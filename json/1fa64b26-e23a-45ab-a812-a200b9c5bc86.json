BLOOM WAITED PATIENTLY FOR AN ANSWER.</p><p>Meghann Dontess leaned back in her seat and studied her fingernails. It was time for a manicure. Past time. \u201cI try not to feel too much, Harriet. You know that. I find it impedes my enjoyment of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019ve seen me every week for four years? Because you enjoy your life so much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t point that out if I were you. It doesn\u2019t say much for your psychiatric skills. It\u2019s entirely possible, you know, that I was perfectly normal when I met you and you\u2019re actually making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using humor as a shield again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me too much credit. That wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>Harriet didn\u2019t smile. \u201cI rarely think you\u2019re funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere goes my dream of doing stand-up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the day you and Claire were separated.\u201d</p><p>Meghann shifted uncomfortably in her seat. Just when she needed a smart-ass response, her mind went blank. She knew what Harriet was poking around for, and Harriet knew she knew. If Meghann didn\u2019t answer, the question would simply be asked again. \u201cSeparated. A nice, clean word. Detached. I like it, but that subject is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that you maintain a relationship with your mother while distancing yourself from your sister.\u201d</p><p>Meghann shrugged. \u201cMama\u2019s an actress. I\u2019m a lawyer. We\u2019re comfortable with make-believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever read one of her interviews?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tells everyone that we lived this poor, pathetic-but-loving existence. We pretend it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were living in Bakersfield when the pathetic-but-loving pretense ended, right?\u201d</p><p>Meghann remained silent. Harriet had maneuvered her back to the painful subject like a rat through a maze.</p><p>Harriet went on, \u201cClaire was nine years old. She was missing several teeth, if I remember correctly, and she was having difficulties with math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Meghann curled her fingers around the chair\u2019s sleek wooden arms.</p><p>Harriet stared at her. Beneath the unruly black ledge of her eyebrows, her gaze was steady. Small round glasses magnified her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t back away, Meg. We\u2019re making progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more progress and I\u2019ll need an aid car. We should talk about my practice. That\u2019s why I come to you, you know. It\u2019s a pressure cooker down in Family Court these days. Yesterday, I had a deadbeat dad drive up in a Ferrari and then swear he was flat broke. The shithead. Didn\u2019t want to pay for his daughter\u2019s tuition. Too bad for him I videotaped his arrival.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you keep paying me if you don\u2019t want to discuss the root of your problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have issues, not problems. And there\u2019s no point in poking around in the past. I was sixteen when all that happened. Now, I\u2019m a whopping forty-two. It\u2019s time to move on. I did the right thing. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you still have the nightmare?\u201d</p><p>She fiddled with the silver David Yurman bracelet on her wrist. \u201cI have nightmares about spiders who wear Oakley sunglasses, too. But you never ask about that. Oh, and last week, I dreamed I was trapped in a glass room that had a floor made of bacon. I could hear people crying, but I couldn\u2019t find the key. You want to talk about that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA feeling of isolation. An awareness that people are upset by your actions, or missing you. Okay, let\u2019s talk about that dream. Who was crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Meghann should have seen that. After all, she had an undergraduate degree in psychology. Not to mention the fact that she\u2019d once been called a child prodigy.</p><p>She glanced down at her platinum-and-gold watch. \u201cToo bad, Harriet. Time\u2019s up. I guess we\u2019ll have to solve my pesky neuroses next week.\u201d She stood up, smoothed the pant legs of her navy Armani suit. Not that there was a wrinkle to be found.</p><p>Harriet slowly removed her glasses.</p><p>Meghann crossed her arms in an instinctive gesture of self-protection. \u201cThis should be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like your life, Meghann?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like? I\u2019m the best divorce attorney in the state. I live\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014in a kick-ass condo above the Public Market and drive a brand-new Porsche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talk to Elizabeth every Thursday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily?\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was time to get a new therapist. Harriet had ferreted out all of Meghann\u2019s weak points. \u201cMy mom stayed with me for a week last year. If I\u2019m lucky, she\u2019ll come back for another visit just in time to watch the colonization of Mars on MTV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister and I have problems, I\u2019ll admit it. But nothing major. We\u2019re just too busy to get together.\u201d When Harriet didn\u2019t speak, Meghann rushed in to fill the silence. \u201cOkay, she makes me crazy, the way she\u2019s throwing her life away. She\u2019s smart enough to do anything, but she stays tied to that loser campground they call a resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss my sister. And I definitely don\u2019t want to discuss her father.\u201d</p><p>Harriet tapped her pen on the table. \u201cOkay, how about this: When was the last time you slept with the same man twice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who thinks that\u2019s a bad thing. I like variety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you like younger men, right? Men who have no desire to settle down. You get rid of them before they can get rid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, sleeping with younger, sexy men who don\u2019t want to settle down is not a bad thing. I don\u2019t want a house with a picket fence in suburbia. I\u2019m not interested in family life, but I like sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the loneliness, do you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lonely,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m independent. Men don\u2019t like a strong woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong men do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I better start hanging out in gyms instead of bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd strong women face their fears. They talk about the painful choices they\u2019ve made in their lives.\u201d</p><p>Meghann actually flinched. \u201cSorry, Harriet, I need to scoot. See you next week.\u201d</p><p>She left the office.</p><p>Outside, it was a gloriously bright June day. Early in the so-called summer. Everywhere else in the country, people were swimming and barbecuing and organizing poolside picnics. Here, in good ole Seattle, people were methodically checking their calendars and muttering that it was June, damn it.</p><p>Only a few tourists were around this morning; out-of-towners recognizable by the umbrellas tucked under their arms.</p><p>Meghann finally released her breath as she crossed the busy street and stepped up onto the grassy lawn of the waterfront park. A towering totem pole greeted her. Behind it, a dozen seagulls dived for bits of discarded food.</p><p>She walked past a park bench where a man lay huddled beneath a blanket of yellowed newspapers. In front of her, the deep blue Sound stretched along the pale horizon. She wished she could take comfort from that view; often, she could. But today, her mind was caught in the net of another time and place.</p><p>If she closed her eyes\u2014which she definitely dared not do\u2014she\u2019d remember it all: the dialing of the telephone number, the stilted, desperate conversation with a man she didn\u2019t know, the long, silent drive to that shit-ass little town up north. And worst of all, the tears she\u2019d wiped from her little sister\u2019s flushed cheeks when she said, I\u2019m leaving you, Claire.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the railing. Dr. Bloom was wrong. Talking about Meghann\u2019s painful choice and the lonely years that had followed it wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>Her past wasn\u2019t a collection of memories to be worked through; it was like an oversize Samsonite with a bum wheel. Meghann had learned that a long time ago. All she could do was drag it along behind her.</p><p>Each November, the mighty Skykomish River strained against its muddy banks. The threat of flooding was a yearly event. In a dance as old as time itself, the people who lived in the tiny towns along the river watched and waited, sandbags at the ready. Their memory went back for generations. Everyone had a story to tell about the time the water rose to the second floor of so-and-so\u2019s house . . . to the top of the doorways at the grange hall . . . to the corner of Spring and Azalea Streets. People who lived in flatter, safer places watched the nightly news and shook their heads, clucking about the ridiculousness of farmers who lived on the flood plain.</p><p>When the river finally began to lower, a collective sigh of relief ran through town. It usually started with Emmett Mulvaney, the pharmacist who religiously watched The Weather Channel on Hayden\u2019s only big-screen television. He would notice some tiny tidbit of information, something even those hotshot meteorologists in Seattle had missed. He\u2019d pass his assessment on to Sheriff Dick Parks, who told his secretary, Martha. In less time than it took to drive from one end of town to the other, the word spread: This year is going to be okay. The danger has passed. Sure enough, twenty-four hours after Emmett\u2019s prediction, the meteorologists agreed.</p><p>This year had been no exception, but now, on this beautiful early summer\u2019s day, it was easy to forget those dangerous months in which rainfall made everyone crazy.</p><p>Claire Cavenaugh stood on the bank of the river, her work boots almost ankle-deep in the soft brown mud. Beside her, an out-of-gas Weed Eater lay on its side.</p><p>She smiled, wiped a gloved hand across her sweaty brow. The amount of manual labor it took to get the resort ready for summer was unbelievable.</p><p>Resort.</p><p>That was what her dad called these sixteen acres. Sam Cavenaugh had come across this acreage almost forty years ago, back when Hayden had been nothing more than a gas station stop on the rise up Stevens Pass. He\u2019d bought the parcel for a song and settled into the decrepit farmhouse that came with it. He\u2019d named his place River\u2019s Edge Resort and begun to dream of a life that didn\u2019t include hard hats and earplugs and night shifts at the paper plant in Everett.</p><p>At first he\u2019d worked after hours and weekends. With a chain saw, a pickup truck, and a plan drawn out on a cocktail napkin, he began. He hacked out campsites and cleaned out a hundred years\u2019 worth of underbrush and built each knotty pine riverfront cabin by hand. Now, River\u2019s Edge was a thriving family business. There were eight cabins in all, each with two pretty little bedrooms and a single bathroom and a deck that overlooked the river.</p><p>In the past few years, they\u2019d added a swimming pool and a game room. Plans for a mini golf course and a Laundromat were in the works. It was the kind of place where the same families came back year after year to spend their precious vacation time.</p><p>Claire still remembered the first time she\u2019d seen it. The towering trees and rushing silver river had seemed like paradise to a girl raised in a trailer that only stopped on the poor side of town. Her childhood memories before coming to River\u2019s Edge were gray: ugly towns that came and went; uglier apartments in run-down buildings. And Mama. Always on the run from something or other. Mama had been married repeatedly, but Claire couldn\u2019t remember a man ever being around for longer than a carton of milk. Meghann was the one Claire remembered. The older sister who took care of everything . . . and then walked away one day, leaving Claire behind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, all these years later, their lives were connected by the thinnest of strands. Once every few months, she and Meg talked on the phone. On particularly bad days, they fell to talking about the weather. Then Meg would invariably \u201cget another call\u201d and hang up. Her sister loved to underscore how successful she was. Meghann could rattle on for ten minutes about how Claire had sold herself short. \u201cLiving on that silly little campground, cleaning up after people\u201d was the usual wording. Every single Christmas she offered to pay for college.</p><p>As if reading Beowulf would improve Claire\u2019s life.</p><p>For years, Claire had longed to be friends as well as sisters, but Meghann didn\u2019t want that, and Meghann always got her way. They were what Meghann wanted them to be: polite strangers who shared a blood type and an ugly childhood.</p><p>Claire reached down for the Weed Eater. As she slogged across the spongy ground, she noticed a dozen things that needed to be done before opening day. Roses that needed to be trimmed, moss that needed to be scraped off the roofs, mildew that needed to be bleached off the porch railings. And there was the mowing. A long, wet winter had turned into a surprisingly bright spring, and the grass had grown as tall as Claire\u2019s knees. She made a mental note to ask George, their handyman, to scrub out the canoes and kayaks this afternoon.</p> <p>She tossed the Weed Eater in the back of the pickup. It hit with a clanging thunk that rattled the rusted bed.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie. You goin\u2019 to town?\u201d</p><p>She turned and saw her father standing on the porch of the registration building. He wore a ratty pair of overalls, stained brown down the bib from some long-forgotten oil change, and a flannel shirt.</p><p>He pulled a red bandanna out of his hip pocket and wiped his brow as he walked toward her. \u201cI\u2019m fixing that freezer, by the way. Don\u2019t you go pricing new ones.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t an appliance made that he couldn\u2019t repair, but Claire was going to check out prices, just the same. \u201cYou need anything from town?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmitty has a part for me. Could you pick it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. And have George start on the canoes when he gets here, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it on the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have Rita bleach the bathroom ceiling in cabin six. It got mildewy this winter.\u201d She closed the pickup\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cYou here for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. Ali has a Tee Ball game at Riverfront Park, remember? Five o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded, knowing that he would. He hadn\u2019t missed a single event in his granddaughter\u2019s life. \u201cBye, Dad.\u201d</p><p>She wrenched the truck\u2019s door handle and yanked hard. The door screeched open. She grabbed the black steering wheel and climbed up into the seat.</p><p>Dad thumped the truck\u2019s door. \u201cDrive safely. Watch the turn at milepost seven.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. He\u2019d been giving her that exact bit of advice for almost two decades. \u201cI love you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Now, go get my granddaughter. If you hurry, we\u2019ll have time to watch SpongeBob SquarePants before the game.\u201d</p><p>TWO</p><p>THE WEST SIDE OF THE OFFICE BUILDING FACED PUGET Sound. A wall of floor-to-ceiling windows framed the beautiful blue-washed view. In the distance lay the forested mound of Bainbridge Island. At night, a few lights could be seen amid all that black-and-green darkness; in the daylight, though, the island looked uninhabited. Only the white ferry, chugging into its dock every hour, indicated that people lived there.</p> <p>Meghann sat alone at a long, kidney-shaped conference table. The glossy cherry and ebony wood surface bespoke elegance and money. Perhaps money most of all. A table like this had to be custom-made and individually designed; it was true of the suede chairs, too. When a person sat down at this table and looked at that view, the point was clear: Whoever owned this office was damn successful.</p><p>It was true. Meghann had achieved every goal she\u2019d set for herself. When she\u2019d started college as a scared, lonely teenager she\u2019d dared to dream of a better life. Now, she had it. Her practice was among the most successful and most respected in the city. She owned an expensive condo in downtown Seattle (a far cry from the broken-down travel trailer that had been her childhood \u201chome\u201d), and no one depended on her.</p><p>She glanced down at her watch. 4:20.</p><p>Her client was late.</p><p>You would think that charging well over three hundred dollars an hour would encourage people to be on time.</p><p>\u201cMs. Dontess?\u201d came a voice through the intercom.</p><p>\u201cYes, Rhona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister, Claire, is on line one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut her through. And buzz me the second May Monroe gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the button on her headset and forced a smile into her voice. \u201cClaire, it\u2019s good to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone works both ways, you know. So. How\u2019s life in Moneyland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And in Hayden? Everyone still sitting around waiting for the river to flood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat danger\u2019s passed for the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Meghann stared out her window. Below and to her left, huge orange cranes loaded multicolored containers onto a tanker. She had no idea what to say to her sister. They had a past in common, but that was pretty much it. \u201cSo, how\u2019s that beautiful niece of mine? Did she like the skateboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved it.\u201d Claire laughed. \u201cBut really, Meg, someday you\u2019ll have to ask a salesperson for help. Five-year-old girls don\u2019t generally have the coordination for skateboards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. We were living in Needles that year. The same year I taught you to ride a two-wheeler.\u201d Meg immediately wished she hadn\u2019t said that. It always hurt to remember their past together. For a lot of years, Claire had been more of a daughter to Meghann than a sister. Certainly, Meg had been more of a mother to Claire than Mama ever had.</p><p>\u201cJust get her a Disney movie next time. You don\u2019t need to spend so much money on her. She\u2019s happy with a Polly Pocket.\u201d</p><p>Whatever that was. An awkward silence fell between them. Meghann looked down at her watch, then they both spoke at once.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Alison excited about first grade\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Meghann pressed her lips together. It took an act of will not to speak, but she knew Claire hated to be interrupted. She especially hated it when Meg monopolized a conversation.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Claire said. \u201cAli can\u2019t wait for all-day school. Kindergarten hasn\u2019t even ended and she\u2019s already looking forward to the fall. She talks about it constantly. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m holding on to the tail of a comet. And she never stops moving, even in her sleep.\u201d</p><p>Meghann started to say, You were the same way, and stopped herself. It hurt remembering that; she wished she could push the memory aside.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s work going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And the camp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResort. We open in a little more than two weeks. The Jeffersons are having a family reunion here with about twenty people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week without phone access or television reception? Why am I hearing the Deliverance theme music in my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome families like to be together,\u201d Claire said in that crisp you\u2019ve-hurt-me voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right. I know you love the place. Hey,\u201d she said, as if she\u2019d just thought of it, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you borrow some money from me and build a nice little Eurospa on the property? Better yet, a small hotel. People would flock there for a good body wrap. God knows you\u2019ve got the mud.\u201d</p><p>Claire sighed heavily. \u201cYou just have to remind me that you\u2019re successful and I\u2019m not. Damn it, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. It\u2019s just . . . that I know you can\u2019t expand a business without capital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your money, Meg. We don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>There it was: the reminder that Meg was an I and Claire was a we. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I said the wrong thing. I just want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the baby girl who needs her big sister\u2019s protection anymore, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam was always good at protecting you.\u201d Meg heard a tiny flare of bitterness in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Claire paused, drew in a breath. Meghann knew what her sister was doing. Regrouping, climbing to softer, safer ground. \u201cI\u2019m going to Lake Chelan,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cThe yearly trip with the girlfriends,\u201d Meghann said, thankful for the change in subject. \u201cWhat do you call yourselves? The Bluesers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all going back to that same place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery summer since high school.\u201d</p><p>Meghann wondered what it would be like to have a sisterhood of such close friends. If she were another kind of woman, she might be envious. As it was, she didn\u2019t have time to run around with a bunch of women. And she couldn\u2019t imagine still being friends with people she\u2019d gone to high school with. \u201cWell. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we will. This year, Charlotte\u2014\u201d</p><p>The intercom buzzed. \u201cMeghann? Mrs. Monroe is here.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. An excuse to hang up. Claire could talk forever about her friends. \u201cDamn. Sorry, Claire, I\u2019ve got to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. I know how much you love to hear about my college dropout friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I have a client who just arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d Meghann disconnected the call just as her secretary showed May Monroe into the conference room.</p><p>Meghann pulled the headset off and tossed it onto the table, where it hit with a clatter. \u201cHello, May,\u201d she said, walking briskly toward her client. \u201cThank you, Rhona. No calls, please.\u201d</p><p>Her secretary nodded and left the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>May Monroe stood in front of a large multicolored oil painting, a Nechita original entitled True Love. Meghann had always loved the irony of that; here, in this room, true love died every day of the week.</p><p>May wore a serviceable black jersey dress and black shoes that were at least five years out of date. Her champagne-blond hair fell softly to her shoulders in that age-old easy-care bob. Her wedding ring was a plain gold band.</p><p>Looking at her, you would never know that her husband drove a jet-black Mercedes and had a regular Tuesday tee-time at the Broadmoor Golf Course. May probably hadn\u2019t spent money on herself in years. Not since she\u2019d slaved at a local restaurant to put her husband through dental school. Though she was only a few years older than Meghann, sadness had left its mark on May. There were shadowy circles under her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease, May, sit down.\u201d</p><p>May jerked forward like a marionette who\u2019d been moved by someone else. She sat in one of the comfortable black suede chairs.</p><p>Meghann took her usual seat at the head of the table. Spread out in front of her were several manila file folders with bright pink Post-it notes fanned along the edges of the paperwork. Meghann drummed her fingertips on the stack of papers, wondering which of her many approaches would be best. Over the years, she\u2019d learned that there were as many reactions to bad news as there were indiscretions themselves. Instinct warned her that May Monroe was fragile, that while she was in the midst of breaking up her marriage, she hadn\u2019t fully accepted the inevitable. Although the divorce papers had been filed months ago, May still didn\u2019t believe her husband would go through with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After this meeting, she\u2019d believe it.</p><p>Meghann looked at her. \u201cAs I told you at our last meeting, May, I hired a private investigator to check into your husband\u2019s financial affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a waste of time, right?\u201d</p><p>No matter how often this scene played and replayed itself in this office, it never got any easier. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p> <p>May stared at her for a long moment, then she stood up and went to the silver coffee service set out on the cherry wood credenza. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, keeping her back to Meghann. \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has more than six hundred thousand dollars in an account in the Cayman Islands, which is under his own name. Seven months ago, he took almost all of the equity out of your home. Perhaps you thought you were signing refinance documents?\u201d</p><p>May turned around. She was holding a coffee cup and saucer. The porcelain chattered in her shaking hands as she moved toward the conference table. \u201cThe rates had come down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat came down was the cash. Right into his hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Meghann could see May\u2019s world crumbling. It flashed through the woman\u2019s green eyes; a light seemed to go out of her.</p><p>It was a moment so many women faced at a time like this: the realization that their husbands were strangers and that their dreams were just that.</p><p>\u201cIt gets worse,\u201d Meghann went on, trying to be gentle with her words, but knowing how deep a cut she\u2019d leave behind. \u201cHe sold the practice to his partner, Theodore Blevin, for a dollar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that? It\u2019s worth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t be able to get the half you\u2019re entitled to.\u201d</p><p>At that, May\u2019s legs seemed to give out on her. She crumpled into her chair. The cup and saucer hit the table with a clatter. Coffee burped over the porcelain rim and puddled on the wood. May immediately started dabbing the mess with her napkin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Meghann touched her client\u2019s wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d She got up, grabbed some napkins, and blotted the spill. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry, May. No matter how often I see this sort of behavior, it still sickens me.\u201d She touched May\u2019s shoulder and let the woman have time to think.</p><p>\u201cDo any of those documents say why he did this to me?\u201d</p><p>Meghann wished she didn\u2019t have an answer to that. A question was sometimes preferable to an answer. She reached into the file and pulled out a black-and-white photograph. Very gently, as if it were printed on a sheet of plastique explosives instead of glossy paper, she pushed it toward May. \u201cHer name is Ashleigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshleigh Stoker. I guess I know why he always offered to pick Sarah up from piano lessons.\u201d</p><p>Meghann nodded. It was always worse when the wife knew the mistress, even in passing. \u201cWashington is a no-fault state; we don\u2019t need grounds for a divorce, so his affair doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>May looked up. She wore the vague, glassy-eyed expression of an accident victim. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter?\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d The words were more breath than sound.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re an honest, trustworthy woman who put a selfish prick through ten years of college so he could have a better life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to be our better life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course it was.\u201d</p><p>Meg reached out, touched May\u2019s hand. \u201cYou trusted a man who told you he loved you. Now he\u2019s counting on you to be good ole accommodating May, the woman who puts her family first and makes life easy for Dr. Dale Monroe.\u201d</p><p>May looked confused by that, maybe even a little frightened. Meghann understood; women like May had forgotten a long time ago how to make waves.</p><p>That was fine. It was her lawyer\u2019s job anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do? I don\u2019t want to hurt the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who\u2019s hurt the children, May. He\u2019s stolen money from them. And from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s a good father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll want to see that they\u2019re provided for. If he\u2019s got a shred of decency in him, he\u2019ll hand over half of the assets without a fight. If he does that, it\u2019ll be a cakewalk.\u201d</p><p>May knew the truth that Meghann had already surmised. A man like this didn\u2019t share well. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, we\u2019ll make him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be angry.\u201d</p><p>Meghann leaned forward. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who should be angry, May. This man lied to you, cheated on you, and stole from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also fathered my children,\u201d May answered with a calm that Meghann found exasperating. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to get ugly. I want him . . . to know he can come home.\u201d</p><p>Oh, May.</p><p>Meghann chose her words carefully. \u201cWe\u2019re simply going to be fair, May. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone, but you damn sure aren\u2019t going to be screwed over and left destitute by this man. Period. He\u2019s a very, very wealthy orthodontist. You should be wearing Armani and driving a Porsche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to wear Armani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you never will, but it\u2019s my job to make sure you have every option. I know it seems cold and harsh right now, May, but believe me, when you\u2019re exhausted from raising those two children by yourself and Dr. Smiles is driving around town in a new Porsche and dancing the night away with his twenty-six-year-old piano teacher, you\u2019ll be glad you can afford to do whatever you want. Trust me on this.\u201d</p><p>May looked at her. A tiny, heartbreaking frown tugged at her mouth. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him hurt you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think a few rounds of paperwork and a pile of money in the bank will protect me from that?\u201d She sighed. \u201cGo ahead, Ms. Dontess, do what you need to do to protect my children\u2019s future. But let\u2019s not pretend you can make it painless, okay? It already hurts so much I can barely breathe, and it has just begun.\u201d</p><p>Across the blistered expanse of prairie grass, a row of windmills dotted the cloudless horizon. Their thick metal blades turned in a slow and steady rhythm. Sometimes, when the weather was just right, you could hear the creaking thwop-thwop-thwop of each rotation.</p><p>Today, it was too damn hot to hear anything except the beating of your own heart.</p><p>Joe Wyatt stood on the poured-concrete slab that served as the warehouse\u2019s front porch, holding a now-warm can of Coke, all that was left of his lunch.</p><p>He stared at the distant fields, wishing he were walking along the wide rows between the trees, smelling the sweet scent of rich earth and growing fruit.</p><p>There might be a breeze down there; even a breath of one would alleviate this stifling heat. Here, there was only the hot sun, beating down on the metal warehouse. Perspiration sheened his forehead and dampened the skin beneath his T-shirt.</p><p>The heat was getting to him and it was only the second week of June. There was no way he could handle summer in the Yakima Valley. It was time to move on again.</p><p>The realization exhausted him.</p><p>Not for the first time, he wondered how much longer he could do this, drift from town to town. Loneliness was wearing him down, whittling him away to a stringy shadow; unfortunately, the alternative was worse.</p><p>Once\u2014it felt long ago now\u2014he\u2019d hoped that one of these places would feel right, that he\u2019d come into some town, think, This is it, and dare to rent an apartment instead of a seedy motel room.</p><p>He no longer harbored such dreams. He knew better. After a week in the same room, he started to feel things, remember things. The nightmares would start. The only protection he had found was strangeness. If a mattress was never \u201chis,\u201d if a room remained unfamiliar territory, he could sometimes sleep for more than two hours at a time. If he settled in, got comfortable, and slept longer, he invariably dreamed about Diana.</p><p>That was okay. It hurt, of course, because seeing her face\u2014even in his dreams\u2014filled him with an ache that ran deep in his bones, but there was pleasure, too, a sweet remembrance of how life used to be, of the love he\u2019d once been capable of feeling. If only the dreams stopped there, with memories of Diana sitting on the green grass of the Quad in her college days or of them cuddled up in their big bed in the house on Bainbridge Island.</p><p>He was never that lucky. The sweet dreams invariably soured and turned ugly. More often than not, he woke up whispering, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The only way to survive was to keep moving and never make eye contact.</p><p>He\u2019d learned in these vagrant years how to be invisible. If a man cut his hair and dressed well and held down a job, people saw him. They stood in line for the bus beside him, and in small towns they struck up conversations.</p><p>But if a man let himself go, if he forgot to cut his hair and wore a faded Harley-Davidson T-shirt and ragged, faded Levi\u2019s, and carried a ratty backpack, no one noticed him. More important, no one recognized him.</p><p>Behind him, the bell rang. With a sigh, he stepped into the warehouse. The icy cold hit him instantly. Cold storage for the fruit. The sweat on his face turned clammy. He tossed his empty Coke can in the trash, then went back outside.</p><p>For a split second, maybe less, the heat felt good; by the time he reached the loading dock, he was sweating again.</p><p>\u201cWyatt,\u201d the foreman yelled, \u201cwhat do you think this is, a damn picnic?\u201d</p><p>Joe looked at the endless row of slat-sided trucks, filled to heaping with newly picked cherries. Then he studied the other men unloading the crates\u2014Mexicans mostly, who lived in broken-down trailers on patches of dry, dusty land without flushing toilets or running water.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said to the florid-faced foreman who clearly got his kicks from yelling at his workers. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a picnic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then get to work. I\u2019m docking you a half an hour\u2019s pay.\u201d</p><p>In his former life, Joe would have grabbed the foreman by his sweaty, dirty collar and shown him how men treated one another.</p><p>Those days were gone.</p><p>Slowly, he walked toward the nearest truck, pulling a pair of canvas gloves out of his back pocket as he moved.</p><p>It was time to move on.</p><p>Claire stood at the kitchen sink, thinking about the phone conversation with Meg yesterday.</p><p>\u201cMommy, can I have another Eggo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we ask for that?\u201d Claire said absently.</p><p>\u201cMommy, may I please have another Eggo?\u201d</p><p>Claire turned away from the window and dried her hands on the dish towel hanging from the oven door. \u201cSure.\u201d She popped a frozen waffle into the toaster. While it was warming, she looked around the kitchen for more dirty dishes\u2014</p><p>And saw the place through her sister\u2019s eyes.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a bad house, certainly not by Hayden standards. Small, yes: three tiny bedrooms tucked into the peaked second floor; a single bathroom on each floor; a living room; and a kitchen with an eating space that doubled as a counter. In the six years Claire had lived here, she\u2019d painted the once moss-green walls a creamy French vanilla and replaced the orange shag carpeting with hardwood floors. Her furniture, although mostly secondhand, was all framed in wood that she\u2019d stripped and refinished herself. Her pride and joy was a Hawaiian koa-wood love seat. It didn\u2019t look like much in the living room, with its faded red cushions, but someday, when she lived on Kauai, it would stop people in their tracks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meg would see it differently, of course. Meg, who\u2019d graduated high school early and then breezed through seven years of college, who never failed to mention that she had buckets of money, and had the nerve to send her niece Christmas gifts that made the others under the tree look paltry by comparison.</p><p>\u201cMy waffle\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is.\u201d Claire took the waffle from the slot, buttered and cut it, then put the plate in front of her daughter. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>Alison immediately stabbed a piece and popped it into her mouth, chewing in that cartoon-character way of hers.</p> <p>Claire couldn\u2019t help smiling. Her daughter had had that effect on her since birth. She stared down at the miniature version of herself. Same fine blond hair and pale skin, same heart-shaped face. Although there were no pictures of Claire at five, she imagined that she and Alison were almost carbon copies of each other. Alison\u2019s father had left no genetic imprint on his daughter.</p><p>It was fitting. The minute he\u2019d heard Claire was pregnant, he\u2019d reached for his running shoes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in your jammies, Mommy. We\u2019re gonna be late if you don\u2019t hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that.\u201d Claire thought about all the things she had to do today: mow the back field; recaulk the showers and bathroom windows; bleach the mildewed wall in cabin three; unplug the toilet in cabin five; and repair the canoe shed. It was early yet, not even 8:00, on the last day of school. Tomorrow, they\u2019d be leaving for a week of rest and fun at Lake Chelan. She hoped she could get everything done in time. She glanced around. \u201cHave you seen my work list, Alison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the coffee table.\u201d</p> <p>Claire picked up her list from the table, shaking her head. She had absolutely no memory of leaving it there. Sometimes she wondered how she\u2019d get by without Alison.</p><p>\u201cI want ballet lessons, Mommy. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled. It occurred to her\u2014one of those passing thoughts that carried a tiny sting\u2014that she\u2019d once wanted to be a ballerina, too. Meghann had encouraged her to dream that dream, even though there had been no money for lessons.</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t quite true. There had been money for Mama\u2019s dance lessons, but none for Claire\u2019s.</p><p>Once, though, when Claire had been about six or seven, Meghann had arranged for a series of Saturday-morning lessons with a junior high friend of hers. Claire had never forgotten those few perfect mornings.</p><p>Her smile faded.</p> <p>Alison was frowning at her, one cheek bunched up midbite. \u201cMommy? Ballet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be a ballerina once. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I have feet the size of canoes.\u201d</p><p>Ali giggled. \u201cCanoes are huge, Mommy. Your feet are just really big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She laughed, too.</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re a worker bee if you wanted to be a ballerina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorker bee is what Grampa calls me. Really I\u2019m an assistant manager.\u201d</p> <p>It had happened a long time ago, her choosing this life. Like most of her decisions, she\u2019d stumbled across it without paying much attention. First, she\u2019d flunked out of Washington State University\u2014one of the many party casualties of higher education. She hadn\u2019t known then, of course, that Meghann was basically right. College gave a girl choices. Without a degree, or a dream, Claire had found herself back in Hayden. Originally, she\u2019d meant to stay a month or so, then move to Kauai and learn to surf, but then Dad got bronchitis and was down for a month. Claire had stepped in to help him out. By the time her father was back on his feet and ready to resume his job, Claire had realized how much she loved this place. She was, in that and in so many things, her father\u2019s daughter.</p><p>Like him, she loved this job; she was outside all day, rain or shine, working on whatever needed to be done. When she finished each chore, she saw tangible proof of her labor. There was something about these gorgeous sixteen acres along the river that filled her soul.</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise her that Meghann didn\u2019t understand. Her sister, who valued education and money above everything, saw this place as a waste of time.</p><p>Claire tried not to let that condemnation matter. She knew her job wasn\u2019t much in the great scheme of things, just managing a few campsites and a couple of cabins, but she never felt like a failure, never felt that her life was a disappointment.</p><p>Except when she talked to her sister.</p><p>THREE</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR HOURS LATER, CLAIRE WAS READY TO LEAVE on vacation. She took a last pass through the tiny house, looking for anything forgotten or left undone, but everything was as it should be. The windows were locked, the dishwasher was empty, and all the perishables had been taken out of the fridge. She was straightening the shower curtain when she heard footsteps in the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of a frog\u2019s butt are you still doing here?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and backed out of the minuscule bathroom.</p><p>Her father stood in the living room. As always, he dwarfed the small space. Big and broad-shouldered, he made every room seem smaller by comparison. But it was his personality that was truly oversize.</p><p>She\u2019d first met him when she was nine years old. She\u2019d been small for her age, and so shy she only spoke to Meghann in those days. Dad had seemed larger than life when he stepped into their travel trailer. Well, he\u2019d said as he looked down at her, you must be my daughter, Claire. You\u2019re the prettiest girl I\u2019ve ever seen. Let\u2019s go home.</p><p>Home.</p><p>It was the word she\u2019d waited for, dreamed of. It had taken her years\u2014and more than a few tears\u2014to realize that he hadn\u2019t offered the same welcome to Meghann. By then, of course, by the time Claire understood the mistake, it was well past the time to rectify it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. I was making sure everything was ready for you to move in.\u201d</p><p>His grin showed a row of Chiclet-white dentures. \u201cYou know damn well I ain\u2019t moving in here. I like my mobile home. A man doesn\u2019t need this much room. I got my fridge and my satellite TV. That\u2019s all I need.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been having this discussion ever since Claire had moved back to the property and Dad had given her use of the house. He swore up and down that the mobile home hidden in the trees was more than room enough for a fifty-six-year-old single man.</p><p>\u201cBut, Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about my butt. I know it\u2019s getting bigger. Now, dance on over here and give your old man a hug.\u201d</p><p>Claire did as she was told.</p><p>His big, strong arms enfolded her, made her feel safe and adored. He smelled faintly of disinfectant today. That was when she remembered the bathroom that needed fixing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave in an hour,\u201d she said. \u201cThe toilet in cabin\u2014\u201d</p><p>He spun her around and pushed her gently toward the door. \u201cGet going. This place isn\u2019t going to fall apart without you. I\u2019ll fix the damn toilet. And I\u2019ll remember to pick up the PVC pipe you ordered and to stack the wood under cover. If you remind me again, I\u2019ll have to hurt you. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t help smiling. She\u2019d reminded him about the pipe at least six times. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He touched her shoulders, forced her to stop long enough to look at him. \u201cTake as long as you want. Really. Take three weeks. I can handle this place alone. You deserve a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never take one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the down side of my life, and I don\u2019t want to get out much. You\u2019re only thirty-five. You and Alison should kick up your heels a bit. You\u2019re too damn responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a thirty-five-year-old single mother who has never been married. That\u2019s not too responsible, and I will kick up my heels in Chelan. But I\u2019ll be home in a week. In time to check the Jefferson party into their cabins.\u201d</p><p>He thumped her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve always done exactly what you wanted, but you can\u2019t blame a guy for trying. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Dad. And take Thelma out for dinner while I\u2019m gone. Quit all that skulking around.\u201d</p><p>He looked genuinely nonplussed. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cCome on, Dad. The whole town knows you\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Sleeping together.\u201d In the silence that followed that remark, Claire walked out of the house and into the steely gray day. A drizzling rain fell like a beaded curtain in front of the trees. Crows sat on fence posts and phone wires, cawing loudly to one another.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mommy!\u201d Alison\u2019s small face poked through the car\u2019s open window.</p><p>Dad hurried ahead of her and kissed his granddaughter\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Claire checked the trunk\u2014again\u2014then got into the car and started the engine. \u201cAre we ready, Ali Kat? Do you have everything?\u201d</p><p>Alison bounced in her seat, clinging to her Mary-Kate-and-Ashley lunch box. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d Her stuffed orca\u2014Bluebell\u2014was strapped into the seat with her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re off to see the Wizard, then,\u201d Claire said, shifting into drive as she yelled a final good-bye to her father.</p><p>Alison immediately started singing the Barney theme song: \u201cI love you, you love me.\u201d Her voice was high and strong, so loud that poodles all across the valley were probably hurling themselves to the ground and whining pitifully. \u201cCome on, Mommy, sing.\u201d</p><p>By the time they reached the top of Stevens Pass, they\u2019d sung forty-two Barney theme songs\u2014in a row\u2014and seventeen Froggy-Went-A-Courtings. When Alison opened her lunch box, Claire rammed a Disney audiotape into the cassette player. The theme music to The Little Mermaid started.</p><p>\u201cI wish I was like Ariel. I want flippers,\u201d Alison said.</p><p>\u201cHow could you be a ballerina then?\u201d</p><p>Alison looked at her, clearly disgusted. \u201cShe has feet on land, Mommy.\u201d Then she leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes, listening to the story of the mermaid princess.</p><p>The miles flew by. In no time, they were speeding across the flat, arid land on the eastern side of the state.</p><p>\u201cAre we almost there, Mommy?\u201d Alison asked, sucking on a licorice whip, bouncing in her seat. The area around her lips was smudged with black. \u201cI wish we\u2019d get there.\u201d</p><p>Claire felt the same way. She loved the Blue Skies Campground. She and her girlfriends had first vacationed there a few years after high school graduation. In the early years there had been five of them; time and tragedy had whittled their number down to four. They\u2019d each missed a year now and then, but for the most part, they met there year after year. At first they\u2019d been young and wild and driven to pick up local boys. Gradually, as they\u2019d started dragging bassinets and car seats with them, the vacation had settled down a bit. Now that the kids were old enough to swim and play on the playground alone, the girls\u2014women\u2014had refound a slice of their previous freedom.</p><p>\u201cMommy. You\u2019re spacing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, we get the honeymoon cabin this year, remember?\u201d She bounced even harder in her seat. \u201cYippee! We get the big bathtub. And this year I get to jump off the dock, don\u2019t forget. You promised. Bonnie got to jump when she was five.\u201d Alison sighed dramatically and crossed her arms. \u201cCan I jump off the dock or not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire wanted to go against her overprotective nature, but when you\u2019d grown up in a house where your Mama allowed anything, you learned fast how easy it was to get hurt. It made you afraid. \u201cLet\u2019s see the dock, okay? And we\u2019ll see how you\u2019re swimming. Then we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018We\u2019ll see\u2019 always means no. You promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not promise. I remember it distinctly, Alison Katherine. We were in the water; you were on my back, with your legs wrapped around me. We were watching Willie and Bonnie jump into the water. You said, \u2018Next year I\u2019ll be five.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, you will.\u2019 And you pointed out that Bonnie was five. I pointed out that she was almost six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost six.\u201d Alison crossed her arms. \u201cI\u2019m jumping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d</p><p>Claire always laughed at that. Lately it was her daughter\u2019s favorite comeback. \u201cOh, yes I am.\u201d</p><p>Alison turned her face toward the window. She was quiet for a long time\u2014almost two minutes. Finally, she said, \u201cMarybeth threw Amy\u2019s clay handprint in the toilet last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. Mrs. Schmidt gave her a long time-out. Did you bring my skateboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re too young to ride it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStevie Wain rides his all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the boy who fell and broke his nose and knocked out two front teeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were baby teeth, Mommy. He said they were loose anyway. How come Aunt Meg never comes to visit us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you this before, remember? Aunt Meg is so busy she hardly has time to breathe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEliot Zane turned blue when he didn\u2019t breathe. The amb\u2019lance came to get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. I just meant Meg is superbusy helping people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Claire steeled herself for her daughter\u2019s next question. There was always a next question with Alison, and you could never predict what it would be.</p><p>\u201cIs this the desert already?\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded. Her daughter always called eastern Washington the desert. It was easy to see why. After the lush green of Hayden, this yellow-and-brown landscape seemed desolate and scorched. The black ribbon of asphalt stretched forever through the prairie.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the water slide!\u201d Alison said at last. She leaned forward, counting out loud. When she got to forty-seven, she yelled, \u201cThere\u2019s the lake!\u201d</p><p>Lake Chelan filled their view to the left, a huge crystal-blue lake tucked into a golden hillside. They drove over the bridge that led into town.</p> <p>Two decades ago, this town had been less than three blocks long, without a national franchise to be found. But over time, word of the weather had spread west, to those soggy coastal towns that so prized their plate-size rhododendrons and car-size ferns. Gradually, Seattleites turned their attention eastward. It became a summer tradition, the trek across the mountains toward the flat, scorched plains. As the tourists came, so did the development. Condominium complexes sprouted along the water\u2019s edge. As one filled up, another was built beside it, and so on and so on, until, at the millennium, this was a thriving vacation destination, with all the kiddie-required amenities\u2014pools, water-slide parks, and Jet Ski rentals.</p><p>The road curved along the lakeshore. They passed dozens of condominium complexes. Then the shore became less inhabited again. They kept driving. A half mile upshore, they saw the sign: Blue Skies Campground: Next Left.</p><p>\u201cLook, Mommy, look!\u201d</p><p>The sign showed a pair of stylized trees bracketing a tent with a canoe in front.</p><p>\u201cThis is it, Ali Kat.\u201d</p><p>Claire turned left onto the gravel road. Huge potholes caught the tires and sent the car bouncing right to left.</p><p>A mile later, the road took a hairpin turn into a grassy field dotted with trailers and motor homes. They drove past the open field and into the trees, where the few coveted cabins sat in a cluster along the shore. They parked in the gravel lot.</p><p>Claire helped Alison out of her car seat, then shut the door and turned toward the lake.</p><p>For a split second, Claire was eight years old again, a girl at Lake Winobee, standing at the shoreline, wearing a pretty pink bikini. She remembered splashing into the cold water, shrieking as she went deeper and deeper.</p><p>Don\u2019t go in past your knees, Claire, Meghann had hollered out, sitting up on the dock.</p><p>For Christ\u2019s sake, Meggy, quit bein\u2019 such an old fuddy-duddy. Mama\u2019s voice. Go on in, sweetums, she\u2019d yelled to Claire, laughing loudly, waving a Virginia Slims menthol cigarette. It won\u2019t do to be a scaredy-cat.</p><p>And then Meghann was beside Claire, holding her hand, telling her there was nothing wrong with being afraid. It just shows good sense, Claire-Bear.</p><p>Claire remembered looking back, seeing Mama standing there in her tiny bicentennial bikini, holding a plastic cup full of vodka.</p><p>Go ahead, sweetums. Jump in that cold water and swim. It doesn\u2019t do a damn bit o\u2019 good to be afraid. It\u2019s best to get your yuks in while you can.</p><p>Claire had asked Meghann, What\u2019s a yuk?</p><p>It\u2019s what so-called actresses go looking for after too many vodka collinses. Don\u2019t you worry about it.</p><p>Poor Meg. Always trying so hard to pretend their life had been ordinary.</p><p>But how could it have been? Sometimes God gave you a mama that made normal impossible. The upside was fun times and parties so loud and crazy you never forgot them . . . the downside was that bad things happened when no one was in charge.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d Alison\u2019s voice pulled Claire into the present. \u201cHurry up.\u201d</p><p>Claire headed for the old-fashioned farmhouse that served as the campground\u2019s lodge. The wraparound porch had been newly painted this year, a forest green that complemented the walnut-stained shingles. Big mullioned windows ran the length of the lower floor; above, where the owners lived, the smaller, original windows had been left alone.</p><p>Between the house and the lake was a strip of grass as wide as a football field. It boasted a Lincoln Log\u2013type swing set/play area, a permanent croquet course, a badminton court, a swimming pool, and a boat-rental shed. Off to the left were the four cabins, each with a wraparound porch and floor-to-ceiling windows.</p><p>Alison ran on ahead. Her little feet barely made a noise on the steps as she hurried up. She wrenched the screen door open. It banged shut behind her.</p><p>Claire smiled and quickened her pace. She opened the screen door just in time to hear Happy Parks say, \u201c\u2014can\u2019t be little Ali Kat Cavenaugh. You\u2019re too big to be her.\u201d</p><p>Alison giggled. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a first grader. I can count to one thousand. Wanna hear?\u201d She immediately launched into counting. \u201cOne. Two. Three . . .\u201d</p><p>Happy, a beautiful, silver-haired woman who\u2019d run this campground for more than three decades, smiled over Alison\u2019s head at Claire.</p><p>\u201cOne hundred and one. One hundred and two . . .\u201d</p><p>Happy clapped. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Ali. It\u2019s good to have you back, Claire. How\u2019s life at River\u2019s Edge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got the new cabin done. That makes eight now. I just hope the economy doesn\u2019t hurt us. There\u2019s that talk of a gas price hike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred. Two hundred and one . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sure haven\u2019t seen a drop-off,\u201d Happy said. \u201cBut we\u2019re like you\u2014all returning guests. Year after year. Which reminds me: Gina is already here. So is Charlotte. The only one missing is Karen. And this is your year for the honeymoon cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. The last time Alison slept in the big cabin, she was in a Portacrib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get the TV,\u201d Alison said, jumping up and down. Counting was forgotten for the moment. \u201cI brought tons of movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one hour a day,\u201d Claire reminded her daughter, knowing it was a mantra that would be repeated at least ten times a day for the next week. Her daughter could literally watch The Little Mermaid 24/7.</p><p>Behind them, the screen door screeched open. A group of children burst through the door laughing, followed by six adults.</p><p>Happy slid a key across the desk. \u201cYou can fill out the paperwork later. I have a feeling this is a group of site hunters. They\u2019ll want a photo tour of each site before they commit.\u201d</p><p>Claire understood. The River\u2019s Edge Resort had only a minimum number of campsites\u2014nineteen\u2014and she doled out the good ones carefully. If she liked the guest, she put them near the restrooms and the river. If not . . . well, it could be a long walk to the toilets on a rainy night. She slapped the worn pine counter. \u201cCome over for drinks one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you crazy girls?\u201d Happy grinned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p><p>Claire handed Alison the key. \u201cHere you go, Ali Kat. You\u2019re in charge. Show us the way.\u201d</p><p>With a yelp, Ali was off. She zigzagged through the now-crowded lobby and burst outside. This time her feet slapped the porch steps.</p><p>Claire hurried along behind her. As soon as they\u2019d gotten their luggage from the car, they raced across the expanse of lawn, past the boat-rental shed, and plunged into the trees. The ground here was hard-packed dirt, carpeted with a hundred years\u2019 worth of pine needles.</p><p>Finally, they came to the clearing. A silvery wooden dock floated on the wavy blue water, tilting from side to side in a gentle rocking motion. Far out, across the lake, a white condo grouping sat amid the golden humps of the distant foothills.</p><p>\u201cClara Bella!\u201d</p><p>Claire tented a hand over her eyes and looked around.</p><p>Gina stood at the shoreline, waving.</p><p>Even from here, Claire could see the size of the drink in her friend\u2019s hand.</p><p>This would be Gina\u2019s intervention week. Usually Gina was the conservative one, the buoy that held everyone up, but she\u2019d finalized her divorce a few months ago and she was adrift. A single woman in a paired-up world. Last week, her ex-husband had moved in with a younger woman.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, Ali!\u201d That was Gina\u2019s six-year-old daughter, Bonnie.</p><p>Alison dropped her Winnie-the-Pooh backpack and peeled off her clothes.</p><p>\u201cAlison\u2014\u201d</p><p>She proudly showed off her yellow bathing suit. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, honey,\u201d Gina said, pulling out an industrial-size plastic tube of sunscreen. Within moments, she\u2019d slathered Alison all over and released her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go in past your belly button,\u201d Claire said, dropping their suitcases right there, in the sand.</p><p>Alison grimaced. \u201cAw, Mommy,\u201d she whined, then ran for the water, splashing in to join Bonnie.</p><p>Claire sat down beside Gina in the golden sand. \u201cWhat time did you get here?\u201d</p><p>Gina laughed. \u201cOn time, of course. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned this year. Your life can fall apart, frigging explode, but you\u2019re still who you are. Maybe even more so. I\u2019m the kind of woman who gets someplace on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRex would disagree. He always said I wasn\u2019t spontaneous enough. I thought it meant he wanted sex in the afternoon. Turns out he wanted to skydive.\u201d She shook her head, gave Claire a wry smile. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to shove him out of the plane now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rig his parachute for him.\u201d</p><p>They laughed, though it wasn\u2019t funny. \u201cHow\u2019s Bonnie doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the saddest part of all. She barely seems to notice. Rex was never home anyway. I haven\u2019t told her that he moved in with another woman, though. How do you tell your kid something like that?\u201d Gina leaned against Claire, who slipped an arm around her friend\u2019s ample body. \u201cGod, I needed this week.\u201d</p><p>They were silent for a long moment. The only sound between them was the slapping of the water against the dock and the girls\u2019 high-pitched laughter.</p> <p>Gina turned to her. \u201cHow have you done it all these years? Been alone, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Claire hadn\u2019t thought much about her solitude since Alison\u2019s birth. Yes, she\u2019d been alone\u2014in the sense that she\u2019d never been married or lived with a man, but she rarely felt lonely. Oh, she noticed it, ached sometimes for someone to share her life, but she\u2019d made that choice a long time ago. She wouldn\u2019t be like her mother. \u201cThe upside is, you can always find the TV remote and no one bitches at you to wash the car or park in the perfect spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Claire. I need advice.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked out at Alison, who was standing up to her belly button in the water and jumping up and down, yelling out the ABC song. The sight made Claire\u2019s chest tighten. Only yesterday Ali had fit in the crook of her arm. In no time, she\u2019d be asking to have her eyebrow pierced. Claire knew she loved her daughter too much; it was dangerous to need another human being so desperately, but Claire had never known any other way to love. That was why she\u2019d never been married. Men who loved their wives unconditionally were few and far between. In truth, Claire wondered if that kind of true love existed. That doubt was one of many legacies handed down from mother to daughter like an infectious disease. For Mama, divorce had been the answer; for Claire, it was never to say \u201cI do\u201d in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYou get past being lonely. And you live for your kids,\u201d she said softly, surprised to hear regret in her voice. There was so much she\u2019d never dared to reach for.</p> <p>\u201cAli shouldn\u2019t be your whole world, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t try to fall in love. I\u2019ve dated every single guy in Hayden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them twice.\u201d Gina grinned. \u201cAnd Bert Shubert is still in love with you. Miss Hauser thinks you\u2019re crazy for letting him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad when a fifty-three-year-old plumber with Coke-bottle glasses and a red goatee is considered an eligible bachelor just because he owns an appliance store.\u201d</p><p>Gina laughed. \u201cYeah. If I ever tell you I\u2019m going out with Bert, please shoot me.\u201d Slowly, her laughter turned to tears. \u201cAw, hell,\u201d she said, leaning into Claire\u2019s embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, Gina,\u201d Claire whispered, stroking her friend\u2019s back. \u201cI promise you will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gina said quietly, and something about the way she said it, maybe the softness in a voice that was usually as hard as steel, made Claire feel empty inside. Alone.</p><p>Absurdly, she thought about the day her life had changed. When she\u2019d learned that love had a shelf life, a use-by date that could pass suddenly and turn everything sour.</p><p>I\u2019m leaving you, her sister had said. Until that moment, Meg had been Claire\u2019s best friend, her whole world. More of a mother than Mama had ever been.</p><p>And then Claire was crying, too.</p><p>Gina sniffed. \u201cNo wonder no one wants to sit with me anymore. I\u2019m the princess of darkness. Ten seconds in my company and perfectly happy people start to weep.\u201d</p><p>Claire wiped her eyes. There was no point in crying about the past. It surprised her, actually, that she had any tears left. She thought she\u2019d made peace with Meg\u2019s abandonment long ago. \u201cRemember the year Char fell off the dock because she was crying so hard she couldn\u2019t see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBob\u2019s midlife crisis. She thought he was having an affair with their housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it turned out he was secretly getting hair-plug treatments.\u201d</p> <p>Gina tightened her hold around Claire. \u201cThank Jesus for the Bluesers. I haven\u2019t needed you all this much since I was in labor.\u201d</p><p>FOUR</p><p>THE INTERCOM BUZZED. \u201cJILL SUMMERVILLE IS HERE TO see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend her in.\u201d</p><p>Meghann grabbed a new yellow legal pad and a pen from the overhead cabinet. By the time Jill was led into the conference room, Meg had returned to her seat and was smiling politely. She rose. \u201cHello, Jill. I\u2019m Meghann Dontess.\u201d</p><p>Jill stood near the door, looking ill at ease. She was a pretty woman, thin; maybe fifty. She wore an expensive gray suit with a cream silk shell underneath.</p><p>\u201cCome, sit down,\u201d Meghann said, indicating the empty chair to her left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain I want a divorce.\u201d</p><p>Meghann heard that all the time. \u201cWe could talk for a while if you\u2019d like. You could tell me what\u2019s going on with your marriage.\u201d</p><p>Jill sat stiffly in the empty chair. She placed her hands on the table, fingers splayed, as if she were afraid the wood might levitate. \u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019ve been married for twenty-six years. But I can\u2019t. Do it. Anymore. We don\u2019t talk at all. We\u2019ve become one of those couples who go out to dinner and sit silently across from each other. I saw my parents do that. I swore I never would. I\u2019m going to be fifty next year. It\u2019s time I have my life.\u201d</p><p>The second-chance-at-life reason for divorce. It was number two, beaten only by that perennial favorite: He\u2019s cheating on me. \u201cEveryone deserves to be happy,\u201d Meg said, feeling strangely remote. On autopilot, she reeled off a series of questions and statements designed to elicit solid information as well as inspire trust. Meg could tell that she was doing well on both counts. Jill had begun to relax. Occasionally, she even smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd how about assets? Do you have an idea of your net worth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice DeMille told me you\u2019d ask that.\u201d She opened her Fendi briefcase and pulled out a packet of papers that were stapled together, then pushed them across the table. \u201cMy husband and I started the Internet company Emblazon. We sold out to AOL at the top of the market. That, combined with the lesser companies and homes, puts our net worth at somewhere around seventy-two million.\u201d</p><p>Seventy-two million dollars.</p><p>Meghann held on to her ordinary smile by dint of will, afraid that her mouth would drop open. This was the biggest case ever to fall in her lap. She\u2019d waited her whole career for a case like this. It was supposed to be the trade-off for all of the sleepless nights she\u2019d spent worrying over clients who couldn\u2019t pay their bills. Her favorite law professor used to say that the law was the same regardless of the zeroes. Meg knew better: The legal system favored women like Jill.</p><p>They should probably hire a media consultant. A case like this could generate a lot of publicity.</p><p>She should have been excited by the prospect, energized. Surprisingly, she felt detached. Even a little sad. She knew that, for all her millions, Jill was still a woman about to be broken.</p><p>Meg reached for the phone and pressed the intercom button. \u201cRhona, bring me the lawyer lists. Seattle. L.A. San Francisco. New York and Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Jill frowned. \u201cBut . . . ,\u201d she paused when the secretary came into the room, carrying a sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Meghann handed the paper to Jill. \u201cThese twenty lawyers are the best in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve spoken to them, they can\u2019t represent your husband. It\u2019s a conflict of interest.\u201d</p><p>Jill\u2019s gaze flicked over the list, then slowly lifted. \u201cI see. This is divorce strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimply planning ahead. In case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this ethical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. As a consumer, you have every right to get second opinions. I\u2019ll need a retainer\u2014say twenty-five thousand dollars\u2014and I\u2019ll use ten thousand of that to hire the best forensic accountants in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Jill looked at her for a long moment, saying nothing. Finally, she nodded and stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll go see everyone on your list. But I assume that if I choose you, you\u2019ll represent me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She remembered at the last minute to add, \u201cBut hopefully you won\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jill said, \u201cI can see that you\u2019re the hopeful type.\u201d</p><p>Meghann sighed. \u201cI know people all across this country are happily married. They just don\u2019t come to see me, but I do hope\u2014honestly\u2014that I won\u2019t see you again.\u201d</p><p>Jill gave her a sad, knowing look, and Meghann knew: The decision might be soft around the edges and filled with regret, but it had been made.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead and hope, then,\u201d Jill said softly. \u201cFor both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><p>Sprawled in the black leather chair, Meghann didn\u2019t move. \u201cSo, that\u2019s why I pay you two hundred dollars an hour. To insult me. Tell me I smell, too. Then I\u2019ll really get my money\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you pay me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI consider it a charitable deduction.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Bloom didn\u2019t smile. She sat\u2014as always, chameleon still\u2014watching. If it wasn\u2019t for the compassion in her dark brown eyes, she could easily be mistaken for a statue. It was often that compassion\u2014an emotion that bordered on pity\u2014that undid Meghann. Over the past twenty years, Meg had seen a constant stream of shrinks. Always psychiatrists, never counselors or psychologists. First off, she believed in a surplus of education. Second, and more important, she wanted to talk to someone who could dispense drugs.</p><p>In her thirties, Meg had gone through a new shrink every two years. She never told them anything that mattered, and they always returned the favor.</p><p>Then she\u2019d stumbled across Harriet Bloom, the stone queen who could sit quietly for an entire hour, take the check, and tell Meghann it was her money to spend wisely or throw away.</p><p>Harriet, who\u2019d uncovered a few artifacts of the past that mattered, and surmised some of the rest. A dozen times in the past year, Meghann had decided to sever their relationship, but every time she started to actually do it, she panicked and changed her mind.</p><p>The silence was gaining weight.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I look like shit. I\u2019ll admit it. I haven\u2019t been sleeping well. I need more pills, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat prescription should last for another two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Meghann couldn\u2019t make eye contact. \u201cA couple of times this week, I needed two. The insomnia . . . it really rips me. Sometimes I can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think you can\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I can\u2019t sleep? That\u2019s the relevant opinion, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Bloom studied her. She was so still it seemed impossible that her lungs were functioning. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have trouble sleeping sometimes. That\u2019s all. Big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you use drugs and strangers to help you through the night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t pick up as many men as I used to. But sometimes . . .\u201d She looked up, saw a sad understanding in Harriet\u2019s eyes. It pissed her off. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me that way.\u201d</p><p>Harriet leaned forward, rested her elbows on the table. Her steepled fingers brushed the underside of her chin. \u201cYou use sex to dispel loneliness. But what\u2019s lonelier than anonymous sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least when the guys leave my bed, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEric.\u201d</p><p>Harriet sat back. \u201cYou were married for less than a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t minimize it, Harriet. He broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. And you suck on that candy every day in your practice, as women tell you their sad and similar stories. But the flavor has been gone for years. You\u2019re not worried about someone breaking your heart again. You\u2019re worried you don\u2019t have a heart to break. The bottom line is, you\u2019re scared, and fear isn\u2019t an emotion that fits well with your need to control.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Meg was tired of being alone and terrified that her life would be a stretch of empty road. A part of her wanted to nod her head, to say yes, and beg for a way to shed her fear. But that was a thin, reedy voice lost amid the screaming blare of self-preservation. The bedrock lesson of her life was that love didn\u2019t last. It was better to be lonely and strong than heartbroken and weak.</p> <p>Her voice, when she found it, was honed and tight. \u201cI had a difficult week at the office. I\u2019m getting impatient with my clients. I can\u2019t seem to feel for them the way I used to.\u201d</p><p>Harriet was too professional to show her disappointment with something as obvious as a sigh or a frown. Her only reaction was to unsteeple her fingers. That oozing, uncomfortable compassion was back in her eyes, though. That poor-Meghann-so-afraid-of-intimacy look. \u201cYour emotions feel distant and inaccessible? Why do you think that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs an attorney, I\u2019m trained to see things dispassionately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet we both know that the best lawyers are compassionate. And you, Meghann, are an extremely good attorney.\u201d</p><p>They were on safe ground again, although it could get slippery again in a second. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you. I\u2019m not as good as I used to be. I used to help people. Even care about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m some balance-sheet automaton who moves through the day crunching finances and spitting out settlements. I find myself hashing and rehashing canned speeches to women whose lives are falling apart. I used to be pissed off at the husbands. Now I\u2019m just tired. It\u2019s not a game\u2014I take it too seriously still for that\u2014but it\u2019s . . . not real life, either. Not to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might consider a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d Meghann smiled. They both knew that relaxation didn\u2019t come easily.</p><p>\u201cA vacation. Ordinary people take weeks in Hawaii or Aspen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDissatisfaction isn\u2019t something you can run away from. Isn\u2019t that Psychology 101?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting you run away. I\u2019m suggesting you give yourself a break. Maybe get a tan. You could spend a few days at your sister\u2019s place in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire and I aren\u2019t likely to vacation together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid to talk to her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything. Claire\u2019s a campground manager in Podunk. We have nothing in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of it good. Believe me, the tour bus driver of Claire\u2019s life would hit the gas and keep driving when he came to our childhood years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love Claire. That must count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Meg said slowly. \u201cI love her. That\u2019s why I stay away.\u201d She glanced down at her watch. \u201cOh, damn. Hour\u2019s up. See you next week.\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>JOE STOOD AT THE CORNER OF FIRST AND MAIN, LOOKING down the street at a town whose name he couldn\u2019t remember. He shifted his backpack around, resettled it on his other shoulder. Beneath the strap, his shirt was soaked with sweat and his skin was clammy. In the windless, baking air, he could smell himself. It wasn\u2019t good. This morning he\u2019d walked at least seven miles. No one had offered him a ride. No surprise there. The longer\u2014and grayer\u2014his hair got, the fewer rides he was offered. Only the long-haul truckers could be counted on anymore, and they\u2019d been few and far between on this hot Sunday morning.</p><p>Up ahead, he saw a hand-painted sign for the Wake Up Caf\u00e9.</p><p>He dug into his pocket and pulled out his wallet, a soft, smooth, lambskin artifact from his previous life. Flipping it open, he barely looked at the single photograph in the plastic square as he opened the side slit.</p><p>Twelve dollars and seventy-two cents. He\u2019d need to find work today. The money he\u2019d earned in Yakima was almost gone.</p><p>He turned into the caf\u00e9. At his entrance, a bell tinkled overhead.</p><p>Every head turned to look at him.</p><p>The clattering din of conversation died abruptly. The only sounds came from the kitchen, clanging, scraping.</p><p>He knew how he looked to them: an unkempt vagrant with shoulder-length silver hair and clothes that needed a heavy wash cycle. His Levi\u2019s had faded to a pale, pale blue, and his T-shirt was stained with perspiration. Though his forty-third birthday was next week, he looked sixty. And there was the smell. . . .</p><p>He snagged a laminated menu from the slot beside the cash register and walked through the diner, head down, to the last bar stool on the left. He\u2019d learned not to sit too close to the \u201cgood people\u201d in any of the towns in which he stopped. Sometimes the presence of a man who\u2019d fallen on hard times was offensive. In those towns it was too damn easy to find your ass on a jail-cell cot. He\u2019d spent enough time in jail already.</p><p>The waitress stood back by the grill, dressed in a splotchy, stained pink polyester uniform. Like everyone else in the place, she was staring at him.</p><p>He sat quietly, his body tensed.</p><p>Then, as if a switch had been flipped, the noise returned.</p><p>The waitress pulled a pen out from above her ear and came toward him. When she got closer, he noticed that she was younger than he\u2019d thought. Maybe still in high school, even. Her long brown hair, drawn back in a haphazard ponytail, was streaked with purple, and a small gold hoop clung precariously to her overly plucked eyebrow. She wore more makeup than Boy George.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I getcha?\u201d She wrinkled her nose and stepped backward.</p><p>\u201cI guess I need a shower, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could use one.\u201d She smiled, then leaned a fraction of an inch closer. \u201cThe KOA campground is your best bet. They have a killer bathroom. \u2019Course it\u2019s for guests only, but nobody much watches.\u201d She popped her gum and whispered, \u201cThe door code is twenty-one hundred. All the locals know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He looked at her name tag. \u201cBrandy.\u201d</p><p>She poised a pen at the small notepad. \u201cNow, whaddaya want?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother looking at the menu. \u201cI\u2019ll have a bran muffin, fresh fruit\u2014whatever you have\u2014and a bowl of oatmeal. Oh. And a glass of orange juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo bacon or eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and started to turn away. He stopped her by saying, \u201cBrandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere could a guy like me find some work?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cA guy like you?\u201d The tone was obvious. She\u2019d figured he didn\u2019t work, just begged and drifted. \u201cI\u2019d try the Tip Top Apple Farm. They always need people. And Yardbirds\u2014they mow lawns for the vacation rentals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Joe sat there, on that surprisingly comfortable bar stool, long after he should have gone. He ate his breakfast as slowly as possible, chewing every bite forever, but finally his bowl and plate were empty.</p><p>He knew it was time to move on, but he couldn\u2019t make himself get up. Last night he\u2019d slept tucked along a fallen log in some farmer\u2019s back pasture. Between the howling wind and a sudden rainstorm, it had been an uncomfortable night. His whole body ached today. Now, for once, he was warm but not hot, and his stomach was full, and he was sitting comfortably. It was a moment of Heaven.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta go,\u201d Brandy whispered as she swept past him. \u201cMy boss says he\u2019s gonna call the cops if you keep hanging around.\u201d</p><p>Joe could have argued, could have pointed out that he\u2019d paid for breakfast and could legally sit here. An ordinary person certainly had that right.</p><p>Instead, he said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and put six bucks on the pink Formica counter.</p><p>He slowly got to his feet. For a second, he felt dizzy. When the bout passed, he grabbed his backpack and slung it over his shoulder.</p><p>Outside, the heat hit him hard, knocking him back. It took a supreme act of will to start walking.</p><p>He kept his thumb out, but no one picked him up. Slowly, his strength sapped by the hundred-degree heat, he walked in the direction Brandy had given him. By the time he reached the KOA Campground, he had a pounding headache and his throat hurt.</p><p>There was nothing he wanted to do more than walk down that gravel road, duck into the bathroom for a long hot shower, and then rent a cabin for a much-needed rest.</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d he said aloud, thinking of the six bucks in his wallet. It was a habit he\u2019d acquired lately: talking to himself. Otherwise, he sometimes went days without hearing another human voice.</p><p>He\u2019d have to sneak into the bathroom, and he couldn\u2019t do it when people were everywhere.</p><p>He crept into a thicket of pine trees behind the lodge. The shade felt good. He eased deep into the woods until he couldn\u2019t be seen; then he sat down with his back rested against a pine tree. His head pounded at the movement, small as it was, and he closed his eyes.</p><p>He was awakened hours later by the sound of laughter. There were several children running through the campsites, shrieking. The smell of smoke\u2014campfires\u2014was heavy in the air.</p><p>Dinnertime.</p><p>He blinked awake, surprised that he\u2019d slept so long. He waited until the sun set and the campground was quiet, then he got to his feet. Holding his backpack close, he crept cautiously toward the log structure that housed the campground\u2019s rest room and laundry facilities.</p><p>He was reaching out to punch in the code when a woman appeared beside him. Just . . . appeared.</p><p>He froze, turning slowly.</p><p>She stood there, wearing a bright blue bathing suit top and a pair of cutoff shorts, holding a stack of pink towels. Her sandy blond hair was a mass of drying curls. She\u2019d been laughing as she approached the bathrooms, but when she saw him her smile faded.</p><p>Damn. He\u2019d been close to a hot shower\u2014his first in weeks. Now, any minute, this beautiful woman would scream for the manager.</p><p>Very softly, she said, \u201cThe code is twenty-one hundred. Here.\u201d She handed him a towel, then went into the women\u2019s bathroom and closed the door.</p><p>It took him a moment to move, that was how deeply her kindness had affected him. Finally, holding the towel close, he punched in the code and hurried into the men\u2019s bathroom. It was empty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a long, hot shower, then dressed in the cleanest clothes he had, and washed his dirty clothes in the sink. As he brushed his teeth, he stared at himself in the mirror. His hair was too long and shaggy, and he\u2019d gone almost completely gray. He hadn\u2019t been able to shave this morning, so his sunken cheeks were shadowed by a thick stubble. The bags beneath his eyes were carry-on size. He was like a piece of fruit, slowly going bad from the inside out.</p><p>He finger-combed the hair back from his face and turned away from the mirror. Really, it was better not to look. All it did was remind him of the old days, when he\u2019d been young and vain, when he\u2019d been careful to keep up appearances. Then, he\u2019d thought a lot of unimportant things mattered.</p><p>He went to the door, opened it a crack, and peered out. There was no one nearby, so he slipped into the darkness.</p><p>It was completely dark now. A full moon hung over the lake, casting a rippled glow across the waves and illuminating the cabins along the shore. Three of them were brightly lit from within. In one of them, he could see people moving around inside; it looked as if they were dancing. And suddenly, he wanted to be in that cabin, to be part of that circle of people who cared about one another.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, Joe,\u201d he said, wishing he could laugh about it the way he once would have. But there was a lump in his throat that made smiling impossible.</p><p>He slipped into the cover of the trees and kept moving. As he passed behind one of the cabins, he heard music. \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d by the Bee Gees. Then he heard the sound of childish laughter. \u201cDance with me, Daddy,\u201d a little girl said loudly.</p><p>He forced himself to keep moving. With each step taken, the sound of laughter diminished until, by the time he reached the edge of the woods, he had to strain to hear it at all. He found a soft bed of pine needles and sat down. Moonlight glowed around him, turning the world into a smear of blue-white and black.</p><p>He unzipped his backpack and burrowed through the damp, wadded-up clothes, looking for the two items that mattered.</p><p>Three years ago, when he\u2019d first run away, he\u2019d carried an expensive suitcase. He still remembered standing in his bedroom, packing for a trip without destination or duration, wondering what a man in exile would need. He\u2019d packed khaki slacks and merino wool sweaters and even a black Joseph Abboud suit.</p> <p>By the end of his first winter alone, he\u2019d understood that those clothes were the archaeological remains of a forgotten life. Useless. All he needed in his new life were two pair of jeans, a few T-shirts, a sweatshirt, and a rain slicker. Everything else he\u2019d given to charity.</p><p>The only expensive garment he\u2019d kept was a pink cashmere sweater with tiny shell buttons. On a good night, he could still smell her perfume in the soft fabric.</p><p>He withdrew a small, leatherbound photo album from the backpack. With shaking fingers, he opened the front cover.</p><p>The first picture was one of his favorites.</p><p>In it, Diana sat on a patch of grass, wearing a pair of white shorts and a Yale T-shirt. There was a stack of books open beside her, and a mound of pink cherry blossoms covered the pages. She was smiling so brightly he had to blink back tears. \u201cHey, baby,\u201d he whispered, touching the glossy covering. \u201cI had a hot shower tonight.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. In the darkness, she came to him. It was happening more and more often lately, this sensation that she hadn\u2019t left him, that she was still here. He knew it was a crack in his mind, a mental defect. He didn\u2019t care.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d he said to her, breathing in deeply, savoring the scent of her perfume. Red by Giorgio. He wondered if they made it anymore.</p><p>It\u2019s no good, what you\u2019re doing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>Go home.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>You break my heart, Joey.</p><p>And she was gone.</p><p>With a sigh, he leaned back against a big tree stump.</p> <p>Go home, she\u2019d said. It was what she always said to him.</p><p>What he said to himself.</p><p>Maybe tomorrow, he thought, reaching for the kind of courage that would make it possible. God knew after three years on the road, he was tired of being this alone.</p><p>Maybe tomorrow he would finally\u2014finally\u2014allow himself to start walking west.</p><p>Diana would like that.</p><p>SIX</p><p>LIKE SUNSHINE, NIGHT BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN SEATTLE. The highway\u2014a bumper-to-bumper nightmare at morning rush hour\u2014became, at night, a glittering red-and-gold Chinese dragon that curled along the blackened banks of Lake Union. The cluster of high-rises in the city\u2019s midtown heart, so ordinary in the gray haze on a June day, was a kaleidoscope of sculpted color when night fell.</p><p>Meghann stood at her office window. She never failed to be mesmerized by this view. The water was a black stain that consumed nearby Bainbridge Island. Though she couldn\u2019t see the streets below, she knew they were clogged. Traffic was the curse Seattle had carried into the new millennium. Millions of people had moved into the once-sleepy town, drawn by the quality of life and the variety of outdoor activities. Unfortunately, after they built expensive cul-de-sac homes in the suburbs, they took jobs in the city. Roads designed for an out-of-the-way port town couldn\u2019t possibly keep up.</p><p>Progress.</p><p>Meghann glanced down at her watch. It was 8:30. Time to head home. She\u2019d bring the Wanamaker file with her. Get a jump on tomorrow.</p><p>Behind her, the door opened. Ana, the cleaning woman, pushed her supply cart into the room, dragging a vacuum cleaner alongside. \u201cHello, Miss Dontess.\u201d</p><p>Meghann smiled. No matter how often she told Ana to call her Meghann, the woman never did. \u201cGood evening, Ana. How\u2019s Raul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we find out if he get stationed at McChord. We keep our fingers crossed, \u00bfs\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be great to have your son so close,\u201d Meghann said as she gathered up her files.</p><p>Ana mumbled something. It sounded a lot like, \u201cYou should have a son nearby, too. Instead of all that work, work, work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you chastising me again, Ana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know chastising. But you work too hard. Every night you\u2019re here. When you gonna meet Mr. Right if you always at work?\u201d</p><p>It was an old debate, one that had started almost ten years ago, when Meghann had handled Ana\u2019s INS hearing pro bono. Her last moment of peace had ended when she handed Ana a green card and hired her. Ever since, Ana had done her best to \u201crepay\u201d Meghann. That repayment seemed to be an endless stream of casseroles and a constant harangue about the evils of too much hard work.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Ana. I think I\u2019ll have a drink and unwind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink isn\u2019t what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d Ana muttered, bending down to plug in the vacuum.</p><p>\u201cBye, Ana.\u201d</p><p>Meghann was almost to the elevator when her cell phone rang. She rifled through her black Kate Spade bag and pulled out the phone. \u201cMeghann Dontess,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMeghann?\u201d The voice was high-pitched and panicky. \u201cIt\u2019s May Monroe.\u201d</p><p>Meghann was instantly alert. A divorce could go bad faster than an open cut in the tropics. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dale. He came by tonight.\u201d</p><p>Meghann made a mental note to get a TRO first thing tomorrow. \u201cUh-huh. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said something about the papers he got today. He was crazy. What did you send him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about this, May. On the phone, last week, remember? I notified Dale\u2019s lawyer and the court that we\u2019d be contesting the fraudulent transfer of his business and demanding an accounting of the Cayman Island accounts. I also told his attorney that we were aware of the affair with the child\u2019s piano instructor and that such behavior might threaten his suitability as a parent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never discussed that. You threatened to take away his children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, May, the temper tantrum is about money. It always is. The kids are a shill game with guys like your husband. Pretend to want custody and you\u2019ll get more money. It\u2019s a common tactic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you know my husband better than I do.\u201d</p><p>Meghann had heard this sentence more times than she could count. It always amazed her. Women who were blindsided by their husband\u2019s affairs, lies, and financial gymnastics continually believed that they \u201cknew\u201d their men. Yet another reason not to get married. It wasn\u2019t masturbation that made you go blind; it was love. \u201cI don\u2019t have to know him,\u201d Meghann answered, using the canned speech she\u2019d perfected long ago. \u201cProtecting you is my job. If I upset your\u201d\u2014no good, lying\u2014\u201chusband in the process, that\u2019s an unfortunate necessity. He\u2019ll calm down. They always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know Dale,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Meghann\u2019s senses pounced on some nuance. Something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cAre you scared of him, May?\u201d This was a whole new wrinkle.</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d May tried to sound surprised by the question, but Meghann knew. Damn. She was always surprised by spousal abuse; it was never the families you expected.</p><p>\u201cDoes he hit you, May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes when he\u2019s drinking, I can say just the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. It\u2019s May\u2019s fault. It was terrifying how often women believed that. \u201cAre you okay now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hit me. And he never hits the children.\u201d</p><p>Meghann didn\u2019t say what came to mind. Instead, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d If she\u2019d been with May, she would have been able to look in her client\u2019s eyes and take a measure of the woman\u2019s fragility. If it seemed possible, she would have given her statistics\u2014horror stories designed to drive home the ugly truth. Often, if a man would hit his wife, he\u2019d get around to hitting his children. Bullies were bullies; their defining characteristic was the need to exert power over the powerless. Who was more powerless than a child?</p><p>But none of that could be done over the phone. Sometimes a client sounded strong and in control while they were falling apart. Meghann had visited too many of her clients in psych wards and hospitals. She\u2019d grown careful over the years.</p><p>\u201cWe need to make sure he understands that I\u2019m not going to take his children from him. Otherwise he\u2019ll go crazy,\u201d May said. There was the barest crack in her voice.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you this, May. Say it\u2019s three months from now. You\u2019re divorced, and Dale has lost half of everything he owns. He\u2019s living with Dance Hall Barbie and they come home drunk one night. Barbie\u2019s driving because she only had three margaritas. When they get home, the baby-sitter has let the kids demolish the house and little Billy has accidentally broken the window in Dale\u2019s office. Are your children safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of things going wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings go wrong, May. You know that. I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019ve always been a buffer between your husband and kids. A human shock absorber. You probably learned how to calm him down and deflect his attention away from the children. Will Barbie know how to protect them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I so ordinary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, the situation is. The good news is, you\u2019re giving yourself\u2014and your children\u2014a new start. Don\u2019t weaken now, May. Don\u2019t let him bully you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, what do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock the doors and turn off the phone. Don\u2019t talk to him. If you don\u2019t feel safe, go to a relative\u2019s or friend\u2019s house. Or to a motel for one night. Tomorrow we\u2019ll get together and come up with a new game plan. I\u2019ll file some restraining orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can keep us safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, May. Trust me. Bullies are cowards. Once he sees how strong you can be, he\u2019ll back down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. When can we meet?\u201d</p><p>Meghann dug through her bag for her PalmPilot, then checked her schedule. \u201cHow about a late lunch\u2014say two o\u2019clock\u2014at the Judicial Annex Caf\u00e9 by the courthouse? I\u2019ll schedule a meeting with Dale\u2019s lawyer for later that afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay, I know this is a sensitive question, but do you by any chance have a photograph of yourself . . . you know . . . when he hit you?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause on the other end of the line, then May said, \u201cI\u2019ll check my photo albums.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s simply evidence,\u201d Meg said.</p><p>\u201cTo you, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, May. I wish I didn\u2019t have to ask questions like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d May said.</p><p>That surprised Meg. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat no man has ever shown you the other side. My father would have killed Dale for all of this.\u201d</p> <p>Before she could stop it, Meghann felt a sharp jab of longing. It was her Achilles\u2019 heel. She was sure she didn\u2019t believe in love, but still, she dreamed of it. Maybe May was right. Maybe if Meg had had a father who\u2019d loved her, everything would be different. As it was, she knew that love was a rope bridge made of the thinnest strands. It might hold your weight for a while, but sooner or later, it would break.</p><p>Oh, there were happy marriages. Her best friend, Elizabeth, had proven that.</p><p>There were also forty-eight-million-dollar-lottery winners, five-leaf clovers, Siamese twins, and full eclipses of the sun.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll meet at the Annex tomorrow at two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Meghann flipped the phone shut and dropped it in her purse, then pushed the elevator button. When the door opened, she stepped inside. As always, the mirrored walls made it feel as if she were stumbling into herself. She leaned forward, unable to stop herself; when a mirror was near, she had to look into it. In the past few years, she\u2019d begun to search obsessively for signs of aging. Lines, wrinkles, sags.</p><p>She was forty-two years old, and since it felt as if she\u2019d been thirty a moment ago, she had to assume it would be a blink\u2019s worth of time before she was fifty.</p><p>That depressed her. She imagined herself at sixty. Alone, working from dawn to dusk, talking to her neighbor\u2019s cats, and going on singles\u2019 cruises.</p> <p>She left the elevator and strode through the lobby, nodding at the night doorman as she passed.</p><p>Outside, the night was beautiful; an amethyst sky gave everything a pink and pearlized glow. Lit windows in towering skyscrapers proved that Meghann wasn\u2019t the only workaholic in the city.</p><p>She walked briskly down the street, bypassing people without making eye contact. At her building, she paused and looked up.</p><p>There was her deck. The only one in the building without potted trees and outdoor furniture. The windows behind it were black; the rest of the building was a blaze of light. Friends and families were in those lighted spaces, having dinner, watching television, talking, making love. Connecting with one another.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, May had said, that no man has ever shown you the other side.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Meghann walked past her building. She didn\u2019t want to go up there, put on her old UW sweats, eat Raisin Bran for dinner, and watch a rerun of Third Watch.</p><p>She went into the Public Market. At this late hour, pretty much everything was closed up. The fish vendors had gone home, and the dewy, beautiful vegetables had been boxed up until tomorrow. The stalls\u2014normally filled with dried flowers, handmade crafts, and homemade food items\u2014were empty.</p><p>She turned into the Athenian, the old-fashioned tavern made famous in Sleepless in Seattle. It was at this polished wooden bar that Rob Reiner had told Tom Hanks about dating in the nineties.</p><p>The smoke in here was so thick you could have played ticktacktoe in it with your finger. There was something comforting in the lack of political correctness in the Athenian. You could order a trendy drink, but their specialty was ice-cold beer.</p><p>Meghann had perfected the art of scoping out a bar without being obvious. She did that now.</p><p>There were five or six older men at the bar. Fishermen, she\u2019d guess, getting ready to head up to Alaska for the season. A pair of younger Wall Street types were there, too, drinking martinis and no doubt talking shop. She saw enough of that kind in court.</p><p>\u201cHey, Meghann,\u201d yelled Freddie, the bartender. \u201cYour usual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d Still smiling, she moved past the bar and turned left, where several varnished wooden tables hugged the two walls. Most were full of couples or foursomes; a few were empty.</p><p>Meghann found a place in the back. She sidled into the glossy wooden seat and sat down. A big window was to her left. The view was of Elliot Bay and the wharf.</p><p>\u201cHere ye be,\u201d Freddie said, setting a martini glass down in front of her. He shook the steel shaker, then poured her a cosmopolitan. \u201cYou want an order of oysters and fries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read my mind.\u201d</p><p>Freddie grinned. \u201cAin\u2019t hard to do, counselor.\u201d He leaned down toward her. \u201cThe Eagles are coming in tonight. Should be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Eagles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe minor league ball team outta Everett.\u201d He winked at her. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>Meghann groaned. It was bad when bartenders started recommending whole ball teams.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Meghann began drinking. When the first cosmo was gone, she ordered a second. By the time she saw the bottom of the glass again, she\u2019d almost forgotten her day.</p><p>\u201cMay I join you?\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked up, startled, and found herself staring into a pair of dark eyes.</p><p>He stood in front of her, with one foot up on the seat opposite her. She could tell by the look of him\u2014young, blond, sexy as hell\u2014that he was used to getting what he wanted. And what he wanted tonight was her.</p><p>The thought was a tonic.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She didn\u2019t offer a half smile or bat her eyes. Pretense had never appealed to her. Neither had games. \u201cI\u2019m Meghann Dontess. My friends call me Meg.\u201d</p><p>He slid into the seat. His knees brushed hers, and at the contact, he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Donny MacMillan. You like baseball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like a lot of things.\u201d She flagged down Freddie, who nodded at her. A moment later, he brought her another cosmopolitan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a Coors Light,\u201d Donny said, leaning back and stretching his arms out along the top of the seat back.</p><p>They stared at each other in silence. The noise in the bar grew louder, then seemed to fade away, until all Meghann could hear was the even strains of his breathing and the beating of her heart.</p><p>Freddie served a beer and left again.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re a baseball player.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, and damn, it was sexy. She felt the first twinge of desire. Sex with him would be great; she knew it. And it would make her forget\u2014</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>\u2014about her bad day.</p><p>\u201cYou know it. I\u2019m gonna make it to the show. You watch. Someday I\u2019ll be famous.\u201d</p><p>That was why Meghann gravitated toward younger men. They still believed in themselves and the world. They hadn\u2019t yet learned how life really worked, how dreams were slowly strangled and right and wrong became abstract ideas instead of goalposts for all to see. Those truths usually hit around thirty-five, when you realized that your life was not what you\u2019d wanted.</p><p>That, of course, and the fact that they never demanded more than she wanted to give. Men her age tended to think sex meant something. Younger men knew better.</p><p>For the next hour, Meghann nodded and smiled as Donny talked about himself. By the time she\u2019d finished her fourth drink, she knew that he had graduated from WSU, was the youngest of three brothers, and that his parents still lived in the same Iowa farmhouse that his grandfather had homesteaded. It all went in one ear and out the other. What she really focused on was the way his knee brushed up against hers, the way his thumb stroked the wet beer glass in a steady, sensual rhythm.</p><p>He was telling her about a frat party in college when she said, \u201cYou want to come to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor coffee?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat, too, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t screw around, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s quite clear that I do. I simply like to be direct about it. I\u2019m . . . thirty-four years old. My game-playing days are behind me.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her then, smiling slowly, and the knowing sensuality in his gaze made her engine overheat. This is going to be good. \u201cHow far away do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs luck would have it, not far.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, reached his hand down to help her up.</p><p>She told herself he was being gallant. As opposed to helping the elderly. She placed her hand in his; at the contact a shivery thrill zipped through her.</p><p>They didn\u2019t talk as they made their way through the now-dark and empty market. There was nothing to say. The niceties had been exchanged, the foreplay initiated. What mattered from this point on had more to do with bare skin than baring questions.</p><p>The doorman at Meghann\u2019s building did his job wordlessly. If he noticed that this was the second young man she\u2019d brought home in the last month, he showed no signs of it.</p><p>\u201cEvening, Ms. Dontess,\u201d he said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cHans,\u201d she acknowledged, leading\u2014Oh, God, what was his name?</p><p>Donny. As in Osmond.</p><p>She wished she hadn\u2019t made that connection.</p><p>They stepped into the elevator. The minute the door closed, he turned to her. She heard the little catch in her breathing as he leaned toward her.</p><p>His lips were as soft and sweet as she\u2019d thought they would be.</p><p>The elevator pinged at the penthouse floor. He started to pull away from her, but she wouldn\u2019t let him. \u201cI\u2019m the only apartment on this floor,\u201d she whispered against his mouth. Still kissing him, she reached into her bag and pulled at her keys.</p><p>Locked together, they centipeded toward the door and stumbled through it.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Her voice was harsh, gruff, as she led him toward the bedroom. Once there, she started unbuttoning her blouse. He tried to reach for her but she pushed his hand away.</p><p>When she was naked, she looked at him. The room was dark, shadowy, just the way she liked it.</p><p>His face was a blur. She opened her nightstand drawer and found a condom.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, reaching out.</p><p>\u201cOh. I intend to come. Here.\u201d She walked toward him slowly, holding her tummy as taut as possible.</p><p>He touched her left breast. Her nipple immediately responded. The ache between her legs graduated, deepened.</p><p>She reached down, took hold of him, and began stroking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After that, everything happened fast. They fell on each other like animals, scratching, humping, groaning. Behind them, the headboard banged against the wall. Her orgasm, when it finally happened, was sharp and painful and faded much too quickly.</p><p>She was left feeling vaguely dissatisfied. That was happening more and more often. She lay back onto the pillows. He was beside her, so close she could feel the warmth of his bare flesh alongside her thigh.</p><p>He was right next to her, and yet she felt alone. Here they were, in bed together, with the scent of their sex still in the air, and she couldn\u2019t think of a single thing to say to him.</p><p>She rolled over and moved closer to him. Before she quite knew what she was doing, she\u2019d cuddled up alongside him. It was the first time she\u2019d done something so intimate in years.</p> <p>\u201cTell me something about you no one knows,\u201d she said, sliding her naked leg across his.</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cI guess you live in Bizarro World, where they do everything backward, huh? First you screw my brains out, then you want to know me. In the bar, you were practically yawning when I told you about my family.\u201d</p><p>She drew away from him, pulled back into herself. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be ordinary.\u201d She was surprised by how okay she sounded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, believe me.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her leg aside and kissed her shoulder. The brush-off. Frankly, she preferred it without the kiss.</p> <p>\u201cI gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, go.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t sound pissed off. It\u2019s not like we fell in love tonight.\u201d</p><p>She reached down to the floor for her Seahawks nightshirt and put it on. She was less vulnerable dressed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me well enough to know whether I\u2019m pissed off. And frankly, I can\u2019t imagine falling in love with someone who used the term \u2018ball handling\u2019 as often as you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He got out of bed and started dressing. She sat in bed, very stiffly, watching him. She wished she had a book on her nightstand. It would have been nice to start reading now.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep bearing left, you\u2019ll find the front door.\u201d</p> <p>His frown deepened. \u201cAre you on medication?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that.</p><p>\u201cBecause you should be.\u201d He started to leave\u2014almost breaking into a run, she noticed\u2014but at the door, he paused and turned around. \u201cI liked you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>Meg heard the front door open and click shut. She finally released a heavy breath.</p><p>It used to take weeks, months even, before men began to ask if she was medicated. Now she\u2019d managed to completely alienate Danny\u2014Donny\u2014in a single night.</p><p>She was losing her grip. Life seemed to be unraveling around her. Hell, she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d kissed a man and felt something more than desire.</p><p>And what about loneliness? Dr. Bloom had asked her. Do you like that, too?</p> <p>She leaned sideways and flicked on the bedside lamp. Light fell on a framed photograph of Meghann and her sister, taken years ago.</p><p>Meghann wondered what her sister was doing right now. Wondered if she was awake at this late hour, feeling alone and vulnerable. But she knew the answer.</p><p>Claire had Alison. And Sam.</p><p>Sam.</p><p>Meghann wished she could forget the few memories she had of her sister\u2019s father. But that kind of amnesia never overtook her. Instead, Meghann remembered everything, every detail. Mostly, she remembered how much she\u2019d wanted Sam to be her father, too. When she\u2019d been young and hopeful, she\u2019d thought: Maybe we could be a family, the three of us.</p><p>The pipe dreams of a child. Still painful after all these years.</p><p>Sam was Claire\u2019s father. He had stepped in and changed everything. Meg and Claire had nothing in common anymore.</p><p>Claire lived in a house filled with laughter and love. She probably only dated upstanding leaders of the community. No anonymous, dissatisfying sex for Claire.</p><p>Meghann closed her eyes, reminding herself that this was the life she wanted. She\u2019d tried marriage. It had ended exactly as she\u2019d feared\u2014with his betrayal and her broken heart. She didn\u2019t ever want to experience that again. If sometimes she spent an hour or so in the middle of the night with an ache of longing that wouldn\u2019t quite go away, well, that was the price of independence.</p><p>She leaned across the bed and picked up the phone. There were five numbers on her speed dialer: the office, three take-out restaurants, and her best friend, Elizabeth Shore.</p><p>She punched in number three.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said a groggy male voice. \u201cJamie?\u201d</p><p>Meghann glanced at the bedside clock. Damn. It was almost midnight; that made it nearly three o\u2019clock in New York. \u201cSorry, Jack. I didn\u2019t notice the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a smart woman, you make that mistake a lot. Just a sec.\u201d</p><p>Meghann wished she could hang up. She felt exposed by her error. It showed how little a life she had.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Elizabeth said, sounding worried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I screwed up. Tell Jack I\u2019m sorry. We can talk tomorrow. I\u2019ll call before I leave for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hang on.\u201d</p><p>Meghann heard Elizabeth whisper something to her husband. A moment later, she said, \u201cLet me guess. You just got home from the Athenian.\u201d</p><p>That made her feel even worse. \u201cNo. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Meg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, really. I just lost track of time. I was . . . working on a messy deposition. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I are leaving for Paris, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Have a great time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could postpone it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss that huge party at the Ritz? No way. Have a wonderful time.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause on the line, then softly Elizabeth said, \u201cI love you, Meg.\u201d</p><p>She felt the start of tears. Those were the words she\u2019d needed, even if they came from far away; they made her feel less alone, less vulnerable. \u201cI love you, too, Birdie. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Meg. Sleep well.\u201d</p><p>She slowly hung up the phone. The room seemed quiet now; too dark. She pulled the covers up and closed her eyes, knowing it would be hours before she fell asleep.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>THEIR FIRST GATHERING AT LAKE CHELAN HAD BEEN IN celebration. Nineteen eighty-nine. The year Madonna urged people to express themselves and Jack Nicholson played the Joker and the first pieces of the Berlin Wall came down. More important, it was the year they all turned twenty-one. There had been five of them then. Best friends since grade school.</p><p>That first get-together had happened by accident. The girls had pooled their money to give Claire a weekend in the honeymoon cabin for her birthday. At the time\u2014in March\u2014she\u2019d been head over heels in love with Carl Eldridge. (The first of many head-over-heels-in-love relationships that turned out to be a plain old kick in the head.) By mid-July, on the designated weekend, Claire had been out of love, alone, and more than a little depressed. Never one to waste money, she\u2019d gone on the trip by herself, intending to sit on the porch and read.</p><p>Just before dinnertime of the first day, a battered yellow Ford Pinto had pulled into the yard. Her best friends had spilled out of the car and run across the lawn, laughing, holding two big jugs of margarita mix. They\u2019d called their visit a love intervention, and it had worked. By Monday, Claire had remembered who she was and what she wanted out of life. Carl Eldridge had most definitely not been \u201cthe one.\u201d</p><p>Every year since then, they\u2019d managed to come back for a week. Now, of course, it was different. Gina and Claire each had a daughter; Karen had four children, aged eleven to fourteen; and Charlotte was trying desperately to conceive.</p><p>In the past few years, their parties had quieted; less tequila and cigarettes came out of suitcases these days. Instead of getting dressed up and going to Cowboy Bob\u2019s Western Roundup to slam tequila and line-dance, they put the kids to bed early, drank glasses of white wine, and played hearts at the round wooden table on the porch. They kept a running score for the week. The winner got the keys to the honeymoon cottage for the next year.</p><p>Their vacation had evolved into a sort of slow, lazy merry-go-round rhythm. They spent their days by the lake, stretched out on red-and-white-striped beach towels or sitting on battered old beach chairs, with a portable radio set up on the picnic table. They always listened to the oldies station, and when a song from the eighties came on, they\u2019d jump up and dance and sing along. On hot days\u2014like this one had been\u2014they spent most of their time in the lake, standing neck-deep in the cool water, their faces shielded by floppy hats and sunglasses. Talking. Always talking.</p><p>Now, finally, the weather was perfect. The sky was a bright seamless blue, and the lake was like glass. The older kids were in the house, playing crazy eights and listening to Willie\u2019s ear-splitting music, probably talking about the latest, grossest R-rated movie that everyone else\u2019s mothers allowed their children to see. Alison and Bonnie were pedaling a water bike in the cordoned-off section of the lake. Their giggles could be heard above the others.</p><p>Karen sat slouched in her chair, fanning herself with a pamphlet from the water-slide park. Charlotte, completely protected from the sun by a floppy white hat and a diaphanous, three-quarter-sleeved cover-up, was reading the latest Kelly Ripa book club choice and sipping lemonade.</p><p>Gina leaned sideways and opened the cooler, rooting noisily through it for a Diet Coke. When she found one, she pulled it out and snapped it open, taking a long drink before she shut the cooler. \u201cMy marriage ends and we\u2019re drinking Diet Coke and lemonade. When Karen\u2019s dickwad first husband left, we slammed tequila and danced the macarena at Cowboy Bob\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my second husband, Stan,\u201d Karen said. \u201cWhen Aaron left, we ate those pot brownies and went skinny-dipping in the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point remains,\u201d Gina said. \u201cMy crisis is getting the Sesame Street treatment. You got Animal House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCowboy Bob\u2019s,\u201d Charlotte said, almost smiling. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been there in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since we started dragging around these undersize humans,\u201d Karen pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to rock and roll with a kid on your back.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte looked out at the lake, to where the little girls were pedaling their water bike. Her smile slowly faded. That familiar sadness came into her eyes again. No doubt she was thinking about the baby she wanted so much.</p><p>Claire glanced at her friends. It startled her for a moment, as it sometimes did on these trips, to see their thirty-five-year-old selves. This year, more than any other, they seemed quieter. Older, even. Women on the edge of a sparkling lake who had too much on their minds.</p><p>That would never do. They came to Lake Chelan to be their younger, freer selves. Troubles were for other latitudes.</p><p>Claire pushed herself up on her elbows. The scratchy cotton of her beach towel seemed to bite into her sunburned forearms.</p><p>\u201cWillie\u2019s fourteen this year, right?\u201d</p><p>Karen nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s starting high school in September. Can you believe it? He still sleeps with a stuffed animal and forgets to brush his teeth. The ninth-grade girls look like Solid Gold Dancers next to him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he baby-sit for an hour or two?\u201d</p><p>Gina sat upright. \u201cHot damn, Claire. Why didn\u2019t we think of that before? He\u2019s fourteen.\u201d</p><p>Karen frowned. \u201cWith the maturity of an earthworm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all baby-sat at his age,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cHell, I was practically a nanny that summer before high school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a responsible kid, Karen. He\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Claire said gently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Last month his fish died. Lack of food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t starve to death in two hours.\u201d</p><p>Karen looked back at the cabin.</p><p>Claire understood exactly what her friend was thinking. If Willie was old enough to baby-sit, he wasn\u2019t really a little boy anymore.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Karen said finally. \u201cOf course. Why not? We\u2019ll leave a cell phone with him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and a list of numbers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and we\u2019ll tell them not to leave the cabin.\u201d</p><p>Gina smiled for the first time all day. \u201cLadies, the Bluesers are going to leave the building.\u201d</p><p>It took them two hours to shower, change their clothes, and make the kids\u2019 dinner. Macaroni and cheese and hot dogs. It took them another hour to convince the kids that their plan was possible.</p><p>Finally, Claire took firm hold of Karen and led her outside. As they walked down the long, winding driveway, Karen paused and looked back every few feet. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d she said each time.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re sure. The responsibility will be good for him.\u201d</p><p>Karen frowned. \u201cI keep thinking about those poor little goldfish, floating belly-up in the dirty water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep walking.\u201d Gina leaned close to Claire and said, \u201cShe\u2019s like a car in the ice. If she stops, we\u2019ll never get her going again.\u201d</p><p>They were standing across the street from Cowboy Bob\u2019s when it hit them.</p><p>Claire was the first to speak. \u201cIt\u2019s not even dark out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs party animals, we\u2019ve lost our touch,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d This from Gina.</p><p>Claire refused to be thwarted. So what if they looked like sorority girls amid the professional drinkers that populated a place like this in the early evening? They were here to have a good time and Cowboy Bob\u2019s was their only choice.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, ladies,\u201d she said, storming forward.</p><p>Her friends fell into line behind her. Heads held high, they marched into Cowboy Bob\u2019s as if they owned the place. A thick gray haze hung along the ceiling, drifting in thin strands between the overhead lights. There were several regulars along the bar, their hunched bodies planted like soggy mushrooms on the black bar stools. Several multicolored neon beer signs flickered in the gloomy darkness.</p><p>Claire led the way to a round, battered table near the empty dance floor. From here they had an unobstructed view of the band\u2014which was now noticeably absent. A whiny Western song played on the jukebox.</p><p>They had barely made it to their seats when a tall, thin waitress with leathery cheeks appeared beside them. \u201cWhat c\u2019n I get for y\u2019all?\u201d she asked, wiping down the table with a gray rag.</p><p>Gina ordered a round of margaritas and onion rings, which were promptly served.</p><p>\u201cGod it feels good to get out,\u201d Karen said, reaching for her drink. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I went out without having to do enough preplanning to launch an air strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen to that,\u201d Gina agreed. \u201cRex could never handle getting a sitter. Not even to surprise me with a dinner date. The surprise was always: We\u2019re going out to dinner. Could you plan it? Like it takes ovaries to pick up the phone.\u201d At that, her smile slipped. \u201cIt always bugged the hell out of me. But it\u2019s a pretty small grievance, isn\u2019t it? Why didn\u2019t I notice that before?\u201d</p><p>Claire knew that Gina was thinking about the changes that were coming in her new, single life. The bed that would be half empty night after night. She wanted to say something, offer a comfort of some kind, but Claire knew nothing of marriage. She\u2019d dated plenty in the last twenty years, and she\u2019d fallen into pseudo-love a few times. But never the real thing.</p><p>She\u2019d figured she was missing out, but just now, as she saw the heartbreak in Gina\u2019s eyes, she wondered if maybe she\u2019d been lucky.</p><p>Claire raised her glass. \u201cTo us,\u201d she said in a firm voice. \u201cTo the Bluesers. We made it through junior high with Mr. Kruetzer, high school with Miss Bass the Wide Ass, through labors and surgeries, weddings and divorces. Two of us have lost our marriages, one hasn\u2019t been able to get pregnant, one of us has never been in love, and a few years ago, one of us died. But we\u2019re still here. We\u2019ll always be here for one another. That makes us lucky women.\u201d</p><p>They clinked their glasses together.</p><p>Karen turned to Gina. \u201cI know it feels like you\u2019re cracking apart. But it gets better. Life goes on. That\u2019s all I can say.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte pressed a hand on Gina\u2019s but said nothing. She was the one of them who knew best that sometimes there were no words to offer.</p><p>Gina managed a smile. \u201cEnough. I can mope at home. Let\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d</p><p>Claire changed the subject. At first, it was awkward, a conversation on a one-way road trying to change directions, but gradually, they found their rhythm. They returned to the old days and everything made them laugh. At some point, they ordered a plate of nachos. By the time the second order of food came, the band had started. The first song was a bone-jarringly loud rendition of \u201cFriends in Low Places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like Garth Brooks got caught in a barbed-wire fence,\u201d Claire said, laughing.</p><p>By the time the band got around to Alan Jackson\u2019s \u201cHere in the Real World,\u201d the place was wall-to-wall people. Almost everyone was dressed in fake leather Western wear. A group was line-dancing in a thigh-slappin\u2019 way.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Claire leaned forward and put her hands on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Guitars and Cadillacs.\u2019 We gotta dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDance?\u201d Gina laughed. \u201cThe last time I danced with you two, my butt hit an old man and sent him flying. Give me another drink or two.\u201d</p><p>Karen shook her head. \u201cSorry, Charlie. I danced until I hit a size sixteen. Now I consider it wise to keep my ass as still as possible.\u201d</p><p>Claire stood up. \u201cCome on, Charlotte. You\u2019re not as damn old as these two. You want to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019d love to.\u201d She plopped her purse onto her chair and followed Claire to the dance floor. All around them, couples dressed in denim were dancing in patterns. A woman pirouetted past them, mouthing 1-2-3 along the way. She clearly needed all of her concentration skills to keep up with her partner\u2019s moves.</p><p>Claire let the music pour over her like cool water on a hot summer\u2019s day. It refreshed her, rejuvenated her. The minute she started to move in time with it, to swing her hips and stamp her feet and clap her hands, she remembered how much she loved this. She couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d let so many quiet years accumulate.</p><p>The music swept her away and peeled back the layer of motherhood years. She and Charlotte became their teenage selves again, laughing, bumping hips, singing out loud to each other. The next song was \u201cSweet Home Alabama,\u201d and they had to stay for that one. Next came \u201cMargaritaville.\u201d</p><p>By the time the band took a break, Claire was damp with perspiration and out of breath. A tiny headache had flared behind her left eye; she stuck a hand in her pocket and found an Excedrin.</p><p>Charlotte pushed the hair out of her eyes. \u201cThat was great. Johnny and I haven\u2019t danced since . . .\u201d She frowned. \u201cJeez. Maybe not since our wedding. That\u2019s what happens when you try like hell to get pregnant. Romance hits the road.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. \u201cBelieve me, honey, it\u2019s after you get knocked up that romance changes ZIP codes. I haven\u2019t had a decent date in years. Come on. I\u2019m so dehydrated I feel like a piece of beef jerky.\u201d</p><p>Char nodded toward the back. \u201cI need to use the rest room first. Order me another margarita. And tell Karen this round is on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Claire started to head for the table, then remembered the aspirin in her fist. She went to the bar instead and asked for a glass of tap water.</p><p>When the water came, she swallowed the single pill, then turned away from the bar. As she started to head back to the table, she saw a man walk onto the stage. He carried a guitar\u2014a regular, old-fashioned guitar that didn\u2019t plug in or amp out. The rest of the band had left the stage, but their instruments were still there.</p><p>He sat down easily on a rickety bar stool. One black cowboy boot was planted firmly on the floor, the other rested on the stool\u2019s bottom rung. He wore a pair of faded, torn jeans and a black T-shirt. His hair was almost shoulder length, and shone blond in the fluorescent overhead lighting. He was looking down at his guitar, and though a black Stetson shielded most of his face, Claire could make out the strong, high bones that defined his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d seen a man who was so good-looking.</p><p>Not in Hayden, that was for sure.</p><p>Men like him didn\u2019t show up in backwater towns. This was a fact she\u2019d learned long ago. The Toms, the Brads, the Georges of this world lived in Hollywood or Manhattan, and when they traveled, they stood behind blank-eyed bodyguards in ill-fitting black suits. They talked about meeting \u201creal people,\u201d but they never actually did it. She knew this because they\u2019d once filmed an action movie in Snohomish. Claire had begged her father to take her down to watch the filming. Not one of the stars had spoken to the locals.</p><p>The man leaned toward the microphone. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fill in while the band takes a short break. I hope y\u2019all don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>A round of lackluster applause followed his words.</p><p>Claire pushed through the crowd, elbowing past a young man in skintight Wrangler jeans and a Stetson as big as a bathtub.</p><p>She halted at the edge of the dance floor.</p><p>He strummed a few notes on the guitar and started to sing. At first, his voice was uncertain, almost too soft to be heard above the raucous, booze-soaked din.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Claire was surprised to hear the words spoken out loud; she\u2019d meant only to think them.</p><p>She felt ridiculously conspicuous, standing there in front of the crowd, only a few feet away from him, but she couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>In the smoky darkness, with a dozen people crammed in beside her, Claire thought he was looking at her.</p><p>Slowly, he smiled.</p><p>Once, years ago, Claire had been running along the dock at Lake Crescent behind her sister. One minute, she\u2019d been laughing and upright; the next second, she was in the freezing cold water, gasping for breath and clawing her way to the surface.</p><p>That was how she felt right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bobby Austin,\u201d he said softly, still looking at her. \u201cThis song is for The One. Y\u2019all know what I mean. The one I\u2019ve been lookin\u2019 for all my life.\u201d</p><p>His long, tanned fingers strummed the guitar strings. Then he started to sing. His voice was low and smoky, seductive as hell, and the song had a sad and haunting quality that made Claire think of all the roads she hadn\u2019t taken in her life. She found herself swaying in time to the music, dancing all by herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the song ended, he set down the guitar and stood up. The crowd clapped politely, then turned away, heading back to their pitchers of beer and buffalo wings.</p><p>He walked toward Claire. She couldn\u2019t seem to move.</p><p>Directly in front of her he stopped. She fought the urge to look behind her, to see if he was actually looking at someone else.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything, she said, \u201cI\u2019m Claire Cavenaugh.\u201d</p> <p>A smile hitched one side of his mouth, but it was strangely sad. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say what I\u2019m thinking without sounding like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s heart was beating so fast she felt dizzy. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He closed the distance between them, small as it had been. Now he was so near she could see the gold flecks in his green eyes, and the tiny half-moon-shaped scar at the edge of his upper lip. She could see, too, that he trimmed his hair himself; the ends were uneven and sloppy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m The One,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThe one what?\u201d She tried to smile. \u201cThe way? The light? There is no way to Heaven but through you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo joking. I\u2019m the one you\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d</p><p>She ought to have laughed at him, told him she hadn\u2019t heard that corny a pick-up line since the year she tried shaping her eyebrows with a Lady Bic.</p><p>She was thirty-five years old. Long past her believing-in-love-at-first-sight years. All of that was what she meant to say, the response she framed in her head. But when she opened her mouth, she heard her heart speak. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, I\u2019ve been lookin\u2019 for you, too.\u201d</p><p>Claire took a tiny step backward; just far enough so that she could breathe her own air.</p><p>She wanted to laugh at him. She really did.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Claire Cavenaugh,\u201d he said softly. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>SOME MARRIAGES ENDED WITH BITTER WORDS AND UGLY epithets, others with copious tears and whispered apologies; each proceeding was different. The one constant was sadness. Win, lose, or draw, when the judge\u2019s gavel rang out on the wooden bench, Meghann always felt chilled. The death of a woman\u2019s dream was a cold, cold thing, and it was a fact, well known in Family Court, that no woman who\u2019d gone through a divorce ever saw the world\u2014or love\u2014in quite the same way again.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Meghann asked May.</p><p>Her client sat rigidly upright, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. To an outside observer, she might have appeared serene, almost unconcerned about the heartbreaking drama that had just played out in this courtroom.</p><p>Meghann knew better. She knew that May was close to the breaking point. Only sheer force of will kept her from screaming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d May said, her breathing shallow. That was common, actually. In times like these, women often began Lamaze-type breathing.</p><p>Meghann touched May\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go next door and get something to eat, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFood,\u201d was May\u2019s reply, neither an agreement to nor a rejection of the idea.</p><p>In the front of the courtroom, the judge stood up. She smiled at Meghann; then at George Gutterson, the opposing counsel; then left the courtroom.</p><p>Meghann helped May to her feet. She held on to her arm to keep her steady as they headed toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d</p><p>Meghann heard May\u2019s sharply indrawn breath, felt her client\u2019s body tense. May stumbled to a halt.</p><p>Dale Monroe surged forward. His face was a deep, purply red. A blue vein throbbed down the middle of his forehead.</p><p>\u201cDale,\u201d George said, reaching for his client. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dale shook his lawyer\u2019s arm away and kept coming.</p><p>Meghann sidestepped easily, putting herself between Dale and May. \u201cStep back, Mr. Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Monroe, you avaricious bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent word usage. You must have gone to a good liberal arts college. Now, please, step back.\u201d She could feel May trembling behind her, breathing too fast. \u201cGet your client out of my face, George.\u201d</p><p>George lifted his hands, palms up. \u201cHe isn\u2019t listening to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took my children away from me,\u201d Dale said, looking right at Meghann.</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting that I was the one who fraudulently transferred assets out of my wife\u2019s reach . . . or that I stole money and equity from my family?\u201d She took a step toward him. \u201cOr wait. Maybe you\u2019re suggesting that I was the one who banged my daughter\u2019s piano teacher every Tuesday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>He paled. It made that vein look even more pronounced. He edged sideways, tried to make eye contact with his wife.</p><p>Ex-wife.</p><p>\u201cMay, come on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know me better than that. I didn\u2019t do all of those things. I would have given you everything you asked for. But the kids . . . I can\u2019t see them only on weekends and two weeks in the summer.\u201d</p><p>He sounded sincere, actually. If Meghann hadn\u2019t seen the ugly truth in black and white, she might have believed he was upset about the children.</p><p>She spoke quickly, so May wouldn\u2019t have to. \u201cThe separation of your assets was entirely fair and equitable, Dr. Monroe. The custody issues were also fairly resolved, and when you calm down, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree. We all read the depositions that reflected your lifestyle. You were gone in the morning by six A.M.\u2014before the children woke up\u2014and you rarely returned home before ten P.M.\u2014after they were in bed. Weekends you spent with the guys, playing golf and poker. Hell, you\u2019ll probably see your children more now than you did while you resided at the family home.\u201d Meghann smiled, pleased with herself. That had been a smart, well-thought-out argument. He couldn\u2019t disagree. She glanced at George, who stood silently beside his client. The attorney looked like he was going to be sick.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d Dale whispered harshly, taking a step toward her. At his sides, his fingers curled into fists.</p><p>\u201cYou going to hit me, Dale? Go ahead. Lose what little custody you have.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>She took a step toward him. \u201cAnd if you ever hit May again, or even touch her too hard, you\u2019ll find yourself back in this courtroom, only it won\u2019t be money at risk. It\u2019ll be your freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Her gaze found his. \u201cYes. I am. Are we clear on that? You stay the hell away from my client or I\u2019ll make sure your life turns into a shower scene from Oz. And I don\u2019t mean Munchkinland. Every other Friday you can park in front of the house and wait for the kids to come out. You return them on time, as stipulated, and that\u2019s the sum of your contact with May. We\u2019re all clear on that, right?\u201d</p><p>May touched her arm, leaned close, and whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Meghann heard the tired strain in May\u2019s voice. It reminded Meghann of her own divorce. She\u2019d tried so hard to be strong, but the moment she\u2019d stepped out of the courtroom, she\u2019d broken like an old drawbridge, just crumbled. There was a big part of her that had never stood upright again.</p><p>She grabbed her briefcase off the oak library table and slipped her other arm around May\u2019s waist. Linked together, they walked out of the courtroom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this, you bitch,\u201d Dale screamed to their backs. Then something crashed against the floor.</p><p>Meghann guessed it was the other oak table.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look back. Instead, she kept a steadying hand on May\u2019s waist and led her to the elevator. In the small cubicle, they stood side by side.</p><p>The moment the door closed, May burst into tears.</p><p>Meghann held May\u2019s hand, squeezing it gently. \u201cI know it seems impossible now, but life will get better. I promise. Not instantly, not even quickly, but it will get better.\u201d</p><p>She led May down the courthouse steps and outside. The sky was heavy and gray with clouds. A dismal rain spit itself along the car-clogged streets. The sun was nowhere to be seen. No doubt it had followed the geese south, to places like Florida and California. It wouldn\u2019t return to western Washington full-time until after the Fourth of July.</p><p>They walked down Third Street to the Judicial Annex, the favorite lunch spot for the Family Court gang.</p><p>By the time they reached the front door, Meghann\u2019s suit was more than a little damp. Gray streaks marred the collar of her white silk blouse. If there was one accessory no local owned, it was an umbrella.</p><p>\u201cHey, Meg,\u201d said a few colleagues as she walked through the restaurant to an empty table at the back. She pulled out a chair for May, then sat down opposite her.</p><p>Within moments, a harried-looking waitress was beside them. She pulled a pencil out from her ponytail. \u201cIs this a champagne or a martini day?\u201d she asked Meghann.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely champagne. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>May looked across the table at her. \u201cWe aren\u2019t really going to drink champagne, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay. You are now a millionaire. Your children can get Ph.D.s from Harvard if they want. You have a beautiful waterfront home in Medina and no mortgage payment. Dale, on the other hand, is living in a thirteen-hundred-square-foot condo in Kirkland. And you got full custody of the kids. Hell yes, we\u2019re celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life has been hit by a Scud missile. The man I love is gone. Now I find out he might have existed only in my mind, anyway. I have to live with the fact that not only am I alone, but, apparently, I\u2019ve been stupid, too. My children will have to live all their lives knowing that families break, that love is impermanent, and, most of all, that promises get broken. They\u2019ll go on, of course. That\u2019s what children and women do\u2014we go on. But we won\u2019t ever be quite whole again. I\u2019ll have money. Big fat deal. You have money, I assume. Do you sleep with it at night? Does it hold you when you\u2019ve awakened from a nightmare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Dale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long time ago, yes. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the man I keep remembering.\u201d May looked down at her hand. At the wedding ring on her finger. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m bleeding. And there you sit. Drinking champagne.\u201d She looked up again. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can be a harsh job,\u201d she answered truthfully. \u201cSometimes, the only way I can get through it is\u2014\u201d</p><p>A commotion broke out in the restaurant. Glass shattered. A table crashed to the floor. A woman screamed.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d May breathed. Her face was pale.</p><p>Meghann frowned. \u201cWhat in the\u2014?\u201d She turned around in her chair.</p><p>Dale stood in the open doorway, holding a gun in his left hand. When Meghann looked at him, he smiled and stepped over a fallen chair. But there was no humor in that smile; in fact, he appeared to be crying.</p><p>Or maybe that was the rain.</p><p>\u201cPut down the gun, Dale.\u201d She was surprised to hear the calmness in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYour turn at the mike is over, counselor.\u201d</p><p>A woman in a black pinstripe suit crawled across the floor. She moved slowly until she made it to the door. Then she got up and ran.</p><p>Dale either didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t care. He only had eyes for Meghann. \u201cYou ruined my life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPut the gun down, Dale. You don\u2019t want to do something stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did something stupid.\u201d His voice broke, and Meghann saw that he was crying. \u201cI had an affair and got greedy and forgot how much I love my wife.\u201d</p><p>May started to get to her feet. Meghann grabbed her, forced her down, then stood up herself.</p><p>She raised her hands into the air. Her heart was a jackhammer trying to crack through her rib cage. \u201cCome on, Dale. Put the gun down. We\u2019ll get you some help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere was all your help when I tried to tell my wife how sorry I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake. I\u2019m sorry. This time we\u2019ll all sit down and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know how screwed I am? Believe me, lady, I know.\u201d His voice caught again. Tears rolled down his cheeks. \u201cJesus, May, how did I get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale,\u201d Meghann said his name in a calm, even voice. \u201cI know how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. It\u2019s your fault, you bitch. You\u2019re the one who did all of this.\u201d He raised the gun, aimed, and pulled the trigger.</p> <p>Joe awoke with a fever and a stinging throat. A dry, hacking cough brought him upright before he\u2019d even fully opened his eyes. When it was over, he sat there, bleary-eyed, in desperate need of some water.</p><p>A glittering layer of frost coated his sleeping bag, its presence a testament to the altitude. Though the days in this part of the state were as hot as hell, the nights were cold.</p><p>He coughed again, then climbed out of the sleeping bag. His fingers were trembling as he rolled up the bag and tied it onto his backpack. He stumbled out of the still-dark forest and emerged molelike and blinking into a sunny day. Already the sun was angry as it climbed the cloudless sky.</p><p>Joe dug the toothbrush, soap, and toothpaste out of his pack and, squatting by the rushing rapids of Icicle Creek, readied himself for the day.</p><p>By the time he finished, he was breathing hard, as if the exertion of brushing his teeth was on par with running the Boston Marathon.</p><p>He stared at himself in the river. Though his reflection wavered in the current, the clear water captured his image in surprising detail. His hair was far too long and as tangled as the underbrush that had formed his bed for the last two nights. A thick beard covered the lower half of his face; it was a quiltlike combination of gray and black. His eyelids hung low, as if in tired defeat.</p> <p>And today was his birthday. His forty-third.</p><p>In another time\u2014another life\u2014this would have been a day for celebration, for family. Diana had always loved a party; she\u2019d throw one at the drop of a hat. The year he\u2019d turned thirty-eight, she\u2019d rented the Space Needle and hired a Bruce Springsteen impersonator to sing the soundtrack of their youth. The place had been packed with friends. Everyone wanted to celebrate Joe\u2019s birthday with him.</p><p>Then.</p><p>With a sigh, he pushed to his feet. A quick check of his wallet and pockets revealed that he was nearly broke again. The money he\u2019d made last week mowing lawns had all but disappeared.</p><p>Slinging his backpack into place, he followed the winding river out of the National Forest. By the time he reached Highway 2, he was sweating so hard he had to keep wiping his eyes. His forehead was on fire. He knew he had a fever. One hundred degrees, at least.</p><p>He stared at the black river of asphalt that flowed down to the tiny town of Leavenworth. On either side, spindly green pine trees stood guard.</p><p>Town was only a mile or so away. From this distance, he could see the Bavarian-themed buildings, the stoplights and billboards. It was, he knew, the kind of town that sold handmade Christmas ornaments year-round and had a quaint bed-and-breakfast on every corner. The kind of place that welcomed tourists and visitors with open arms.</p><p>Unless you looked or smelled like Joe.</p> <p>Still, he was too tired to walk uphill, so he turned toward town. His feet hurt and his stomach ached. He hadn\u2019t had a good meal in several days. Yesterday, he\u2019d survived on unripe apples and the last of his beef jerky.</p><p>By the time he reached town, his headache was almost unbearable. For two hours, he went from door to door trying to find temporary work.</p><p>There was nothing.</p><p>Finally, at the Chevron station, he spent his last two dollars on aspirin, which he washed down with water from the rusty sink in the public rest room. Afterward, he stood in the candy aisle, staring blindly at the products.</p><p>Corn Nuts would be good now . . .</p><p>Or barbecue potato chips.</p><p>Or\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou gotta get a move on, Mister,\u201d said the young man behind the cash register. He wore a tattered brown T-shirt that read: We interrupt this marriage to bring you elk-hunting season. \u201cUnless you\u2019re gonna buy something else.\u201d</p><p>Joe glanced up at the clock, surprised to see that he\u2019d been there more than an hour. Nodding at the kid, he took his canteen into the rest room and filled it with water, then used the facilities and headed out. At the cash register, he paused. Careful not to make eye contact, he asked if there was a place he could find part-time work.</p><p>\u201cThe Darrington farm hires transients sometimes. Usually at harvesttime. I dunno about now. And the Whiskey Creek Lodge needs maintenance men during the salmon run.\u201d</p><p>Picking fruit or gutting fish. He\u2019d done plenty of both in the past three years. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. You look sick.\u201d The kid frowned. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Thanks.\u201d Joe kept moving, afraid that if he stopped for too long he\u2019d stumble, then fall. He\u2019d wake up in a hospital bed or on a jail-cell cot. He wasn\u2019t sure which fate was worse. Each brought too many bad memories.</p><p>He was outside the mini mart, unsteady on his feet, trying to will the aspirin to take effect when the first raindrop hit. It was big and fat and splatted right in his eye. He tilted his chin up, saw the sudden blackness of the sky overhead.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Before he finished the word, the storm hit. A pounding rain that seemed to nail him in place.</p><p>He closed his eyes and dropped his chin.</p><p>Now his flu would escalate into pneumonia. Another night outside in wet clothes would seal it.</p><p>And suddenly he couldn\u2019t live like this anymore. He was sick and tired of being sick and tired.</p><p>Home.</p><p>The idea came to him like a balmy breeze, took him far away from this ugly spot in the driving rain. He closed his eyes and thought of the small town where he\u2019d been raised, where he\u2019d played shortstop for the local ball team and worked at a garage after school and every summer until he went away to college. If any town would still accept him after what he\u2019d done, it would be that one.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Moving slowly, his emotions a convoluted mixture of fear and anticipation, he went to the phone booth and stepped inside its quiet enclosure. Now the rain was only noise; it was like his heartbeat: fast, breathless.</p><p>He let out a long breath, then picked up the phone, punched 0 and placed a collect call.</p><p>\u201cHey, little sister,\u201d he said when she answered. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. It\u2019s about damn time. I\u2019ve been worried sick about you, Joey. You haven\u2019t called in\u2014what? Eight months? And then you sounded awful.\u201d</p><p>He remembered that call. He\u2019d been in Sedona. The whole town had seemed to be draped in crystals and waiting for otherworld contact. He\u2019d thought Diana had called him there, but of course she hadn\u2019t. It had just been another town to pass through. He\u2019d called his sister on her birthday. Back then, he\u2019d thought he\u2019d be home any day. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She sighed again, and he could picture her perfectly: standing at her kitchen counter, probably making a list of things to do\u2014shopping, carpool, swimming lessons. He doubted she\u2019d changed much in the last three years, but he wished he knew for sure. Missing her blossomed into an ache; it was the reason he never called. It hurt too much. \u201cHow\u2019s my beautiful niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>He heard something in her voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, then more softly. \u201cI could use my big brother right about now, that\u2019s all. Has it been long enough?\u201d</p><p>There it was, the question upon which everything rested. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m tired, I know that. Have people forgotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get asked so much anymore.\u201d</p><p>So some had forgotten, but not everyone. If he returned, the memory would tag along. He didn\u2019t know if he was strong enough to stand up to his past. He hadn\u2019t been when it was his present.</p><p>\u201cCome home, Joey. It has to be time. You can\u2019t hide forever. And . . . I need you.\u201d</p><p>He heard the sound of her crying; it was soft and broken and it pulled something out of him. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m chopping onions for dinner.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cYour niece is going through a spaghetti phase. She won\u2019t eat anything else.\u201d She tried to laugh.</p><p>Joe appreciated the attempt at normalcy, however forced.</p><p>\u201cMake her some of Mom\u2019s spaghetti. That should end it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cGosh, I\u2019d forgotten. Hers was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than her meat loaf.\u201d</p><p>After that, a silence slipped through the lines. Softly, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to forgive yourself, Joey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things are unforgivable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen at least come home. People care about you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to. I can\u2019t . . . live like this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s what this phone call means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too.\u201d</p><p>It was that rarest of days in downtown Seattle. Hot and humid. A smoggy haze hung over the city, reminding everyone that too many cars zipped down too many highways in this once-pristine corner of the country. There was no breeze. Puget Sound was as flat as a summer lake. Even the mountains appeared smaller, as if they, too, had been beaten down by the unexpected heat.</p><p>If it was hot outside, it was sweltering in the courthouse. An old air-conditioning unit sat awkwardly in an open window, making soft, strangled noises. A white flap of ribbon, tied to the frontpiece, fluttered every now and then, defeated.</p><p>Meghann stared down at the yellow legal pad in front of her. A neat stack of black pens were lined up along one side. The desktop, scarred by decades of clients and attorneys, wobbled on uneven legs.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t written a word.</p><p>That surprised her. Usually her pen was the only thing that worked as fast as her brain.</p><p>\u201cMs. Dontess. Ahem. Ms. Dontess.\u201d</p><p>The judge was speaking to her.</p><p>She blinked slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She got to her feet and automatically smoothed the hair back from her face. But she\u2019d worn it back this morning, in a French twist.</p><p>The judge, a thin, heronlike woman with no collar peeking out from the black vee of her robes, was frowning. \u201cWhat are your thoughts on this?\u201d</p><p>Meghann felt a flare of worry, almost panic. She looked again at her blank legal pad. Her right hand started to shake. The expensive pen fell from her fingers and clattered on the table.</p><p>\u201cApproach the bench,\u201d said the judge.</p><p>Meghann didn\u2019t glance to her left. She didn\u2019t want to make eye contact with her opposing counsel. She was weak right now\u2014shaking, for God\u2019s sake\u2014and everyone knew it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tried to look confident; perhaps it worked. As she crossed the wooden floor, she heard her heels clacking with each step. The sound was like an exclamation mark on the sentence of her every breath.</p><p>At the high oak bench, she stopped and looked up. It took an act of will to keep her hands open and at her sides. \u201cYes, Your Honor?\u201d Her voice, thank God, sounded normal. Strong.</p><p>The judge leaned forward to say softly, \u201cWe all know what happened last week, Meghann. That bullet missed you by inches. Are you certain you\u2019re ready to be back in a courtroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Meghann\u2019s voice was softer now. Her right hand was trembling.</p> <p>The judge frowned down at her, then cleared her throat and nodded. \u201cStep back.\u201d</p><p>Meghann headed back to the desk. John Heinreid stepped in beside her. They\u2019d tried dozens of cases against each other. They often shared a glass of wine and a plate of oysters after a long day in court.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay? I\u2019d be willing to shove this back a few days.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cThanks, John. I\u2019m fine.\u201d She went back to the table, slid into her seat.</p><p>Her client, a Mercer Island housewife who couldn\u2019t possibly live on nineteen thousand dollars a month, stared at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she mouthed, twisting the gold chain of her Chanel handbag.</p> <p>Meghann shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll restate, Your Honor,\u201d John said. \u201cMy client would like to stay these proceedings for a short time so that he and Mrs. Miller can obtain counseling. There are, after all, small children involved. He\u2019d like to give the marriage every opportunity to succeed.\u201d</p><p>Meghann heard her client whisper, \u201cNo way,\u201d as she planted her hands on the desk and slowly rose.</p><p>Her mind went blank. She couldn\u2019t think of a single argument. When she closed her eyes, trying to concentrate, she heard a different voice, gruff and desperate. It\u2019s your fault, you bitch. Then she saw the gun pointed at her, heard an echoed blast. When she opened her eyes, everyone was looking at her. Had she flinched or cried out? Shit. She didn\u2019t know. \u201cMy client believes that the marriage is irretrievably broken, Your Honor. She sees no benefit to counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo benefit?\u201d John argued. \u201cCertainly, after fifteen years of living together, it couldn\u2019t hurt to spend a few hours with a therapist. My client believes that the children\u2019s welfare should be paramount here. He\u2019s merely asking for an opportunity to save his family.\u201d</p><p>Meghann turned to her client. \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable request, Celene,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou won\u2019t look good if we fight this battle in front of the judge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. I guess . . .\u201d Celene frowned.</p><p>Meghann returned her attention to the bench. \u201cWe\u2019d ask for a time limit and a follow-up court date to be set now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s acceptable to us, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>Meghann stood there, a little unsteady on her feet as the details were worked out. Her right hand was still trembling and a tic had begun spasming in her left eyelid. On autopilot, she packed up her briefcase.</p><p>\u201cWait. What just happened?\u201d Celene whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe agreed to counseling. A few months or so. No more. Maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCounseling? We\u2019ve tried counseling\u2014or did you forget that? We\u2019ve also tried hypnosis and romantic vacations and even a weeklong couples\u2019 self-help seminar. None of it worked. And do you know why?\u201d</p><p>Meghann had forgotten all of that. The information that should have been at her fingertips had vanished. \u201cOh\u201d was all she could manage.</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work because he doesn\u2019t love me,\u201d Celene\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cMr. Computer Software likes male prostitutes, remember? Blow jobs under the Viaduct and in X-rated theaters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Celene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry? Sorry. My children and I need to start over, not relive the same old shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll fix this. I promise I will.\u201d And she could. A phone call to John Heinreid that threatened to reveal Mr. Miller\u2019s preferred sex partners and it\u2019d be handled instantly. Quietly.</p><p>Celene sighed. \u201cLook, I know what happened last week. It was on every channel. I feel sorry for that lady\u2014and for you. I know that husband tried to kill you. But I need to worry about myself. For once. Can you understand that?\u201d</p><p>For a terrible moment, Meghann thought she was going to lose it. How in God\u2019s name had she glanced at Celene Miller and seen just another pampered, spoiled housewife? \u201cYou should be taking care of yourself first. I did you a disservice in here. I screwed up. But I\u2019ll fix it, and you won\u2019t be paying a dime for this divorce. Okay? Can you trust me again?\u201d</p><p>Celene\u2019s frown released. \u201cTrusting people has always been easy for me. It\u2019s part of why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch up with John right now. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow about what I came up with.\u201d</p><p>Celene tried valiantly to smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Meghann put a hand down on the desk to steady herself as she stood there, watching her client walk out of the courtroom. When Celene was gone, Meghann sighed heavily. She hadn\u2019t realized that she\u2019d been holding her breath.</p><p>She reached for her yellow pad, noticed her trembling fingers and thought: What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>A hand pressed against her shoulder, and she jumped at the contact.</p><p>\u201cMeg?\u201d</p><p>It was Julie Gorset, her partner.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jules. Tell me you weren\u2019t in the courtroom today.\u201d</p><p>Julie looked at her sadly. \u201cI was. And we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The Pike Place Public Market was wall-to-wall people on a sunny summer\u2019s day. Now, at nighttime, it was quiet. Sweaty vendors in gauzy clothes were busy packing up their homemade crafts and loading them onto trucks parked outside on the cobblestone street. The night air rang out with the ping-ping-ping of delivery trucks in reverse gear.</p><p>Meghann stood outside the Athenian\u2019s open door. The bar was hazy with cigarette smoke; the expansive Puget Sound view sparkled in the few open spaces between patrons. There were at least two dozen people at the bar, no doubt shooting oysters\u2014drinking them raw from a glass jigger. It was a house tradition.</p><p>She glanced from table to table. There were plenty of possibilities. Single men in expensive suits and college boys in cutoff shorts that showed their lean torsos and checkered boxers.</p><p>She could go in there, put on her kiss me smile and find someone to spend time with her. For a few blessed hours, she could be part of a couple, no matter how false and fragile that pairing might be. At least she wouldn\u2019t have to think. Or feel.</p><p>She started to take a step forward. Her toe caught on the threshold and she stumbled sideways, skimming the door\u2019s side.</p><p>And suddenly, all she could think about was what would really happen. She\u2019d meet some guy whose name wouldn\u2019t matter, let him touch her body and crawl inside of her . . . and then be left more alone than when she\u2019d started.</p><p>The tic in her left eye started again.</p><p>She reached into her handbag and pulled out her cell phone. She\u2019d already left a desperate-sounding call me message on Elizabeth\u2019s answering machine, when she remembered that her friend was in Paris.</p><p>There was no one else to call. Unless . . .</p><p>Don\u2019t do it.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t think of anywhere else to turn.</p><p>She punched in the number, biting down on her lip as it rang. She was just about to hang up when a voice answered.</p><p>\u201cHello? Hello?\u201d Then: \u201cMeghann. I recognize your cell phone number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sue whoever invented Caller ID. It\u2019s ruined the time-honored tradition of hanging up on someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eight thirty at night. Why are you calling me?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cMy left eyelid is flapping like a flag on the Fourth of July. I need a prescription for a muscle relaxer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about a delayed reaction, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Post-traumatic stress. I thought you meant I\u2019d get depressed; not that my eyelid would try to fly off my face. And . . . my hands are shaking. It would not be a good week to start quilting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>Meghann considered lying, but Harriet had ears like a bloodhound; she could probably hear the bar noises. \u201cOutside of the Athenian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be in my office in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. If you could just call in a prescription\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy office. Thirty minutes. If you aren\u2019t there, I\u2019ll come looking for you. And nothing scares off drunk college boys like an angry shrink named Harriet. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Honestly, Meghann was relieved. Harriet might be a pain in the ass, but at least she was someone to talk to. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Meghann hung up the phone and put it back in her purse. It took her less than fifteen minutes to get to Harriet\u2019s office. The doorman let her in and, after a short question-and-answer routine, pointed to the elevator. She rode up to the fourth floor and stood outside the glass-doored office.</p><p>At precisely 9:00, Harriet showed up, looking rushed and poorly put together. Her normally smoothed black hair had been drawn back in a thin headband and her face shone pink without makeup. \u201cIf you make a crack about the headband, I\u2019ll charge you double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Be judgmental? You must be joking.\u201d</p><p>Harriet smiled at that. They\u2019d often discussed avid judgmentalism as one of Meghann\u2019s many flaws. \u201cI had to choose between being on time and looking decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly, you\u2019re on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet inside.\u201d Harriet unlocked the door and pushed it open.</p><p>Even now, late at night, the office smelled of fresh flowers and worn leather. The familiarity of it immediately put Meghann at ease. She walked through the reception area and went into Harriet\u2019s large corner office, going over to stand in front of the window. Below her, the city was a grid of moving cars and stoplights.</p><p>Harriet took her usual seat. \u201cSo, you think a prescription will help you.\u201d</p><p>Meghann slowly turned around. Her eyelid was thumping like a metronome. \u201cEither that or a Seeing Eye dog. If the other one starts, I\u2019ll be blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Meghann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. I could go home and finish watching Friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou watch Friends? I would have guessed you tuned in to PBS. Maybe the Discovery Channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Meghann did as she was told. The comfortable chair enfolded her. \u201cI remember when I hated this chair. Now it seems made for me.\u201d</p><p>Harriet steepled her fingers and peered at Meghann over her short, clear-polished nails. \u201cIt was a week ago today, wasn\u2019t it? When your client\u2019s husband tried to shoot you.\u201d</p><p>Meghann\u2019s left foot started to tap. The plush gray carpet swallowed the sound. \u201cYes. The funny thing is, the publicity has gotten me clients. It seems women want a lawyer who makes a man that crazy.\u201d She tried to smile.</p><p>\u201cI told you you needed to deal with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you did. Remind me to put a gold star next to your name on the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Every time I close my eyes, I see it all again. The gunshot whizzing past my ear . . . the way he dropped the gun afterward and sank to his knees . . . May rushing to him, holding him, telling him everything would be all right, that she\u2019d stand behind him . . . the police taking him away in handcuffs. Today, I relived it in court.\u201d She looked up. \u201cThat was lovely, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. He\u2019s the one to blame.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that. I also know that I handled their divorce badly. I\u2019ve lost my ability to really feel for people.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . . if I can do this job anymore. Today I completely screwed a client. My partner has asked me\u2014ordered me, really\u2014to take a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might not be a bad idea. It wouldn\u2019t hurt you to develop a real life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I feel better in London or Rome . . . alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you call Claire? You could go stay at her resort for a while. Maybe try to relax. Get to know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a funny thing about visiting relatives. You need an invitation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you saying Claire wouldn\u2019t want you to visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m saying that. We can\u2019t talk for more than five minutes without getting into an argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could visit your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather contract the West Nile virus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Elizabeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Jack are in Europe, celebrating their anniversary. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d appreciate a guest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is, you have nowhere to go and no one to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I said was, Where would I go?\u201d It had been a mistake to come here. Harriet was making her feel worse. \u201cLook, Harriet,\u201d her voice was softer than usual, and cracked. \u201cI\u2019m falling apart. It\u2019s like I\u2019m losing myself. All I want from you is a drug to take the edge off. You know me, I\u2019ll be fine in a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queen of Denial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen something works for me, I stick with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly denial isn\u2019t working anymore, is it? That\u2019s why your eyelid is spasming, your hands are shaking, and you can\u2019t sleep. You\u2019re breaking apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t break. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeghann, you\u2019re one of the smartest women I\u2019ve ever known. Maybe too smart. You\u2019ve handled a lot of trauma in your life and succeeded. But you can\u2019t keep running away from your own past. Someday you\u2019re going to have to settle the tab with Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA client\u2019s husband tries to blow my brains out, and you manage to make my breakdown about my family. Are you sure you\u2019re really a doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I have to do is mention Claire and the walls go up. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this isn\u2019t about Claire, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooner or later, Meg, it\u2019s always about family. The past has an irritating way of becoming the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once had a fortune cookie that said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re deflecting again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m rejecting.\u201d Meghann got to her feet. \u201cDoes this mean you won\u2019t write me a prescription for a muscle relaxant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t help your tic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll get an eye patch.\u201d</p><p>Harriet slowly stood up. Across the desk, they faced each other. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you let me help you?\u201d</p><p>Meghann swallowed hard. She\u2019d asked herself the same question a hundred times.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Harriet asked finally.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you know the answer, why ask the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to stop feeling so alone.\u201d</p><p>A shudder passed through Meghann, left her chilled. \u201cI\u2019ve always been alone. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not always.\u201d</p><p>Meghann\u2019s thoughts spooled back to those years, so long ago now, when she and Claire had been inseparable, the best of friends. Then, Meg had known how to love.</p><p>Enough. This was getting Meg nowhere.</p><p>Harriet was wrong. This wasn\u2019t about the past. So Meg felt guilty about the way she\u2019d abandoned her sister, and she\u2019d been hurt when Claire rejected her and chose Sam. So what? That water had flowed under the bridge for twenty-six years. She wasn\u2019t likely to drown in it now. \u201cWell, I\u2019m alone now, aren\u2019t I? And I sure as hell better figure out how to get my shit together. Thanks for the help with that, by the way.\u201d She grabbed her purse off the floor and headed for the door. \u201cSend tonight\u2019s bill to my secretary. Charge whatever you want. Good-bye, Harriet.\u201d She said good-bye instead of good night because she didn\u2019t intend to come back.</p><p>She was at the door when Harriet\u2019s voice stopped her.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Meghann. Especially now. Don\u2019t let loneliness consume you.\u201d</p><p>Meghann kept walking, right out the door and into the elevator and across the lobby.</p><p>Outside, she looked down at her watch.</p><p>9:40.</p><p>There was still plenty of time to go to the Athenian.</p><p>NINE</p><p>IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF AN EIGHTEEN-WHEELER, JOE SAT slumped against the window. The truck\u2019s air conditioner had gone out about forty miles ago, and it was as hot as hell in the cab.</p><p>The driver, a long-hauler named Erv, hit the Jake Brakes and shifted gears. The truck groaned and shuddered and began to slow down. \u201cThere\u2019s the Hayden exit.\u201d</p><p>Joe saw the familiar sign and didn\u2019t know how to feel. He hadn\u2019t been here in so long. . . .</p><p>Home.</p><p>No. It was where he\u2019d grown up; home was something else\u2014or, more accurately, someone else\u2014and she wouldn\u2019t be waiting up for him to return.</p><p>The off-ramp looped over the freeway and flattened out onto a tree-lined road. On the left side was a small shingled gas station and a mini mart.</p><p>Erv pulled up in front of the pump and came to a creaking stop. The brakes wheezed loudly and fell silent. \u201cThe store there makes some mighty fine egg-salad samiches, if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d Erv opened his door and got out.</p><p>Joe wedged the handle down and gave the door a good hard push. It creaked wearily open, and he stepped down onto the pavement of western Washington for the first time in three years. He broke out in a cold sweat\u2014whether from the fever or his arrival home, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>He looked at Erv, who was busy pumping gas. \u201cThanks for the ride.\u201d</p><p>Erv nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk much, but you were good company. The road can get lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIt can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to go to Seattle? It\u2019s only an hour and a half away. There ain\u2019t much here.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked down the long, tree-lined road. Though he could only make out the barest hint of town, his memories compensated. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>His sister was just down that road, waiting for him in spite of everything, hoping he\u2019d knock on her door. If he did, if he found that courage, she\u2019d pull him into her arms and hold him so tightly, he\u2019d remember how it felt to be loved.</p><p>The thought galvanized him.</p><p>\u201cBye, Erv.\u201d He slung his backpack over his shoulder and started walking. In no time, he came to the small green sign that welcomed him to Hayden, population 872. Home of Lori Adams, 1974 State Spelling Bee Champion.</p><p>The town where he\u2019d been born, where he\u2019d grown up and moved on from, hadn\u2019t changed at all. It looked precisely as he remembered, a pretty little collection of Western-themed buildings dozing peacefully beneath this warm June sun.</p><p>The buildings all had false fronts, and there were hitching posts stationed here and there along a wooden boardwalk. The stores were mostly the same\u2014the Whitewater Diner and the Basket Case Florist Shoppe, then Mo\u2019s Fireside Tavern and the Stock \u2019Em Up grocery store. Every sign sparked some memory, every doorway had once welcomed him. He\u2019d bagged groceries for old Bill Turman at the grocery store one summer and ordered his first legal beer at Mo\u2019s.</p><p>Once, he\u2019d been welcomed everywhere in town.</p><p>Now . . . who knew?</p><p>He let out a long sigh, trying to understand how he felt at this moment. He\u2019d dreaded and longed for this return for three years, but now that he\u2019d actually come home, he felt curiously numb. Maybe it was the flu. Or the hunger. Certainly a homecoming ought to be sharper. Returning after so long an absence, after all that he had done.</p><p>He made a valiant effort to feel.</p><p>But nothing seized hold of him, and so he began to walk again, past the four-way stop sign that introduced the start of town, past the Loose Screw Hardware Shop and the family-owned bakery.</p><p>He felt people looking at him; it beat him down, those looks that turned into frowns of recognition. Whispers followed him, nipped at his heels.</p><p>Jesus, is that Joe Wyatt?</p><p>Did you see that, Myrtle? It was Joe Wyatt.</p><p>He\u2019s got some nerve\u2014</p><p>How long has it been?</p><p>Every one made him hunch a little farther. He tucked his chin close to his chest, rammed his hands in his pockets, and kept moving.</p><p>On Azalea Street, he veered left, then, on Cascade he turned right.</p><p>Finally, he could breathe again. Here, only a few blocks from Main Street, the world was quiet again. Quaint wood-framed houses sat on impeccably trimmed lawns, one after another for a few blocks, and then the signs of inhabitation grew sparse.</p><p>By the time he reached Rhododendron Lane, the street was almost completely deserted. He walked past Craven Farms, quiet this time of year before the fall harvest, and then turned into the driveway. Now the mailbox said Trainor. For years and years, it had read: Wyatt.</p><p>The house was a sprawling log-built A-frame that was set amid a perfectly landscaped yard. A mossy split-rail fence outlined the property. Flowers bloomed everywhere, bright and vibrant, and glossy green boxwoods had been shaped into a rounded hedge that paralleled the fencing. His father had built this house by hand, log by log. One of the last things Dad had said to them, as he lay in his hospital bed dying of a broken heart, was: Take care of the house. Your mother loved it so . . .</p><p>Joe felt a sudden tightening in his throat, a sadness almost too sweet to bear. His sister had done as she\u2019d been asked. She\u2019d kept the house looking exactly as it always had. Mom and Dad would be pleased.</p><p>Something caught his eye. He looked up, caught a fluttering, incorporeal glimpse of a young woman on the porch, dressed in flowing white as she giggled and ran away. The image was shadowy and indistinct and heartbreaking.</p><p>Diana.</p><p>It was a memory; only that.</p><p>Halloween. Nineteen ninety-seven. They\u2019d come here to take his niece trick-or-treating for the first time. In her Galadriel costume, Diana had looked about twenty-five years old.</p><p>Someday soon, she\u2019d whispered that night, clinging to his hand, we\u2019ll take our own child trick-or-treating. Only a few months later, they found out why they\u2019d been unable to conceive. . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stumbled, came to a stop at the bottom of the porch steps, and glanced back down the road, thinking, Maybe I should turn around.</p><p>The memories here would ruin what little peace he\u2019d been able to find. . . .</p><p>No.</p><p>He\u2019d found no peace out there.</p> <p>He climbed the steps, hearing the familiar creaking of the boards underfoot. After a long pause in which he found himself listening to the rapid hammering of his heart, he knocked on the door.</p><p>For a moment, there was no sound within; then the clattering of heavy-soled shoes and the called-out \u201cComing!\u201d</p><p>The door swung open. Gina stood there, dressed in baggy black sweats and green rubber clogs, breathing hard. Her cheeks were bright pink, her chestnut brown hair a bird\u2019s nest of disarray. She took one look at him, mouthed Oh, then burst into tears. \u201cJoey\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pulled him into her arms. For a moment, he was dazed, too confused to respond. He hadn\u2019t been touched in so long, it felt wrong somehow.</p><p>\u201cJoey,\u201d she said again, putting her face in the crook of his neck. He felt her warm tears on his skin and something inside of him gave way. He brought his arms around her and held on. The whole of his childhood came back to him then, drifted on the baking-bread smell of the house and the sweet citrusy scent of her shampoo. He remembered building her a stick fort by the fish pond long after he\u2019d outgrown it himself, and baby-sitting her on Saturday mornings and walking her home from school. Though they were seven years apart in age, they\u2019d always been a pair.</p> <p>She drew back, sniffling, wiping her red-rimmed eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d really come back.\u201d She patted her hair and made a face. \u201cOh, shit, I look like the undead. I was planting flowers in the backyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said, meaning it.</p><p>\u201cPretend that Grandma Hester\u2019s ass hasn\u2019t moved onto my body.\u201d She reached out for him, took hold of his hand, and dragged him into the sunlit living room.</p><p>\u201cI should take a shower before I sit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d Gina sat down on a beautiful butter-yellow sofa and pulled him down beside her.</p><p>He felt uncomfortable suddenly, out of place. He could smell his own scent, feel the clammy dampness of his skin.</p> <p>\u201cYou look sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. My head is pounding.\u201d</p><p>Gina popped up and hurried from the room. All the while she was gone, she talked to him from another room. No doubt she was afraid he\u2019d vanish again.</p><p>\u201c\u2014some water,\u201d she called out, \u201cand aspirin.\u201d</p><p>He started to say something\u2014he had no idea what\u2014when he saw the photo on the mantel.</p><p>He got slowly to his feet and walked toward it.</p><p>The photograph was of five women crowded together; four of them wore matching pink dresses. They were all smiling broadly and holding up wineglasses, most of which, he noticed, were empty. Gina was front and center, the only woman in white. Diana was beside her, laughing.</p><p>\u201cHey, Di,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of my favorite pictures,\u201d Gina said, coming up behind him.</p><p>\u201cAt the end,\u201d he said softly, \u201cshe talked about you guys. The Bluesers. She must have told me a hundred Lake Chelan stories.\u201d</p><p>Gina squeezed his shoulder. \u201cWe all miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find it out there . . . whatever you were looking for?\u201d</p><p>He thought about that. \u201cNo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cBut now that I\u2019m here, I want to be gone again. Everywhere I look, I\u2019ll see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me that wasn\u2019t true out there, too.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. His sister was right. It didn\u2019t matter where he was. Diana filled his thoughts, his dreams. Finally, he turned around and looked down at his sister. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home. That counts for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost, Gigi. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in the ice. I can\u2019t move. I don\u2019t know how to start over.\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? You already have. You\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand over hers and stared down at her, trying to think of something to say. Nothing came to mind, so he tried to smile instead. \u201cWhere\u2019s my beautiful niece? And my brother-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonnie\u2019s over at River\u2019s Edge, playing with Ali.\u201d</p><p>Joe frowned, took a step back. \u201cAnd Rex? He doesn\u2019t work on Sundays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left me, Joey. Divorced me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say, While you were gone, but she could have. His baby sister had needed him and he hadn\u2019t been there for her. He pulled her into his arms.</p><p>She burst into tears. He stroked her hair and whispered that he was here, that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>For the first time in three years, it was the truth.</p><p>Meghann\u2019s desk was clean for the first time in more than a decade. All her pending cases had been portioned out to the other attorneys. She\u2019d promised Julie that she\u2019d take at least three weeks of vacation, but already she was having second thoughts. What in the hell would she do with all the hours that made up an ordinary day?</p><p>Last night and the night before, she\u2019d gone out for dinner and drinks with some lawyer friends. Unfortunately, it had become obvious that they were worried about her. No one mentioned the drama with the gun, and when Meg made a joke about her near-death experience, it fell flat. The two evenings had only served to make her feel more alone.</p><p>She thought about calling Harriet, then discarded the idea. She\u2019d studiously avoided her therapist in the past few days, even going so far as to cancel her regular appointment. Their late-night session had been depressing and disturbing; frankly, Meghann was doing a good enough job at depressing herself. She didn\u2019t need to pay a professional to help her.</p><p>She retrieved her briefcase and handbag from the bottom desk drawer and headed for the door. She allowed herself a last look at the room that was more of a home to her than her condo and quietly closed the door.</p><p>As she walked down the wide marble hallway, she noticed that her colleagues were avoiding her. Success was a virus everyone longed to catch. Not so failure. The watercooler whispers had been rampant in the past weeks. Dontess is losing it . . . cracking up . . . just shows you what happens when you have no life.</p><p>The comments were quietly made, of course, in hushed and hurried tones. She was a senior partner, after all, the second name on the door in a business where pecking order was everything. Still, for the first time in her career, they were questioning her, wondering if the Bitch of Belltown had lost her edge. She sensed the same curiosity from her lawyer friends.</p><p>At the closed door of Julia\u2019s corner office, she paused and knocked gently.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Meghann opened the door and entered the bright, sunlit office. \u201cHey, Jules.\u201d</p><p>Julie looked up from her paperwork. \u201cHey, Meg. You want to go out for a drink? Maybe celebrate your first vacation in a decade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about celebrating my decision to stick around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Charlie. I\u2019ve taken a month a year for the last decade. Your only time off generally comes with novocaine.\u201d She stood up. \u201cYou\u2019re tired, Meg, but you\u2019re too stubborn to admit it. What happened last week would mess with anyone\u2019s mind. Let yourself feel it. You need a rest. I recommend at least a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen me rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That makes my point, not yours, counselor. Where are you going to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBangladesh, maybe. I hear the hotels are dirt cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. Why don\u2019t you use my condo in Hawaii? A week by the pool is just what the doctor ordered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I can\u2019t drink anything that comes with an umbrella. I think I\u2019ll just watch Court TV or CNN. Listen for my voice on Larry King Live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t change my mind, no matter how pathetic you seem. Now, go. Your vacation time can\u2019t start if you don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe O\u2019Connor case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinuance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill Summerville\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettlement conference on Friday. I\u2019m handling it personally, and I\u2019ll conduct the Lange deposition next Wednesday. Everything is handled, Meg. Go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she asked quietly, hating the neediness in her voice.</p><p>Julie moved toward her, touched her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re forty-two years old, Meg. If you don\u2019t have anywhere to go and no one to visit, it\u2019s about time you reassessed. This is a job. A damn good one, to be sure, but just a job. You\u2019ve made it your life\u2014I let you, I\u2019ll admit it\u2014but it\u2019s time to make some changes. Go find something.\u201d</p><p>Meghann pulled Julie into her arms, gave her a fierce hug. Then, feeling awkward with the uncharacteristic display of emotion, she stumbled backward, turned around, and strode out of the office.</p><p>Outside, night was closing in, drawing the warmth from a surprisingly hot day. As she neared the Public Market, the crowds increased. Tourists stood in front of flower shops and outside bakery windows. She cut through Post Alley toward her building. It wasn\u2019t a route she often chose, but she didn\u2019t want to walk past the Athenian. Not now, when she felt vulnerable. This was the kind of night where it would be easy to slip from grace and, honestly, she was tired of the fall. It hurt too much to land.</p><p>In the lobby of her building, she waved at the doorman and went up to her condo.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten to leave the radio playing. The place was jarringly silent.</p><p>She tossed her keys on the entryway table. They clanged into a floral-carved Lalique bowl.</p><p>Her place was beautiful and neat, with not so much as a paper clip out of place. The cleaning lady had been here today and carefully removed all evidence of Meghann\u2019s natural disorder. Without the books and folders and papers piled everywhere, it had the look of an expensive hotel room. The kind of place people visited, not where they lived. A pair of blue-black brocade sofas faced each other, with an elegant black coffee table in between. The west-facing walls were solid glass. The view was a blue wash of sky and Sound.</p><p>Meghann opened the antique black-and-gold lacquered armoire in the television room and grabbed the remote. As sound blared to life, she slumped into her favorite suede chair and planted her feet on the ottoman.</p><p>It took less than five seconds to recognize the theme music.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>It was a rerun of her mother\u2019s old television show\u2014Starbase IV. She recognized the episode. It was called \u201cTopsy-Turvy\u201d; in it, the crew of the floating biodome was accidentally transformed into bugs. Mosquito-men took control of the laboratories.</p><p>Mama hurried on-screen wearing that ridiculous lime-green stretch suit with black thigh-high boots. She looked alive and vibrant. Beautiful. Even Meg had trouble looking away.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Wad,\u201d Mama said, her overly plucked eyebrows frowning just enough to convey emotion but not enough to create wrinkles. \u201cWe\u2019ve received an emergency message from the boys in the dehydratin\u2019 pod. They said somethin\u2019 about mosquitos.\u201d</p><p>Dehydratin\u2019.</p><p>As if a microbotanist on a Martian space station had to be from Alabama. Meg hated the fake accent. And Mama had used it ever since. Said her fans expected it of her. Sadly, they probably did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it,\u201d Meghann said aloud.</p><p>But, of course, it was impossible. Turning away from the past was something Meg could do when she was strong. When she was weak, the memories took over. She closed her eyes and remembered. A lifetime ago. They\u2019d been living in Bakersfield then. . . .</p><p>\u201cHey, girls, Mama\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>Meghann huddled closer to Claire, holding her baby sister tightly. Mama stumbled into the trailer\u2019s small, cluttered living room, wearing a clinging red-sequined dress with silver fringe and clear plastic shoes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought Mr. Mason home with me. I met him at the Wild Beaver. You girls be nice to him now,\u201d she said in that boozy, lilting voice that meant she\u2019d wake up mean.</p><p>Meghann knew she had to act fast. With a man in the trailer, Mama wouldn\u2019t be able to think about much else, and the rent was long past due. She reached down for the wrinkled copy of Variety that she\u2019d stolen from the local library. \u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>Mama lit up a menthol cigarette and took a long drag. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Meghann thrust out the magazine. She\u2019d outlined the ad in red ink. It read: Mature actress sought for small part in science fiction television series. Open call. Then the address in Los Angeles.</p><p>Mama read the ad out loud. Her smile froze in place at the words mature actress. After a long, tense moment, she laughed and gave Mr. Mason a little shove toward the bedroom. When he went into the room and closed the door behind him, Mama knelt down and opened her arms. \u201cGive Mama a hug.\u201d</p> <p>Meghann and Claire flew into her embrace. They waited days for a moment like this, sometimes weeks. Mama could be cold and distracted, but when she turned on the heat of her love, it warmed you to the bone.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Meggy. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you. I\u2019ll surely try out for that part. Now, you two scamper off and stay out of trouble. I\u2019ve got some entertaining to do.\u201d</p><p>Mama had read for the role, all right. To her\u2014and everyone else\u2019s\u2014amazement she\u2019d nailed the audition. Instead of winning the small part she\u2019d gone up for, she\u2019d won the starring role of Tara Zyn, the space station\u2019s microbotanist.</p><p>It had been the beginning of the end.</p><p>Meghann sighed. She didn\u2019t want to think about the week Mama had gone to Los Angeles and left her daughters alone in that dirty trailer . . . or the changes that had come afterward. Meghann and Claire had never really been sisters since.</p><p>Beside her, the phone rang. It was jarringly loud in the silence. Meghann pounced on it, eager to talk to anyone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, Meggy, it\u2019s me. Your mama. How are you, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Meg rolled her eyes at the accent. She should have let the answering machine pick up. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mama. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be better. The Fan-ference was this weekend. I have a few photos left over. I thought y\u2019might like a signed one for your collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have m\u2019houseboy send you one. Lordy, I signed s\u2019many autographs, my fingers ache.\u201d</p><p>Meghann had been to one of the Starbase IV Fan Conference weekends. One had been enough. Hundreds of starry-eyed geeks in cheap polyester costumes, clamoring for photographs with a bunch of has-beens and never-really-weres. Mama was the only cast member who\u2019d had a career since the show was canceled, and it wasn\u2019t much. A few bad made-for-TV movies in the eighties and a cult horror classic in the late nineties. It was reruns that had made her rich and famous. A whole new generation of nerds had latched on to the old show. \u201cWell, your fans love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for small miracles. It surely is nice to talk to you, Meggy. We should do it more often. Y\u2019all should come down and visit me.\u201d</p><p>Mama always said that. It was part of the script. A way to pretend they were something they weren\u2019t\u2014family.</p> <p>It was understood that she didn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>Still . . .</p><p>Meghann took a deep breath. Don\u2019t do it. You\u2019re not that desperate.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t sit alone in this condo for three weeks. \u201cI\u2019m taking a vacation,\u201d she said in a rush. \u201cMaybe I could come stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That would be . . . fine.\u201d Mama exhaled heavily; Meghann swore she could smell smoke coming through the phone. \u201cMaybe this Christmas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Mama laughed. \u201cHoney, I\u2019ve got a photographer from People magazine comin\u2019 over at three o\u2019clock, and at my age I wake up lookin\u2019 like one o\u2019 those hairless dogs. It takes ten women all day to make me beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her accent was getting pronounced. That always happened when her emotions were strong. Meghann wanted to hang up, say forget it, but when she looked around her empty, photo-free apartment, she felt almost sick. \u201cHow about Monday, then? Just for a few days. Maybe we could go to a spa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever watch the E! channel? I\u2019m leavin\u2019 for Cleveland on Monday. I\u2019m doin\u2019 Shakespeare in some park with Pamela Anderson and Charlie Sheen. Hamlet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? You\u2019re doing Shakespeare?\u201d</p><p>Another dramatic pause. \u201cI\u2019m gonna forget I heard that tone in your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the accent, Mama. It\u2019s me. I know you were born in Detroit. Joan Jojovitch is the name on your birth certificate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being rude. You always were a prickly child.\u201d</p><p>Meghann didn\u2019t know what to say. The last place in the world she wanted to go was to her mother\u2019s, and yet being studiously noninvited rankled her. \u201cWell. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big break for me.\u201d</p><p>For me. Mama\u2019s favorite words. \u201cYou better get a good night\u2019s sleep before the magazine shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth.\u201d Mama exhaled again. \u201cMaybe y\u2019all could come down later in the year. When I\u2019m not so busy. Claire, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Bye, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Meghann hung up the phone and sat there in her too-quiet home. She called Elizabeth, got the answering machine, and left a quick message. Then she hung up.</p><p>What now? She had no idea.</p><p>For the next hour, she paced the apartment, trying to formulate a plan that made sense.</p><p>The phone rang. She dived for it, hoping it was Elizabeth. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire? This is a nice surprise.\u201d And for once it was. She sat down. \u201cI talked to Mama today. You won\u2019t believe this. She\u2019s doing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014Shakespeare in\u2014married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy, Meg. I know it\u2019s crazy, but that\u2019s love, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you marrying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby Jack Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never even heard his name.\u201d Not since Hee Haw went off the air, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI met him ten days ago in Chelan. I know what you\u2019re going to say, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen days ago. You have sex with men you just met, Claire. Sometimes you even sneak away for a wild weekend. What you don\u2019t do is marry them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love, Meg. Please don\u2019t ruin it for me.\u201d</p><p>Meg wanted to give advice so badly she had to curl her hands into fists. \u201cWhat does he do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a singer/songwriter. You should hear him, Meg. He sounds like an angel. He was singing in Cowboy Bob\u2019s Western Roundup when I first saw him. My heart stopped for a second. Have you ever felt that way?\u201d</p><p>Before Meghann could answer, Claire went on, \u201cHe\u2019s a ski instructor in Aspen in the winter and he travels around in the summer, playing his music. He\u2019s two years older than I am, and he\u2019s so good-looking you won\u2019t believe it. Better than Brad Pitt, I kid you not. He\u2019s going to be a star.\u201d</p><p>Meghann let it all soak in. Her sister was marrying a thirty-seven-year-old ski bum who dreamed of being a Country and Western singer. And the best gig he could get was Cowboy Bob\u2019s in Nowheresville.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be yourself, Meg,\u201d Claire said evenly when the pause had gone on too long.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know what the campground is worth? Will he sign a prenuptial agreement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Meg. Can\u2019t you be happy for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be,\u201d Meghann said, and it was true. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you deserve the best, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby is the best. You haven\u2019t asked about the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday, the twenty-third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf this month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought, Why wait? I\u2019m not getting any younger. So we booked the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe church.\u201d This was crazy. Too fast. \u201cI need to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. The rehearsal dinner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I need to meet him now. I\u2019ll be at your house tomorrow night. I\u2019ll take you guys out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Meg, you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>Meg pretended not to hear Claire\u2019s reluctance. \u201cI want to. I have to meet the man who stole my sister\u2019s heart, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d Claire paused, then said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Bye.\u201d Meg hung up, then punched in the number for her office and left a message for her secretary. \u201cGet me everything we\u2019ve got on prenuptial agreements. Forms, cases, even the Ortega agreement. I want it all delivered to my house by ten o\u2019clock tomorrow morning.\u201d As an afterthought, she added, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Then she headed for her computer to do some checking up on Bobby Jack Austin.</p><p>This was what she\u2019d do on her idiotic vacation. She\u2019d save Claire from making the biggest mistake of her life.</p><p>TEN</p><p>CLAIRE HUNG UP THE OFFICE PHONE. IN THE SILENCE THAT followed, doubt crept into the room.</p><p>She and Bobby were moving awfully fast. . . .</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Meg.\u201d</p><p>But even as she cursed her sister, Claire knew the doubt had been there all along, a little seed inside of her, waiting to sprout and grow. She was too old to be swept away by passion.</p><p>She had a daughter to think about, after all. Alison had never known her biological father. It had been easy so far, bubble-wrapping Ali\u2019s world so that none of life\u2019s sharp edges could hurt her. Marriage would change everything.</p><p>The last thing Claire wanted to do was marry a man who had itchy feet.</p><p>She knew about men like that, men who smiled pretty smiles and made big promises and disappeared one night while you were brushing your teeth.</p><p>Claire had had four stepfathers before she\u2019d turned nine. That number didn\u2019t include the men she\u2019d been asked to call Uncle, the men who\u2019d passed through Mama\u2019s life like shots of tequila. There and gone, leaving nothing behind but a bitter aftertaste.</p><p>Claire had had such high hopes for each new stepfather, too. This one, she\u2019d thought each time. He\u2019ll be the one to take me roller-skating and teach me how to ride a bike. Of course, it had been Meg who\u2019d taught her those things; Meg, who never once called one of Mama\u2019s husbands Daddy and refused to have any hopes for them at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No wonder Meghann was suspicious. Their past had given her reason to be.</p><p>Claire walked across the main lobby of the registration office. On her way to the window, she picked up a fallen flyer, no doubt dropped by one of the guests, and tossed it into the cold fireplace.</p><p>Outside, the sun was just beginning to set. The camp lay bathed in a rose-gold light in which every leaf edge seemed sharper, every green distinct. Sunlight sparkled on the blue water in the swimming pool, empty now as the guests were firing up their camp stoves and barbecues.</p><p>As she stood there, feeling vulnerable and uncertain, she saw a shadow fall across the grass.</p> <p>Dad and Bobby strolled into view. Dad wore his summertime uniform: blue overalls and a black T-shirt. A tattered River\u2019s Edge baseball cap shaded his eyes; beneath it, his brown hair was a mass of fuzzy curls.</p><p>And Bobby.</p><p>He wore a pair of faded jeans and a blue T-shirt that read: Cowboy Up for Coors. In this fading light, his long hair was the color of eighteen-carat gold, rich and warm. He carried their Weed Eater in one hand and a can of gasoline in the other. In the days he\u2019d been here, Bobby had pitched in with the work. He was good at it, though she knew he wouldn\u2019t be happy at River\u2019s Edge forever. Already, he\u2019d mentioned going on the road for a few weeks this summer. The three of them. \u201cThe Austins\u2019 road trip\u201d was how he put it. Claire thought it sounded great, traveling from town to town for a while, listening to her new husband sing. She hadn\u2019t broached the idea with her father, but she knew he\u2019d be all for it. As for what would become of the camp next season, they\u2019d have to cross that bridge together when the time came.</p><p>Dad and Bobby stopped in front of cabin number five. Dad pointed up toward the eaves and Bobby nodded. A minute later, they were both laughing. Dad put his hand on Bobby\u2019s shoulder. They moved away, toward the laundry room.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mommy. Whatcha lookin\u2019 at?\u201d</p> <p>Claire turned around. Ali stood at the bottom of the stairs, clutching her Tickle Me Elmo doll. \u201cHey, Ali Kat. Come over here a minute, will you?\u201d She sat down in the blue-and-white striped chair-and-a-half by the fireplace, putting her feet up on the matching ottoman.</p><p>Alison crawled onto her lap, settling comfortably in place. Heart to heart, the way they always sat.</p><p>\u201cI was just watching Grandpa talk to Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby\u2019s gonna teach me to fish. He says I\u2019m old enough to go to the trout farm in Skykomish.\u201d Alison leaned closer and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s a trick to catching the big ones. He\u2019s gonna teach it to me. An\u2019 he says we can float down the river in inner tubes by August. Even me. Did you ever put a worm on a hook? Yeech. But I\u2019m gonna do it. You\u2019ll see. Bobby said he\u2019d help me if it was too wriggly or snotty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like him,\u201d Claire said softly, trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great.\u201d Alison wiggled around until she was facing Claire. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mommy? You look like you\u2019re gonna cry. The worms don\u2019t feel anything. Honest.\u201d</p> <p>She stroked Alison\u2019s soft cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re my whole world, Ali Kat. You know that, don\u2019t you? No one could ever take your place in my heart.\u201d</p><p>Alison and Elmo kissed Claire. \u201cI know that.\u201d Alison giggled and scampered out of Claire\u2019s lap. \u201cI gotta go. Grandpa\u2019s taking me to Smitty\u2019s Garage. We\u2019re gonna get the truck fixed.\u201d</p><p>As she watched her daughter run out the front door, heard her yell \u201cGrandpa! Bobby! I\u2019m here!\u201d Claire felt the pressing weight of responsibility again. How did a woman know if she was being selfish, and was that necessarily a bad thing, anyway? Men were selfish all the time and they built multibillion-dollar corporations and rockets that flew to the moon.</p><p>But what if the marriage didn\u2019t work?</p><p>There it was. The clay beneath it all.</p><p>She needed to talk to someone about this. Not her sister, of course. A friend. She dialed Gina\u2019s number.</p><p>Gina answered on the first ring. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Claire slumped back into the oversize chair and put her feet up. \u201cIt\u2019s me. The Insta-Marry Queen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Claire. That\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeghann thinks I\u2019m being an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do we care what she thinks? She\u2019s an attorney, for God\u2019s sake. That\u2019s below invertebrates on the evolutionary chain.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s chest eased. She smiled. \u201cI knew you\u2019d put it in perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for. Would you like me to sing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, no. I\u2019ve heard you sing. Just tell me I\u2019m not being a selfish bitch who is going to ruin her daughter\u2019s life by marrying a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s your mother we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like her.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice was suddenly soft.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you since all five of us showed up for the first day of school in the same blue shirt. I remember when you bought cream to make your boobs grow and still believed in sea monkeys. Honey, you\u2019ve never been selfish. And I\u2019ve never seen you this happy. I don\u2019t care that you\u2019ve known him less than two weeks. God has finally given you the gift of love and passion. Don\u2019t return it unopened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared. I should have done this when I was young and optimistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are young and optimistic, and of course you\u2019re scared. If you\u2019ll remember, I had to drink two tequila straight shots to marry Rex\u2014and we\u2019d lived together for four years.\u201d She paused. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have used us as an example. But the point remains. A smart person is afraid of marriage. You made it past the marriage-for-marriage\u2019s-sake years and you haven\u2019t reached the nursing-home-desperation years. You met a man and fell in love. So it happened fast. Big deal. If you\u2019re not ready to marry him, by all means, wait. But don\u2019t wait because your big sister made you question yourself. Follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s gut was clenched, her mind was clouded, but her heart was crystal clear. \u201cWhat would I do without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same thing I\u2019d do without you\u2014drink too much and whine to strangers.\u201d</p><p>Claire heard the tiny thread of depression in Gina\u2019s voice. It made her love her friend all the more for listening to her problems while her own whole world was caving in. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis day or this week? I\u2019ve got more mood swings than a teenager, and my ass is starting to look like a Buick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo jokes, Gigi. How are you?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cShitty. Rex came by last night. The son of a bitch has lost about ten pounds and dyed his hair. Pretty soon he\u2019ll ask me to call him the Rexster again.\u201d She paused. \u201cHe wants to marry that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch with a blowtorch. I\u2019m remembering the day he proposed to me, and he\u2019s pricing diamonds. It hurts like hell. But you haven\u2019t heard the real news: Joey\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. Where\u2019s he been?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, the sound of movement, then Gina lowered her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Here and there, he says. He looks bad. Older. He got home yesterday. He\u2019s been asleep for almost thirteen hours. Honestly, I hope I never love anyone as much as he loved Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I said he could stay here, but he won\u2019t. He\u2019s like some animal that\u2019s been in the wild too long. And this house brings back a lot of memories. He stared at the picture of my wedding for almost an hour. Honest to God, I wanted to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>They talked for a few more minutes about ordinary, everyday things. By the time they hung up, Claire felt better. The ground beneath her feet felt firm again. Thinking about Joe and Diana helped, too. With everything that had gone wrong between those two, they still were proof that love could be real.</p><p>She looked down at her left hand, at the engagement ring she wore. It was a strip of silver foil, carefully folded and twisted around her finger.</p><p>She refused to think of what her sister would say about it, and remembered instead how she\u2019d felt when Bobby put it there.</p><p>Marry me, he\u2019d said, on bended knee. She\u2019d known she should smile gently, say, Oh, Bobby, of course not. We barely know each other.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t say those words. His dark eyes had been filled with the kind of love she\u2019d only dreamed of, and she\u2019d been lost. Her rational self\u2014the part that had been alone for almost three dozen years and become a single parent\u2014had warned her not to be a fool.</p><p>Ah, but her heart. That tender organ would not be ignored. She was in love. So much so that it felt like drowning.</p><p>Gina was right. This love was a gift she\u2019d been given, one she\u2019d stopped looking for and almost stopped believing in. She wouldn\u2019t turn away from it because she was afraid. One thing motherhood had taught her\u2014love required boldness. And fear simply came with the package.</p><p>She grabbed her sweater off the back of the sofa and slipped it over her shoulders, then she went outside.</p><p>Night had almost completely fallen now; darkness enveloped the salmon-hued granite peaks. To the tourists who sat around their campfires making s\u2019mores and roasting hot dogs, it seemed like a quiet time in this patch of green tucked up against the mountains\u2019 vertical walls. The locals knew better. Within walking distance, there was a whole world unseen by the casual observer, unheard by those who spent their lives listening on telephones and watching computer screens.</p><p>On peaks nearby, ones with names like Formidable, Terror, and Despair, the glaciers were never still, never silent. They slid forward, groaning, creaking, crunching every rock in their path. Even the heat of an August sun couldn\u2019t melt them away, and along the banks of the mighty Skykomish, just beyond where the humans walked, a thousand species of wildlife preyed on one another.</p><p>Yet the night felt still and calm; the air smelled of pine needles and drying grass. It was that time of year when, for a few weeks, the lawns in town would turn brittle and brown. That rarest of times in the Northwest\u2014a patch of dry.</p><p>She heard the quiet buzz of the campers\u2019 dinner conversations, punctuated every now and then by a barking dog or a child\u2019s high-pitched giggle. Underneath it all, as steady and familiar as the beating of her heart, was the chattering of the river. These sounds had become the music of her youth, long ago replacing the jumbled cacophony of raucous music that had been Mama\u2019s soundtrack.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother with shoes. Barefoot, her soles toughened by summers spent along this river\u2019s banks, she strolled past the empty pool. In the small, shingled pool house, the filter\u2019s motor thumped on, buzzing. A pair of inner tubes\u2014one shocking pink and one lime green\u2014floated on the darkening water.</p><p>She made her nightly rounds slowly, stopping to talk to several of their guests, even sharing a glass of wine with Wendy and Jeff Goldstein at campsite thirteen.</p><p>It was completely dark by the time she reached the small row of cabins on the property\u2019s eastern edge. All of the windows glowed with fuzzy golden light. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At first, she thought the sound she heard was crickets, gearing up for a nightly concert. Then she heard the sweet sound of strings being strummed.</p><p>Cabin four had a pretty little porch that faced the river. They had taken the cabin off the market this summer because of rain damage to the roof; the vacancy had given Bobby a place to stay until the wedding. Destiny, Dad had said when he gave Claire the key.</p><p>Now, destiny sat on the edge of the porch, cross-legged, his body veiled in shadows, a guitar across his lap. He stared out at the river, plucking a slow and uncertain tune.</p><p>Claire eased into the darkness beneath a giant Douglas fir. Hidden, she watched him. The music sent shivers skimming along her flesh.</p> <p>Almost too quietly to hear, he started to sing. \u201cI\u2019ve been walkin\u2019 all my life . . . on a road goin\u2019 nowhere. Then I turned a corner, darlin\u2019 . . . and there you were.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s throat tightened with an emotion so sweet and powerful she felt the start of tears. She stepped out of the shadows.</p><p>Bobby looked up and saw her. A smile crinkled the suntanned planes of his face.</p><p>She stepped toward him, her bare feet making a soft, thumping beat on the hard, dried grass.</p><p>He began to sing again, his gaze on her face. \u201cFor the first time in my life . . . I believe in God almighty . . . in the Lord my grandpa promised me . . . \u2019cause, honey, I see Heaven in your eyes.\u201d He strummed a few more chords, then thumped his hand on the guitar and grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve written so far. I know it needs work.\u201d He put down the guitar and moved toward her.</p> <p>With every footstep, she felt her breathing shorten until, by the time he was standing in front of her, she couldn\u2019t seem to draw a full breath. It was almost embarrassing to feel this much.</p><p>He took her left hand in his, looked down at the strip of foil that was supposed to be a diamond ring. When he looked at her again, he was no longer smiling.</p><p>\u201cPathetic,\u201d he whispered, and her heart ached for the shame she saw in his dark eyes. \u201cNot every woman would accept a ring like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Bobby. That\u2019s all that matters. I know it\u2019s crazy, impossible even, but I love you.\u201d The words freed something inside her. She could breathe again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no prize, Claire. You know that. I\u2019ve made mistakes in my life. Three of \u2019em, to be exact.\u201d</p><p>Claire could practically hear Meg\u2019s voice in the breeze. But the sound meant nothing when she saw how Bobby looked at her. No one had ever looked at her like that before, as if she were the most precious woman on earth. \u201cI\u2019m a single mother who never got married. I know about mistakes, Bobby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way before,\u201d he said softly, a catch in his voice. \u201cHonest to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if my heart doesn\u2019t belong to me anymore, as if it can\u2019t beat without you. You\u2019re inside me, Claire, holding me up. You make me want to be more than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want us to grow old together,\u201d she whispered the words. It was her deepest dream, her most treasured hope. All her life, she\u2019d imagined herself alone in old age, one of those white-haired women who sat on the porch, waiting for the phone to ring or a car to drive up. Now, finally, she allowed herself to imagine a better future, one filled with love and laughter and family.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear our kids fight about who\u2019s touching who in the smelly backseat of a minivan.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. It felt so good to dream with someone.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms, danced with her to the music of the river and the crickets.</p><p>Finally, Claire said, \u201cMy sister, Meghann, is coming up to meet you tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>He drew back. Taking her hand, he led her to his porch. They sat down in the creaky oak swing and rocked gently. \u201cI thought you said she\u2019d boycott the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWishful thinking.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cShe was predictably underwhelmed by our decision to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the sister Gina called Cruella De Vil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaws is really the preferred nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes her opinion matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it does.\u201d</p><p>Claire felt like a fool. \u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll win her over. Maybe I\u2019ll write a song for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt better go platinum. Meg doesn\u2019t like second best. She should be here by early evening tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I go down to the army surplus and check out some Kevlar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the very least.\u201d</p><p>Bobby\u2019s smile faded after a moment. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to change your mind about me, will she?\u201d</p><p>She was moved by his vulnerability. \u201cShe\u2019s never been able to change my mind about anything. It\u2019s what makes her foam at the mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you love me, I can take anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Bobby Austin,\u201d she put her arms around him and leaned over for a kiss. Just before their lips touched, she whispered, \u201cThen you can take anything. Even my sister.\u201d</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>CLAIRE STOOD AT THE KITCHEN SINK, WASHING THE breakfast dishes. It was a gray, not-quite-rainy day, the kind where the sky was so low it seemed to bump you in the forehead when you dared to venture outside. Perfect weather for a visit with Meghann.</p><p>The thought made her head pound. She dried her hands and reached for the bottle of Excedrin on the windowsill.</p><p>\u201cMary Kay Acheson gets to have Cap\u2019n Crunch for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>It was a common early-morning argument. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably have false teeth in time for eighth grade. You don\u2019t want to have to take your teeth out at bedtime, do you?\u201d</p><p>Ali banged her feet rhythmically on the rungs at the base of her chair. \u201cWillie has all his teeth and he\u2019s gonna be in ninth grade. He\u2019s practically a grown-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Karen feeds him Raisin Bran for breakfast. If he ate Cap\u2019n Crunch, it\u2019d be a different story.\u201d</p><p>Ali frowned, thinking about that.</p><p>Claire washed down the aspirin.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a headache again, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Meg\u2019s coming over tonight. She wants to meet Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Ali\u2019s frown deepened. Obviously, she was trying to understand the connection between Mom\u2019s headache and Aunt Meg\u2019s visit. \u201cI thought she was too busy to breathe.\u201d</p><p>Claire went to the table and sat down beside her daughter. \u201cYou know why Meghann wants to meet Bobby?\u201d</p><p>Alison rolled her eyes. \u201cDuh, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh?\u201d Claire bit back a smile. At some point, she\u2019d have to address the issue of respectful responses, but she\u2019d better wait until she could do it without cracking up. She held out her hand instead. \u201cYou know what this ring means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a ring. It\u2019s foil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis kind of ring is a symbol. The ring isn\u2019t what matters. The words that come with it are what matters. And Bobby asked me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Mommy. C\u2019n I have some cheddar Goldfish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat in a second. I want to talk to you about this. No one is more important to me than you. No one. I\u2019ll always love you, even if I\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Mommy. I know that. Now c\u2019n I have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the Goldfish.\u201d No wonder It\u2019s like talking to a five year old was a common expression of frustration. \u201cDo you mind if I marry Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ali\u2019s little face scrunched up. She bunched up her left cheek, then her right. Then she looked up at Claire. \u201cC\u2019n I call him Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo at school, on family day, he\u2019ll come for the sack races and help Brittani\u2019s dad barbecue the hot dogs?\u201d</p><p>Claire released a breath. It wasn\u2019t easy for her to make blanket promises for another human being. That kind of faith lived in the hearts of women who\u2019d grown up in safer homes, where Mom and Dad could be counted on. But she believed in Bobby as much as one of her mother\u2019s daughters could believe in any man. \u201cYes. We can count on him.\u201d</p><p>Alison grinned. \u201cOkay. I want him to be my dad. Daddy.\u201d She was obviously testing the word, weighing how it felt to say aloud. It was amazing how many little girls\u2019 dreams could be contained in those few letters.</p><p>Big girls\u2019 dreams, too, for that matter.</p><p>Alison gave Claire a quick kiss, then scampered off, dragging a dirty Elmo on the floor behind her. She went upstairs to her bedroom. Seconds later, The Little Mermaid theme music started.</p><p>Claire stared down at her engagement ring. As makeshift as it was, it gave her a warm feeling of hopefulness.</p><p>\u201cOne down,\u201d she said aloud. Actually, it was two. Both her father and her daughter had put their stamp of approval on the wedding plans.</p><p>That left only two blood-related holdouts. Meghann, who definitely hadn\u2019t sounded approving, and Mama, who probably wouldn\u2019t much care. Claire had been putting off the call. No good ever came from talking to Mama.</p><p>Still, she was her mother, and she had to be called.</p><p>The funny part was, when Claire thought of her \u201cmother,\u201d the face that came to her was Meg\u2019s. In every childhood memory, it was her sister who\u2019d been there . . . until, of course, the day she decided she\u2019d had enough of caring for Claire.</p><p>And Mama. Well. Truth be told, Claire\u2019s memories of Mama were sketchy at best. Claire was lucky in that; the brunt of mama\u2019s flightiness had fallen on Meg. Still, they all pretended that they were family.</p><p>Claire picked up the phone and punched in the number. It rang and rang. Finally, an answering machine clicked on. Mama\u2019s thick-as-honey-and-twice-as-sweet Southern drawl was accompanied by music. \u201cI do so appreciate your call on m\u2019private number. Unfortunately, I\u2019m too darn busy to answer, but leave me a message and I\u2019ll return your call just as soon as I can. And look for my interview in People magazine, on newsstands in late June. Bye, y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>Only Mama would self-promote on her answering machine.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mama,\u201d she said at the beep, \u201cIt\u2019s Claire here. Your daughter. I\u2019ve got some big news and I\u2019d like to talk to you. Call me.\u201d She left her number, just in case, and hung up.</p><p>She was still holding the phone, listening to the dial tone when she realized her mistake. She was getting married in less than two weeks. If she waited for Mama to call, the wedding would be long past. The point was to invite Mama, not to simply inform. You had to invite your mother to your wedding, even if the woman who bore you had the parenting instincts of a mosquito, and there was little chance she\u2019d actually show up.</p><p>By the time Mama had managed to fly from Los Angeles to Seattle to see her only granddaughter, Alison had been four years old.</p><p>Claire still remembered the day vividly. They\u2019d met at the Woodland Park Zoo in downtown Seattle. Mama had been in the middle of a Starbase IV promotional tour (yet again) that touched down there.</p><p>Claire and Alison had been sitting on the wooden bench by the zoo\u2019s entrance for more than an hour, waiting.</p><p>Claire had almost given up when she\u2019d heard a familiar high-pitched screech. She\u2019d looked up just in time to see Mama, dressed in a bronze silk caftan, bearing down on them like a Thanksgiving Day parade float. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lordy it\u2019s good to see my girl again, she\u2019d cried out loudly enough that everyone nearby stopped to stare. A hushed buzz of recognition twittered through the crowd.</p><p>It\u2019s her, someone said. Tara Zyn from Starbase IV.</p><p>Claire had fought the urge to roll her eyes. She stood up, her hand clasped tightly around Alison\u2019s. Hey, Mama. It\u2019s good to see you again.</p><p>Mama had swooped down on one knee in a movement that sent silk wings flying up on either side of her. Is this darlin\u2019 little thing my granddaughter?</p> <p>Hello, Mrs. Sullivan, Alison had said, stumbling awkwardly over the name she\u2019d practiced for a week. Claire had been sure that Mama wouldn\u2019t appreciate the word Grandma. In print, she claimed to be looking forward to her fiftieth birthday.</p><p>Mama had studied Alison carefully. For a moment, only that, a kind of sadness passed through her blue eyes. Then that smile was back. You can call me Nanna. She reached out one bejeweled hand, stroked Ali\u2019s curly hair. You\u2019re the spittin\u2019 image of your mama.</p><p>I\u2019m not allowed to spit, Mrs. . . . Nanna.</p><p>Mama had looked up. She\u2019s spunky, Claire-Bear. Just like Meggy. Good for you. It\u2019s the spunky ones that make it in life. I think she\u2019s the most well spoken two-year-old I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure o\u2019 meetin\u2019.</p><p>That\u2019s because she\u2019s four, Mama.</p> <p>Four? Mama popped to her feet. Oh, honey, I don\u2019t think so. Y\u2019all were just in the hospital. Now, let\u2019s hurry along to the snake house. That\u2019s m\u2019favorite. And I\u2019ve got to be back t\u2019my hotel in an hour for an interview with Evenin\u2019 Magazine. Later that afternoon, Meghann had shown up and the four of them had walked silently through the Seattle Center, pretending they had something in common.</p><p>It used to hurt Claire to remember that day. Not so much anymore. The wound had healed over, grown a layer of thicker skin. She\u2019d long ago quit wishing for a different mother. It was a hope that had once crippled her; she\u2019d had to let it go. Like her dream of a sister who was also a best friend. Some things just didn\u2019t turn out the way you wanted, and a girl could only cry for so many years.</p><p>She glanced up at the clock on the oven. It was almost one o\u2019clock.</p><p>In only a few hours, Meghann would be here.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Claire muttered.</p><p>\u201cMy sister called me last night.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet sat back in her chair. It made a squeaking sound at the movement. \u201cAh. No wonder you actually kept this appointment. I\u2019d begun to despair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed one appointment. That\u2019s hardly a big deal. I called to cancel and I paid for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always assume that money is the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point, Harriet? Today you\u2019re being so obscure even Freud couldn\u2019t follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that you were upset at our last appointment.\u201d</p><p>Meghann\u2019s eye started to twitch. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Harriet stared at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand that being upset is part of healing? You need to stop running from your emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do, if you\u2019ll listen. I said, my sister called last night.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet sighed. \u201cIs that unusual? I was under the impression that you spoke to Claire quite often; you just never talk about what matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s true. We call each other every few months. Always on holidays and birthdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what is remarkable about last night\u2019s conversation?\u201d</p><p>Meghann\u2019s eye twitch kicked into high gear. She could barely see. For no reason at all, she found it difficult to sit still. \u201cShe\u2019s getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath, Meg,\u201d Harriet said softly.</p><p>\u201cMy eye is batting like an Evinrude motor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>Meghann felt like an idiot. \u201cWhat in the hell is wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Identifying the emotion helped. She was scared. She released a pent-up breath slowly and looked at Harriet. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you assume that marriage will hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. I notice you\u2019re no longer wearing that one-karat solitaire on your left hand. I don\u2019t suppose taking it off was a song-inspiring moment of joy.\u201d</p><p>Harriet fisted her left hand. \u201cMany sisters rejoice when they hear this kind of news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the ones who handle the divorces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you separate yourself from your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about my job, Harriet. My sister is in trouble. I have to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she in love?\u201d</p><p>Meghann waved her hand impatiently. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that matters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re always in love in the beginning. It\u2019s like going out to sea on a huge throat lozenge. The water disintegrates it. After a few floating years, you\u2019re swimming with nothing to hold you up. Then the sharks move in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be people like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is no time for lawyer jokes. I have to save my sister before she marries the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s the wrong man?\u201d</p><p>Meghann fought the urge to say, They all are. That admission would only fill up another round of observations and questions. \u201cHe\u2019s practically jobless. They\u2019ve known each other less than a month. He\u2019s a musician. He lets people call him Bobby Jack. Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I want to marry an itinerant Country and Western singer who can\u2019t even headline at Cowboy Bob\u2019s Western Roundup in Lake Chelan. Yes, Harriet, you\u2019ve hit the core of it this time. I\u2019m jealous.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cHe\u2019s probably marrying her for the so-called resort. He\u2019ll try to talk her into building condos or dentists\u2019 offices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would show some initiative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire loves that tired piece of land. She would hate to pave over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said the land was underdeveloped and that Claire was wasting her life there. I believe you mentioned building a spa on the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re completely missing the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point being that you need to ride in on a white horse and save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to protect her. I want to be there for her this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked up sharply. Of course Harriet had pounced on the two words that mattered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Harriet leaned forward. \u201cTell me about the day you weren\u2019t there for your sister.\u201d</p><p>Meghann stiffened, drew back. The chair squeaked as it rolled backward. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smarter than that, Meg. I don\u2019t have to remind you that everything between you and Claire is about the past. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Meghann closed her eyes. Obviously, she was in a weakened state, because the sour memories were there, waiting to crowd to the front of her mind. She shrugged, tried to appear casual as she opened her eyes and looked at Harriet. \u201cYou know it all. You just want to hear me go through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sixteen. Claire was nine. Mama went to Los Angeles for the Starbase IV audition and had so much fun she forgot about the kids she left in Bakersfield. For her, it was a common oversight. Then Social Services started poking around. They threatened to put us into foster care. I was old enough to run away, but Claire . . .\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSo I pulled a Nancy Drew and tracked down Sam Cavenaugh\u2014her biological dad. I called him. Sam couldn\u2019t save his daughter fast enough.\u201d Meg heard the adolescent hurt in her voice. Even now, all these years later, the memories of that summer were hard to bear. She hated to remember how much she\u2019d wanted Sam to be her father, too. Meg straightened. \u201cNone of this old shit matters. Sam was a great father to Claire. Everyone ended up happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone? How about the girl who lost her mother and sister and had no father to turn to?\u201d</p><p>The observation hurt. Meghann had never been able to discover her own father\u2019s name; all Mama ever called him was That loser. \u201cEnough. Tell me this, Harriet. Is it smart to marry a man you\u2019ve known a few weeks? Would you like it if your daughter did what Claire is doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to trust her, wouldn\u2019t I? We can\u2019t live other people\u2019s lives for them. Even if we love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love Claire,\u201d Meghann said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. That\u2019s never been the issue, has it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing in common. It doesn\u2019t mean I want to see her throw her life away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think you have something in common. You lived together for nine years. That\u2019s a lot of shared memories. I get the feeling that you used to be best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I dumped her off with a man she barely knew and then ran away? Yeah. We were best friends before that. But Claire wanted a daddy, and once she got one . . . well . . .\u201d Meghann glanced at the intricately cast crystal desk clock. It was 4:00. \u201cIt\u2019ll take me almost two hours to reach Hayden at this time of day. Our traffic is just terrible, don\u2019t you think? If we would elect a mayor instead of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeg. Don\u2019t go off on one of your rants. Today is important. Claire may harbor certain animosities against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re going to race up to Hayden in your expensive car and butt into her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d characterize my involvement as saving her from herself. Just handing out some obviously overlooked information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll appreciate your help?\u201d</p><p>Meghann winced. Claire would probably not be pleased. Some people had trouble accepting certain facts. \u201cI\u2019ll be pleasant about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pleasantly tell her that she shouldn\u2019t marry a singer with no real prospects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know I can be abrasive at times, and opinionated to the point of oppression, but this time I intend to choose my words carefully. I won\u2019t say loser or gold digger or stupid. She\u2019ll be hurt, but she\u2019ll see that I\u2019m only trying to look out for her.\u201d</p><p>Harriet seemed to wait an inordinately long time before she asked, \u201cDo you remember how love feels?\u201d</p><p>Meghann couldn\u2019t follow the segue, but she was glad to quit talking about Claire. \u201cI married Eric, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Number two on the hit parade of bad decisions.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember about your marriage to Eric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe end of it. I\u2019ve had headaches that lasted longer than my marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did it end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this. He cheated on me. With most of the Seahawks\u2019 cheerleaders and half the wait staff at the Bellevue Hooters. He was absolutely ardent in his pursuit of silicone. If only he\u2019d shown so much drive in his career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when he proposed?\u201d</p><p>Meghann sighed. She didn\u2019t want to think about that day. It had all happened so long ago. The candlelit room, the trail of white rose petals that led to the king-size bed, the music coming from another room, a soft, instrumental version of Air Supply\u2019s \u201cAll Out of Love\u201d that was playing on the radio. \u201cI proposed to him, if you must know. I\u2019ve never been good at waiting, and it took Eric an hour to pick out a pair of socks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harriet looked pained. \u201cMeghann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try that story again? My memory is not as poor as you\u2019d like to think.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked down at her fingernails. For years she\u2019d told stories about Eric\u2019s infidelities. The remark about his ardent pursuit of silicone always got a laugh. It was better that way, she\u2019d learned; better to think of him as a villain. The truth hurt too much. Even Elizabeth didn\u2019t know what had really happened in Meghann\u2019s marriage. But now, somehow, Harriet had ferreted out the facts. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d Harriet said gently. \u201cThat\u2019s why you should.\u201d</p><p>Meghann released her breath slowly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t go after waitresses. Not as far as I know, anyway. He was faithful to me . . . until he met Nancy.\u201d She closed her eyes, remembering that terrible day when he\u2019d come home crying. I can\u2019t do it anymore, Meg. You\u2019re killing me. Nothing I do is good enough for you. And your love . . . it\u2019s a cold place.</p><p>And then, just when she\u2019d felt the start of her own tears and tasted the desperate plea in her mouth, he said, I\u2019ve met someone. She loves who I am, not who I could be if I were more ambitious. And . . . she\u2019s pregnant.</p><p>The memories twisted Meghann\u2019s insides, made her feel needy and weak. She couldn\u2019t hold it all inside anymore. \u201cIt was so romantic,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThe night he proposed to me. The white rose petals were true. So was the music. He poured a glass of champagne and told me that I was his whole world, that he wanted to love me forever and be the father of my children. I cried when he said it.\u201d She wiped her eyes of tears that should have dried long ago. \u201cI should have known how fragile love was, given my family history, but I was reckless. I handled a glass bubble as if it were made of steel. I couldn\u2019t believe how quickly it broke. He left because I didn\u2019t know how to love him enough.\u201d On that, her voice cracked. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you did love him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I loved him,\u201d Meghann said quietly, feeling the dormant pain well up and become fresh again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that you readily remember the pain of your divorce, but you have to be reminded of the love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d Meg said, standing up. \u201cThis is like open-heart surgery without anesthesia.\u201d She looked at her watch. \u201cBesides, we\u2019re out of time. I told Claire I\u2019d be there this evening. I need to go.\u201d</p><p>Harriet slowly removed her glasses and looked up at Meghann. \u201cThink this thing through, Meg. Maybe this wedding could bring you and Claire together, give you some new ground to stand on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should just let her marry Bobby Jack Tom Dick and say nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes love means trusting people to make their own decisions. In other words, shutting up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWomen pay me handsomely to tell them the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour version of the truth. And Claire is not one of your clients. She\u2019s a woman who is getting married for the first time. A thirty-five-year-old woman, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I should just smile and hug her and tell her I think it\u2019s great that she\u2019s marrying a stranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he breaks her heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll need her sister. But she won\u2019t turn to someone who\u2019ll say, I told you so.\u201d</p><p>Meghann thought about that. She was opinionated and abrasive, but she wasn\u2019t a dimwit. \u201cSorry, Harriet,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI don\u2019t agree. I can\u2019t let him hurt her. Claire\u2019s the best person I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best person you don\u2019t know, you mean. Clearly, you want to keep it that way. You want to keep her at arm\u2019s length.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever. Good-bye.\u201d Meghann hurried from the office.</p><p>Harriet was wrong. It was that simple.</p><p>Meghann had let Claire down once; she wouldn\u2019t do it again.</p><p>It\u2019s stupid to marry a man you just met.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Stupid\u2019 is not a good word choice.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s inadvisable to\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her sister, not her lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Meghann had been carrying on this demented conversation with the rearview mirror for more than an hour. How was it that she came up with closing arguments that would bring a jury to tears and she couldn\u2019t find a simple, compelling way to warn her sister of impending doom?</p><p>She drove through the stop-and-go traffic of downtown Seattle and into the flat green farmland of the Snohomish valley. Towns that in her youth had been sleepy little dairy towns now wore the glitzy facade of bedroom communities. Big, brick-fronted, porticoed suburban homes sat on chopped-up pieces of land, their driveways cluttered with SUVs and recreational vehicles. The original clapboard farmhouses had been torn down long ago; only rarely did one peek out from behind a billboard or beside a strip mall.</p><p>But as the highway began to climb, that yuppie sheen disappeared. Here, in the shadow of the lavender-gray peaks of the central Cascade Mountains, the towns were untouched by the march of progress. These towns, with names like Sultan, Goldbar, and Index, were too far out of the way to be gentrified. For now.</p><p>The last stop before Hayden wasn\u2019t a town at all; rather, it was a collection of buildings on the side of the road, the final place to get gas and supplies before the top of the pass. A run-down tavern\u2014the Roadhouse\u2014sat huddled beneath a blinking neon sign that recommended Coors Light.</p><p>Honest to God, she wanted to pull over, walk into that crowded tavern, and lose herself in the smoky darkness. It would certainly be better than saying to Claire after being separated all these years, You\u2019re making a mistake.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t slow down. Instead, she drove the nine miles to Hayden, veered into the exit lane and turned off the freeway. The road immediately telescoped down to two lanes bordered on either side by towering evergreens. The mountains were jagged and cruel-looking. Even in the summer months, snow lay atop their inaccessible peaks.</p><p>A small green sign welcomed her to Hayden, population 872. Home of Lori Adams, 1974 State Spelling Bee Champion.</p><p>Nineteen seventy-four.</p><p>Meghann had first seen this sleepy little town only three years later. Back then, Hayden had been nothing more than a few run-down buildings. The city fathers hadn\u2019t stumbled across the Western motif as a tourist attraction idea yet.</p><p>The memory of driving into town was still fresh. She could practically smell the musty odor of Sam\u2019s old pickup truck, practically feel Claire\u2019s thin body tucked in close beside her. Does he really want us? her sister had whispered every time Sam got out to pump gas or check them into a cheap motel. They\u2019d driven from California to Washington in two days; in that time, almost no words had been exchanged between them. Meghann had felt sick to her stomach the whole time. Each passing mile had made her more afraid that calling Sam had been the wrong thing to do. By the time they\u2019d actually reached Hayden, Meg had run out of optimistic answers to her sister\u2019s questions, so she\u2019d simply tightened her hold on Claire. Sam must have been uncomfortable in the silence, too. He\u2019d cranked the radio up. Elton John\u2019s \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\u201d had been playing when they\u2019d pulled up to the resort.</p><p>Funny, the things one remembered.</p><p>She slowed down. Hayden still looked like the kind of place that welcomed newcomers, where women brought homemade tuna casseroles to the families who moved in across the street.</p><p>But Meghann knew better.</p><p>She\u2019d lived here long enough to know how cruel these nice-looking people could be to a girl who ran with the wrong crowd. Sure, a small town could comfort a person; it could also turn cold fast. When you\u2019d been raised by a stripper and grown up in a trailer on the wrong side of town, you couldn\u2019t move to Mayberry and fit in.</p><p>At least, Meghann hadn\u2019t been able to. Claire had been a different story.</p><p>Meghann came to the one and only stoplight. When it turned green, she hit the gas and sped through town.</p><p>A few miles later she came to the sign.</p><p>River\u2019s Edge Resort. Next Left.</p><p>She turned onto the gravel road. The trees on either side were gigantic. Salal and Volkswagen-size ferns grew in their immense shadows.</p><p>At the first driveway, she slowed again. A cute mailbox, painted to look like a killer whale, read: C. Cavenaugh.</p><p>The once-wild yard had been tamed, trimmed, and planted; it now looked like an English country garden. The house was Martha Stewart perfect\u2014pale, butter-yellow clapboard siding and glossy white trim, a pretty white wraparound porch decorated with hanging pots of geraniums and lobelia.</p><p>Meg had been here only once, after Ali was born. All she remembered about that day was sitting on a shabby sofa, trying to make conversation with her sister. Then the Bluesers had descended\u2014Claire\u2019s friends\u2014they\u2019d swarmed into the house like locusts, chattering and buzzing.</p><p>For an endless hour, Meg had sat there, sipping weak lemonade, thinking about a deposition that had gone badly. Finally, she\u2019d made some idiotic excuse and slipped away. She hadn\u2019t been back since.</p><p>Now she parked and got out of the car. Lugging gifts, she walked up to the front door and knocked.</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>After a long wait, she walked back to the car and drove the five hundred or so yards to the campground\u2019s main office.</p><p>She walked past the swimming pool, where kids were playing Marco Polo, toward the long, narrow log building that served as the registration office. A bell tinkled overhead as she opened the door.</p><p>Sam Cavenaugh stood behind the desk. At her entrance, he looked up. His ready smile faded slowly, then reinforced itself. \u201cHey, Meg. It\u2019s good to see you. It\u2019s been too damn long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure you missed me.\u201d As always, she felt uncomfortable around Sam; angry. Harriet claimed it was because Claire had rejected Meghann in favor of him, but that wasn\u2019t right. She still remembered the day he told her, Go, just leave. He\u2019d thought she was a bad influence on his daughter. But what she\u2019d really hated, the one that stayed with her was just like your damn mother.</p><p>They stared at each other. Thankfully, he kept his distance.</p><p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d Meghann glanced down at her watch. The last thing she wanted to do was stand around not talking with Sam.</p><p>\u201cClaire told me to watch out for you. She\u2019s running a little late. The Ford family, over in campsite seventeen, had a little emergency with their stove. She had to go help them out, but she should be back any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll wait for her at the house, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should be there any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still tough, aren\u2019t you, Meghann?\u201d he said, his voice soft, a little tired even.</p><p>\u201cI had to be, Sam. You know that better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kick you out, Meghann, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked away, let the door slam shut behind her. She was halfway to the car when she heard his voice again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s happy, you know. With this fella,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meghann slowly turned around. \u201cIf I remember correctly, you were happy when you married Mama. I was happy when I married Eric.\u201d</p><p>Sam walked toward her. \u201cYour mama is a piece of work, that\u2019s for sure, and I was mad at her for a lot of years, but I\u2019m glad I married her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be on drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u201d was all he said.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Meghann felt a pinch of jealousy. There it was again\u2014the Claire father-daughter thing. It pissed her off. She ought to be long past that.</p><p>\u201cBe careful with her,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d Once again, she walked away. She strolled through the campground, surprised at the number of guests who were there. All of them seemed to be having a good time. The place was well maintained and perfectly situated. Every view was a picture postcard of mountain, trees, and water. Finally, she returned to her car and drove to Claire\u2019s house.</p> <p>This time when she knocked on the front door, she heard the patter of feet come from inside. The door burst open.</p><p>Alison stood there, dressed in daisy-festooned denim overalls and a pretty yellow eyelet blouse.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be Alison Katherine Cavenaugh. She\u2019s a baby.\u201d</p><p>Ali beamed at that. \u201cI\u2019m a big girl now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>Alison frowned up at her. \u201cYour hair is longer and there\u2019s gray in it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy, thank you for noticing. Can you give your Aunt Meg a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re breathing okay.\u201d</p><p>Meg had no idea what the child meant by that. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Alison moved forward and gave her a lukewarm hug. When she stepped back, Meg said, \u201cI brought you a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d Claire emerged from the shadows at the end of the hallway. \u201cYou thought every five year old needs a Swiss Army Knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A BB gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Meghann laughed. \u201cI went into the bowels of Hell\u2014a toy store at Northgate\u2014and found the dullest-looking salesperson. She recommended this instead.\u201d She handed Alison a brightly wrapped box.</p> <p>Ali ripped it open. \u201cIt\u2019s a Groovy Girl, Mommy. A Groovy Girl!\u201d She flung herself at Meghann, this time hugging for real. She showed the doll to Claire, then ran upstairs.</p><p>Meghann handed Claire a bottle of wine\u2014Far Niente 1997. \u201cThis is one of my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. Their last meeting had been a year ago, when Mama was in town for the Fan-ference. Mama had taken Claire and Ali to the zoo, then later, Meghann had joined them at the Seattle Center. They\u2019d spent most of their time taking Alison for rides in the Fun Forest. That way, they didn\u2019t need to talk.</p><p>Finally Claire surged forward, pulled Meghann into a quickie hug, then let her go.</p><p>Meghann stumbled back, too surprised by the gesture to respond. Afterward, she wished she\u2019d hugged Claire in return. \u201cDinner smells good, but you didn\u2019t have to cook. I wanted to take you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Chuck Wagon smorgasbord isn\u2019t exactly your style. I didn\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, come in. It\u2019s been too long since you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been to my place.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s called small talk, Meg. I wasn\u2019t picking a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Meghann said again, feeling like an idiot.</p><p>She followed Claire to the sofa and sat down beside her. She couldn\u2019t help noticing the ridiculous engagement ring\u2014a band of tinfoil, for God\u2019s sake. It was good she\u2019d come up here. There was no point in putting it off. \u201cClaire, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then he walked into the room. Meghann knew instantly why her sister had fallen so hard. Bobby might be a loser as a singer, but he was a winner in the looks department. He was tall and lean, but broad-shouldered, with blond hair that fell almost to his shoulders. When he smiled, it was with his whole face.</p><p>A man like this didn\u2019t just sweep you off your feet; he twirled you into the air so far and fast there was nowhere to go but down.</p><p>He and Claire exchanged a look that radiated love. Meg was reminded of The Way We Were, that paean to the bittersweet truth that sometimes the wrong man could look so good he took your breath away.</p><p>But sooner or later a woman had to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bobby Austin,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>Meghann rose to her feet and shook his hand. \u201cMeghann Dontess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire says folks call you Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends do, yes.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m judging by that bite-on-a-lemon look of yours that you\u2019d like me to stick with Miz Dontess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine those mountain girls in Arkansas think you\u2019re charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Texas girls sure did.\u201d He put an arm around Claire. \u201cBut those days are behind me now. I\u2019ve found the girl I want to grow old with.\u201d He kissed Claire lightly on the cheek and squeezed her hand, then he took the wine bottle and walked into the kitchen.</p><p>In the few moments he was gone, Meghann stood there, staring at her sister, trying to choose her words with care, but nothing seemed quite right.</p><p>Bobby returned with two glasses of wine and handed one to Meghann. \u201cI imagine you have some questions for me,\u201d he said, sitting down.</p><p>His forthrightness threw Meghann off. Slowly, feeling a little uncertain, she sat down in the chair opposite the sofa. They were separate entities now: Bobby and Claire versus Meghann. \u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething substantive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a facts-and-figures, gal, huh? I\u2019m thirty-seven years old. Graduated from Oklahoma State. Degree in music appreciation. Rodeo scholarship. I was a calf roper. Which is why my knees are gone. I\u2019ve . . . been married.\u201d</p><p>Meghann leaned forward, on alert. \u201cHow many times?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Claire. \u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d Meghann looked at Claire. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding. If marriages were felonies, he\u2019d be in prison for life.\u201d</p><p>He scooted forward. \u201cI married Suellen when we were eighteen years old. She was pregnant, and where I come from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice grew soft. \u201cMiscarriage. After that, there wasn\u2019t much reason to stay married. We lasted less than three months. I\u2019m a slow learner, though. I got married again at twenty-one. Unfortunately, it turned out that she wanted a different life than I did. Nice cars, nice jewelry. I got arrested when they busted her for selling cocaine out of our house. I lived with her for two years and never noticed it. I just thought she was moody as hell. Nobody believed I wasn\u2019t a part of it. Laura was the only one who counted. She was\u2014is\u2014a pediatrician who loves country music. We were married for ten years. It broke up about a year ago. I could tell you why, but it\u2019s none of your business. Claire knows everything, though.\u201d</p><p>A three-time loser and a felon.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>And now the bad sister had to break the good sister\u2019s heart.</p><p>How?</p><p>That was the $64,000 question. How did you say the things that needed to be said at a time like this? Especially with Mr. Better-Looking Than God sitting there? Harriet had been right about one thing: Meghann and Claire had been poised on a cliff of politeness and pretense for years. The wrong approach could send them over the edge.</p><p>Claire got off the sofa, moved toward her. She sat on the carved Chinese chest that served as a coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t be happy for me, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be.\u201d It was the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He wouldn\u2019t get a platinum rating. I know. And you handle divorces for a living. I know that, too. Most of all, I know that you grew up in Mama\u2019s house.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cI know, Meg.\u201d</p><p>Meghann felt the weight of those few words. Her sister had thought of all the same reasons, had seen all the possible outcomes. There wasn\u2019t anything Meghann could say that Claire didn\u2019t already know.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t ever make sense and I know it\u2019s crazy and risky and\u2014worst of all\u2014Mama-like. I don\u2019t need you to tell me these things. What I need is for you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Trust. Exactly what Harriet had predicted. But Meghann had forgotten long ago how to trust people. If she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for you, I know. The leader of the pack never makes a good follower. But it would mean a lot to me if you\u2019d let this go. Maybe hug me and say you\u2019re happy for me. Even if it\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked into her sister\u2019s pale green eyes. Claire looked frightened right now; expectant, too. She was obviously preparing herself to be wounded by Meghann\u2019s response, but a slim part of her couldn\u2019t help believing. . . .</p><p>It reminded Meghann of their childhood. Whenever Mama had brought a new \u201cfriend\u201d home, Claire had let herself believe that finally there would be a daddy in her life. Meghann had tried to protect Claire from her own optimism, but she\u2019d never succeeded, and so, each stepfather had broken a tiny piece of Claire\u2019s heart. And yet, when the next man arrived, her sister found a way to believe again.</p><p>Of course Claire believed in Bobby Austin.</p><p>There was no way Meghann would change her sister\u2019s mind, or\u2014more important\u2014her heart. Thus, she had two choices: pretend to give her blessing or stick to her guns. The first choice allowed her and Claire to remain the almost sisters they were. The second choice risked even that tenuous relationship.</p><p>\u201cI trust you, Claire,\u201d Meghann said at last. She was rewarded with a small, uncertain smile. \u201cIf you say Bobby Austin is the man you love, that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Claire released a sharp breath. \u201cThank you. I know that wasn\u2019t easy for you.\u201d She leaned forward and hugged Meghann, who was too surprised by it to hug her back.</p><p>Claire drew back and stood up. She went over to the sofa and sat down by Bobby, who immediately put an arm around her and pulled her in close.</p><p>Meghann tried to think of what to say in the awkward silence that followed. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the wedding plan? Justice of the peace? I have a friend who\u2019s a judge. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Claire laughed. \u201cI waited thirty-five years for this. I\u2019m having the whole enchilada. White dress. Formal church wedding. Cake. Reception with dancing. All of it.\u201d</p><p>Meghann didn\u2019t know why she was surprised. Claire had been one of those children who played bride endlessly. \u201cThere\u2019s a consultant in my building. I think she planned Bill Gates\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Hayden, not Seattle. I\u2019ll rent the VFW hall and everyone will pitch in with potluck. The Bon March\u00e9 has a bridal department now. It\u2019ll be great. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPotluck? Potluck?\u201d Meghann got to her feet. Apparently there was something of her mother in her after all. She wasn\u2019t going to let her sister have a Wal-Mart wedding. \u201cI\u2019ll organize the wedding and reception,\u201d she said impulsively. Once she\u2019d offered, she felt steady again. In control of something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire\u2019s smile faded. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a social moron. I can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . but . . . your job is so hectic. I couldn\u2019t ask you to take time out of your busy schedule for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask. I offered. And it so happens that I find myself . . . underutilized at work.\u201d The idea seized hold of her. Maybe it could bring them together. \u201cThis would be perfect, really. I\u2019d like to do this for you, Claire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Claire sounded underwhelmed. Meghann knew what her sister was thinking\u2014Meghann was a bull in a small-town china shop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll listen to you and do what you want. It\u2019ll be your wedding. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it sounds great,\u201d Bobby said, smiling broadly. \u201cYou\u2019re very generous, Meghann.\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned at Meghann. \u201cWhy am I seeing Father of the Bride playing in my head? You never do anything in a small way, Meg.\u201d</p><p>Meghann felt awkward suddenly, vulnerable. She wasn\u2019t certain why she wanted this so badly. \u201cI will this time. Honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Claire said finally. \u201cYou can help me plan my wedding.\u201d</p><p>Meghann grinned and clapped her hands. \u201cGood. Now, I better get started. Where\u2019s a local phone book? And what\u2019s the date again\u2014the twenty-third? Next Saturday? That\u2019s not much time to pull this together.\u201d She headed for the kitchen, where she found a scrap of paper and began a to-do list.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d she heard her sister say. \u201cI\u2019ve created a monster.\u201d</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>BY THE SECOND NIGHT IN HIS SISTER\u2019S HOUSE, JOE FELT AS IF he were suffocating. Everywhere he looked he saw glimpses of his old life. He didn\u2019t know how he was going to go forward, but he knew he couldn\u2019t stay here.</p><p>He waited until Gina left to go grocery shopping, then crammed his things\u2014including several framed photographs of Diana that he\u2019d taken from the house\u2014into the old backpack and headed for the door. He left a note on the kitchen counter.</p> <p>Can\u2019t stay here. Sorry. Hurts too much.</p><p>I know this is a rough time for you, so</p><p>I won\u2019t go far. Will call soon. Love you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>J.</p><p>He walked the few miles back to town. By the time he reached Hayden, it felt as if he were slogging through mud. He was tired again, weary.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to run away, didn\u2019t want to hunker down in some shitty little motel room and gnaw on the old guilt.</p><p>He looked up and saw a sign for the Mountain View Cemetery. A shiver passed through him. The last time he\u2019d been there it had been pouring rain. There had been two policemen beside him, shadowing his every move. The mourners had kept their distance. He\u2019d felt their condemnation, heard their whispers.</p> <p>He\u2019d tried to walk away during the ceremony, but the police yanked him back in line. He\u2019d whispered, I can\u2019t watch this in a broken voice. One of his guards had said, Too bad and held him in place.</p><p>He should go there now, to the cemetery. But he couldn\u2019t do it, couldn\u2019t kneel on the sweet green grass in front of her headstone.</p><p>Besides, he wouldn\u2019t find her at the cemetery. There was more of her in his heart than beneath any gray stone.</p><p>He skirted town and hiked across an empty field toward the river. The soft, gurgling sounds sparked a dozen memories of their youth. Days they\u2019d picnicked along the water\u2019s edge and nights they\u2019d parked there, making love in the dark interior of the Dodge Charger he\u2019d once owned.</p><p>He knelt there.</p><p>\u201cHey, Di.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut, battling a wave of guilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home. What now?\u201d</p><p>No answer came to him on the summer breeze, no scent of Red wafted his way. And yet, he knew. She was glad he\u2019d come back.</p><p>He opened his eyes again, stared at the silver caps of the current. \u201cI can\u2019t go to the house.\u201d The thought of it made him almost ill. Three years ago, he\u2019d walked out of their home on Bainbridge Island and never looked back. Her clothes were still in the closet. Her toothbrush was still by the sink.</p><p>No way he could go there. His only hope\u2014if there was any hope at all\u2014lay in baby steps. He didn\u2019t have to move toward his old life; he simply had to stop running from it.</p><p>\u201cI could get a job in Hayden,\u201d he said after a long silence.</p><p>Staying in town would be difficult, he knew. So many people remembered what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d have to endure the looks . . . the gossip.</p><p>\u201cI could try it.\u201d</p><p>With that, he found that he could breathe again.</p><p>He spent another hour there, kneeling in the grass, remembering. Then, finally, he climbed to his feet and walked back to town.</p><p>There were a few people milling around the streets, and more than one face peered frowningly up at him, but no one approached him. He saw when he was recognized, saw the way old friends lurched at the sight of him, drew back. He kept his head down, kept moving. He was about to give up on the whole damn idea of finding a job here when he came to the end of town. He stood across the street from Riverfront Park, staring at a collection of cars, all lined up on a patch of gravel behind a sagging chain-link fence. A metal Quonset hut advertised Smitty\u2019s, The Best Auto Shop in Hayden.</p><p>On the chain-link fence was a sign: Help Wanted. Experience requested, but who am I kidding?</p><p>Joe crossed the street and headed toward the entrance.</p><p>A dog started barking. He noticed the Beware of Dog sign. Seconds later, a miniature white poodle came tearing around the corner.</p><p>\u201cMadonna, stop that damn yapping.\u201d An old man stepped out from the shadowed darkness of the Quonset hut. He wore oil-stained overalls and a Mariners baseball cap. A long white beard hid the lower half of his face. \u201cDon\u2019t mind the dog. What can I do ya for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your help-wanted sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kiddin\u2019.\u201d The old man slapped his thigh. \u201cThat thing\u2019s been up there since Jeremy Forman went off to college. Hell, that\u2019s been pret near on two years now. I\u2014\u201d He paused, stepped forward, frowning slowly. \u201cJoe Wyatt?\u201d</p><p>He tensed. \u201cHey, Smitty.\u201d</p><p>Smitty blew out a heavy breath. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back. And I need a job. But if it\u2019d cost you customers to hire me, I understand. No hard feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a job wrenching? But you\u2019re a doctor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat life is over.\u201d</p><p>Smitty stared at him a long time, then said, \u201cYou remember my son, Phil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a lot older than me, but yeah. He used to drive that red Camaro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVietnam ruined him. Guilt, I think. He did stuff over there. . . . Anyway, I\u2019ve seen a man run before. It isn\u2019t good. Of course I\u2019ll hire you, Joe. The cabin still comes with the job. You want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Smitty nodded, then led the way through the Quonset hut and out the other end. The backyard was big and well maintained. Flowers grew in riotous clumps along the walkway. There, a thicket of towering evergreens stood clustered behind the small log cabin. Moss furred the roof; the front porch sagged precariously.</p><p>\u201cYou were a teenager the last time you lived here. I couldn\u2019t keep track of all the girls you dated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Smitty sighed. \u201cHelga still keeps it spick-\u2019n\u2019-span clean. She\u2019ll be glad to have you back.\u201d</p><p>Joe followed Smitty to the cabin.</p><p>Inside, it was as clean as always. A red-striped woolen blanket covered an old leather sofa and a rocking chair sat next to the river-rock fireplace. The yellow Formica-clad kitchen appeared well stocked for appliances and pots and pans, and a single bedroom boasted a queen-size four-poster bed.</p><p>Joe reached out and shook Smitty\u2019s bear-claw hand. \u201cThank you, Smitty,\u201d he said, surprised at how deep his gratitude ran. His throat felt tight.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people in this town who care about you, Joe. You seem to have forgotten that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice to hear. Still, I\u2019d be happier if no one knew I was here, for a while, anyway. I don\u2019t . . . feel comfortable around people anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long road back from something like that, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very long road.\u201d</p><p>After Smitty left, Joe burrowed through his backpack for one of the framed photographs that he\u2019d taken from his sister\u2019s house. He stared down at Diana\u2019s smiling face. \u201cIt\u2019s a start,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>Meghann woke up disoriented. In the first place, the room was dark. Second, it was quiet. No honking horns and sirens and the beep-beep-beep of trucks in reverse gear. At first she thought a radio was on, in a room down the hall. Then she realized that the noise was birdsong. Birdsong, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>Claire\u2019s house.</p><p>She sat up in bed. The beautifully decorated guest room was oddly comforting. Everywhere were handmade trinkets\u2014proof of time spent on the little things\u2014as well as Ali\u2019s artwork. Framed photographs cluttered every surface. In another time and place, Meghann might have laughed at the crudely painted macaroni-coated egg carton that acted as a jewelry box. Here, in her sister\u2019s house, it made her smile. When she looked at it, she pictured Ali, with her pudgy little fingers, gluing and placing and painting. And Claire, clapping with pride when the project was done; then proudly displaying it. All the things their own mama wouldn\u2019t have had time for.</p><p>There was a knock at the door, then a hesitantly called out \u201cMeg?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the bedside clock.</p><p>Ten fifteen.</p><p>Oh, man. She rubbed her eyes, which felt like a sandpit from lack of sleep. As usual, she\u2019d tossed and turned all night. \u201cI\u2019m up,\u201d she said, throwing the covers back.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast is on the table,\u201d Claire said through the closed door. \u201cI\u2019m going to go clean the swimming pool. We\u2019ll leave at about eleven, if that\u2019s still okay?\u201d</p><p>It took Meghann a second to remember. She\u2019d promised to join Claire and her friends in town. Wedding-dress shopping in Hayden with grown women who called themselves the Bluesers.</p><p>Meghann groaned. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>Meghann listened to the footsteps as Claire walked away. How long could she keep up this charade of I\u2019m your sister, I support your wedding? Sooner or later, her head would pop off, or\u2014worse\u2014her mouth would open and her opinion would explode, bomblike: You can\u2019t marry him. You don\u2019t know him. Be smart.</p><p>None of these opinions would sit well.</p><p>And yet, because Meghann couldn\u2019t return to work, had no friends to call, and no true vacation plans, she found herself preparing to plan her sister\u2019s wedding. Honestly, who could possibly be worse for the job?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even remember the last wedding she\u2019d attended. Oh, yes she could.</p><p>Hers.</p><p>Of course, it hadn\u2019t been the wedding that sent them on the wrong road; it was the pairing up that had done it.</p><p>She got out of bed and went to the door. Opening it a crack, she peeked out. Everything was quiet. She hurried down the hallway to the small second-floor bathroom. An unopened traveler\u2019s toothbrush lay on the side of the sink, no doubt a quick repossession from the \u201cresort\u2019s\u201d mini store. She brushed her teeth, then took a quick, very hot shower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thirty minutes later, she was ready to go, re-dressed in yesterday\u2019s clothes\u2014a white Dolce &amp; Gabbana blouse, a pair of low-rise Marc Jacobs jeans, and a wide brown belt with a silver circle buckle.</p><p>She quickly picked up the bathroom, made her bed, and left the house.</p><p>Outside, the sun shone brightly on the well-tended yard. It was late June, a glorious time of year in the Northwest. So much was in bloom. There was color everywhere in the yard, all of it backed and bordered by glossy green bushes and a thicket of trees. At the far end, looking almost close enough to touch, the granite triangle of Formidable Peak pushed up toward a high layer of clouds.</p><p>Meghann tossed her purse onto the passenger seat of her Porsche and got inside. The engine growled to life. She drove toward the resort slowly, careful not to stir up too much dust on the gravel road. It was a short distance, maybe five hundred yards between the house and the registration office, but her high-heeled sandals couldn\u2019t handle the loose stone.</p> <p>Finally, she pulled up in front of the registration building and parked. Choosing a careful path through the dewy grass, she went into the building.</p><p>It was empty.</p><p>She went to the desk and found the Hayden phone book, then flipped to Wedding Consultants. There was one listing. Royal Event Planning. In fine print it read: Pretend you\u2019ll only get married once.</p><p>Meghann couldn\u2019t help smiling at that. A cynic with humor. Who better to help Meghann plan a wedding? She wrote down the number and put it in her purse.</p><p>She found Claire in the campground\u2019s rest room, plunging a backed-up toilet. At Meghann\u2019s horrified expression, Claire laughed. \u201cGo on outside, hotshot. I\u2019ll be out in a sec.\u201d</p> <p>Meghann backed out and stood on the edge of the grass.</p><p>True to her word, Claire was out in no time. \u201cI\u2019ll wash up and we\u2019ll go.\u201d She looked at the Boxster. \u201cYou drove over here?\u201d Laughing, she walked away.</p><p>Meghann got in the car and started it up. The stereo immediately came on, too loud. \u201cHotel California.\u201d She put the convertible top down and waited.</p><p>Finally Claire reappeared, wearing a pair of jeans and a River\u2019s Edge Resort T-shirt. She tossed her canvas handbag behind the seat and climbed in. \u201cNow, this is going to town in style.\u201d</p><p>Meghann didn\u2019t know if Claire intended that remark as a put-down or not, so she kept silent. Actually, that was her new mantra: Shut up and smile.</p><p>\u201cYou sure slept late,\u201d Claire said, turning down the music. \u201cI thought you usually got to the office by seven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had trouble sleeping last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about me, Meg. Please.\u201d</p><p>Meghann was trapped by that quiet please. She couldn\u2019t let her sister think the insomnia was because of the wedding. \u201cIt\u2019s not the wedding. I never sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it started in college. Cramming all night for exams. You know how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Meghann had been trying to protect Claire, to hide the fact that the insomnia had started when their family fell apart, but college had been the wrong tack. To Claire, it was another reminder of everything between them, one more instance of Meghann lording it over her sister. Over the years, Claire had made dozens of remarks about her brainiac older sister who started college early. It was a touchy subject. \u201cFrom what I hear, motherhood causes a few all-nighters, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know something about babies. Mama said I was colicky. A real pain in the ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, like Mama would know. You didn\u2019t have colic. You had ear infections. When you were sick, you wailed like a banshee. I used to carry you, screaming, down to the Laundromat. If I sat on top of the dryer, holding you, you\u2019d finally fall asleep. Mama always wondered what happened to all her quarters.\u201d</p><p>Meghann felt Claire\u2019s gaze on her. She tried to think of something to say, a way to change the conversation, but she came up empty.</p><p>Claire finally laughed, but the sound was brittle. \u201cNo wonder I don\u2019t mind doing the laundry. Turn here.\u201d</p><p>They were on safe land once again, she and Claire; each standing on her separate shore.</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d Claire pointed to an old Victorian house, painted Pepto-Bismol pink with lavender trim. A gravel walkway cut through a perfectly shorn lawn. On either side were bright red roses in full bloom. The white picket fence bore a hand-painted sign that read: Miss Abigail\u2019s Drawers. Come on in.</p><p>Meghann looked up at the ridiculously cute house. \u201cWe could zip down to Escada or Nordstrom. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be yourself, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll be Tammy Faye. Or better yet, Small-Town Sally. Lead on. I\u2019ll shut my mouth.\u201d</p><p>They walked up the rickety stairs and entered the store. There was merchandise everywhere\u2014plastic flowers and seashell picture frames, and Christmas ornaments made of painted dough. The fireplace screen was alight with votive candles.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d Claire called out.</p><p>There was an immediate response. A gaggle of women\u2019s voices, then a herd of running footsteps.</p><p>A large, older woman barreled around the corner, her gray sausage-curled hair bobbing like Cindy\u2019s on The Brady Bunch. She wore a floral muumuu and white pom-pomed mule slippers. \u201cClaire Cavenaugh. I\u2019m so glad to finally be able to show you the second floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding dresses are on the second floor,\u201d Claire said to Meghann. \u201cAbby had given up on me.\u201d</p><p>Before Meghann could respond, two other women hurried into the room. One was short and wore a baggy, waistless dress and white tennis shoes. The other was tall, perhaps too thin, and dressed flawlessly in beige silk.</p><p>Two of the Bluesers. Meg recognized the women but couldn\u2019t have matched a name to a face for all the prize money in the world.</p><p>Waistless dress, she learned, was Gina, and beige silk was Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cKaren couldn\u2019t make it today,\u201d Gina said, eyeing Meghann suspiciously. \u201cWillie had an orthodontist appointment and Dottie sat on her glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Charlotte said, \u201can ordinary Karen day.\u201d</p><p>They all started talking at once.</p><p>Meghann watched Claire fall in beside Charlotte and Abigail. They were talking about lace and beadwork and veils.</p><p>All Meg could think was: The perfect accessory is a prenup. It made her feel decades older than these women, and distinctly apart.</p><p>\u201cSo. Meghann. The last time I saw you, Alison was a newborn.\u201d Gina stood beside a cast-iron statue of a crane. \u201cNow you\u2019re back for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s friends had always been good at the not-so-subtle reminder than Meghann didn\u2019t belong here. \u201cHello, Gina. It\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Gina looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you could get away from the office. I hear you\u2019re the best divorce attorney in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss Claire\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a divorce attorney. She\u2019s good at breaking up families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we do.\u201d</p><p>A look passed through Gina\u2019s eyes. Her voice softened. \u201cDo you ever put them back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot often.\u201d</p><p>Gina\u2019s face seemed to fall; it crumpled like an old paper bag, and Meghann understood. \u201cYou\u2019re going through a divorce.\u201d</p><p>Gina tried valiantly to smile. \u201cJust finished it, actually. Tell me it\u2019ll get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d Meg said softly. \u201cBut it may take a while. There are several support groups that might help you.\u201d She started to reach into her purse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the Bluesers to cry with, but thank you. I appreciate the honesty. Now let\u2019s go upstairs and find your sister the perfect wedding dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Hayden?\u201d</p><p>Gina laughed at that and led Meg upstairs. By the time they got there, Claire was already wearing the first dress. It had huge leg-of-mutton sleeves, a sweetheart neckline, and a skirt that looked like an upside-down teacup. Meg sat down in an ornate white wicker chair. Gina stood behind her.</p><p>\u201cOh, my. That\u2019s lovely,\u201d Abigail said, \u201cand it\u2019s thirty-three percent off.\u201d</p><p>Claire stood in front of a three-paneled full-length mirror, turning this way and that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very princesslike,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>Claire looked at Meg. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Meghann wasn\u2019t sure what was expected of her. Honesty or support. She took another look at the dress and knew support was impossible. \u201cOf course the dress is on sale. It\u2019s hideous.\u201d</p><p>Claire climbed down from the platform and went in search of a different dress.</p><p>At her exit, Charlotte and Abigail looked at Meghann. Neither woman was smiling.</p><p>She\u2019d been too honest\u2014a common flaw\u2014and now she was suspect. The outsider.</p><p>She would not comment on the next dress. She absolutely would not.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Claire asked a few moments later.</p><p>Meg squirmed in her chair. Was this a joke? The dress looked like something you\u2019d wear to a formal hoedown. Maybe the Country Music Awards. The only thing missing was a beaded milking pan. The dress was ugly. Period. And cheap-looking, to boot.</p><p>Claire studied herself in the mirror, again turning this way and that. Then she turned to look at Meghann. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the vomit backing up in my throat. I can\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s smile froze. \u201cI take it that\u2019s a negative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cheap dress from the Bon March\u00e9 is a negative. That piece of lace-festooned shit is a get-me-the-hell-out-of-here-you\u2019ve-lost-your-mind thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re being a bit harsh,\u201d Abigail said, puffing up like a colorful blowfish.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her wedding,\u201d Meg said. \u201cNot a tryout for Little House on the Prairie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister is always harsh,\u201d Claire said quietly, walking back into the dressing room.</p><p>Meghann sighed. She\u2019d screwed up again, wielded her opinion like a blunt instrument to the back of the head. She hunkered down in her chair and clamped her mouth shut.</p><p>The remainder of the afternoon was a mind-wrecking parade of cheap dresses. One after another, Claire zipped in, got opinions, and zipped out. She didn\u2019t again ask for Meghann\u2019s opinion, and Meghann knew better than to offer it. Instead, she leaned back in her chair and rested her head against the wall.</p><p>A jab in the rib cage woke her up. She blinked, leaned forward. Charlotte, Abigail, and Claire were walking away from her, talking animatedly until they disappeared into a room marked Hats and Veils.</p><p>Gina was staring at her. \u201cI\u2019d heard you could be a bitch, but falling asleep while your sister tries on wedding dresses is pretty rude.\u201d</p><p>Meghann wiped her eyes. \u201cIt was the only way I could keep quiet. I\u2019ve seen better-looking dresses on Denny\u2019s waitresses. Believe me, I was doing her a favor. Did she find one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to say thank God, but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s another shop in town.\u201d Meghann frowned suddenly. \u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019m a bitch? Is that what Claire says?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Yes. Sometimes. You know how it is when you\u2019re drinking margaritas on a bad day. Karen calls her sister Susan the Soulless Psychopath. Claire calls you Jaws.\u201d</p><p>Meghann wanted to smile but couldn\u2019t. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember when she moved here, you know,\u201d Gina said softly. \u201cShe was quiet as a mouse and cried if you looked at her the wrong way. All she\u2019d say for years was that she missed her sister. I didn\u2019t find out until after graduation what had happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019d done, you mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not one to judge. Hell, I\u2019ve waded through some ugly shit in my life, and motherhood is the hardest job in the world. Even if you\u2019re grown-up and ready for it. My point is this: Claire was wounded by all of that, and sometimes, when she hurts the most, she turns into Polly Politeness. She\u2019s really nice, but the temperature in the rooms drops about twenty-five degrees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve pretty much needed a coat all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStick with it. Whether she admits it or not, it means a lot to her that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I\u2019d plan the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem perfectly suited for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. I\u2019m a real romantic.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is listen to Claire. Really listen, and then do whatever you can to make her dream come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could get the info and report back to me. Sort of a CIA-like mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you sat down for a drink with your sister and just talked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put it this way: We wouldn\u2019t have been old enough to have wine with our meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Go with her now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Alison\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam can take care of Ali. I\u2019ll let him know.\u201d She opened her purse and dug through it, finally pulling out a scrap of paper. She wrote something down and handed it to Meghann. \u201cHere\u2019s my cell phone number. Call me in an hour and I\u2019ll let you know Ali\u2019s schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire won\u2019t want to go with me. Especially not after I nixed the dresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd fell asleep. The snoring was especially poignant. Anyway, I got the impression from Claire that other people\u2019s needs or wants didn\u2019t matter much to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t pull any punches, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThus, the divorce. Take Claire out for dinner. Go see a movie. Look at wedding flowers. Do something sisterly. It\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>CLAIRE KNEW HER LIPS WERE DRAWN IN A TIGHT, unyielding line that communicated displeasure. She\u2019d honed that skill; the ability to convey anger without having to form the words that would make her feel regret afterward. Her dad often remarked on this talent of hers. Lordy, Claire, he\u2019d say, no one else can yell at me without saying a word. Someday all that silent anger of yours is gonna back up in your throat and choke you.</p> <p>She glanced sideways at her sister, who was behind the wheel, driving too fast, her black hair flapping behind her like some celebrity starlet\u2019s. Sunglasses that probably cost more than Claire\u2019s net worth covered her eyes. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked for the fourth time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Always the same answer. Clipped and unadorned. As if Meghann were afraid to say more.</p><p>She\u2019d fallen asleep.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if Claire asked much of her sister. Hell, nothing was farther from the truth. She hadn\u2019t expected her sister to join in the fun of buying a wedding gown. God, no. Meghann enjoy a day with girlfriends? Hardly.</p><p>What galled most was that Claire had asked Meg\u2019s opinion first, even with Gina and Charlotte right there. Claire had put her neediness on the table: What do you think, Meghann?</p><p>She\u2019d asked her twice. After the second time, she rectified her mistake and ignored Meghann completely.</p><p>Then she\u2019d heard the snores.</p><p>That was when she\u2019d felt the sting of tears.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t helped, of course, that all of the dresses had been wrong, or that even ugly dresses were expensive these days, or that, by the end of the afternoon, she\u2019d actually begun to think that a white sundress might be more practical. That had only brought the tears closer. But now Claire was just plain mad. Meghann would ruin this wedding; there was no doubt about it. Her sister was like an airborne virus. Ten seconds in the room with her and you began to feel sick.</p><p>\u201cI need to get back to Ali,\u201d Claire said, also for the fourth time.</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>Claire took a deep breath. Enough was enough. \u201cLook, Meg, about planning my wedding. Honestly, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Meg tucked the silver Porsche into an empty parking spot on the street. Before Claire could respond, Meghann was out of the car and standing by the meter. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>They were in downtown Seattle now. Her sister\u2019s territory. Meg probably wanted to show off her hugely expensive condo.</p><p>Claire frowned. They were parked at the base of a long, slowly rising hill. Up ahead\u2014maybe six blocks away\u2014she could see the Public Market. Behind them, also several blocks away, was the ferry terminal. A street musician played a sad tune on a saxophone; the music floated above the traffic noises. To their left, a waterfall of concrete steps spilled down the courtyard of a condo complex. Across the street was a Diamond Parking lot, the stalls mostly empty on this non-game day.</p><p>\u201cDo you live here?\u201d Claire asked as she grabbed her bag and climbed out of the sports car. \u201cI always pictured you in some sleek high-rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited you to my place a ton of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice. You invited me over once that day Mama was in town for the el creepo convention and once for Christmas dinner. You canceled the Christmas dinner because you got the flu, and Mama took us out for dinner at Canlis instead.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked surprised by that. \u201cReally? I thought I was always asking you to see my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were. You just never set up a day and time. I was always supposed to stop by when I was in town. News flash: I\u2019m never in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem a little hostile today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? I can\u2019t imagine why.\u201d Claire slung her purse strap over her shoulder and fell into step beside Meghann, who was marching uphill like Patton. \u201cWe need to talk about the wedding. Your performance this morning\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Meghann said, stopping suddenly in front of a narrow white door flanked by windows on either side. A small iron-scrolled sign read: By Design. A man in a severe black suit was busily undressing a mannequin behind the glass. He saw Meghann and waved her in.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I could plan your wedding, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to discuss with you. Unfortunately, your listening skills are seriously underdeveloped.\u201d</p><p>Meg opened the door and went inside.</p><p>Claire hesitated.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Meghann waited for her in front of an elevator.</p><p>Claire followed.</p><p>A second later, the elevator pinged and the doors slid open. They went in; the doors closed.</p><p>Finally, Meghann said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this morning. I know I screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping is one thing. Snoring is another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Claire sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of our lives, Meg. Don\u2019t you get tired of it? One of us is always sorry about something, but we never\u2014\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened.</p><p>Claire gasped.</p><p>Meg had to lay a hand on her shoulder and gently shove her forward. She stumbled over the off-kilter threshold and into the store.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t a store. That was like calling Disneyland a carnival.</p><p>There were mannequins everywhere, poised perfectly, and dressed in the most beautiful wedding dresses Claire had ever seen. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d she breathed, stepping forward. The gown in front of her was an off-the-shoulder creation, nipped at the waist. Ivory silk charmeuse fell in folds to the floor. Claire felt the fabric\u2014softer than anything she\u2019d ever touched\u2014and peeked at the price tag. It read: Escada $4,200.</p><p>She let go of it suddenly and turned to Meghann. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Her throat felt tight. She was a little girl again, standing in the hallway of a friend\u2019s house, watching a family have dinner together.</p><p>Meg grabbed her wrist, wouldn\u2019t let her go. \u201cI want you to try on dresses here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I know you\u2019re just being you, Meg. But this . . . hurts a little. I work at a campground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say this twice, Claire, so please listen and believe me. I work eighty-five hours a week, and my clients pay almost four hundred dollars an hour. I\u2019m not showing off. It\u2019s a fact: Money is something I have. It would mean a lot to me to buy you this wedding gown. You don\u2019t belong in the dresses we saw this morning. I\u2019m sorry if you think I\u2019m a bitch and a snob, but that\u2019s how I feel. Please. Let me do this for you.\u201d</p><p>Before Claire had come up with her answer, a woman cried out, \u201cMeghann Dontess. In a wedding shop. Who would ever believe it?\u201d</p><p>A tall, rail-thin woman in a navy blue sheath dress strode forward, her impossibly high heels clacking on the marble floor. Her hair, a perfect combination of white-blond and silver, stood out from her face in a Meg Ryan\u2013type cut.</p><p>\u201cHello, Risa,\u201d Meg said, extending her hand. The women shook hands, then Risa looked at Claire.</p><p>\u201cThis is the great one\u2019s baby sister, yes?\u201d</p><p>Claire heard the barest hint of an Eastern European accent. Maybe even Russian. \u201cI\u2019m Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Meghann is letting you marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s advised against it, actually.\u201d</p><p>Risa threw back her head and laughed. \u201cOf course she advised against it. I have heard such advice from her twice. Both times I should have listened, yes, but love will have its way.\u201d She took a step back, studying Claire from head to toe.</p><p>Claire fisted her left hand, hiding the tinfoil ring.</p><p>Risa tapped a long, dark fingernail against her front teeth. \u201cThis is not what I expected,\u201d she said, glancing pointedly at Meghann. \u201cYou said your sister was a country girl. Getting married in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t know whether to smile or smack Meghann in the head. \u201cI am a small-town girl. Meghann used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. That must be where she left her heart, yes?\u201d Risa tapped her teeth again. \u201cYou are beautiful,\u201d she said at last. \u201cSize ten or twelve, I expect. We won\u2019t need to pad your bra.\u201d She turned to Meghann. \u201cCan she get an appointment with Renaldo? The hair . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must accentuate those beautiful eyes. So blue. It makes me think of Brad Pitt\u2019s wife. The nervous one from Friends. Yes. This is who your sister looks like. For her, I think the classics. Prada. Valentino. Armani. Wang. Maybe a vintage Azzaro. Come.\u201d She turned and began marching away. Her hand snaked out now and then to grab a dress.</p><p>Claire looked at Meghann. \u201cArmani? Vera Wang?\u201d She shook her head, unable to say, You can\u2019t do this. They were the right words, the thing she should say, but the denial of this moment caught in her throat. What little girl hadn\u2019t dreamed of this? Especially a girl who had believed in love even after so many broken promises. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can always leave without buying anything,\u201d Meghann said. \u201cTry them on. Just for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry up, you two! I haven\u2019t the whole day.\u201d Risa\u2019s voice rang out, startling Claire, who hurried forward.</p><p>Meghann hung back as Risa went from rack to rack, piling one dress after another into her arms.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Claire stepped into a dressing area that was bigger than her bedroom. Three floor-to-ceiling mirrors fanned out in front of her. A small wooden platform stood in the center.</p><p>\u201cGo on. The dresses are in there. Try one on,\u201d Risa gave her a gentle shove.</p><p>Claire went into the dressing room, where several gowns hung waiting. The first one was a stunning white silk Ralph Lauren with an intricate lace-and-beadwork patterned bodice. Another was a romantic peach-tinged ivory Prada with ruffled, capped sleeves and a slightly asymmetrical hemline. There was a white silk Armani sheath: simplicity itself with a plunging V neck and a draped, sexy back.</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t allow herself to look at the prices. This was her make-believe moment. She could afford anything. She peeled out of her wrinkled jeans and work T-shirt and tossed them on the floor. (She did not look at her faded, overwashed JCPenney bra and Jockey-for-Her underwear.)</p><p>The Ralph Lauren gown floated over her shoulders like a cloud and fell down her nearly naked body. From the neck down, she looked like Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, honey. Let\u2019s see,\u201d Risa said.</p><p>She opened the door and stepped into the dressing area.</p><p>There was a gasp at her entrance. Then Risa shouted, \u201cShoes!\u201d and ran off.</p><p>Meg stood there, holding an armful of dresses. Her lips parted in a soft sigh.</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t help smiling. At the same time, she had the oddest urge to cry. \u201cThat Ralph Lauren is no slouch. Of course, my car cost less than this dress.\u201d She stepped up onto the platform and looked at herself in the mirror. No wonder Meghann had hated the gowns this morning.</p><p>Risa came back, brandishing a pair of strappy high-heeled sandals.</p> <p>Claire laughed. \u201cWho do you think I am\u2014Carrie Bradshaw? My nose would bleed if I wore heels that high. Not to mention the fact that I\u2019d break a hip when I fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. Put them on.\u201d</p><p>Claire did as she was told, then stood very still. Every breath threatened to send her toppling off the block.</p><p>\u201cAagh. Your mother, she did not teach you to stand in heels. A crime. I get you pumps.\u201d Her mouth twisted slightly at the last word.</p><p>When Risa disappeared, Meghann laughed. \u201cThe only thing Mama taught us was how to walk in shoes you\u2019d outgrown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always had a new pair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny thing.\u201d</p><p>A look passed between them, a moment of perfect understanding; when it passed, and they were back in ordinary time, Claire felt a tug of regret.</p> <p>\u201cI think the fabric is too flimsy, don\u2019t you?\u201d Claire said. Her job was to find a flaw in each dress, a reason her sister shouldn\u2019t spend this much money.</p><p>Meghann frowned. \u201cToo flimsy? You look gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hangs on every bulge. I\u2019d have to wear undergarments made by Boeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire. It\u2019s a size ten. One more comment like that and you\u2019ll qualify for the Hollywood Wives Eating Disorder League.\u201d</p><p>After that, Claire tried on a succession of dresses, each one more beautiful than the last. She felt like a princess, and it didn\u2019t ruin the day at all that she had to decline each one. She could always find one tiny thing that made the dress less than perfect. The sleeves are too short, too wide, too ruffled. . . . The neckline is too sweet, too sexy, too traditional. . . . The feel of this one isn\u2019t right.</p><p>She could tell that Meghann was getting frustrated. She kept delivering armfuls of gowns. \u201cHere, try these,\u201d she said every time. Meg and patience had never known each other well.</p><p>Risa had long ago gone on to other customers.</p><p>Finally, Claire came to the last dress of the day. Meghann had chosen it. An elegant white gown with a heavily beaded tank bodice and a flowing taffeta silk skirt.</p><p>Claire unhooked her bra and stepped into the dress. She was still fastening the back as she stepped out of the dressing room.</p><p>Meghann was completely silent.</p><p>Claire frowned. She heard Risa in another part of the store, chattering loudly to another customer.</p><p>Claire looked at her sister. \u201cYou\u2019re uncharacteristically quiet. Should I begin the Heimlich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Claire lifted the heavy skirt off the ground and stepped up onto the platform. Slowly, she faced the trifold mirror.</p><p>The woman who stared back at her wasn\u2019t Claire Cavenaugh. No. This woman hadn\u2019t partied her way out of a state college and decided that cosmetology was a viable career choice, only to quit attending those classes as well . . . she hadn\u2019t borne a child out of wedlock because her lover refused to marry her . . . and she certainly didn\u2019t manage a campground that pretended it was a resort.</p><p>This woman arrived in limousines and drank champagne from fluted glasses. She slept on high-thread-count sheets and always had a current passport.</p><p>This was the woman she could have been, if she\u2019d gone to college in New York and done graduate work in Paris. Maybe it was the woman she could still become.</p><p>How could a dress highlight everything that had gone wrong with your life and subtly promise a different future? She imagined the look on Bobby\u2019s face when she walked down the aisle. Bobby, who\u2019d knelt on one knee when he asked her to please, please be his wife. If he saw her in this dress . . .</p><p>Meghann came up behind her, stood on the platform.</p><p>There they were, side by side. Mama\u2019s girls, who\u2019d once been closer than sisters and were now so far apart.</p><p>Meghann touched Claire\u2019s bare shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t even try to find something wrong with this dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t look at the price tag, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Meghann ripped the tag in half. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t.\u201d She turned, raised a hand. \u201cRisa. Get over here.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked at her sister. \u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you? You handpicked it.\u201d</p><p>Meg tried not to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s Vera Wang, honey. Of course I knew. I also knew your defenses were a bit high at the outset. You don\u2019t want me to buy your dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Claire. It means a lot to me that you\u2019ve included me in your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re family,\u201d Claire answered after a long pause. It felt awkward, this conversation, and vaguely dangerous. As if they were skating on a frozen pond that couldn\u2019t possibly hold their weight. \u201cThank you for the dress. It\u2019s what . . .\u201d Her voice cracked a little. \u201cI always dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>Meg finally smiled. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t believe in marriage doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t plan a kick-ass wedding, you know.\u201d</p><p>Risa stepped into the dressing room, her face flushed, her arms full of gowns. \u201cThe Wang,\u201d she said softly, looking at Meg. \u201cYou said this would be her choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is the picture of love, yes?\u201d Risa hung up the unnecessary gowns and went to Claire. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to take in the bust a little\u2014just to there, don\u2019t you think?\u2014and let out the waist. We\u2019ll also need to choose a veil. Something elegant, yes? Not too ornate. What shoes will you wear?\u201d She began pinning and pulling.</p><p>\u201cThese pumps are fine.\u201d</p><p>Risa knelt down to pin the hemline. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the skirt long. In case you change your mind, which you must do. It\u2019ll be ready in time,\u201d she promised when she was finished, then hurried off.</p><p>After she\u2019d been gone for a moment, Claire said, \u201cHow did you know I\u2019d choose this dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt my wedding, I overheard you talking to Elizabeth. You said a wedding dress should be simple. You were right. Mine looked like something a circus performer would wear.\u201d Meghann seemed determined to smile. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why Eric left me.\u201d</p><p>Claire heard the hurt in her sister\u2019s voice. It was thin and quiet, a thread fluttering. It surprised her. Claire always imagined her sister\u2019s defenses to be solid granite. \u201cHe hurt you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he hurt me. He broke my heart and then wanted my money. It would have been a lot easier if I\u2019d had a prenuptial agreement. Or better yet, if I\u2019d lived with him instead of marrying him.\u201d</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t help smiling at the not-so-subtle reminder. This time it made sense. \u201cIf marrying Bobby is a mistake, it\u2019s one I want to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s the thing about love. It\u2019s inherently optimistic. No wonder I stick to sex instead. Now, how about if we pick up some takeout from the Wild Ginger and eat at my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlison\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014is having dinner at Zeke\u2019s Drive-In and joining Sam and Bobby for date night at the Big Bowl. I called Gina from Everett.\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled. \u201cBobby is going to date night at the bowling alley? And you don\u2019t believe in true love. Now, help me out of this dress.\u201d Claire hiked up the falling dress and picked her way carefully to the dressing room. She was just about to shut the door when she remembered to say, \u201cYour wedding dress was beautiful, Meghann, and you were beautiful. I hope I didn\u2019t hurt your feelings when I said that to Elizabeth. We\u2019d had a few drinks by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sleeves looked like open umbrellas. God knows why I picked it. No, that\u2019s not true. Sadly, I inherited Mama\u2019s style sense. As soon as I started making money, I hired a personal shopper. Anyway, thanks for the apology.\u201d</p><p>Claire closed the dressing-room door and changed back into her clothes. They spent another hour trying on veils and then shoes. When they had chosen everything, Meghann took Claire by the arm and led her out of the boutique.</p><p>In front of the Wild Ginger, Meghann double-parked, ran into the restaurant, and came out three minutes later with a paper sack. She tossed it into Claire\u2019s lap, jumped into the driver\u2019s seat, and stomped on the gas.</p><p>They turned down Pike Street and veered left hard, into an underground parking lot.</p><p>Claire followed her sister into the elevator, up to the penthouse floor, and into the condo.</p><p>The view was breathtaking. An amethyst almost-night sky filled every picture window. To the north, the sleepy community of Queen Anne sparkled with multicolored light. The Space Needle, decked out in summertime colors, filled one window. Everywhere else, it was the midnight-blue Sound, its dark surface broken only by the streamers of city lights along the shore.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s some view,\u201d Meghann said, plopping the paper sack on the kitchen\u2019s black granite countertop.</p><p>Everywhere Claire looked, she saw perfection. Not a painting was askew on the silk-covered walls, not a piece of paper cluttered a table. Of course there was no dust.</p><p>She walked over to a small Biedermeier desk in the corner. On its shiny surface stood a single framed photograph. It was the only one in the room, as far as she could tell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a photograph of Claire and Meghann, taken long ago. In it, they were kids\u2014maybe seven and fourteen\u2014sitting at the end of a dock with their arms looped around each other. In the corner, a glowing cigarette tip identified Mama as the photographer.</p><p>Surprisingly, Claire found that it hurt to see them this way. She glanced over at Meg, who was busily dividing up the food.</p><p>She put the photograph back and kept moving through her sister\u2019s condo. She saw the white-on-white bedroom that only a woman without pets or children would possibly choose and the bathroom that contained more beauty products than the cosmetics counter at Rite Aid. All the while, Claire found herself thinking that something was wrong.</p><p>She made her way back to the kitchen.</p> <p>Meg handed her a margarita in a frosted glass. \u201cOn the rocks. No salt. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Your home is gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d Meg laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s funny. I never think of it that way, but it is, of course. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>That was it. This wasn\u2019t a home. It was a really nice hotel suite. Definitely four-star, but cold. Impersonal. \u201cDid you decorate it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? The last thing I chose for myself was the wedding gown with parachute sleeves. I hired a decorator. German woman who didn\u2019t speak English.\u201d She set out the plates. \u201cHere. Let\u2019s eat out on the deck.\u201d She carried her plate and drink outside. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to sit on the floor. The decorator chose the most uncomfortable outdoor furniture in the world. I returned it all and haven\u2019t found the time to buy new stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven years.\u201d</p><p>Claire followed her sister outside. It was a beautiful night. Stars everywhere.</p><p>As they ate, silence fell between them. Meg said a few odd, awkward things, clearly designed to break the quiet, but like seawater in a rising tide, the silence always returned.</p><p>\u201cDid I thank you for the gown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you\u2019re welcome.\u201d Meg put her empty plate down on the deck and leaned back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Claire said. \u201cIt\u2019s loud out here at night\u2014between the traffic and the ferry horns and the railroad, but it still feels . . . empty. Kind of lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe city can be that way.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked at Meghann and, for once, she didn\u2019t see the harsh, judgmental older sister who was always right. Neither did she see the older sister who\u2019d once loved her so completely. Now, she saw a pale, rarely smiling woman who seemed to have no life apart from work. A lonely woman who\u2019d had her heart broken long ago and now wouldn\u2019t allow herself to believe in love.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help remembering the old days, when they\u2019d been best friends. For the first time in years, she wondered if that could happen again. If so, one of them would have to make the first move.</p><p>Claire took a chance. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to come stay at my house for a few nights, while you\u2019re planning the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Meghann looked up, obviously surprised.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably too busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually. I\u2019m . . . between cases right now. And I do need to spend some time in Hayden. Getting stuff ready, you know. I have a meeting there tomorrow, in fact. With the wedding consultant. But I wouldn\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p> <p>Big mistake, Claire. Incredible Hulk big. \u201cIt\u2019s settled, then. You\u2019ll spend a few nights at my house.\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>MEGHANN PARKED THE CAR AND STEPPED OUT ONTO THE curb. She checked her instructions again, then looked up the street.</p><p>Hayden shimmered in the warm, lemony sunlight. People drifted across the street and along the boardwalks, gathering now and then in gossipy circles, waving to one another as they moved on.</p><p>Across the street, standing all by herself, was a magenta-haired teenager wearing pants that would have been big on Shaquille O\u2019Neal.</p><p>Meghann knew how that girl felt, the outsider in this pretty little town. The girl who didn\u2019t fit in. Trailer parks, Meghann had learned early on, were always on the wrong side of the tracks, regardless of where they\u2019d been built. And when your clothes were wrong and your address was even worse, you were always treated like a slut, whether you were or not. Sooner or later\u2014and with Meghann, it had been sooner\u2014you gave in and started being what everyone already thought you were.</p><p>No wonder Mama had never stopped in towns like Hayden. One tavern and four churches? I think we\u2019ll pass this burg right on by. She liked the kind of place where nobody knew your name . . . where nobody knew how to find you when you snuck off in the middle of the night, with three months\u2019 back rent due.</p><p>Meghann walked two blocks, then turned right on Azalea Street.</p><p>Her destination was easy to spot: a narrow Victorian house painted canary yellow with purple trim. A sign hung askew on the white picket fence out front: Royal Event Planning. There were glittery roses all around the pink letters.</p><p>Meghann almost kept walking. There was no way that someone who painted with glittery paint could plan a classy wedding.</p><p>But it was Claire\u2019s day, and she wanted a small, casual wedding.</p><p>Do you hear me, Meg? I mean it.</p><p>Claire had said it three times last night and twice this morning.</p><p>What, no swing bands or ice sculptures? she\u2019d teased.</p><p>Ice sculptures? I hope you\u2019re kidding. I mean it, Meg. Simple is the adjective you should remember. We don\u2019t need it catered, either. Everyone will bring something to eat.</p><p>Meghann had drawn the line there. It\u2019s a wedding, not a funeral, and while I see certain similarities in the two events, I am not\u2014repeat not\u2014going to let you have a potluck wedding.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>Hot dogs wrapped in Kraft cheese and pink Jell-O in wedding-ring molds? She shuddered. I don\u2019t think so.</p><p>Meg, Claire had said, you\u2019re being you again.</p><p>Okay. I\u2019m a lawyer. I can compromise. The food will be casual.</p><p>And the reception has to be outside.</p><p>Outside. Where it rains? Where bugs breed? That outside?</p><p>Claire had been smiling by then. Outside. In Hayden, she added.</p><p>It\u2019s a good thing you mentioned that. I might have accidentally booked the Bloedel Reserve on Bainbridge Island. It is beautiful there. And not a horrible drive, she\u2019d added hopefully.</p><p>Hayden.</p><p>Okay. But a bird will probably crap on your head during the ceremony.</p><p>Claire had laughed, then sobered. You don\u2019t have to do this, you know. Really. It\u2019s a lot of work to have a wedding ready in nine days.</p><p>Meg knew Claire didn\u2019t really want her planning this, and that knowledge stung. As with all opposition, it strengthened her resolve to do a great job. I have a meeting in town, so I\u2019d better run. As Meg started to leave, Claire had said, Don\u2019t forget the bridal shower. Tomorrow night at Gina\u2019s.</p><p>Meghann had forced herself to keep smiling. A \u201ccouples\u2019 \u201d shower. No doubt she\u2019d be the only single woman in the room besides Gina.</p><p>What fun.</p><p>She unlatched the picket gate and stepped into a surreal Candy Land yard, half expecting Pee-wee Herman and his pals to jump out at her. A green Astro Turf walkway led her to the porch steps, which sagged beneath her weight. At the salmon-pink door, she knocked.</p><p>The door started to open, then thunked into something. A voice cursed thickly, \u201cDamn door.\u201d</p><p>This time the door opened all the way.</p><p>An old woman with pink hair sat in a motorized wheelchair, a canister of oxygen beside her. Clear tubes slipped into each nostril, rode across her high, hollow cheekbones, and tucked behind her ears.</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to guess?\u201d she said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you want, for Henry\u2019s sake. You knocked on the damn door, dintcha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m here to see the event coordinator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. Whaddaya want? Male strippers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Grandma,\u201d came a thin male voice from the other room. \u201cYou know you retired twenty years ago.\u201d</p><p>The woman backed up, spun her wheelchair around, and headed away. \u201cErica is in trouble. I better go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive Granny,\u201d said the tall man who came to the door. He had curly bottle-blond hair and a California-dark tan. His glasses were heavy and black-rimmed. He wore skintight black leather pants and a teal green muscle-shirt, which showed off scarecrow-thin arms. \u201cShe has a little memory loss now and then. You must be Meghann Dontess. I\u2019m Roy Royal.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to smile.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, have a good laugh. I\u2019m just lucky my middle name isn\u2019t Al.\u201d He swung one hip out, planted a hand on it. \u201cThose are some pretty sharp clothes, Ms. Dontess. We don\u2019t see much Marc Jacobs in Hayden. Our labels of choice are Levi\u2019s and Wrangler. I can\u2019t imagine what brings you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Claire Cavenaugh\u2019s sister. I\u2019m here to plan her wedding.\u201d</p><p>He actually jumped into the air and screeched. \u201cClaire! All right, girl! Well, let\u2019s get going. Only the best for Claire.\u201d He ushered her into the sitting room, toward a pink velvet settee. \u201cWedding at the Episcopal Church, of course. Reception at the Moose Lodge, catering by the Chuck Wagon. We can get tons of silk flowers from Target. Then they can be reused.\u201d</p><p>Meg thought, Simple and casual, simple and casual.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Roy stopped in mid-excited-utterance. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wedding in Hayden, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTop drawer. Only Missy Henshaw\u2019s was better, and she sprang for the clubhouse at the golf course in Monroe.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cThey had champagne, not just beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does a wedding cost around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like Missy\u2019s, but a good, solid event? Say . . . two thousand dollars.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cMaybe a little less if one of the community college kids takes the photos.\u201d</p><p>Meg was the one who leaned forward now. \u201cDo you read People magazine, Roy? Or In Style?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAre you kidding? Cover to cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know what a celebrity wedding is like. Especially the kind they call \u2018simple and elegant.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He waved his hand in the air, snapped his fingers. \u201cAre you kidding, honey? Denise Richard\u2019s wedding was supposedly simple and they had enough fresh flowers to cover a Rose Parade float. Simple in Hollywood just means really, really expensive but no bridesmaids and an outdoor reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you keep a secret, Roy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stayed in the closet during the Reagan years. Believe me, honey, these lips know when to close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the kind of wedding this town has never seen. But\u2014and this is important\u2014no one but you and I can know that it\u2019s a big deal. You have to master the phrase It was on sale. Deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d he grinned and clapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s your budget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfection. Every little girl\u2019s dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney isn\u2019t something we should worry about.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still smiling. \u201cHoney, that\u2019s a sentence I\u2019ve never heard before. I do believe you\u2019re the best-looking woman I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He reached out to the coffee table and grabbed a copy of Bride\u2019s magazine. \u201cWe should start with the gown.

Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has to be outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. A tent. Perfect. We should start with the lighting. . . .\u201d</p><p>Meghann barely listened as his voice droned on and on about a zillion details. Lighting. Flowers. Table dressings. Grooms\u2019 cakes, for goodness\u2019 sake.</p><p>She had definitely made the right decision in coming here. All she had to do was write the checks.</p><p>Joe was elbow-deep in the undercarriage of an old Kubota tractor, changing the oil, when he heard a car drive up. He listened for Smitty\u2019s booming voice, always loud when he welcomed customers to the garage, but now there was nothing except the tinny, scratchy strains of an old Hank Williams song on the radio.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone here?\u201d someone called out. \u201cSmitty?\u201d</p><p>Joe rolled out from under the tractor and got to his feet. He was just putting his baseball cap on, pulling the brim low on his eyes, when a florid, heavyset man walked into the garage.</p><p>Joe recognized the man. It was Reb Tribbs, an old-time logger who\u2019d lost an arm on the job.</p><p>Joe pulled his cap down lower and didn\u2019t make eye contact. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy truck\u2019s dyin\u2019 again. I just brought the damn thing to Smitty. He said he fixed it. Some job, he done. I ain\u2019t payin\u2019 for it till it runs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take that up with Smitty. But if you want to drive into the garage, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d Reb frowned, pushed the cowboy hat back on his head, and stepped closer. \u201cI don\u2019t never forget a voice. Can\u2019t see for shit, but I got the hearin\u2019 of a damn wolf.\u201d</p><p>Do I know you? It was the question Joe had heard in every town in Washington. \u201cI\u2019ve got one of those faces. People always think they know me. Now, if you\u2019ll bring the truck around\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe Wyatt. Ho-ly shit.\u201d Reb made a whistling sound. \u201cIt\u2019s you, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Joe sighed, beaten. \u201cHey, Reb.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, during which Reb studied Joe, his head cocked to the side as if he were listening to someone. \u201cYou got some nerve comin\u2019 back here, boy. Folks around here remember what you done. Hell, I thought you were in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Joe fought the urge to walk away. Instead, he stood there, listening. He deserved every word.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best get a move on. Her daddy don\u2019t need to hear that you\u2019re back in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCourse not. Chickenshit piece of crap like you don\u2019t have the guts. You\u2019d best move on, Joe Wyatt. This town doesn\u2019t need a man like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Reb.\u201d It was Smitty\u2019s voice. He stood at the open garage door, holding a half-eaten sandwich in one hand and a can of Coke in the other.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d hire this piece of garbage,\u201d Reb said.</p><p>\u201cI said, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bring my truck here if he\u2019s gonna work on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine I can lose your business and still survive,\u201d Smitty said.</p><p>Reb made a sputtering sound, then turned on his heel and marched out. As he got into his truck, he yelled out, \u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry, Zeb Smith. Trash like him don\u2019t belong in this town.\u201d</p><p>After he drove away, Smitty placed a hand on Joe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s the trash, Joe. Always has been. Mean as a badger.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared out the window, saw the beat-up red truck buck down the road. \u201cYou\u2019ll lose customers when word gets out that I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter. My house is paid for. My land\u2019s paid for. I own a rental house in town that brings in five hundred a month. Helga and I both have Social Security. I don\u2019t need a single damn customer. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. Your reputation is important.\u201d</p><p>Smitty squeezed his shoulder. \u201cLast Helga and I heard about our Philly, he was living in Seattle. Under the Viaduct. Heroin. Every day I hope someone offers him a helping hand.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>Finally, Smitty said, \u201cI gotta make a Costco run. You think you can handle the garage for the next two hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if Reb is any indication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201d Smitty tossed him the keys. \u201cClose up anytime you want.\u201d Then he left.</p><p>Joe finished out the workday, but he couldn\u2019t forget the incident with Reb. The old man\u2019s words seemed to hang in the garage, poisoning the air.</p><p>This town doesn\u2019t need a man like you.</p><p>By the time he closed up shop, he felt empty again. Gutted by the truth of Reb\u2019s observations.</p><p>Then he remembered Gina. He had family here now; he didn\u2019t have to be alone.</p><p>He went into the office and called her. The answering machine picked up. He hung up without leaving a message.</p><p>Instead, he locked up for the night. He was just about to turn toward his cabin when he happened to glance down the street.</p><p>The neon Redhook sign in Mo\u2019s window caught his attention.</p><p>And suddenly he was thirsty. He wanted to sneak into that smoky darkness and drink until the ache in his chest went away.</p><p>He pulled the baseball cap low on his forehead and crossed the street. Outside the tavern he paused just long enough to pray that no one he knew was inside, then he pushed through the scarred wooden door.</p><p>He glanced around, saw no familiar faces, and finally breathed easily. He made his way to a table in the back, the one tucked farthest from the overhead lights. A few minutes later, a tired-looking waitress appeared. She took his order for a pitcher, then left. In no time, she was back with his beer.</p><p>He poured himself a schooner. Unfortunately, the three empty chairs around the table reminded him of other times, of another life, in fact. Back then, he never drank alone.</p><p>Meghann hadn\u2019t been to a bridal shower in more than a decade. Her friends and colleagues lived with their boyfriends for years and then\u2014sometimes\u2014quietly got married. She had no idea how to blend in to this small-town crowd, how to adapt to their coloration. The last thing she wanted to do was stand out.</p><p>Yesterday, after her four-hour meeting with Roy, Meghann had spent another hour in Too Many Cooks. Although she wasn\u2019t much of a cook, she was familiar with all the gadgets and gizmos. Sometimes, when she couldn\u2019t sleep, she\u2019d watch cooking shows on TV. So she knew what every kitchen needed. She bought Claire (and Bobby, although she didn\u2019t think of them as a couple, really) a Cuisinart food processor.</p><p>She\u2019d been tired by the time she made it back to Claire\u2019s house, and dinner hadn\u2019t helped. As the meal progressed, she\u2019d felt increasingly separate, a woman distinct in her solitude even among her so-called family.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to make mealtime conversation, but it had been difficult. Claire and Bobby rarely took their eyes off each other, and Alison talked continually\u2014mostly to her mother and Bobby. On the few rare instances in which Meghann had been able to wedge a word in between the child\u2019s soliloquies, she\u2019d discovered what a yawning silence was.</p><p>What? Bobby had asked twice, blinking slowly as he peeled his gaze away from Claire.</p><p>Meghann couldn\u2019t remember now what she\u2019d said. All she recalled for sure was that it had been wrong. She knew for a fact that she shouldn\u2019t have mentioned her work. One innocent little remark about a deadbeat dad, and Alison asked loudly, \u201cWill you and Bobby ever get divorced, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>Claire had not been amused. \u201cNo, honey. Don\u2019t listen to Aunt Meg. She\u2019s the Antichrist when it comes to marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>Bobby had laughed so hard he spilled his milk. That had made Alison laugh, then Claire. It was remarkable how alienating other people\u2019s laughter could be.</p><p>Meghann had been the only one not laughing as they sopped up the milk. She\u2019d excused herself quickly from the table\u2014pleaded a headache\u2014and ran upstairs.</p><p>But now, nearly an hour later, she felt better. A quick glance at the bedside clock told her it was 6:40.</p><p>Come on, Meg. It\u2019s time\u2014again\u2014to celebrate your sister\u2019s decision to marry a three-time loser. Wait! Give them gifts! She went down the hall and ducked into the bathroom, where she twisted her abundant black hair into a knot and applied enough makeup to hide the lack-of-sleep lines around her eyes. Then she went back into the bedroom and opened her closet. It took her a while to figure out what to wear. Fortunately, she\u2019d packed a lot of choices.</p><p>In the end, she decided on a plain black dress. Armani was never wrong. She added sheer black hose and a pair of pumps, then went downstairs.</p><p>The house was quiet.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Then she saw the note on the kitchen table:</p><p>Dear Meg, Sorry you\u2019re feeling sick. Stay home and rest, xxoo, C.</p><p>They\u2019d left without her. She glanced at her watch. It was 7:00. Of course they\u2019d left. They were the guests of honor. They couldn\u2019t be late.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>She considered staying right here.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Claire. I\u2014</p><p>\u2014lost the directions.</p><p>\u2014felt sick after dinner.</p><p>\u2014couldn\u2019t get my car started.</p><p>Each excuse would work. In truth, Claire would probably love it if Meg stayed away. And yet, it would be one more brick in the wall that separated them.</p><p>There were enough bricks already.</p><p>She dug through her purse for the pale lavender invitation. It read Couples\u2019 Shower for Claire and Bobby, 7:00. The directions were on the back.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d walked so slowly to her car, or when she\u2019d followed the speed limit signs so precisely. Even so, Hayden was a small town and the directions on the invitation were easy to follow. It took her less than ten minutes to find Gina\u2019s house. She pulled up behind a battered red pickup with a gun rack in the cab window and a bumper sticker that read: Screw the Spotted Owl.</p><p>Clearly a member of Greenpeace.</p><p>She got out of the car and walked up the slanted concrete driveway that led to a sprawling log house with a wraparound porch. Bright red geraniums and purple lobelia cascaded from hanging pots. Rhododendrons sporting plate-size red blooms were everywhere. She could hear the buzz of conversations through the open windows. From somewhere came the pounding beat of an old Queen song. \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust.\u201d</p><p>Meghann smiled at the choice. Holding the gift firmly under one arm, she climbed the porch steps and knocked on the front door. You can do this. You can fit in with her friends. Just smile and nod and ask for a pitcher of margaritas.</p><p>There was a rush of footsteps, then the door opened.</p><p>Gina stood there, her face creased in laughter. Until she saw Meghann. \u201cOh.\u201d She stepped back to allow entry. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d</p><p>Meghann stared at Gina, who was dressed in a pair of denim capri pants and an oversize black T-shirt. Her feet were bare. Great. \u201cI\u2019m overdressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? If I hadn\u2019t gained fifteen pounds since Rex left I\u2019d be dressed up, too. Come on. You\u2019re my date for the evening.\u201d Gina smiled. \u201cI thought I\u2019d been stood up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took Meghann by the arm and led her down a wide hallway, toward the noise. They finally reached the great room\u2014a living room/dining room combination\u2014that overlooked a beautifully landscaped backyard. \u201cClaire! Look who made it,\u201d she said loudly enough to be heard above the din.</p><p>Everyone stopped talking and turned toward them. The crowd was a sea of T-shirts and jeans.</p><p>Except for Meghann, of course, who looked ready for a night of dancing at the Space Needle.</p><p>Claire extricated herself from Tentacle Boy and hurried toward her. She looked gorgeous in a pair of ice-blue cotton pants and white boat-neck cotton sweater. Her long blond hair had been pulled back from her face and gathered in a white scrunchy. She smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you could make it. I thought you had a migraine. When I get a headache, I can\u2019t move for hours.\u201d</p> <p>Meghann felt like Jackie O at a keggar. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d her sister said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Really.\u201d</p><p>Bobby sauntered through the crowd and sidled up to Claire, slipping an arm around her hips. Meghann had to admit that he looked good. Damn good. He was going to bypass breaking her sister\u2019s heart and just plain shatter it.</p><p>\u201cHeya, Meghann,\u201d he said, smiling broadly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>It stuck in her craw to be welcomed to her own sister\u2019s party by country boy. She had to force herself to smile. \u201cThanks, Bobby.\u201d</p> <p>They stood there in an uncomfortable silence. Finally, Gina said, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>Meghann nodded. \u201cBy all means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the kitchen with me,\u201d Gina said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you a jumbo margarita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry back,\u201d Claire said. \u201cWe were just going to start the games.\u201d</p><p>Meghann actually stumbled.</p><p>Games.</p> <p>Meghann really did have a headache now.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the sofa, her knees tucked primly together, a paper plate of homemade cookies on her lap. The rest of the guests (in pairs, like on Noah\u2019s ark) sat sprawled against one another, in a circle on the hardwood floor. They were all talking at once, resurrecting memories and moments from a lifetime Meghann didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Remember when Claire fell off the high dive at Island Lake Camp\u2014</p><p>Or when she hid Mrs. Testern\u2019s favorite ruler\u2014</p><p>When she called Poison Control because she caught Ali eating the diaper-pail deodorant\u2014</p><p>The junior and senior high school years, the girls-just-want-to-have-fun years, the Alison years. They were all a mystery to Meghann. She had stories to tell, of course, stories about a girl who once cut all of her hair so she could look like Buffy on Family Affair, who cried every night that Mama forgot to come home, and who slept curled in her big sister\u2019s arms on a cot that was too small.</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s big sister,\u201d said a brown-haired woman in faded jeans and an Old Navy T-shirt. Her wedding ring sported a diamond the size of a pencil eraser. She plopped down beside Meghann. \u201cI\u2019m Karen, by the way. We met several years ago. Your dress is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hear you want Claire to sign a prenuptial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was it for small talk, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe watch out for one another.\u201d</p><p>In truth, Meghann was glad for that. God knew she\u2019d failed Claire in the watching-over department. That was why she was sitting here, overdressed and separate, pretending to love the cookies. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. She\u2019s lucky to have you as friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all lucky. She won\u2019t sign anything, you know. I gave her the same advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>She fluttered the fingers of her left hand. \u201cDivorce wars survivor. That guy over there\u2014the one chewing like a squirrel\u2014that\u2019s Harold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could talk to Claire. It\u2019s not smart for her to go into this thing unprotected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis thing is marriage, and it\u2019s all about faith. Your sister is one of the believers in this world. Don\u2019t take that away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn law school faith is surgically removed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that yours was lost long before that. Don\u2019t look so shocked. I\u2019m not a psychic or anything. We tell each other everything. You guys had a rough time of it growing up.\u201d</p><p>Meghann shifted uncomfortably. She wasn\u2019t used to people knowing so much about her. Not friends, and certainly not strangers. Her childhood was something she\u2019d never shared with a girlfriend, not even Elizabeth. She remembered how people had looked at her when she was child, as if she were white trash; she hadn\u2019t wanted that judgment to follow her into adulthood.</p><p>Karen seemed to be waiting for a response. The moment lengthened between them. Meg\u2019s heartbeat accelerated. She didn\u2019t want this conversation to continue. These Bluesers were too damn blunt.</p><p>\u201cOkay, everyone, it\u2019s time for the games!\u201d Gina yelled suddenly, jumping to her feet.</p><p>Meghann let out her breath in a relieved sigh.</p><p>\u201cGina loves games,\u201d Karen said. \u201cI just hope no one has to humiliate themselves. It was nice to see you again. I better run. Harold just started hyperventilating.\u201d And she was gone, back to her husband in a blink.</p><p>\u201cOutside,\u201d Gina said, clapping her hands again and ushering everyone outside, where a row of powdered-sugar doughnuts hung at intervals along a sagging clothesline. \u201cEveryone pick a doughnut and stand in front of it.</p><p>The guests surged forward, lining up.</p><p>Meghann hung back in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Meg,\u201d Gina called out. \u201cThere\u2019s a place for you, too.\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned to look at her.</p><p>She hurried across the porch and out into the yard. The sweet smell of honeysuckle and roses filled the night air. Somewhere nearby there must be a pond, because frogs were croaking en masse. It gave the evening an odd, surreal edge\u2014or maybe that came from the swinging doughnuts.</p><p>\u201cWhen I start the stopwatch, everyone starts licking the sugar off the doughnuts. This will tell us who is the best kisser.\u201d</p><p>A man laughed. Meghann thought it was Charlotte\u2019s husband. \u201cIf you want to know who has the best tongue, we should be licking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare finish that sentence,\u201d Charlotte said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cGo. And no fair using hands.\u201d</p><p>The group went at it. Within seconds, everyone was laughing.</p><p>Meghann tried, she really did, but at her first pass, the doughnut hit her in the nose and white sugar fluttered down the front of her black Armani.</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d Bobby yelled, throwing his hands in the air as if he\u2019d just scored the game-winning run.</p><p>Claire put her arms around him. \u201cAnd there you have it, the real reason I\u2019m marrying him.\u201d</p><p>Meghann stepped back from the undulating doughnut. Once again, she was the only one not laughing, and her silence settled on her chest like Hester Prynne\u2019s scarlet A.</p><p>Gina handed Bobby a CD. \u201cYou win. And I must say, none of us will ever look at you quite the same again.\u201d She rushed back into the house, then came out with a big white porcelain bowl. \u201cThe next game is called Truth in M&amp;M\u2019s. Everybody take as many as you want, then find a seat.\u201d She went around the group, handing out candy.</p><p>Meghann could tell that she wasn\u2019t the only suspicious person. No one took a handful. Meg chose two, then sat down on the top porch step. Everyone else pulled up a patch of grass and sat down.</p><p>\u201cFor each M&amp;M, you have to tell one thing about the bride or groom and make a prediction for the future.\u201d</p><p>A groan moved through the men.</p><p>Harold rolled his eyes; Karen elbowed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI have three. Claire has a beautiful smile, and I predict Bobby will keep it on her face. Also, she is a great cook, so I predict he\u2019ll be fat by forty. And finally, she hates to do laundry, so I predict Bobby will learn to like the stained, rumpled look.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed the loudest of all of them.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Karen said. \u201cI\u2019m on a diet\u2014as usual\u2014so I only picked one. Claire has developed a . . . fondness for electrical devices. I predict she won\u2019t need one anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren!\u201d Claire cried out, her face turning red even as she laughed.</p><p>They continued around the circle, and with each comment, Meghann felt herself edging toward uneasiness. Even the husbands here seemed to know more about Claire\u2019s everyday life than Meghann did, and she was terrified that when her turn came to make a prediction, she\u2019d blurt out, I predict he breaks her heart. She finished her second margarita in gulps.</p><p>\u201cMeg? Meg?\u201d It was Gina. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked down in her palm. Sweat had turned the candies into red smudges. \u201cI have two.\u201d She tried to smile. \u201cClaire is . . . the best mother I know, so I predict she\u2019ll have another child.\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled at her, then leaned lovingly against Bobby, who whispered something in her ear.</p><p>\u201cAnother one, Meg.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cClaire loves well, but not necessarily easily, so I predict,\u201d she barely paused, \u201cthat this is the real thing.\u201d When she looked up, Claire was frowning.</p><p>Meghann didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d said wrong. It had seemed cheery and optimistic to her, romantic even. But Claire looked ready to cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m last,\u201d Gina said in the sudden silence. \u201cI have only one. Claire is completely tone-deaf. So I predict that Bobby will never let her be his backup singer.\u201d</p><p>That got them all laughing and talking again. They got to their feet and closed ranks around Claire and Bobby.</p><p>Absurdly, Meghann felt the start of tears. She got clumsily to her feet, realizing when she stood up that those margaritas had been stronger than she\u2019d thought. She turned away from the party. Getting drunk would be the last straw. When no one was looking, she ducked into the house and ran for her car.</p><p>She meant to go home, wait up for Claire, and apologize for whatever wrongs she\u2019d uttered.</p><p>Then she saw the tavern.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>MEGHANN EASED HER FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR. THE Porsche slowed to a crawl.</p><p>Through the smoke-grayed glass of the tavern\u2019s window, she could make out the shadowy bodies inside, pressed in close together along the bar.</p><p>It was easy to get lost in a crowd like that, where no one asked your name or why you were there. She knew that if she went inside and had a drink\u2014or two or three\u2014she would feel better.</p><p>Maybe she would meet someone . . . and he would take her to his place for a few hours and help her forget. Help her sleep.</p><p>Experience had taught her that on a night like this, when her inadequacies felt as sharp as bits of glass embedded in her skin, she would lie in her lonely bed and stare up at the ceiling, unable to sleep. In the morning, she would awaken to a face that was wrinkled and stare into eyes that were tired and sad.</p><p>Meghann hit the gas. The car roared to life. She sped down two blocks, found a parking space, and pulled in. When she shut down the engine and got out of the car, she noticed how quiet the night was. The Big Dipper pointed toward the river. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most of the stores were closed. Only a few kept their signs illuminated. Every twenty feet or so a green wrought-iron streetlamp tossed light downward, creating a lacy, scalloped pattern along the darkened boardwalk.</p><p>Meghann settled her shoulder strap in place, clamped her elbow tightly against her purse, and started for the tavern. She didn\u2019t falter when she reached the open door, just turned and walked in.</p><p>It was like a hundred other taverns she\u2019d been in. Smoke collected along the acoustical tile ceiling, trailing like ghostly sleeves below the inset lighting. The bar ran the length of the room on the right side, a huge mahogany piece that had to be a hundred years old. The mirror behind it was at least six feet long, veined in strands of gold and aged to a tarnished silver. In it, the patrons looked taller and thinner, a fun-house mirror for people too drunk to notice.</p><p>She saw the people clustered along the bar, seated on wooden stools. The pitchers outnumbered the people, and there was a lit cigarette in every hand.</p> <p>Those were the hardcore drinkers, the folks who found their bar stools at 10:00 A.M. and climbed aboard.</p><p>Scatted throughout the left side of the room were round tables; most of them were full. In the smoky background, she saw the faded outline of a pool table, heard the clackety-thump of a game in progress. An old Springsteen song played on the jukebox. \u201cGlory Days.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. It had probably been chosen by the guy sitting at the bar who wore a red-and-white letterman\u2019s jacket. He\u2019d long ago lost all his hair.</p><p>She moved into the haze. Her heart beat faster: Smoke and anticipation made her eyes water. She walked to the closest empty space on the bar, where a tired-looking man was busily wiping up a spill. At her arrival, he sighed and looked up. If he was surprised by her\u2014after all, women like her didn\u2019t show up alone in seedy taverns every day\u2014he hid it well.</p><p>\u201cWhaddaya want?\u201d He threw down the rag and grabbed his cigarette from an ashtray.</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cDirty martini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a tavern, lady. We don\u2019t have an H license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a joke. I\u2019ll take a glass of white wine. Vouvray, if you have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have Inglenook and Gallo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInglenook.\u201d</p><p>He turned and headed down the other way. In a moment, he returned with a glass of wine.</p> <p>She slapped her Platinum credit card on the bar. \u201cOpen a tab.\u201d</p><p>The jukebox clicked, then buzzed. An old Aerosmith song came on. She had a sudden flashback to her youth\u2014standing front and center in the Kingdome, screaming out her love for Steven Tyler.</p><p>She took her card back from the bartender, slipped it in her bag, and headed toward the nearest table, where three men sat, talking loudly.</p><p>Normally, she\u2019d find an empty table, sit down, and wait to see who came on to her, but she felt jittery tonight, nervous. She was tired of being alone.</p><p>\u201cHey, boys,\u201d she said, gliding into an empty space between two of the men.</p><p>Their conversation stopped. The sudden silence made her teeth ache. That was when she noticed that they each wore a wedding ring.</p><p>She kept her smile in place. It wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d one of the men said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p> <p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d The others followed suit. None of them made eye contact.</p><p>\u201cI have to run, guys,\u201d the first one said, pushing back from the table.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, they were gone.</p><p>Meghann waved at their backs, said brightly, \u201cSee you again, soon. Drive safely.\u201d Just in case anyone had witnessed her humiliation.</p><p>She counted silently to five, then turned around. There was another table, not too far away. This one had only one man seated at it. He was writing on a yellow legal pad, obviously taking notes from an open textbook. He was staring so intently at the work that he hadn\u2019t seen her debacle at the table.</p><p>She walked over to him. \u201cMay I join you?\u201d</p><p>When he looked up, she saw that he was young. Maybe twenty-one or twenty-two. His eyes were unguarded, filled with the kind of open-ended hope that came with youth. She felt drawn to that optimism, warmed by it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2019am. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>Ma\u2019am.</p><p>\u201cCall me Meg.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou look familiar. Are you a friend of my mother\u2019s? Sada Carlyle.\u201d</p><p>She felt like the old lady from Titanic. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know her. And I . . . thought I knew you, but I was mistaken. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She tightened her grip on the wineglass. Desperation came for her, tapped her on the shoulder.</p><p>Get a grip.</p><p>She headed toward another table. As she came within range, a woman slipped into the empty chair and leaned in to kiss the man.</p><p>Meghann spun to her left and ran into a shaggy, derelict-looking guy who was obviously on his way back from the bar. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI should have signaled before I made a turn like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo harm done.\u201d</p><p>He went back to his table and sat down. She saw that he was slightly unsteady on his feet.</p><p>She stood there, alone in the midst of the crowded bar. There were three men back at the pool table. Two of them looked dangerous, dressed as they were in black leather and chains. The third man had so many tattoos on his bald head that it looked like earth as seen from space.</p><p>She felt the press of desperation, but it was useless. This wasn\u2019t going to be her night. She\u2019d have to return to Claire\u2019s homey, comfortable guest room, climb into bed alone, and spend the night tossing and turning and wanting. Wanting, most of all.</p><p>She looked at the derelict. His shoulders were broad; his black T-shirt stretched taut along the top of his back. The waistband of his worn, faded Levi\u2019s veed out, as if he\u2019d lost weight and hadn\u2019t bothered to buy jeans that fit.</p><p>It was him . . . or loneliness.</p><p>She went to his table, stood beside him. \u201cMay I sit down?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up from his beer. \u201cWhat am I, your lucky fifth choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re counting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t hard, lady. You\u2019re clearing out the place faster than a cop at a frat party.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out a chair and sat down across from him. The song \u201cLookin\u2019 for Love\u201d came on the jukebox. In all the wrong places . . .</p><p>Finally, he looked up. Beneath the silvery fringe of hair that must have been trimmed with a pocket knife, a pair of blue eyes stared at her. With a start, she realized that he wasn\u2019t much older than she was, and he was almost handsome, in a Sam Elliott stranger-in-town kind of way. He looked like the kind of man who\u2019d walked down a few dark alleys in his time.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said, \u201cyou won\u2019t find it here.\u201d</p><p>She started to flirt, to say something funny and impersonal, but before her tongue had even formed the first word, she paused. There was something about him. . . .</p><p>\u201cHave we met?\u201d she asked, frowning. She prided herself on her memory. Faces, she rarely forgot. Unless they belonged to the men she sometimes picked up; those she forgot immediately. Please God, tell me I haven\u2019t screwed him already.</p><p>\u201cPeople say that all the time.\u201d He sighed. \u201cJust an ordinary face, I guess.\u201d</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t it. She was sure she\u2019d seen him before, but it didn\u2019t matter, really. Besides, anonymity was her goal here, not making friends. \u201cIt\u2019s far from ordinary. Are you from around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I make a living? I get by, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all any of us do, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeghann. Friends call me Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeghann. I\u2019m not going to take you home. Is that clear enough for you?\u201d</p><p>That made her smile. \u201cI don\u2019t remember asking to be taken home. I asked if I could sit down. You\u2019re making quite an assumption.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back a little, looked uncomfortable. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve been . . . alone for a while. Makes a man poor company.\u201d</p><p>Poor company. It had the ring of education to it.</p><p>She leaned closer, studying him. Though the light was dim in here, and the air clogged with cigarette smoke, she liked his face. Enough for one night, at least.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I did want to go home with you?\u201d</p><p>When he looked up again, she would have sworn that he\u2019d gone pale. His eyes were swimming-pool blue.</p><p>It was an eternity before he answered. \u201cI\u2019d say it wouldn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d His voice sounded tight. He looked scared.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThe sex?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She felt it suddenly, the thrill of the chase, the revving up of her heart. She reached out, pressed her forefinger along the back of his hand. \u201cWhat if I said that was okay? That I didn\u2019t want it to mean anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that was sad.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand back, stung by the observation. She felt transparent suddenly, as if those blue eyes could see straight into her. \u201cDo you want to get laid or not? No strings. No future. Just tonight. A little time together.\u201d She heard her voice spike; it was a small, desperate kind of sound, and it shamed her into sudden silence.</p><p>Another eternity passed. Finally, he spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be any good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She pressed her lips together to keep from saying something stupid. It was ridiculous, really, but she was nervous. She wanted him to want her, wanted it more than she understood. He was nothing, just another link in the chain of unavailable, ultimately forgettable men she\u2019d slept with since her divorce. As far as she could tell, he had nothing to recommend him, nothing that would account for the odd fluttering in her chest. But she was afraid he\u2019d turn her down. \u201cMaybe we could just get each other through this one night.\u201d</p><p>He stood up so quickly the chair wobbled and almost fell. \u201cI live down the street.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t touch him, didn\u2019t take his hand or otherwise lay claim to him. None of the usual pretense of affection. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you\u201d was all she said.</p><p>Joe felt her beside him, the warmth of her body, the way her hand brushed accidentally against his every now and then.</p><p>Stop this now, he thought. Just turn to her and say, \u201cI made a mistake, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d But he kept walking forward, putting one foot in front of the other.</p><p>He could smell her perfume. Something musty and sweet and sexy; it reminded him of summer in the deep South. Of fragrant blossoms and hot, dark nights.</p><p>He was losing his grip. Must be drunker than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do this. Didn\u2019t even remember how. (Not the sex part\u2014that he remembered; it was the rest of it that eluded him, the talking, the touching, the being with another person.)</p><p>Suddenly he was standing in front of his cabin. Three blocks they\u2019d walked, and he hadn\u2019t managed a single word of conversation. Neither had she, and he didn\u2019t know if he was thankful or not. If she\u2019d chattered ridiculously on about nothing, perhaps he would have had the strength to turn away from her, to make his excuses. Her silence was his undoing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is where I live right now,\u201d he said, rather stupidly he thought, as they were standing at the front door.</p><p>\u201cRight now, huh?\u201d</p><p>That surprised him. She\u2019d picked up on the one thing in the sentence that revealed something. He\u2019d need to be careful around her.</p><p>He opened the door and stepped aside to let her enter first.</p> <p>She frowned briefly, then walked past him, into the darkness.</p><p>He followed her, leaving the lights off on purpose. There were photos of Diana everywhere. He didn\u2019t want to explain why he lived this way, not to this woman in her designer dress and expensive gold-and-platinum jewelry. In fact, he didn\u2019t want to talk at all.</p><p>He went to the kitchen and grabbed some candles. There were dozens available, kept on hand for winter storms when the power went out. Wordlessly, he carried them into the bedroom and placed them wherever he could; then, one by one, he lit them. When he was finished, he turned around and there she was, standing at the end of the bed, holding her purse as if she thought he might steal it.</p><p>He released a pent-up breath. She was beautiful. Jet-black hair, pale skin, green eyes that slanted upward, lips that seemed reluctant to smile. What in the hell was she doing here with him? And what was he doing here with her? He hadn\u2019t been with a woman since Diana.</p><p>She reached into her purse for something\u2014</p> <p>A condom. Oh, God.</p><p>\u2014and then dropped her bag on the floor. As she walked toward him, hips swaying slightly, she unzipped her dress. It fell halfway down her arms, revealing a lacy black bra and creamy cleavage.</p><p>He meant to say, Go away, but instead he reached for her, pulled her against him. Her body molded to his and began slowly, slowly to move.</p><p>When he found the strength to pull back, he was trembling.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think, didn\u2019t speak, just swept her into his arms and carried her toward the bed.</p> <p>They fell onto the rumpled bedding together, she beneath him. His body lay possessively on top of hers, and it felt good. Her hips came up to meet him.</p><p>Groaning, he bent down to kiss her. The soft, pliant feel of her mouth jolted him back in time.</p><p>Diana.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>He drew back, looked down at her.</p><p>Meghann.</p><p>This time, when he kissed her, he kept his eyes open. She kissed him with a ferocity that left him breathless.</p><p>She shoved her hands underneath his T-shirt. Her fingertips grazed his nipples. \u201cTake off your pants.\u201d Her voice was coarse. \u201cI want to touch you.\u201d</p> <p>They broke apart. He slid off the bed and undressed, his fingers too shaky to unbutton his jeans on the first try.</p><p>Naked, they fell together on the bed again. He rubbed his erection against her, kissing her open mouth, her chin, her closed eyes. She wrapped her leg over his and pressed in close. He felt her moisture against his thigh.</p><p>Then she reached down and touched him, wrapped her fingers tightly around him. Up and down. Up and down. He felt the condom slide into place in one practiced move.</p><p>He groaned as he thrust into her grasp one sweet, aching time, then pulled away before it was too late. He slid down her body, kissing her chin, her throat, her breasts. He tasted one nipple, drew it into his mouth, and sucked its sweetness. His hands pushed her legs apart as he moved downward, kissing her navel, her pubic hair.</p><p>She tried to push him away.</p><p>He held her in place, lowered his kisses until he was inside her. Moaning, she clutched his head and spread her legs wider apart. His tongue explored her, tasted her, glided up and down and in and out.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d She said it brokenly. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her toward him in one swift motion and entered her.</p><p>She clung to him, arched up to meet him. She matched him thrust for thrust.</p><p>Joe\u2019s climax was like nothing he\u2019d ever experienced before.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d she said, pushing the damp hair away from her face. \u201cThat was definitely an E-ticket ride.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the wobbly headboard. His whole body felt weak, trembling.</p><p>She looked up at him, smiling broadly, still breathing hard. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Joe. That was great.\u201d</p><p>After a long minute, he dared to slide his arm around her, draw her closer. Holding her, he closed his eyes.</p><p>For the first time in years, he went to sleep with a woman in his arms.</p><p>When he woke up, he was alone again.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>\u201cWHEW!\u201d CLAIRE FLOPPED BACK ONTO THE PILLOWS. \u201cI CAN\u2019T remember the last time I got lucky in the morning.\u201d She pushed the hair out of her eyes and smiled at Bobby. \u201cYou must really love me if you\u2019ll kiss me before I brush my teeth.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his side. His handsome face was crisscrossed with tiny pink sleep lines. \u201cYou still wonder, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said too quickly.</p><p>He touched her cheek in a caress so soft it made her sigh. \u201cI love you, Claire Cavenaugh. I\u2019d like to kick the ass of the man who made you so afraid to believe me.\u201d</p><p>She knew her smile was more than a little sad. There was nothing she could do about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not just men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t beat up your mother or your sister.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that. \u201cJust prove Meg wrong. Nothing will make her crazier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying, you know.\u201d</p><p>Claire sat up in bed. \u201cYeah. I noticed. She made that crack about me not loving people, then left the party early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also bought you a dress that cost more than my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney\u2019s easy for Meg. She\u2019s got tons. Just ask her.\u201d</p><p>Bobby leaned back against the headboard. The blankets slid down his naked chest and pooled across his lap.</p><p>\u201cShe grew up with your mother, too, and she didn\u2019t have a dad to pick up the slack. It had to be hard on her, raising you all those years and then watching Sam step in to replace her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re defending her. She told me I was stupid to marry you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her that slow-growing smile that always made her go weak in the knees. \u201cDarlin\u2019, you can\u2019t hold that against her. She\u2019s just trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl me is more like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She leaned toward him. Her bare breasts breezed against his chest as they kissed. He slipped a hand around her neck and held her there, kissing her until she forgot their whole conversation. When she finally drew back, she was dizzy and breathing too hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to know you, Claire Cavenaugh-soon-to-be-Austin,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cYou had a headache after the wedding dress screwup and again last night. When Meghann hurts your feelings, you say you don\u2019t care and start chewing aspirin. I\u2019ve been there, darlin\u2019. I know what matters is that she\u2019s your sister. The only one you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Claire wanted to disagree but knew it was pointless. She did want to be close to Meg again. More and more often in the past few days, she\u2019d found herself remembering the old Meg. The way they used to love each other. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the way we are together,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can push my buttons like Meghann. She has a true gift for saying exactly the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My dad was like that. We never could quite make it work between us. Now he\u2019s gone, and I wish we\u2019d tried harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Sigmund Freud. I\u2019ll try talking to her. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more aspirin.\u201d</p><p>She gave him another long, lingering kiss, then walked naked into the bathroom. By the time she\u2019d finished showering and gotten dressed, he was gone.</p><p>She made her bed and walked across the hall to Ali\u2019s room. Her daughter lay in bed, hidden beneath a blue-and-green pile of Little Mermaid sheets and comforters.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie,\u201d she said, sitting on the edge of the twin bed. \u201cTime to wake up.\u201d</p><p>Alison stretched and rolled onto her back. \u201cDid we get a kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard a kitty meowing this morning.\u201d</p><p>Claire bit her lower lip to keep from smiling. Note to self: Come quietly. \u201cNope, no kitty. You must have been dreaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 I heard someone on the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . uh . . . went down to make coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, could we get a puppy? Amy Schmidt has one and her mom is \u2019lergic to dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a goldfish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMo-om. The last goldfish got flushed down the toilet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it, okay? Now hurry downstairs. I\u2019m making blueberry pancakes for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Claire went down to start the coffee. By the time Alison came into the kitchen, dragging her Groovy Girl doll behind her, the eggs and pancakes were ready.</p><p>Alison climbed up onto her chair, positioned the doll in her lap, and started pouring syrup.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough syrup,\u201d Claire said as she flipped another pancake on the Teflon griddle.</p><p>\u201cYou and Bobby and Aunt Meghann took a shower together last night. How\u2019dya all fit?\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a shower with water. It\u2019s a party for people who are going to be married. You know, like a birthday party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidja play games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Thong underwear. Chocolate body paint. A giant box of rubbers. \u201cAunt Meghann gave us a Cuisinart.\u201d At Ali\u2019s confused look, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s a way-cool blender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Grandpa is taking me fishing today. Up at Tidwell Pond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said you had wedding shit to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlison Katherine. You know better than to repeat Grandpa\u2019s bad words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d Ali bent forward and started licking the syrup off her plate. In no time, it was clean. \u201cDid you know that if you cut a worm in half, it\u2019ll grow back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did know that.\u201d</p><p>She pushed back from her seat. \u201cBut Lily France got her finger cut off an\u2019 it didn\u2019t grow back.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI think God likes worms better than Lily. It\u2019s cuz she cuts in line at lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Mom!\u201d Alison threw her a kiss and scampered off. The screen door banged shut behind her. A moment later, Claire heard her daughter\u2019s high-pitched voice yell out, \u201cI\u2019m here, Grandpa. Were you lookin\u2019 for me?\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled and turned off the griddle, then poured herself a second cup of coffee and went out to the back porch. The slatted swing welcomed her.</p><p>She sat there, rocking gently, staring out at the silver curve of water that defined her back property line. The house was set well back from the river, on a rise of safety, but on a day like today, with the sky as blue as forget-me-nots and the grass turning golden from an unexpected week of sunlight, it was almost impossible to remember how dangerous the river could be.</p><p>The screen door screeched open and banged shut. Meghann stepped out onto the porch. She wore a fringed black peasant top and flare-legged jeans. Her hair, unbound, fell down her back in a riot of curls. She looked beautiful. \u201cMorning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire pulled the woolen blanket tighter around her legs, hiding the ratty, torn sweats she\u2019d put on. \u201cYou want some pancakes?\u201d</p><p>Meg sat down on the wooden Adirondack chair across from the swing. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m still trying to metabolize last night\u2019s cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure left the party early.\u201d Claire hoped she sounded casual and not hurt.</p><p>\u201cIt was a nice party. Your friend Gina has a great sense of humor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be hard on her\u2014watching your wedding so soon after her own divorce.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s going through a really difficult time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always hard to find out you married the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were married for fifteen years. Just because they got divorced doesn\u2019t mean he was the wrong man to marry.\u201d</p> <p>Meg looked at her. \u201cI would say it meant exactly that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric really played a number on you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Claire took a sip of coffee. It occurred to her to drop the whole thing, to do what she\u2019d always done around Meg\u2014shut up and pretend it didn\u2019t hurt. Then she remembered her conversation with Bobby. Slowly, she said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question: How come you left the shower early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that early. How were your presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were great. Thank you for the Cuisinart, by the way. Now: Why did you leave early?\u201d</p> <p>Meg closed her eyes, then slowly opened them. She looked . . . scared.</p><p>It shocked Claire so much she straightened. \u201cMeg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the M&amp;M game,\u201d she answered. \u201cI tried to be a good sport and play the game, but I barely know you, so I said something wrong. I still don\u2019t know what the hell it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I loved well but not easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s true, that\u2019s all, and it hurt my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true for me,\u201d Meg said.</p><p>Claire leaned forward. They were finally circling something that mattered. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to love you, Meg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d She laughed, but it was a bitter, throaty sound.</p><p>\u201cYou judge people\u2014me\u2014so harshly. Your opinions are like bullwhips. Every one leaves a bloody mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople, yes. But you? I don\u2019t judge you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI flunked out of college. I dropped out of cosmetology school. I never left Hayden. I dress poorly. I had a child out of wedlock with a man whom I discovered was already married. Now I\u2019m marrying a three-time loser and I\u2019m too stupid to protect myself with a prenuptial agreement. Stop me when it sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>Meg frowned. \u201cHave I hung all that on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a suit of armor. I can\u2019t talk to you without feeling like a poor-white-trash loser. And, of course, you\u2019re rich and perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat part is true.\u201d Meg saw that her attempt at humor failed. \u201cMy therapist thinks I have control issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh. You\u2019re a lot like Mama, you know. You both need to run the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference is, she\u2019s psychotic. I\u2019m neurotic. But God knows she handed down bad luck with men.\u201d Meghann looked at her. \u201cHave you broken the curse?\u201d</p><p>Even yesterday, Claire would have been angered by the question. Now, she understood it. Claire\u2019s legacy from Mama was a belief that sooner or later love walked out on you. Meg had inherited something else entirely: She didn\u2019t believe in love at all. \u201cI have, Meg. Honestly.\u201d</p><p>Meg smiled, but there was a sadness in her eyes. \u201cI wish I had your faith.\u201d</p><p>For once, Claire felt like the stronger sister. \u201cI know love is real. It\u2019s in every moment I share with Ali and Dad. Maybe if . . . you\u2019d had a father, you\u2019d be able to believe in it.\u201d Claire saw the way her sister went pale; she knew she\u2019d gone too far.</p><p>\u201cYou were lucky to have Sam,\u201d Meg said slowly.</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t help thinking about the summer Dad had tried to be there for Meg. It had been a nightmare. Meg and Sam had had screaming fights about who loved Claire more, who knew what was best for her. It had been Claire herself who\u2019d ended the worst of the battles. She\u2019d cried out to Meg, Quit yelling at my daddy. That was the first time she\u2019d seen her sister cry. The next day, Meg had gone. Years later, she\u2019d finally called Claire. By then, Meg was in college and had her own life.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to be there for you, too,\u201d Claire said gently.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t my father.\u201d</p><p>They fell silent after that. The quiet bothered Claire, compelled her to stack up words between them, but she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>She was saved by the phone. When it rang, she jumped up and ran inside the house to answer it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold for Eliana Sullivan, please.\u201d</p><p>Claire heard Meg come up behind her. She mouthed: Mama.</p><p>\u201cThis should be good,\u201d Meg said, pouring herself a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Mama said. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mama, it\u2019s me, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Mama laughed, that throaty, carefully sexy sound she\u2019d cultivated over the years. \u201cI believe I know which of my own daughters I called, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Claire answered, although Mama confused the two of them all the time. Her memories were completely interchangeable. When called on it, Mama would say airily, Whatever; y\u2019all were thick as thieves back then. How\u2019m I supposed to keep every little detail straight?</p><p>\u201cWell, honey, speak up. M\u2019houseboy said you left me a message. What\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>Claire hated the faux Southern accent. Every elongated vowel reminded her that she was ultimately \u201cthe audience\u201d to Mama. \u201cI called to tell you I\u2019m getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned. I thought for sure you were going to die an old maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love him, Mama. He\u2019s a nice Texas boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy? I thought that was your sister\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>Claire actually laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s a man, Mama. Thirty-seven years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much money does he make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroke, huh? Well, I\u2019ll give you my best advice, honey. It\u2019s easier to marry the rich ones, but what the hell. Congratulations. When\u2019s the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday the twenty-third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf June? You mean this comin\u2019 Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. You would have had plenty of notice if you\u2019d called me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was doing Shakespeare in the park. With Charlie Sheen, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, honey. You know I have to take care of my fans. They\u2019re my life\u2019s blood. Did you see my picture in People, by the way? Just me and Jules Asner, sharin\u2019 a little girl talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed that. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you a subscription. What do y\u2019all do, just let it sit around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy with the wedding plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Well, Saturday\u2019s difficult for me, honey. How about the first weekend in August?\u201d</p><p>Claire rolled her eyes. \u201cAs interested as I am in your schedule, Mama, the invitations have already gone out. Meg\u2019s busy planning the big day. It\u2019s too late to change the date.\u201d</p><p>Mama laughed. \u201cMeg is planning your wedding? Honey, that\u2019s like asking the pope to plan a bar mitzvah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding is Saturday. I hope you\u2019ll be able to attend.\u201d There she was, getting stiff and formal again, her usual reaction to stress.</p><p>Meghann handed her an aspirin.</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cShe gives me a migraine every time,\u201d Meg said. \u201cIs she still babbling?\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded, whispered, \u201cI think I heard the name Anna Nicole Smith.\u201d</p><p>Meg grinned. \u201cAnother nice Southern girl with intimacy issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Mama said sharply. \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mama. Every word is a pearl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time on Saturday? I asked you twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding is at seven P.M. Reception to follow.\u201d</p><p>Mama sighed. \u201cSaturday. I\u2019ve been waitin\u2019 three months for my hair appointment with Jos\u00e9. Maybe he can take me early.\u201d</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t take any more. \u201cI\u2019ve got to run, Mama. I\u2019ll be at the Hayden Episcopal Church at seven this Saturday. I hope you can make it, but I\u2019ll certainly understand if you\u2019re too busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am busy. But how often does a woman\u2019s daughter get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn our family, not often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me straight up, honey. D\u2019you think this one\u2019ll last? I\u2019d hate to give up my hair appointment for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go, Mama. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey. Me, too. And congratulations. I couldn\u2019t be happier for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mama. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Claire tried to smile as she looked up at Meghann. \u201cSaturday\u2019s a bad day for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? An audition for the $25,000 Pyramid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hair appointment with Jos\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have sent her the invite after it was over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I keep expecting something different from her.\u201d</p><p>Meg shook her head. \u201cYeah, I know. Even a mother alligator sticks around the eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama would make herself an omelette.\u201d</p><p>They actually laughed at that.</p><p>Claire looked out the window. Sunlight streamed onto her yard, made the flowers glow. She took peace from that view; it reminded her of all that was right with her world. It was best to forget about Mama. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the wedding plans,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Maybe we could go over the menu.\u201d</p><p>Claire straightened. \u201cOf course. I was thinking about those foot-long submarine sandwiches. They really feed a lot of people, and the men love them. Gina\u2019s potato salad is a perfect side dish.\u201d</p><p>Meghann was staring at her. \u201cPotato salad and submarine sandwiches. That would be . . .\u201d She paused. \u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou paused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I? I think I took a breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that pause. It\u2019s judgment talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No. I had just talked to a girlfriend of mine. Carla. She\u2019s a struggling chef\u2014just graduated\u2014and she\u2019s broke. Can\u2019t pay her rent. She offered to do up some hors d\u2019oeuvres for cost plus a tiny amount. She needs the word of mouth; you know how it is. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be happy to go to Safeway for the food, if that\u2019s what you\u2019d rather do.\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned. \u201cWould it really help your friend out? Catering the reception?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would, but that\u2019s not what matters. What I care about is that you get the wedding you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow much would it cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same as submarine sandwiches and potato salad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.

I\u2019m sure I would have thought of that.\u201d</p> <p>Claire thought her sister paused again, but she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Meg smiled. It was only a little forced. \u201cNow, oddly enough, I also know an out-of-work baker who could make a four-layer cake with fresh flowers. She recommends violets, but of course, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Meg, you\u2019re a complete pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Judgmental and unforgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. But you take charge well.\u201d</p> <p>Meghann\u2019s smile faded. Claire knew her sister was thinking of that summer, so many years ago, when Meg had taken charge and changed all their lives.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything bad by that,\u201d Claire said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s such a damn minefield between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, about the cake . . .\u201d</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>\u201cI\u2019VE GOTTEN THE PERMIT FOR THE PARK, AND THE TENT IS reserved from the party rental store. I\u2019ll go over the final details of setup with them tomorrow on my way to Costco.\u201d Roy sat back with a flourish. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the lights?\u201d Meghann asked, checking off the tent from her list.</p><p>\u201cTen thousand white Christmas lights, forty-two Chinese lanterns, and twenty hanging lights. Check.\u201d</p><p>Meghann marked her list accordingly. That was it. Everything on her list had been taken care of. In the past two days, she\u2019d worked her ass off, checking and rechecking each detail. She\u2019d arranged for every single thing that Roy had wanted. It was going to be, he declared at least three times a day, the best wedding ever to take place in Hayden.</p><p>Meghann didn\u2019t think that was much of a standard, but she was learning to keep her cynical thoughts to herself. She\u2019d even been working so hard that she slept at night. The only problem now was her dreams.</p><p>They all seemed to be about Joe. When she closed her eyes, she remembered everything about that night. The blue eyes that were so sad . . . the way he\u2019d whispered something\u2014a name, maybe\u2014while they were making love.</p><p>Making love.</p><p>She\u2019d never thought of it that way, not with anyone.</p><p>\u201cMeghann? You\u2019re getting that mushy look again. Are you thinking about the hors d\u2019oeuvres?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at Roy. \u201cYou should have seen Carla\u2019s face when I told her she\u2019d have to do up a tray of pigs in blankets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to admit it, but . . . they are tasty, you know. Dipped in ketchup. Even better dragged in baked beans. They\u2019ll probably disappear long before the Brie and p\u00e2t\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t let her do p\u00e2t\u00e9.\u201d Meghann consulted her list again. It was a habit, checking and rechecking everything.</p><p>Roy touched her arm. \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re done. All you have to do is show up at the rehearsal tonight and then get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Roy. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without you on all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, it has been an unexpected pleasure to work on this wedding. My next event is a potluck keggar in the Clausens\u2019 cow field to celebrate little Todd\u2019s acceptance to community college.\u201d</p><p>After the meeting, she headed back toward her car. She\u2019d walked several blocks before she realized she was going in the wrong direction. She was just about to turn around when she saw the garage. There, tucked back in a thicket of trees and runaway salal, was Joe\u2019s cabin.</p><p>She had a sudden urge to walk up to the door, say, Hey, Joe, and follow him to the bedroom. The sex had been great. Hell, it had been better than great. So good that she\u2019d sneaked off in the middle of the night. She\u2019d always been better at good-bye than good morning.</p><p>The light in his kitchen went on. She saw a shadow cross the window, a flash of silvery hair.</p><p>She almost went to him.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>The one thing she knew for certain\u2014had learned from hard-won experience\u2014was that anonymous sex was all she could handle.</p><p>She turned and walked back to her car.</p><p>Joe stood at the kitchen sink, listening to the water running. It gargled down the rusty pipes. He was supposed to be washing his lunch dishes\u2014that\u2019s why he\u2019d come over here, after all\u2014but he couldn\u2019t make his hands work.</p><p>She was standing across the street, looking at his house.</p><p>Meghann. Friends call me Meg.</p><p>She stood perfectly still, her arms crossed, her pointy chin held up just the slightest bit. Beside her, a huge hanging pot of flowers sent a red trailer of blossoms along her upper arm. She didn\u2019t seem to notice. Probably didn\u2019t notice their scent, either. She didn\u2019t strike him as a romantic woman.</p><p>\u201cMeghann.\u201d He said her name softly, surprised by the unexpected rush of longing that came with it. He\u2019d thought about her too often in the hours since their meeting.</p><p>He told himself it meant nothing, was simply an excess of hormones in a body that had been cold for years. But now, looking at her, wanting her again, he knew he was lying to himself.</p><p>Across the street, she took a step toward him.</p><p>His heartbeat sped up, his hands clenched.</p><p>Then she turned and walked away, quickly.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said, wishing he meant it.</p><p>He shut the water off and dried his hands. Slowly, he went to the mantel and stood in front of a picture of Diana. In it, she stood at the base of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, waving at him. She was smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, touching the glass.</p><p>The phone rang, startling him.</p><p>He knew who it was, of course. \u201cHey, Gina,\u201d he answered, reaching for his work gloves.</p><p>\u201cHey, big brother. I know it\u2019s late notice, but I\u2019m having a rehearsal dinner at my house tonight. I thought you might like to come.\u201d</p><p>A rehearsal dinner. Prelude to a wedding. \u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Claire Cavenaugh. She\u2019s finally getting married.\u201d</p><p>Joe closed his eyes, remembering Claire. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gigi,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d The only thing worse than celebrating a marriage would be walking into a hospital.</p><p>\u201cI understand, Joey. Really. I\u2019ll call you next week.\u201d</p><p>Claire sat in the doctor\u2019s waiting room, reading the newest issue of People magazine. There it was, a picture of her mother in some city park, surrounded by fans dressed in full space-traveler regalia. The caption read: Eliana Sullivan mobbed by fans on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Starbase IV\u2019s first show.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. I had better Halloween costumes in second grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled down at her daughter, who sat cross-legged on the taupe-colored carpet, playing with a Cat in the Hat doll. \u201cNothing, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. How much longer? I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much longer. Dr. Roloff is busy with people who are really sick. You saw Sammy Chan go in\u2014he has a broken arm.\u201d</p><p>Alison frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not sick, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. This is my yearly appointment. You always come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ali went back to playing.</p><p>A few minutes later, the receptionist\u2014Monica Lundberg\u2014came out into the waiting room. As always, she looked beautiful, this time in a pale celery-colored sundress. \u201cDoctor will see you now.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked down at Alison. \u201cStay right here, honey. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch her,\u201d Monica said. \u201cYou go on into room four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Claire went down the hallway and turned into the last room on the left.</p><p>\u201cHey, Claire, how\u2019re the wedding plans going?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at Bess, the nurse who had worked for Dr. Roloff for as long as anyone could remember.</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019re having something simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d Bess took Claire\u2019s blood pressure and temperature. \u201cGood blood pressure, kiddo. You must be living right.\u201d She took a quick blood sample, then burrowed through the cupboard over the sink and withdrew a plastic specimen cup. \u201cYou know the drill. Leave a sample in the door in the rest room. Doctor will be in as soon as he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Bess.\u201d</p><p>Bess winked. \u201cSee you tomorrow. Bye.\u201d And she was gone.</p><p>Claire hurried across the hall, left a urine sample in the bathroom, then returned to the room, where she dressed quickly in the hospital gown and climbed up onto the paper-covered examination table.</p><p>Moments later, Dr. Roloff walked in. He was a tall, gray-haired man with stern eyes and a ready smile. He\u2019d been Claire\u2019s doctor for most of her life. He\u2019d tended her through ear infections, acne, and pregnancy. Now he was Alison\u2019s doctor. Sam\u2019s, too.</p><p>The doctor sat down on a rolling stool and moved toward her. \u201cHow\u2019re the wedding plans going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Will you and Tina be able to make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d He paused, looked down for a minute. Claire knew he was thinking about the daughter he\u2019d lost. \u201cDiana would have loved your wedding.\u201d</p><p>Claire swallowed hard. It was true. One of the hardest parts of this wedding was doing it without Diana. The Bluesers had always done everything together. \u201cShe always said I was saving myself for royalty.\u201d</p><p>He finally looked up. The smile he offered was tired and more than a little worn. \u201cDid you hear about Joe? He\u2019s back in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. How is he?\u201d</p><p>Henry sighed heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He hasn\u2019t been to see Tina and me.\u201d It was obvious how hurt the doctor was by that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure.\u201d Dr. Roloff pushed the glasses higher on his nose and straightened. \u201cWell, enough of that.\u201d Opening her chart, he studied it. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not due to see me for another two months. Why so early, Claire? Usually we have to send three notices and make a phone call to get you in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBirth control pills,\u201d she said, feeling her cheeks heat up. It was ridiculous; she was thirty-five years old. There was no reason to be embarrassed. But she was. \u201cWe want to wait awhile before we get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He studied her chart again, then nodded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you on them for too many years, but for now you\u2019ll be okay. We\u2019ll start you on the mini pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Roloff set her chart aside. \u201cLet\u2019s do your Pap smear.\u201d</p><p>When he was finished, Claire sat up.</p><p>\u201cYour dad told me you had a headache last week,\u201d he said, stripping off his gloves. \u201cAnd that you twisted your left ankle.\u201d</p><p>Life in a small town. Claire sighed. For as long as she could remember, her dad had run to the doctor whenever she had a hangnail or a loose tooth. Her arrival at adulthood hadn\u2019t changed his behavior. \u201cLast year he thought I had M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease after a ride on the Ferris wheel made me dizzy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled at that. \u201cSam is certainly vigilant in terms of health care, that\u2019s true. You should have seen him when you were little. I got three calls a week asking if such-and-such was normal. Things like three sneezes in a row would set him off. Nonetheless, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a fool. Do the headaches seem to be triggered by your cycles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-five,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cIt seems like I\u2019m always ovulating or flowing. So, yeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever start exercising?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver? Ninth grade was a good year for me. I went out for track and volleyball.\u201d</p> <p>He wrote something in her chart. Probably couch potato.</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a baby. Since I met Bobby . . .\u201d She blushed again. \u201cWell, you know. I sleep great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that. Stress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a single mother who is about to get married for the first time. The sister I barely know is planning the wedding, and my mother is threatening to come. So, yes, I\u2019m a little stressed out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Tell your dad I said everything is fine. No worries. But get some exercise. It\u2019s the best treatment for stress. Also, you\u2019re a little anemic again. That can cause headaches, too. So start taking some iron, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow get that beautiful little girl of yours home and start doing that woman-wedding thing. The whole town is looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you wait fifteen years after everyone else in your class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were only moments away from being labeled the town spinster. I don\u2019t know who Bess and Tina will worry about now.\u201d His eyes sparkled behind the small round glasses.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Doc.\u201d</p> <p>He patted her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Claire. We all are.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>THE AFTERNOON TURNED GRAY AND COLD. RAIN FELL IN tiny staccato bursts that were all but invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>Claire spent the rest of the day pretending to work.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Claire,\u201d her father said to her whenever he happened to walk into the office and see her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d was her standard answer, and every time she said it, he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re a big help today. Go take a bath. Do your nails.\u201d</p><p>She was too nervous to take a bath or do her nails. Thirty-five was too old to marry for the first time. How could she possibly be doing the right thing?</p> <p>But every time her worries threatened to overwhelm her, she\u2019d turn a corner or open a door and see Bobby. He was painting the fence around the laundry room the first time she saw him, scrubbing canoes the second.</p><p>He\u2019d looked up at her approach both times. Hey, darlin\u2019, he\u2019d said, smiling. I love you.</p><p>Just that, those few and precious words, and Claire breathed easier again, for an hour or so, until the doubts once again welled up.</p><p>Finally, at around three in the afternoon, she gave up and walked back to her house. Toys lay scattered on the grass in the front yard; a Barbie that was half dressed, a pink plastic bucket and tiny shovel, a red Fisher-Price barn, complete with farm animals. She picked everything up and headed for the house.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Meghann said when she walked in.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, sighing as she walked over to the toy box and dumped her load in.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She certainly didn\u2019t want to discuss her wedding jitters with Miss Prenup.</p><p>Meghann got up. Claire could feel her sister\u2019s gaze; it was lawyerly and intense. Not a sister-to-sister look at all. \u201cI was just going to have some iced tea. Would you like one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA margarita would be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Sit.\u201d</p><p>Claire sank onto the sofa and put her feet up on the magazine-covered coffee table.</p><p>Meg was back in no time, holding two glasses. \u201cHere you are.\u201d</p><p>Claire took the glass and tried the margarita. \u201cThis is good. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Meg sat in the bentwood rocker by the fireplace. \u201cYou\u2019re scared,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>Claire jumped as if she\u2019d been shouted at. \u201cAnyone would be.\u201d She took another drink, careful not to make eye contact. She felt like a squirrel in the presence of a cobra.</p><p>Meg moved to the sofa and sat down beside Claire. \u201cIt\u2019s normal, believe me. If you weren\u2019t scared right now, I\u2019d take your pulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should be scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember when Elizabeth and Jack got married. They were as in love as any two people I\u2019ve ever seen. And she still needed two martinis to walk down the aisle. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t be afraid, Claire. Maybe that\u2019s why weddings take place in churches\u2014because each one is an act of faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I should sign a prenuptial agreement to protect my assets in case we get divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. Protecting people is what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou protect strangers. Members of your family are a different thing.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked down at her drink, then said softly, \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Claire wished she could take back that little cruelty. What was it about their past that made them wound each other so consistently? \u201cI know you\u2019re trying to help, but how can you? You don\u2019t believe in love. Or marriage.\u201d</p><p>It was a moment before Meg answered, and when she did speak, her voice was soft. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a baby crow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way to work, I see crows clustered along the phone lines in the waterfront park. So I know that every spring there are nests somewhere, filled with tiny newborn crows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeg, are you having a seizure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is: I know things exist that I never see. Love has to be one of them. I\u2019m trying to believe in it for you.\u201d</p><p>Claire knew how much it cost her sister to say something like that. No one who\u2019d grown up in Mama\u2019s shadow found it easy to believe in love. That Meghann would try, for Claire\u2019s sake, really meant something. \u201cThank you. And thanks for planning the wedding. Even if you are keeping every detail a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been more fun that I thought. Kinda like being on the prom committee\u2014not that I ever would have been on such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was Prom Queen.\u201d Claire grinned. \u201cNo kidding, and Rhododendron Princess, too, at Mountaineering Days.\u201d</p><p>Meghann laughed. Obviously she was relieved by a return to casual conversation. \u201cWhat does the rhodie princess do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit in the back of a 1953 Ford pickup in a dress the color of Pepto-Bismol and wave at the crowd. The 4-H Goat Club walked behind us in the parade. It was raining so hard that I ended up looking like Tim Curry at the end of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Dad took about three dozen photos and put them all in an album.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked down at her drink again. It was a moment before she spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice memory.\u201d</p><p>Claire immediately regretted her comment. All it did was highlight Meghann\u2019s fatherlessness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were lucky to have Sam. And Ali is lucky to have you. You\u2019re a great mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you regret it?\u201d Claire said, surprising both of them with the intimate question. \u201cNot having kids, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a divorce lawyer made me sterile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeghann,\u201d she said evenly.</p><p>Meg finally looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be any good at it. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a good mother to me. For a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018for a while\u2019 that matters.\u201d</p><p>Claire leaned toward her sister. \u201cI\u2019d like you to baby-sit Alison next week. While Bobby and I are on our honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t taking a honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad insisted. His wedding gift was a week\u2019s trip to Kauai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to baby-sit?\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled. \u201cIt would mean a lot to me. Ali needs to know you better.\u201d</p><p>Meghann released a fluttery breath. She looked nervous. \u201cYou\u2019d trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Meg sat back. A tremulous smile curved her lips. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Claire grinned. \u201cNo taking her to the shooting range or teaching her to bungee-jump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, skydiving lessons are out. Can I take her for a pony ride?\u201d</p><p>They were still laughing when Dad pushed through the door and came into the living room. He was already dressed for the rehearsal in black pants\u2014freshly ironed\u2014and a pale blue denim shirt with a River\u2019s Edge logo on the pocket. His brown hair had been recently cut and was combed back from his forehead. If Claire didn\u2019t know better, she\u2019d think he\u2019d moussed it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. You look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He flashed an uncomfortable smile at her sister. \u201cMeg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Meg said stiffly as she got to her feet. \u201cI need to get dressed. Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>When Meghann had disappeared upstairs, Sam sighed and shook his head. \u201cI feel about two feet tall when she looks at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling. What\u2019s going on, Dad? I need to get dressed.\u201d She looked past him. \u201cI thought you were playing checkers with Ali?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby is trying to French-braid her hair.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed at that and started for the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll redo it before we leave. You want to pick me up in forty-five minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you first. Just for a minute. I didn\u2019t know if I should talk to Bobby at the same time\u2014\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t my long-overdue sex talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to you about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it is not a talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWiseass.\u201d He nodded toward the couch. \u201cSit down. And don\u2019t give me any lip. This\u2019ll just take a second.\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the coffee table. \u201cMargaritas, already?\u201d he said, glancing at Meg\u2019s glass.</p><p>\u201cI was a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me think of when I married your mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, she was power-drinking all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both were.\u201d He smiled, but it was a little sad, that smile, and it excluded Claire somehow.</p><p>After a short pause, he reached into his pocket, pulled out a small black box, and opened it.</p><p>Inside was a marquise-cut yellow diamond set on a wide platinum band. \u201cIt\u2019s your grandma Myrtle\u2019s diamond. She wanted you to have it.\u201d</p><p>The ring sparked a dozen sweet memories. Whenever her grandmother had dealt a hand of cards, this diamond had splashed tiny colored reflections on the walls.</p><p>Dad reached out, took her hand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let my baby get married with a tinfoil ring.\u201d</p><p>She tried it on. The ring fit as if it had been made for her. She leaned over and pulled him into her arms. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He smelled of woodsmoke and bay rum aftershave, as he had for the whole of her life, and in that moment, as she held him with her face pressed against his cheek, she remembered a dozen times from her girlhood. Nights they\u2019d gone bowling and had dinner at Zeke\u2019s Drive-In . . . the way the porch light flickered ten seconds after she and her date pulled into the driveway . . . the stories he used to tell her at bedtime when she felt scared and alone and missed her big sister. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After tomorrow, she would be a married woman. Another man would be the center of her life, another arm would keep her steady. She would be Bobby\u2019s wife from now on; not Sam Cavenaugh\u2019s little girl.</p><p>When Dad drew back, there were tears in his eyes, and she knew he\u2019d been thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He nodded in understanding. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p> <p>NINETEEN</p><p>MEGHANN WISHED TO GOD SHE\u2019D NEVER AGREED TO LET Gina host and plan the rehearsal dinner. Every moment was pure hell.</p><p>Are you here by yourself?</p><p>Where\u2019s your husband?</p><p>You don\u2019t have children? Well. That\u2019s lucky, sometimes I wish I could give mine away. This one was followed by a clearly uncomfortable laugh.</p> <p>No husband, huh? It must be great to be so independent. This one was always followed by a frown.</p><p>Meghann knew that Claire\u2019s friends were trying to make conversation with her; they just didn\u2019t know what to say. How could they? This was a group of women who talked endlessly about their families. Summer camp start-times were a big topic of conversation; also resorts that were \u201ckid friendly\u201d on Lake Chelan and along the Oregon Coast. Meghann had no idea what kid friendly even meant. That they served ketchup with every meal, maybe.</p><p>They were trying to include her, especially the Bluesers, but the more they tried to make her a part of the group, the more alienated she felt. She could talk about a lot of things\u2014world politics, the situation in the Mideast, where to get the best deal on designer clothes, real estate markets, and Wall Street. What she couldn\u2019t talk about were family things. Kid things.</p><p>Meghann stood at the fireplace in Gina\u2019s beautifully decorated house, sipping her second margarita. This one, like the first, was disappearing much too quickly. There were pods of people everywhere\u2014on the deck, in the living room, sitting at the dining-room table\u2014all talking and laughing among themselves. Across the room, Claire stood at the kitchen bar/counter, eating potato chips and laughing with Gina. As Meghann watched, Bobby came up behind Claire and whispered something in her ear. She immediately turned into his arms. They came together like puzzle pieces, fitting perfectly, and when Claire looked up at Bobby, her face glowed.</p><p>Love.</p><p>There it was, in all its quicksilver glory.</p> <p>Please, God, she found herself praying for the first time in years, let it be real.</p><p>\u201cOkay, everyone,\u201d Gina said, coming into the room. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for the second part of the evening.\u201d</p><p>A hush fell. Everyone looked up.</p><p>Gina smiled. \u201cHector is opening the bowling alley just for us! We leave in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Bowling. Rented shoes. Polyester shirts. The division of people into teams.</p><p>Meg eased away from the wall. Taking a sip of her cocktail, she realized that she\u2019d finished it. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t really met yet. I\u2019m Harold Banner. Karen\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>Meghann was startled by the man\u2019s presence. She hadn\u2019t heard him approach. \u201cHello, Harold.\u201d</p> <p>He was a tall, thin man with bushy black eyebrows and a smile that was just a bit too wide, as if maybe he had too many teeth. \u201cI hear you\u2019re a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you then\u2014\u201d</p><p>She tried not to groan.</p><p>He barked out a braying laugh. \u201cJust kidding. I\u2019m a doctor. I get the same thing all the time. Everyone I meet mentions a pain somewhere.\u201d</p><p>In the ass, maybe. She nodded and looked down into her empty glass again.</p><p>\u201cI guess you left your husband at home, huh? Lucky guy. Karen makes me show up at everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m single.\u201d She tried not to grit her teeth, but this was about the tenth time she\u2019d had to reveal that tonight.</p><p>\u201cAh. Footloose and fancy-free. Lucky you. Kids?\u201d</p><p>She knew he was just being nice, trying to find some common ground for conversation, but she didn\u2019t care. Tonight had been brutal. One more reminder that she was a woman alone in the world and she\u2019d probably scream. Normally she was proud of her independence, but this small-town crowd made her feel as if she lacked something important. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harold. I need to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about bowling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bowl.\u201d She walked across the living room and came up beside Claire, gently putting her hand on her sister\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Claire turned. She looked so happy right then it took Meghann\u2019s breath away. When she saw Meghann, she laughed. \u201cLet me guess. You\u2019re not a bowler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love bowling. Really,\u201d she added at her sister\u2019s skeptical look. \u201cI have my own ball.\u201d She knew immediately that she\u2019d gone too far with that one.</p><p>\u201cYou do, huh?\u201d Claire leaned against Bobby, who was talking animatedly to Charlotte\u2019s husband.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I have a few last-minute details I need to go over for tomorrow. I have to get up early.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cI understand, Meg. I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d call Mama again, too.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s happy look faded. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll show up?\u201d</p><p>Meghann wished she could protect Claire from Mama. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to get her here.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell. Bye. I\u2019ll tell Gina why I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Meghann was in her car, speeding down the country road toward Hayden. She had the top down, and the cool night air whipped through her hair.</p><p>She tried to forget the rehearsal dinner, get the hurtful memories out of her mind, but she couldn\u2019t do it. Her sister\u2019s well-meaning friends had managed to underscore the emptiness of Meg\u2019s life.</p><p>She saw the sign for Mo\u2019s Fireside Tavern and slammed on the brakes.</p><p>It was a bad idea to go in, she knew. There was nothing but trouble in there. And yet . . .</p><p>She parked on the street and went inside the smoky bar. It was crowded tonight.</p><p>Friday. Of course.</p><p>Men sat on every barstool, at every table. There were a few women scattered throughout the crowd, but damn few.</p><p>She made her way through the place, boldly checking out every man. She got enough smiles to know that she could definitely find one here tonight.</p><p>She had toured the whole place and made her way back to the front door when she realized why she was really here.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she said softly, surprised. She honestly hadn\u2019t known that she wanted him.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>She left the bar. Out on the street, she took a deep breath of sweet mountain air. She never slept with a man twice. Or rarely, anyway. As her friend Elizabeth had once pointed out, Meghann would sometimes make a New Year\u2019s resolution to quit screwing college kids, and then date men without hair for a week or two, but that was pretty much the extent of her so-called dating life.</p><p>The amazing thing was, she didn\u2019t want to cull through the possibilities in the bar and bring home a stranger.</p><p>She wanted . . .</p><p>Joe.</p><p>She stood at her car, looking down the street at his small cabin. Light glowed from the windows.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said aloud. She shouldn\u2019t do it, but she was walking anyway, crossing the street, and entering his yard, which smelled of honeysuckle and jasmine. At the door, she paused, wondering what in the hell she was doing.</p><p>Then she knocked. There was a long silence. No one answered.</p><p>She twisted the knob and went inside. The cabin was dark and quiet. A single lamp glowed with soft light, and a fire crackled in the hearth.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d Cautiously, she stepped forward.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>A shiver crept along her spine. She sensed that he was here, close by, burrowed into the darkness like a wounded animal, watching her.</p><p>She was being ridiculous. He simply wasn\u2019t home. And she shouldn\u2019t be here.</p><p>She started to turn for the door when she saw the photographs. They were everywhere\u2014on the coffee table, the end tables, the windowsills, the mantel.</p><p>Frowning, she walked from place to place looking at the pictures. They were all of the same woman, a lovely blond with a Grace Kelly kind of elegance. There was something familiar about her. Meghann picked one up, smoothed her finger across the cheap Plexiglas frame. In this photograph, the woman was clearly trying to make pie dough from scratch. There was flour everywhere. She wore an apron that read: Kiss the Cook. Her smile was infectious. Meghann couldn\u2019t help smiling along with her.</p><p>\u201cDo you always break into other people\u2019s homes and paw through their things?\u201d</p><p>Meghann jumped back. Her fingers went numb\u2014just for a second, but it was time enough. The picture crashed to the floor. She turned around, looking for him. \u201cJoe? It\u2019s me, Meghann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>He was slumped in the corner of the room, with one leg bent and the other stretched out. Firelight illuminated his silvery hair and half of his face. She didn\u2019t know if it was the dim lighting, but she noticed the lines etched around his eyes. Sadness clung to him, made her wonder if he\u2019d been crying.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come in. Or come here, for that matter,\u201d she said, uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She turned and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cHave a drink with me.\u201d</p><p>She released a breath, realizing just then how much she\u2019d wanted him to ask her to stay. Slowly, she faced him.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartini?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. It was a dry, rustling sound that bore no resemblance to the real thing. \u201cI\u2019ve got scotch. And scotch.\u201d</p><p>She sidled past the coffee table and sat down on the worn leather sofa. \u201cI\u2019ll have a scotch.\u201d</p><p>He got up, shuffled across the room. She saw now why he\u2019d been so invisible; he had on worn black jeans and a black T-shirt.</p><p>She heard a splash of liquid, then a rattling of ice. As he poured her drink, she looked around the room. All those photographs of the Grace Kelly look-alike made her uncomfortable. These pictures weren\u2019t decoration; they were obsession, naked and unashamed. She tried to figure out where she\u2019d seen this woman but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>He stood in front of her. The top two buttons of his Levi\u2019s were undone, and the T-shirt was ripped at the collar, revealing a dark patch of chest hair.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He took a drink straight from the bottle, then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cSure.\u201d He didn\u2019t move away, just stood there, staring down at her. He was unsteady on his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d she said, finally getting it.</p><p>\u201cIss June twenty-second.\u201d He smiled, or tried to, but the sadness in his eyes made it impossible.</p><p>\u201cDo you have something against the twenty-second?\u201d</p><p>His gaze darted to the end table beside her. To the photographs clustered there. He looked quickly back at her. \u201cYou were here the other day. You didn\u2019t come in.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d seen her, standing on the street that afternoon, looking at his house. She couldn\u2019t think of how to answer, so she drank instead.</p><p>He sat down beside her.</p><p>She twisted around to face him, realizing an instant too late how close they were. She could feel his breath against her lips. She tried to edge away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reached out, grabbed her wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t leaving. But maybe I should.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her wrist suddenly. \u201cMaybe you should.\u201d He took another swig from the bottle.</p><p>\u201cWho is she, Joe?\u201d Her voice was soft, but in the quiet room, it seemed too loud, too intimate. She flinched, wishing she hadn\u2019t asked, surprised that she cared.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife. Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. She . . . left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn June twenty-second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019jou know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know about divorces. The anniversaries can be hell.\u201d Meghann stared into his sad, sad eyes and tried not to feel anything. It was better that way, safer. But sitting here beside him, close enough to be taken into his arms, she felt . . . needy. Maybe even desperate. Suddenly she wanted something from Joe; something more than sex.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go. You seem to want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been alone.\u201d</p><p>She heard the ache of loneliness in his voice and it drew her in. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>He reached out, touched her face. \u201cI can\u2019t offer you anything, Meghann.\u201d</p><p>The way he said her name, all sad and drawn out and slow, sent a shiver along her spine. She wanted to tell him that she didn\u2019t want anything from him except a night in his bed, but amazingly, she couldn\u2019t form the words. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo should you.\u201d</p><p>She felt fragile suddenly, as if this man she didn\u2019t know at all had the power to break her heart. \u201cWe\u2019re talking too much, Joe. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>In the fireplace, a log fell to the hearth floor with a thud. Sparks flooded into the room.</p><p>With a groan, he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, THE WEATHER IN HAYDEN WAS perfect. A bright sun rode high in the cornflower blue, cloudless sky. A thin, cooling breeze rustled through the trees, making music on the deep green maple leaves. By five o\u2019clock, Claire was ready to begin dressing. The problem was, she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Behind her, there was a knock at the door.</p> <p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said, thankful for the distraction.</p><p>Meghann stood in the doorway, holding a pile of plastic-sheathed dresses. She looked nervous, uncharacteristically uncertain. \u201cI thought maybe we\u2019d get dressed together.\u201d When Claire didn\u2019t answer instantly, Meghann said, \u201cYou probably think it\u2019s a stupid idea.\u201d She backed out of the room.</p><p>\u201cStop. I think it would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I just need to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I\u2019ll meet you back here in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>True to her word, Meghann was back in ten minutes, wearing a towel around her naked body. Once inside the room, she changed into a bra and panties, then dried her hair and fashioned it into a beautiful French twist.</p><p>\u201cThat looks great,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cI could do your hair if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I did it all the time when you were little.\u201d</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t remember that, and yet she crossed the room and automatically knelt in front of the bed.</p><p>Meghann settled in behind her, began brushing her hair. She hummed as she worked.</p><p>Claire closed her eyes. It felt so good to have someone brushing her hair.</p><p>It came to her then, floating on the lullaby of her sister\u2019s humming, a memory.</p><p>You\u2019ll be the prettiest girl in all of Barstow kindergarten, Claire-Bear. I\u2019ll put this pink ribbon all through your braids and it\u2019ll protect you.</p><p>Like a magic ribbon?</p><p>Yes. Just exactly like that. Now sit still and let me finish.</p><p>\u201cYou did do my hair when I was little.\u201d</p><p>The hairbrush paused, then began stroking again. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I remembered more of those years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I remembered less.\u201d</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t know what to say to that, so she changed the subject. \u201cHave you heard from Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I left three messages yesterday. Her houseboy told me she\u2019d call back at a better time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point getting mad at her. She is who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. A has-been actress and a never-was mother.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. \u201cShe\u2019d debate \u2018has-been actress\u2019 with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. After all, she\u2019s done Shakespeare in Cleveland. There. All done.\u201d</p><p>Claire climbed to her feet and started to head for the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Meghann pulled her back to the bed. \u201cSit down here. No one is supposed to do their own wedding makeup.\u201d Meg got up, ran to her bedroom, and returned a minute later with a box big enough to hold fishing tackle.</p><p>Claire frowned as she sat down. \u201cNot too much. I don\u2019t want to look like Tammy Faye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought you did.\u201d Meghann opened the tackle box. Inside lay dozens of shiny black compacts emblazoned with the interlocked Chanel Cs.</p><p>Claire smiled. \u201cI think you spend too much time at Nordstrom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Claire did as she was told. Whisper-soft bristles breezed across her eyelids and along her cheekbones.</p><p>Fairy kisses, that\u2019s what I call \u2019em.</p><p>Halloween. The year they lived in Medford, Oregon. Mama had been waiting tables during the day and dancing in a strip club at night.</p><p>Can you make me look like a princess, Meggy? Claire had asked, eyeing Mama\u2019s oh-so-off-limits bag of makeup.</p><p>Of course I can, silly. Now, close your eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s legs were unsteady as she got to her feet. She looked at Meghann, sitting there on her knees with the makeup box open beside her and, for a split second, Claire was a six-year-old princess, holding her big sister\u2019s hand on Halloween night.</p><p>\u201cGo look.\u201d</p><p>Claire went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror.</p><p>Her blond hair had been loosely drawn back from her face and twisted into an elegant roll. The hairstyle emphasized her cheekbones and made her eyes look huge. She\u2019d never looked this pretty. Never.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it. I can change it. Come over here.\u201d</p><p>Claire turned to her sister. They were always doing that to each other, misinterpreting, imagining the worst. No wonder every conversation bruised one or the other. \u201cI love it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Meghann\u2019s smile was dazzling. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Claire took a step toward her. \u201cWhat happened to us, Meg?\u201d</p><p>Meghann\u2019s smile faded. \u201cYou know what happened. Please. Let\u2019s not talk about it now. Not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying \u2018not today\u2019 for years. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s worked, do you?\u201d</p><p>Meghann released a heavy sigh. \u201cSome things hurt too much to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Claire knew about that. It was the principle that had guided their whole relationship. Unfortunately, it had kept them strangers to each other. \u201cSometimes silence hurts most of all.\u201d She heard the ache in her voice; there was no way to mask it.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re living proof of that.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>Suddenly the door banged open. \u201cMommy!\u201d Ali raced into the room, already wearing her beautiful ice-blue silk bridesmaid dress. \u201cHurry, Mommy, come look.\u201d She grabbed Claire\u2019s hand, dragged her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cJust a second, honey.\u201d Claire threw Meghann a bathrobe, then slipped a nightgown over her own head and followed Ali downstairs. Outside in the driveway, Dad, Bobby, and Alison stood around a candy-apple-red convertible.</p><p>Claire moved toward them, frowning. That was when she noticed the pink bow on the hood. \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d</p><p>Dad handed her a note. It read:</p><p>Dear Claire and Bobby,</p><p>Best of luck on your big day. I\u2019m</p><p>still hoping to make it up there.</p><p>Hugs and kisses,</p><p>Mama</p><p>Claire stood there a long time, staring down at the car. She knew what it meant: Mama wasn\u2019t going to make it to the wedding. Probably, she chose the hard-to-get hair appointment instead.</p><p>Meg came up beside her, laid a hand on her shoulder. \u201cLet me guess: Mama\u2019s wedding gift.\u201d</p><p>Claire sighed. \u201cLeave it to Mama to give me a car with two seats. Am I supposed to have Ali run along behind?\u201d</p><p>Then she laughed. What else could she do?</p><p>Claire stood in the dressing room at the small Episcopal church on Front Street. The last hour had been nonstop action. She and Meghann hadn\u2019t found five minutes to talk.</p><p>The Bluesers had been in and out of the dressing room every few minutes, oohing and aahing over her dress, and Meghann had been busily checking details, clipboard in hand. Ali had asked at least a dozen times which step she was supposed to stand on.</p><p>But now, the room was mercifully quiet. Claire stood in front of the full-length mirror, unable to quite grasp that the woman in the glass was her. The gown fit perfectly, flowing to the floor in a cascade of white silk, and the veil made her look every bit the princess.</p><p>Her wedding day.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite believe it. Every night since meeting Bobby, she\u2019d gone to sleep wondering if he\u2019d be there in the morning. When the sun came up, she was quietly amazed to find him still there.</p><p>Another lovely legacy from childhood, she supposed.</p><p>But soon, she would be Mrs. Robert Jackson Austin.</p><p>There was a knock at the door.</p><p>It was Meghann. \u201cThe church is packed. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Claire swallowed hard. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Meghann took her sister\u2019s arm and led her out to the small area behind the closed church doors. Dad was already there, waiting with Ali.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ali Kat, you look like a princess,\u201d Claire said, kneeling down to kiss her daughter.</p><p>Alison giggled, twirled. \u201cI love my dress, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Behind the doors, the music started. It was time.</p><p>Meghann bent down to Alison. \u201cAre you ready, sweetie? You walk slow\u2014like we practiced, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ali hopped up and down. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Meghann eased the door open a crack. Ali slipped through and disappeared.</p><p>Dad turned to Claire. His eyes filled slowly with tears. \u201cI guess you\u2019re not my little girl anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet ready,\u201d Meghann said; a second later, the organ started \u201cHere Comes the Bride,\u201d and she opened the doors.</p><p>Claire slipped her arm through her dad\u2019s and they walked slowly down the aisle. At the end of it, Bobby, dressed in a black tuxedo, waited. His brother, Tommy Clinton, stood beside him. Both men were smiling broadly.</p><p>Dad stopped, turned to Claire. He lifted the veil and kissed her cheek, then eased away from her, and suddenly Bobby was there beside her, taking her arm, leading her up to the altar.</p><p>She looked up at him, loving him so much it scared her. It wasn\u2019t safe to love someone this much. . . .</p><p>Don\u2019t be scared, he mouthed, squeezing her hands.</p><p>She focused on the feel of his hand in hers, the comfortable stability of him beside her.</p><p>Father Tim droned on and on, but Claire couldn\u2019t really hear anything except the beating of her own heart. When it came time for her to say her lines, she panicked that she wouldn\u2019t be able to hear or remember them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she did.

She wore a silver lam\u00e9 dress that showcased her curves. Behind her, there were at least a dozen people: bodyguards, reporters, and photographers. \u201cI can\u2019t believe y\u2019all started without me.\u201d</p> <p>A gasp of recognition moved through the church. Someone whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>Bobby frowned.</p><p>Claire sighed and wiped her eyes. She should have expected this. \u201cBobby, you\u2019re about to meet Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am going to kill her.\u201d Meghann wiped the unexpected tears from her eyes and shot to her feet. Mumbling Excuse me to the shell-shocked guests beside her, she sidled out of the pew and stepped into the aisle.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my other girl.\u201d Mama threw open her arms. Again the flashbulbs erupted in spasms of blinding light.</p> <p>Meghann grabbed her mother by the arm and yanked her back through the doors. The paparazzi followed, all talking at once. There was one terrifying moment when Mama wobbled on her ridiculous heels and Meghann feared a California-freeway-type pileup of bodies on the red-carpeted aisle, but she tightened her grip and staved off disaster.</p><p>Through the now-closed doors, she could hear Father Tim\u2019s stumbling second attempt to pronounce Bobby and Claire husband and wife. A moment later, applause thundered through the church.</p><p>Meghann pulled Mama into the dressing room and shut the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mama whined, obviously unable to frown but wanting to. Too much Botox, no doubt.</p><p>A dog barked. Mama looked down at a small St. John beaded travel carrier in her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey. Meggy\u2019s makin\u2019 a mountain out of a molehill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought your dog?\u201d</p> <p>Mama pressed a hand to her ample breast. \u201cYou know Elvis hates to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, you haven\u2019t been alone in years. Forget whatever poor fool you\u2019re currently sleeping with, you employ three gardeners, two housekeepers, a personal assistant, and a houseboy. Certainly one of them could dog-sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to clear my lifestyle with you, Miss Meggy. Now why in the hell did you throw me out of my own daughter\u2019s weddin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Meghann felt a surge of impotent anger. It was like dealing with a child. There was no way to make Mama understand what she\u2019d done wrong. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>Mama waved a hand. \u201cDarlin\u2019, I\u2019m a celebrity. We\u2019re always late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday was Claire\u2019s day to be a star. Can you get that, Mama? Her day. And you walked in right at the moment of glory and stole the show. What were you doing out here, waiting for the perfect moment to make your entrance?\u201d</p><p>Mama looked away for just a second, but it was enough to confirm Meghann\u2019s suspicion. Her mother had timed her entrance. \u201cOh, Mama,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cThat\u2019s a new low. Even for you. And who are all those people? Do you think you need bodyguards at a wedding in Hayden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always pooh-pooh my career, but my fans are everywhere. They scare me sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Meghann laughed at that. \u201cSave the acting for People magazine, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the article? I looked good, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Mama immediately went to the mirror and began checking her makeup.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as the church empties out, I\u2019m going to talk to your entourage. They arrived in cars; they can sit in them until it\u2019s time to leave. I\u2019ll protect you from your stampeding fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDang it, Meggy. Who\u2019ll take my picture at the weddin\u2019? A woman my age needs filters.\u201d Mama reached into her crystal-encrusted evening bag and pulled out a black tube of lipstick. She leaned closer to the mirror.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Meghann said slowly, \u201cClaire has waited a long time for this day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. I was startin\u2019 to think she and those friends of hers were gay.\u201d Mama snapped the lipstick shut and smiled at her reflection.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, we need to focus on her today. Her needs.\u201d</p><p>Mama spun around. \u201cNow, that hurts. When have I ever put my needs ahead of my children\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Meghann was speechless. The most amazing part of this science-fiction moment was that her mother actually believed what she just said. Meghann forced a smile. \u201cLook, Mama, I don\u2019t want to argue with you on this special day. You and I are going to walk over to the reception and tell Claire how happy we are for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy for her. Bein\u2019 married is the most wonderful feelin\u2019 in the world. Why I remember when I married her daddy, I felt swept away by him.\u201d</p><p>You get swept away more often than a muddy riverbank. Meghann kept her lips sealed and her smile tacked in place. She didn\u2019t remind Mama that the marriage to Sam had lasted less than six months, or that Mama had run out on him in the middle of the night, after sending him to the store for tampons. For years, Meghann had had a mental picture of Sam, returning to the Chief Sealth Trailer Park in Concrete, Washington, on that rainy night, standing at the empty site, holding a box of tampons. He hadn\u2019t known for almost ten years\u2014until Meghann called\u2014that his marriage had produced a daughter. \u201cThat\u2019s the way, Mama. Pour it on. But,\u201d she stepped closer, looked up into her mother\u2019s surgically wrinkle-less face, \u201cyou may bring one photographer. One. No bodyguards and no dog. These rules are not negotiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a pain in the ass, Meghann,\u201d Mama said. Her accent was so thick only a trained ear could understand it. \u201cNo wonder you can\u2019t keep a man for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis from the woman whose been married what\u2014six times? Pretty soon you and Elizabeth Taylor will have to start swapping husbands or you\u2019ll run out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no romance in your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why, growing up as I did with so much love.\u201d</p><p>They stood there, inches apart, staring at each other.</p><p>Then Mama laughed. The real thing this time, not that sexy kitten-laugh she used in Hollywood, but the deep, tavern sound she\u2019d been born with. \u201cMeggy, darlin\u2019, you always did bust my ass. You flipped me off when you were eight months old\u2014did I ever tell you that?\u201d</p><p>Meghann smiled in spite of herself. It was always this way between them. How could you stay angry with a woman as shallow as Mama? In the end, sometimes there was nothing to do but laugh and go on. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Mama.\u201d</p><p>She put her arm around Meghann and pulled her close. It reminded Meghann of so many childhood and adolescent times. She and Mama had always fought like cats and dogs, and then ended up laughing. Probably because both of them would rather laugh than cry. \u201cNo. You looked right up, smiled, and flipped me off. It was the funniest damn thing ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it a few times since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you have. It\u2019s the nature of the beast. You\u2019d know this if you\u2019d had children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fiddle-dee-dee. You don\u2019t tell me what to do or say, Missy. It takes guts to be a mother. You just don\u2019t have \u2019em, that\u2019s all. Look at the way you pawned off your sister. Nothin\u2019 to be ashamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I don\u2019t think you ought to tell me what it takes to be a mother. I might have to remind you of a few things you pretend to forget. Like how it was your job to raise Claire, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are we goin\u2019 to this reception or not? I have a midnight flight home. But don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s none of that two-hours-ahead stuff for stars like me. I need to be at SeaTac by eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means you need to leave here about eight-thirty. So let\u2019s go. And I mean it, Mama, best behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, darlin\u2019, you know that social etiquette is bred into us Southern girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. You\u2019re as Southern as Tony Soprano.\u201d</p><p>Mama sniffed. \u201cI swear, I should have left you by the side of the road in Wheeling, West Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did leave me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were a hard and unforgiving person. It\u2019s a flaw, Meggy. Truly. So I miscounted my children. It happens. My mistake was in comin\u2019 back for you.\u201d</p><p>Meghann sighed. There was no way to get the last word with Mama. \u201cCome on, Mama. Claire probably thinks I killed you.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>CLAIRE REFUSED TO THINK ABOUT THE DEBACLE WITH Mama. She clung to Bobby\u2019s arm and let herself be carried away. She was the center of a laughing, talking, congratulatory crowd. She had never felt so special, so completely loved in her life. Most of the town had turned out for this wedding, and everyone stopped Claire to tell her that she was the prettiest bride ever.</p><p>It went straight to a woman\u2019s head, that kind of thing. You forgot sometimes, in the middle of a hectic, single-mother life, how it felt to be the center of attention.</p><p>Bobby slipped an arm more tightly around her waist, pulled her close. \u201cHave I told you how beautiful you look?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and turned to him, letting her body melt against his. The wedding guests kept moving past them, jostling them. \u201cYou have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you came down that aisle, you took my breath away. I love you, Mrs. Austin.\u201d</p><p>She felt tears start again. It came as no surprise. She\u2019d been weepy all day.</p><p>They kept their arms around each other and followed the crowd, walking slowly this time. \u201cI don\u2019t see why everyone had to park at Riverfront Park. There\u2019s usually plenty of room at the church. We can all carpool to the campground.\u201d</p><p>Bobby shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just following the crowd. Gina said the limo was waiting for us at the park.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. \u201cLeave it to Meghann to rent a limo to drive us six miles.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t deny that she was excited. She\u2019d never been in a limousine.</p><p>In front of them, the crowd stopped; as if on cue, they parted, forming a dark aisle.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Gina yelled out, waving them forward.</p><p>Claire grabbed Bobby\u2019s hand and pulled him forward. Around them, the guests clapped and cheered them on. A shower of rice seemed to fall from the sky; it sprinkled their faces and crunched beneath their feet.</p><p>They came to the end of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d Claire turned around, searched the crowd for Meghann, but her sister was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. Riverfront Park, the very place where she\u2019d spent her childhood, where she\u2019d broken her ankle playing red rover, where she\u2019d tasted her first kiss, had been transformed.</p><p>Night turned the thick lawn jet-black. Off to the right, the now-quiet river was a tarnished silver ribbon that caught the moonlight and held it.</p><p>A huge white tent had been set up in the park. Thousands of tiny white Christmas lights twined up the poles and across the makeshift ceilings. Even from here, Claire could see the tables set up within the tent. Silvery, shimmery tablecloths draped each one. Chinese lanterns cut the light into shapes\u2014stars and crescents that patterned the floor and walls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She moved forward. The scent of roses filled the night air, turned it sweet. She saw that each table had a floral centerpiece, a simple glass bowl filled with fresh white roses. A long, silver-clothed table ran along one side, its surface cluttered with elegant sterling chafing dishes and pewter trays of food. In the corner, a trio of men in white tuxedos played a World War II love song in soft, haunting tones.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Bobby said, coming up beside her.</p><p>The band struck up a beautiful rendition of \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance, Mrs. Austin?\u201d</p> <p>Claire let him take her in his arms and lead her to the dance floor. There, with all her friends and family watching, she danced with her husband.</p><p>When, at last, the song came to an end, Claire finally saw her sister. She was tagging after Mama, who was clearly in her meet-and-greet mode. \u201cCome on, Bobby,\u201d she said, taking his hand and pulling him off the dance floor. It felt as if it took them hours to get through the well-wishers, each of whom had something to say. But finally, they were near the bar, where Mama was regaling a starstruck crowd with stories of life aboard the USS Star Seeker.</p><p>Mama saw her coming and stopped talking midsentence. A genuine smile curved her lips. \u201cClaire,\u201d she said, reaching for her with both hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was late, darlin\u2019. A star\u2019s life is run by others. But you were the most beautiful bride I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Her voice cracked just a bit. \u201cReally, Claire,\u201d she said, softer this time, for Claire\u2019s ears alone, \u201cyou made me so proud.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes met. In her mother\u2019s dark eyes, Claire glimpsed a genuine joy, and it touched her.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Mama said quickly, smiling again, \u201cwhere\u2019s my new son-in-law?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere I am, Miz Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Ellie. All my family does.\u201d She moved toward him, whistling softly. \u201cYou\u2019re good-looking enough for Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>It was Mama\u2019s highest compliment.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>A look of irritation crossed Mama\u2019s face; it was there and gone in a flash. \u201cReally. Call me Ellie. I hear you\u2019re a singer. Meggy doesn\u2019t know if you\u2019re any good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p> <p>She took his hand. \u201cIf you sing half as good as you look, you\u2019ll be on the radio in no time. Come. Tell me about your career while we dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored to dance with my new mother-in-law.\u201d Tossing Claire a quick smile, he was off.</p><p>Claire turned at last to Meghann, who\u2019d stood silently by for the whole exchange. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama brought her dog. Not to mention an entourage of bodyguards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be overcome by the hoards of her fans at any moment,\u201d Claire said in her best pseudo-Southern voice.</p><p>Meghann laughed. Then sobered. \u201cShe has to leave at eight- thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA manicure with Rollo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Whatever it is, I believe a prayer of thanks is in order.\u201d</p> <p>The band shifted into a sweet, soulful version of \u201cAs Time Goes By.\u201d</p><p>Claire stared at her sister, trying to come up with words to match her emotions. \u201cThis wedding,\u201d she started but her voice cracked. She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cI did something wrong, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Claire ached then for the whole of their relationship, for the years that had been lost and those that had never been.</p><p>\u201cYou spent a fortune,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Meghann shook her head. \u201cAlmost everything was on sale. They\u2019re my Christmas lights. The tent\u2014\u201d</p><p>Claire touched her sister\u2019s lips, shut her up. \u201cI\u2019m trying to say thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t even know how to word it, this sudden longing of hers. It seemed too big to stand on something as thin as words.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Meghann said softly. \u201cMaybe things can be different now. This time together . . . it\u2019s made me remember how things used to be between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were my best friend,\u201d Claire said, wiping her eyes carefully, so she didn\u2019t smear her makeup. \u201cI missed that when you . . .\u201d Left. She couldn\u2019t say the harsh word, not now.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy! Mommy! Come dance with us.\u201d</p><p>Claire twisted around and saw her dad and Alison, standing a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s customary for the bride to dance with her father,\u201d he said, smiling, holding out his calloused hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd her daughter! Grandpa\u2019ll carry me.\u201d Alison was hopping up and down with excitement.</p><p>Claire gave her champagne glass to Meghann, who mouthed: Go. She let herself be pulled onto the dance floor. As they made it to the center of the crowd, Dad whispered in her ear, \u201cSomeday Ali will get married and you\u2019ll know how this feels. It\u2019s every emotion at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick me up, Grandpa!\u201d</p><p>He bent down and scooped Alison up. The three of them clung to one another, swaying gently in time to \u201cThe Very Thought of You.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked away quickly\u2014before Ali could ask why Mommy was crying. To her left, Mama was spinning poor Bobby around as if he were a top. Claire laughed out loud and knew exactly what her dad meant.</p><p>Every emotion.</p><p>That was what tonight was. All her life she\u2019d look back on this night and remember how good her life was, how much she loved and was loved in return.</p><p>That was what Meghann had given her.</p><p>Meghann gazed at the black velvet lawn of Edgar Peabody Riverfront Park. Across the street, the Quonset hut sat bathed in moonlight. Behind her, the band was breaking down their equipment. Only a few die-hard guests were still here. Mama had left hours ago, as had Sam and Ali. Everyone else, including the bride and groom, had drifted away at around midnight. Meghann had stayed late, supervising the cleanup, but now that job was done.</p><p>Meghann sipped her champagne and looked across the street again. Her car was parked in front of Joe\u2019s house. She wondered now if that had been a conscious choice.</p><p>He was probably sleeping.</p><p>She knew it was ridiculous to go to him, maybe even dangerous, but there was something in the air tonight. A heady combination of romance and magic. It smelled like roses and made a woman believe that anything was possible. For tonight, anyway.</p><p>She didn\u2019t let herself think about it. If she did, she\u2019d call herself a fool and stay put. So she hummed along with the music and walked down the gravel road. When she reached the black ribbon of asphalt, she turned right.</p><p>At his gate, she paused. The lights were on.</p><p>This was so unlike her.</p><p>She pushed the thought away and went to his door. There, she debated for another minute or two, then knocked.</p><p>Moments later, Joe opened the door. His hair was messed up, as if he\u2019d been asleep; all he wore was a pair of black jeans. He waited for her to say something, but her voice had pulled a full retreat. She just stood there like an idiot, staring at his naked chest.</p><p>\u201cYou just going to stand there?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her right hand, showing him the bottle of champagne she\u2019d carried over.</p><p>He stared at her, saying nothing. When the silence became uncomfortable, he grabbed a black T-shirt from the sofa and put it on, then came back to the door. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re horny. That\u2019s why you came by, right?\u201d</p><p>She flinched at that. She thought about pulling herself up, slapping him, even, but it would be for show. A woman who screwed strangers had lost that right long ago. He was being honest, but there was something else, too. It felt as if he were angry with her. She couldn\u2019t imagine why. Even more disconcerting was the realization that she cared. \u201cNo. I thought maybe we could go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want us to go on a date? At one o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA better question is why.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. When their gazes locked, she felt a flutter in her pulse. She couldn\u2019t possibly put the answer into words. She didn\u2019t dare look too closely at her own motivations. \u201cLook, Joe. I was in a good mood. Maybe I had too much to drink.\u201d Her voice stumbled; need tripped her up. Humiliated, she closed her eyes. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d When she opened her eyes, she saw that he\u2019d moved closer. It would take nothing at all for him to kiss her now, barely a movement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much for going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t mind if you wanted to come in.\u201d</p><p>She felt the start of a smile. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mind,\u201d he said, \u201cis waking up alone. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to spend the night, but don\u2019t sneak out like a hooker.\u201d</p><p>So that was it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. It lit up his whole face, made him look ten years younger. \u201cOkay. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>She touched his arm. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen you smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said softly, maybe sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>Meghann slept through the night. When dawn came to the small, dingy cabin windows and peered inside, she woke with a start. Instead of feeling nervous and cranky\u2014her normal moods after a sleepless night\u2014she felt rested and relaxed. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time morning had been so sweet.</p><p>She felt the heavy weight of Joe\u2019s bare leg against her own. His arm was around her, anchoring her in place. Even in sleep, his forefinger brushed possessively against her skin.</p><p>She should move away. It was a maneuver she\u2019d perfected over the years\u2014the intimacy-evading sideways roll, the silent plop to the floor, the soundless dressing and unseen exit.</p><p>What I mind, he\u2019d said last night, is waking up alone.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t sneak out.</p><p>The surprising part was that she didn\u2019t want to, not really. She sensed that she should, in that basic self-preservation kind of way, but really, it felt good to be in a man\u2019s arms again. As she lay here, listening to his slow, even breathing, feeling his arm around her, she couldn\u2019t help but realize how little intimacy she\u2019d known in her life. She was always so in control, moving forward on the path she saw for herself, she never let herself slow down enough to feel anything. It wasn\u2019t real, of course, this intimacy she felt with Joe. They didn\u2019t know or care deeply about each other, but for Meghann, even this approximation of emotion was more than she\u2019d felt in years.</p><p>The sex had been different last night, too. Softer, gentler. Instead of their previous I\u2019m-going-as-fast-as-I-can coupling, they\u2019d acted as if they had all the time in the world. His long, slow kisses had made her crazy with wanting. It wasn\u2019t simple horniness, either; at least that\u2019s what she\u2019d thought when he\u2019d swept her away. She\u2019d imagined that there was something more between them.</p><p>That worried her. Need was something she understood, accepted. In a gray world, it was jet-black.</p><p>Emotion was something else entirely. Even if it wasn\u2019t a lead-up to love, it was trouble. The last thing Meghann wanted was to care for someone.</p><p>Still . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had never been one to deceive herself and, just now, lying naked in his arms, she had to admit that there was something between them. Not love, surely, but something. When he kissed her, it felt as if she\u2019d never been kissed before.</p><p>There it was, as clear to her as the colors of the rising dawn: the prelude to heartache.</p><p>The beginning.</p><p>It had sneaked up on her. She\u2019d opened a door called anonymous sex and found herself standing in a room filled with unexpected possibilities.</p> <p>Possibilities that could break a woman\u2019s heart.</p><p>If she left him behind, he would fade into a pretty memory. It might hurt to remember him, but it would be a bittersweet pain, almost pleasurable. Certainly preferable to the kind of heartache that was sure to follow if she tried to believe in something more than sex.</p><p>She had to end this thing right now, before it left a mark.</p><p>The realization saddened her, made her feel even lonelier.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself; she leaned over and kissed him. She wanted to whisper, Make love to me, but she knew her voice would betray her.</p> <p>So she closed her eyes and pretended to sleep. It didn\u2019t help. All she could think about was later, when she would leave him.</p><p>She knew she wouldn\u2019t say good-bye.</p><p>Joe awoke with Meghann in his arms, their naked bodies tangled together. Memories of last night teased him, made him feel strangely light-headed. Most of all, he remembered the hoarse, desperate sound of her voice when she\u2019d cried out his name.</p><p>He shifted his weight gently, moved just enough so that he could look down at her. Her black hair was a tangled mess; he remembered driving his hands through it in passion, then stroking it as he fell asleep. Her pale cheeks looked even whiter against the grayed cotton pillowcase. Even in sleep, he saw a kind of sadness around her eyes and mouth, as if she worried her troubles both day and night.</p><p>What a pair they were. They\u2019d spent three nights together now and had exchanged almost no secrets about each other.</p><p>The amazing thing was, he wanted her again already. Not just her body, either. He wanted to get to know her, and just that\u2014the wanting\u2014seemed to change him. It was as if a light had gone on in a place that had been cold and dark.</p> <p>And yet it frightened him.</p><p>The guilt was so much a part of him. In the last few years it had wrapped around him, bone and sinew. For more nights than he wanted to count, it had been his strength, the only thing holding him together; the first thing he remembered in the morning and the last thing on his mind when he fell asleep.</p><p>If he let go of the guilt\u2014not all of it, of course, but just enough to reach for a different life, a different woman\u2014would he lose the memories, too? Had Diana become so intertwined with his regret that he could have both or neither? And if so, could he really make a life that was separate from the woman he\u2019d loved for so much of his life?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>But just now, looking down at Meghann, feeling the whisper softness of her breath against his skin, he wanted to try. He reached out, brushed a silky strand of hair from her face. It was the kind of touch he hadn\u2019t dared in years.</p><p>She blinked awake. \u201cMorning,\u201d she said, her voice scratchy and raw.</p><p>He kissed her gently, whispered, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back too quickly, turned away. \u201cI need to go. I\u2019m supposed to pick up my niece at nine o\u2019clock.\u201d She threw the covers back and got out of bed. Naked, she yanked a pillow up to cover herself and hurried into the bathroom. By the time she reemerged, dressed once again in her expensive lavender silk dress, he was dressed.</p> <p>She picked up her strappy sandals in one hand and draped her panty hose over one shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve really got to go.\u201d She glanced at the front door and started to turn toward it.</p><p>He wanted to stop her, but didn\u2019t know how. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came last night.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cMe, too. Twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, moving toward her. He had no idea what\u2014if anything\u2014was between them, but he knew it wasn\u2019t a joke.</p><p>She looked at the door again, then up at him. \u201cI can\u2019t stay, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later, then. Good-bye.\u201d He waited for her to answer, but she didn\u2019t. Instead, she kissed him. Hard. He was breathless by the time she pulled back, whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Joe.\u201d</p><p>Then she was gone.</p><p>Joe went to the window and watched her leave. She practically ran to her car, but once she was there, she paused, looking back at the house. From this distance, she looked oddly sad. It made him realize how little he knew her.</p><p>He wanted to change that, wanted to believe there was a future for him after all. Maybe even one with her.</p><p>But he\u2019d have to let go of the past.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to do all of it, how to start a life over and believe in a different future, but he knew what the first step was. He\u2019d always known.</p><p>He had to talk to Diana\u2019s parents.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>MEGHANN PARKED THE CAR AND GOT OUT. A QUICK glance up at the house told her that no one was home. The lights were all out. She rammed her panty hose into her handbag and ran barefoot across the lawn, then slipped quietly into the darkened house.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, she was showered, dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, and packed. On her way out, she paused long enough to write Claire a quick note, which she left on the kitchen counter.</p><p>Claire and Bobby</p><p>Welcome home.</p><p>Love, Meg.</p><p>She drew a funny picture of a pair of martini glasses alongside her name, then paused, took one last look at the house that was so much a home. It was unexpectedly difficult to leave. Her condo was so cold and empty by comparison.</p><p>Finally, she went to her car and drove slowly through the campground.</p><p>The place was quiet this early on a Sunday morning. There were no children in the pool, no campers walking around. A lonely pair of fishermen\u2014father and son by the looks of them\u2014stood at the riverbank, casting their lines toward the water.</p><p>At the property line she turned right onto a rutted gravel road. Here, the trees grew closer together, their towering limbs blocking out all but the hardiest rays of morning sunlight. Finally, she came to the clearing, a horseshoe-shaped yard full of oversize rhododendrons and humongous ferns. A gray mobile home squatted on cement blocks in the middle of the yard, its front end accentuated by a pretty cedar deck. Pots of red geraniums and purple petunias were everywhere.</p><p>Meghann parked the car and got out. As always, she felt a tightening in her stomach when she thought about meeting Sam. It took a concerted effort to look at him and not remember their past.</p><p>Go. Just leave.</p><p>You\u2019re just like your Mama.</p><p>She gripped her purse strap and walked up the gravel walkway and onto the porch, which smelled of honeysuckle and jasmine on this June morning.</p><p>She knocked, too softly at first. When no one answered, she tried again. Harder this time.</p><p>The door swung open, hinges creaking, and there he was, filling the doorway, dressed in shabby overalls and a pale blue T-shirt that read: River\u2019s Edge. His brown hair was Albert Einstein wild.</p><p>\u201cMeg,\u201d he said, clearly forcing a smile. He stepped back. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>She sidled past him and found herself in a surprisingly cozy living room. \u201cGood morning, Sam. I\u2019m here to pick up Alison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He frowned. \u201cAre you sure you want to take her this week? I\u2019d be happy to keep her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would,\u201d she answered, stung. It was too much like the other time.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how busy you are, though.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cYou still think I\u2019m a bad influence, is that it?\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her, stopped. \u201cI should never have thought that. Claire\u2019s told me how good you were to her. I didn\u2019t know about kids back then, and I sure as hell didn\u2019t know about teenage girls who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t finish that sentence. Do you have a list for me? Allergies. Medications. Anything I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe goes to bed at eight. She likes it if you read her a story. The Little Mermaid is her favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Meg looked down the hallway. \u201cIs she ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s just telling the cat good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Meg waited. Somewhere in the trailer a clock ticked past a minute, then another.</p><p>\u201cShe has a birthday party to go to on Saturday. If you get her here by noon, she\u2019ll make it,\u201d Sam said finally. \u201cThat way she\u2019ll already be here when Claire and Bobby get home on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Meghann knew the arrangements. \u201cShe\u2019ll be on time. Do I need to take her shopping for a gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing too expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can handle shopping, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Another silence fell, marked by the clock\u2019s passing minutes.</p><p>Meghann was trolling for something innocuous to say when Alison came racing down the hallway, carrying a black cat whose body stretched almost to the ground. \u201cLightning wants to come with me, Grandpa. He meowed me. Can I take him with me, Aunt Meg, can I?\u201d</p><p>Meg had no idea whether cats were allowed in her building.</p><p>Before she could answer, Sam knelt down in front of his granddaughter and gently eased the cat from her arms. \u201cLightning needs to stay here, honey. You know he likes to play with his friends and hunt for mice in the woods. He\u2019s a country cat. He wouldn\u2019t like the city.\u201d</p><p>Alison\u2019s eyes looked huge in the heart-shaped pallor of her face. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a city girl, either,\u201d she said, puffing out her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou\u2019re an adventurer, though. Just like Mulan and Princess Jasmine. Do you think they\u2019d be nervous about a trip to the big city?\u201d</p><p>Ali shook her head.</p><p>Sam pulled her into his arms and hugged her tightly. When he finally let her go, he got slowly to his feet and looked at Meghann. \u201cTake good care of my granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>It was not unlike what she\u2019d said to Sam all those years ago, just before she left for good. Take care of my sister. The only difference was, she\u2019d been crying. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Alison grabbed her Little Mermaid backpack and her small suitcase. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Aunt Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d Meg took the suitcase and headed for the door. They were in the car and moving forward down the gravel driveway when Alison suddenly screamed, \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>Meg slammed on the brakes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Alison climbed out of her seat, opened the door, and ran back into the trailer. A moment later she was back, clutching a ratty pink blanket to her chest. Her eyes glistened with tears.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go \u2019venturing without my wubbie.\u201d</p><p>Claire would always remember her first sight of Kauai.</p><p>As the jet banked left and dipped down, she saw the turquoise-blue water that ringed the white sand beaches. Reefs glittered black beneath the surface.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bobby,\u201d she said, turning to look at him. She wanted to tell him what this moment meant to the girl who\u2019d grown up in trailers, dreaming of palm trees. But the words she came up with were too small, too trite. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An hour later, they were settled in their rental car\u2014a Mustang convertible\u2014and driving north.</p><p>Amazingly, with every mile driven, the island grew greener, lusher. By the time they reached the famous Hanalei Bridge, where huge green patchwork taro fields lay tucked against the rising black mountains, it was another world completely. On one side of the two-lane road, the local farmers stood in water, tending their taro crops. There wasn\u2019t a house or a road to be seen for miles. On the right side, the winding Hanalei River, hemmed on either side by thick, flowering green vegetation, calmly carried kayakers downstream. In the distance, the dark mountains stood in stark contrast to the blue sky; a few diaphanous clouds hinted at rain for tomorrow, but now, it was perfect weather.</p><p>\u201cHere! Turn here,\u201d she said a block after a church.</p><p>The houses along the beach road sat on huge waterfront lots. Claire had braced herself for Bel Air\u2013type mansions. She needn\u2019t have bothered. Most of the houses were old-fashioned, unpretentious. At the park, they turned again, and there it was: the house her dad had rented. Only a block from the beach and tucked as it was in a cul-de-sac, it ought to feel ordinary.</p> <p>It was anything but. Painted a bright tropical blue with glossy white trim, the house looked like a jeweled box hidden in a tropical landscape. A thick green hedge ran down three borders of the property, effectively blocking the neighbors from view.</p><p>Inside, the house had white walls, pine plank floors, and bright Hawaiian furniture. Upstairs, the bedroom, done in more bright colors, led to a private balcony that overlooked the mountains. As she stood there, staring out at the waterfall-ribboned mountain, Claire could hear the distant surf.</p><p>Bobby came up behind her, slipped his arms around her. \u201cMaybe someday I\u2019ll make it big, and we\u2019ll live here.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back against him. It was the same dream she\u2019d had for years, but now its hold had loosened. \u201cI don\u2019t care about making it big or someday, Bobby. We have this right now, and really, it\u2019s more than I ever dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around so that she was facing him. There was an uncharacteristic sadness in his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you, Claire. How can you not know that?\u201d</p> <p>Claire wanted to smile, shake the words off. \u201cI do know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t yet. I love you, Claire. I guess all I can do is keep saying it. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about to the beach?\u201d</p><p>They walked hand in hand down the road toward the beach. At the pavilion, one of the many public access points, a large group of Hawaiians were celebrating a family reunion. Dark-haired, copper-skinned children in brightly colored swimsuits played running games on the grass while the adults set out a buffet inside. Someone somewhere was playing a ukelele.</p><p>Hanalei Bay fanned out from her on either side, a mile of white-sand beach shaped in a giant horseshoe. To the north stood the mountains, turned pink now by the sinking sun.</p><p>Small, white-tipped waves rolled forward, carrying laughing children toward the sand. Farther back, some teenage boys lay on oversize surfboards. Their instructor, a good-looking guy in a straw hat, gave them each a shove when a wave seemed promising.</p> <p>They spent the rest of the day on the warm sands of Hanalei Bay and watched the sunset and talked. When the beach fell silent and lay in darkness, with stars glittering on the black water, they finally went back to their house. Together, they made dinner and ate it on a picnic table on the back lanai, with lanterns and mosquito-repellant candles lighting their way. By the time dinner was finished and the dishes were done, they couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other anymore.</p><p>Bobby swept Claire into his arms and carried her upstairs. She laughed and clung to him, letting go only when he dropped her onto the bed. She immediately came up to her knees and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he said, reaching out to slip a finger beneath her bathing-suit bra strap. She felt the heat of that touch against her cold, goosefleshed skin and found it hard to breathe.</p><p>He bent down and stripped out of his suit, then straightened again. The sight of his naked body, hard and ready, made her shiver and reach out.</p><p>He moved to the bed. She could feel the eager trembling in his hands as he removed her swimsuit and touched her breasts. At last he kissed her\u2014her mouth, her eyelids, her chin, her nipples.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and pulled him down on top of her. She felt his hand slip between her legs, finding her wetness. With a groan, she opened herself to him. When he finally climbed on top of her, she dug her fingers into his hard backside and arched up to meet him. They came at the same time, each crying out the other\u2019s name.</p><p>Afterward, Claire curled up against her husband\u2019s damp, hot body and fell asleep to the quiet evenness of his breathing and the steady drone of the ceiling fan.</p><p>Meg took Alison on a whirlwind tour of downtown Seattle. They went to the aquarium and watched the feeding of the otters and seals. Meg even dared to roll up her designer sleeves and plunge her bare hands into the exploration tank, where, alongside a busload of out-of-town children, she and Alison touched sea anemones and mussels and starfish.</p> <p>After that, they got hot dogs at a frankfurter stand and walked down the wharf. At Ye Olde Curiosity Shoppe they saw shrunken heads and Egyptian mummies and cheap souvenirs. (Meg didn\u2019t point out the eight-foot-long petrified whale penis that hung suspended from the ceiling; she could just imagine what Ali would tell her friends.) They had dinner at the Red Robin Hamburger Emporium and finished off the day with a Disney movie at the Pacific Place Theater.</p><p>By the time they made it back to the condo, Meg was exhausted.</p><p>Unfortunately, Alison had energy to spare. She ran from room to room, picking up stuff, looking at it, yelling Wow! over things like a Sonicare toothbrush.</p><p>Meg was on the couch, sprawled out with her feet on the coffee table, when Alison skidded into the room, carrying the Lalique bowl from the front entry.</p><p>\u201cDid you see this, Aunt Meg? These girls have no clothes on.\u201d She giggled.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re naked. Billy says his dad has magazines with naked girls in \u2019em. Gross.\u201d</p><p>Meg got up and very gently took the bowl from Alison. \u201cGross is in the eye of the beholder.\u201d She returned it to its spot on the entry table. When she walked back into the living room, Alison was frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a bee holder? Is that like a hive?\u201d</p><p>Meg was too tired to come up with a smart answer. \u201cKind of.\u201d She collapsed onto the couch again. How had she done this when she was a teenager?</p><p>\u201cDidja know that baby eagles eat their daddy\u2019s barf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Even my cooking is better than that.\u201d</p><p>Alison giggled. \u201cMy mommy\u2019s a good cook.\u201d The minute she said it, her lower lip wobbled. Tears glistened in her green eyes, and just then, standing there on the verge of crying, Alison looked so much like Claire that Meghann couldn\u2019t breathe. She was thrown back in time to all the nights she\u2019d comforted her little sister, held her tightly, and promised that Soon, soon things will get better . . . and Mama will come home.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Ali,\u201d she said, her throat tight.</p><p>Alison hesitated for a moment, just that, but the pause reminded Meghann of how little she and her niece knew each other.</p><p>Alison sat down on the sofa, about a foot away.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to call your mommy? She\u2019s going to call at six o\u2019clock, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Alison yelled, bouncing up and down on the cushion.</p><p>Meghann went in search of the phone. She found it on the nightstand by her bed. After a quick consultation in her day planner, she dialed the Kauai house\u2019s direct number, then handed the phone to her niece.</p><p>\u201cMommy?\u201d Alison said after a few seconds. Then, \u201cHi, Mommy. It\u2019s me, Ali Kat.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Meg walked into the kitchen and began unpacking the bags of groceries and goodies she\u2019d picked up today. Stuff she hadn\u2019t bought in years\u2014Frosted Flakes, Pop-Tarts, Oreo cookies\u2014and stuff she\u2019d never seen before, like juice that came in silver bags and mix-your-own yogurt. The most important purchase was an activity book for children. She intended to make this a week Alison wouldn\u2019t forget.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to talk to you, Aunt Meg,\u201d Alison said, bouncing into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Meg took the phone, said, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, big sis, how\u2019s it going? Has she stopped talking yet?\u201d</p><p>Meg laughed. \u201cNot even when she\u2019s eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my Ali.\u201d</p><p>Alison tugged on Meg\u2019s pant leg. \u201cMommy said the sand is like sugar. Sugar. Can I have some cookies?\u201d</p><p>Meg handed her an Oreo. \u201cOnly one before bed,\u201d she said to her niece. To Claire, she said, \u201cI need a margarita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It makes me think. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Claire asked softly.</p><p>\u201cAbout us. You. Sometimes I look at Ali and all I can see is us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, she\u2019ll love you, Meg.\u201d</p><p>Meg closed her eyes. It felt so good to talk to Claire this way, as true sisters who had something more than a sordid childhood in common. \u201cShe misses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedtime might be hard. You\u2019ll need to read her a story.\u201d Claire laughed. \u201cI warn you, she has quite an attention span.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try Moby-Dick. You\u2019d have to be on speed to stay awake for that.\u201d</p><p>Alison grabbed her pant leg again. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna be\u2014\u201d And she puked all over Meg\u2019s shoes.</p><p>\u201cI need to go, Claire. Have a great trip. We\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone and set it on the counter.</p><p>Alison looked up at her, giggling. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the double banana split was a bad idea.\u201d She eased out of her shoes and scooped Alison into her arms and carried her to the bathroom.</p><p>Alison looked so tiny in the big marble tub.</p><p>\u201cThis is like a swimming pool,\u201d she said, sucking up a mouthful of water and spitting it on the tile wall.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not drink our own bathwater, shall we? It\u2019s one of the things that separates us from the lesser primates. Like men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa lets me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point exactly. Now come here, let me wash your hair.\u201d She reached for the brand-new baby shampoo. The scent made her smile. \u201cI used to wash your mom\u2019s hair with this shampoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting it in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she used to say.\u201d Meghann was still smiling when she rinsed Alison\u2019s hair and helped her out of the tub. She dried off the little girl, dressed her in pink flannel pajamas, and carried her into the guest room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big bed,\u201d Alison said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s for princesses only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I a princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d Meghann curtsied. \u201cMilady,\u201d she said in a solemn voice. \u201cWhat command have you for me?\u201d</p><p>Alison giggled and climbed under the covers. \u201cRead me a story.

Alison immediately snuggled in beside her, resting her cheek on the precious wubbie.</p><p>Meg started to read again.</p> <p>An hour and six books later, Alison was finally asleep. Meg kissed her niece\u2019s sweet pink cheek and left the room, careful to leave the door open.</p><p>Afraid to turn on the television or the stereo\u2014she didn\u2019t want to wake Alison\u2014she tried to read a magazine. Within minutes she was falling asleep, so she padded into her bedroom, changed into her Seahawks nightshirt, brushed her teeth, and got into bed.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she thought of all the things she had to do tomorrow. There was no way she\u2019d fall asleep tonight.</p><p>Woodland Park Zoo.</p><p>The BFG at the Children\u2019s Theater.</p> <p>GameWorks.</p><p>F.A.O. Schwarz.</p><p>Fun Forest at Seattle Center.</p><p>Her mind skipped from Fun Forest to National Forest to Hayden to Joe.</p><p>Joe.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her good-bye so gently on that last morning they were together. It had made her feel inexplicably vulnerable.</p> <p>She wanted to see him. And not just for sex.</p><p>For what, then?</p><p>She\u2019d chosen him in the first place for his unavailability. What had been his first words to her, or practically the first?</p><p>I won\u2019t take you home with me.</p><p>Or something like that. Right off the bat he\u2019d declared his unavailability.</p><p>And so she\u2019d gone for him. But where could they go beyond the bedroom? He was a small-town mechanic who still cried over his divorce.</p><p>There was no future for them.</p><p>Still . . . when she closed her eyes he was there, waiting to kiss her in the darkness of her own mind.</p> <p>\u201cAunt Meg?\u201d</p><p>She sat upright, flicked on the light. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Alison stood there, clutching her wubbie. Her face was moist with tears; her eyes were red. She looked impossibly small in the open doorway. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>She looked so much like Claire. . . .</p><p>\u201cCome on up here, honey. Come sleep with me. I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Alison bolted across the room and clambered up into the bed, then snuggled close against Meg, who held her tightly. \u201cYour mommy used to sleep with me when she was scared, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Alison popped a thumb in her mouth and closed her eyes. Almost immediately, she was asleep.</p><p>Meghann loved the smell of her, the little girl/baby shampoo sweetness. She cuddled in close to her niece and closed her eyes, expecting to start thinking about tomorrow again.</p><p>Amazingly, she fell asleep.</p><p>The telephone woke Claire up. She sat up fast. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d She looked around for the bedside clock, found it. Five forty-five A.M. Oh, God. \u201cBobby, the phone\u2014\u201d</p><p>She scrambled over him and picked it up. \u201cHello? Meghann? Is Ali okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, darlin\u2019, how are you?\u201d</p><p>Claire released a heavy breath and climbed out of bed. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mama. It\u2019s five-forty-five on Kauai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right? I thought y\u2019all were the same time zone as California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re halfway to Asia, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always did exaggerate, Claire. I do have a reason for callin\u2019, you know.\u201d</p><p>Claire grabbed her robe out of the closet and slipped it on, then went out onto the balcony. Outside, the sky was just turning pink. In the backyard, a rooster strutted across the lawn; hens clucked along behind. The morning smelled of sweet tropical flowers and salt air. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t think I\u2019m much of a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d She yawned, wondering if there was any chance of falling asleep again. She looked through the windows at Bobby, who was sitting up now, frowning at her.</p><p>\u201cIt is so. You and Miss Perfect are constantly remindin\u2019 me that I did a poor job raisin\u2019 you. I consider it ungrateful to say the least, but motherhood has its burdens, as you know, and misunderstanding is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early for drama, Mama. Maybe you could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is, I do some things poorly and some things well. I\u2019m like ordinary people in that way.\u201d</p><p>Claire sighed. \u201cYes, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to remember that. And tell your bigmouthed sister. No matter what y\u2019all remember, or think you do, the truth is that I love you. I always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mama.\u201d She smiled at Bobby, mouthed: Mama, then: coffee.</p><p>\u201cNow put your husband on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have a man in your bed right now?\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Mama sighed dramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s another of my burdens to be saddled with suspicious daughters. It\u2019s about a weddin\u2019 gift, if you must know. I heard y\u2019all didn\u2019t like the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no room for Alison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have to go everywhere with y\u2019all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut Bobby on. This present is for him, since you were so ungrateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mama. Whatever. Just a second.\u201d She went back inside. \u201cShe wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Bobby sat up. This can\u2019t be good, he mouthed as he took the phone from Claire. \u201cHow\u2019s the sexiest mother-in-law in the world?\u201d After a moment, his smile faded. \u201cWhat?\u201d Then: \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. How did you do it?\u201d</p><p>Claire moved toward him, placed her hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible, Ellie. Really. I don\u2019t know how to thank you. When?\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou know we\u2019re here\u2014oh. Yeah. I understand. At the ticket counter. Yes. Okay. Of course we\u2019ll call right away. And thank you. I can\u2019t tell you how much this means. Yes. Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d Claire asked when he hung up the phone.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s smile was so big it creased his whole face into pleats. \u201cShe got me an audition with Kent Ames at Down Home Records. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve been playing shit-ass honky-tonk joints for ten years waiting for a break like this.\u201d</p><p>Claire threw herself at him, holding him tightly in her arms. She told herself it was foolish to have been afraid, worried, but still her hands were shaking. Too many bad years with Mama, she supposed. She always expected the worst. \u201cYou\u2019ll knock \u2019em dead.\u201d</p><p>He twirled her around until they were both laughing. \u201cThis is it, Claire.\u201d</p><p>She was still laughing when he eased her back to her feet.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . ,\u201d he said, not smiling now.</p><p>That worry came back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe audition is Thursday. After that, Kent is leaving for a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Thursday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Nashville.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked up at her husband, who wore his heart in his eyes right now. She knew that if she said no, said, Our honeymoon won\u2019t be over by then, he\u2019d kiss her and say, Okay, maybe call your Mama back and see if the audition can be rescheduled in a month. Knowing all that made her answer easy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to see Opryland.\u201d</p><p>Bobby pulled her into his arms, gazed down at her. \u201cI\u2019d given up,\u201d he admitted quietly.</p><p>\u201cLet that be a lesson,\u201d she answered happily. \u201cNow, hand me that phone. I better let Dad and Meghann know that we\u2019ll probably add a day or two on to the trip.\u201d</p><p>The days with Alison settled into a comfortable routine. By the third afternoon, Meghann had let go of her obsessive need to show her niece every child-friendly venue in the city. Instead, they did simple things. They rented movies and made cookies and played Candy Land until Meg cried out for mercy.</p><p>Each night Meg slept with Ali tucked in her arms, and each morning she awoke with an unexpected sense of anticipation. She smiled easier, laughed more often. She\u2019d forgotten how good it felt to care for someone else.</p><p>When Claire called to extend the length of her honeymoon, Meg knew she\u2019d shocked her sister by offering\u2014gladly\u2014to keep Alison for a few extra days. Unfortunately, the oh-so-important birthday party ruined that option.</p><p>When Saturday finally came, Meghann was surprised by the depth of her emotions. All the way to Hayden she had to work to keep smiling, while Ali chattered nonstop and bounced in her seat. At Sam\u2019s house, Ali flew into her grandfather\u2019s arms and started telling him about the week. Meg kissed her niece good-bye and hurried out of the trailer. That night, she hardly slept at all. She couldn\u2019t seem to stave off the loneliness.</p><p>On Monday, she went back to work.</p><p>The hours stacked on top of one another, growing heavier than usual. By 3:00, she was so tired she could hardly function.</p><p>She hoped that Harriet wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>A useless hope, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou look bad,\u201d Harriet said when Meghann slumped into the familiar chair.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did the wedding go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice,\u201d Meg said, looking down at her hands. \u201cEven Mama couldn\u2019t ruin it. I planned the wedding, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so shocked. I followed your advice and kept my mouth shut. Claire and I . . . connected again. I even baby-sat my niece during the honeymoon. But now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, what?\u201d</p><p>Meg shrugged. \u201cThe real world is back.\u201d She looked up. \u201cMy condo is quiet. I never noticed that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour niece was loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never stopped talking. Except when she was asleep.\u201d Meg felt a tightening in her chest. She would miss sleeping with Ali, miss having a little girl to care for.</p><p>\u201cIt reminded you of Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLately, everything reminds me of those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were best friends,\u201d Meg said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>Meghann sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s married. She has her family. It\u2019s just like before. I probably won\u2019t hear from her until my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone works both ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Meghann looked down at her watch. She didn\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. It hurt too much. \u201cI gotta go, Harriet. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Meghann stared at her client, hoping the smile she managed to form wasn\u2019t as plastic as it felt.</p><p>Robin O\u2019Houlihan paced in front of the window. Stick-thin and wearing more makeup than Terence Stamp in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, she was the clich\u00e9d Hollywood wife. Too thin, too greedy, too everything. Meg wondered why none of these women noticed that at a certain age thin became gaunt. The more weight they lost, the less attractive their faces became, and Robin\u2019s hair had been dyed and redyed blond so often and so long it looked like a straw wig. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. Period. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin,\u201d she said, striving for a calm and even voice. \u201cHe\u2019s offering twenty-thousand dollars a month, the house on Lake Washington, and the condo in La Jolla. Frankly, for a nine-year marriage that produced no children, I think\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wanted children.\u201d She practically hurled the words at Meg. \u201cHe was the one who didn\u2019t. He should have to pay for that, too. He took away the best reproductive years of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin. You\u2019re forty-nine years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m too old to have a child?\u201d</p><p>Well, no. But you\u2019ve been married six times and frankly, you have the mental and emotional stability of a two-year-old. Believe me, your never-conceived children thank you. \u201cOf course not, Robin. I\u2019m simply suggesting that the children approach won\u2019t help us. Washington is a no-fault state, you remember. The whys of a divorce don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want the dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this. The dogs were his before you got married. It seems reasonable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the one who reminded Lupe to feed and water them. Without me, those Lhasa Apsos would be hairy toast. Dead by the side of the pool. I want them. And you should quit fighting with me. You\u2019re my lawyer, not his. I can hardly live on twenty grand a month.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cHe still has the jet, the place in Aspen, the Malibu beach house, and all our friends.\u201d Her voice cracked and, for just a moment, Meghann saw a flash of the woman Robin O\u2019Houlihan had once been. A now-frightened, once-ordinary girl from Snohomish who\u2019d believed a woman could marry her way to the top.</p><p>Meghann wanted to be gentle, say something soothing. In the old days, it would have been easy. But those days were gone now, stamped into muddy nothingness by the stiletto heels of a hundred angry wives who didn\u2019t want to work and couldn\u2019t possibly live on twenty grand a month.</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly, wanting to clear her mutinous mind. But instead of a quiet darkness, she flashed on an image of Mr. O\u2019Houlihan, sitting quietly in the conference room, his hands clasped on the table. He\u2019d answered all her questions with a sincerity that surprised her.</p> <p>No prenuptial, no. I believed we\u2019d last forever.</p><p>I loved her.</p><p>My first wife died. I met Robin nearly ten years later.</p><p>Oh. Yes. I wanted more children. Robin didn\u2019t.</p><p>It had been one of those uncomfortable moments that occasionally blindsided an attorney. That sickening realization that you were leading the wrong team.</p><p>Simply put, she\u2019d believed him. And that was no good.</p> <p>\u201cHel-lo. I\u2019m talking here.\u201d Robin pulled a cigarette from her quilted Chanel bag. Remembering suddenly that she couldn\u2019t smoke in here, she jammed it back in her purse. \u201cSo, how do I get the house in Aspen? And the dogs.\u201d</p><p>Meghann rolled the pen between her thumb and forefinger, thinking. Every now and then the pen thumped on the manila folder open in front of her. It sounded vaguely like a war drumbeat. \u201cI\u2019ll call Graham and hash this through. Apparently your husband is willing to be very generous, but trust me on this, Robin. People get pissed off over a lot less than a beloved dog. If you\u2019re going to go to the mat for Fluffy and Scruffy, be prepared to give up a lot. Your husband could yank the houses from the table in an instant. You better decide how important those dogs are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Meghann thought of the man she\u2019d deposed more than a month ago. His look had been sad\u2014worn, even. \u201cI think you already have, if that\u2019s any consolation.\u201d</p><p>Robin tapped a long scarlet fingernail against her teeth as she stared out toward Bainbridge Island. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have slept with the pool guy.\u201d</p><p>Or the meat delivery boy or the dentist who bleached your teeth. \u201cThis is a no-fault state, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the divorce. I\u2019m talking about the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d There it was again, that flash of a real person hiding behind the decoupage of expensive makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see your life in retrospect. It\u2019s too bad we don\u2019t live life backward. I think it was Kierkegaard who said that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally.\u201d Robin was clearly disinterested. \u201cI\u2019ll think about the dogs and let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAct fast. Graham said this offer lasts for thirty-six hours. After that, he said it was ring time. Round one.\u201d</p><p>Robin nodded. \u201cYou seem awfully timid for someone they call the Bitch of Belltown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot timid. Practical. But if you\u2019d prefer other representation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Robin slung her purse over her shoulder and headed for the door. As she opened it, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d Without looking back, she left. The door clicked shut.</p><p>Meg let out a heavy sigh. She felt pummeled, smaller somehow.</p><p>She set the file aside, and as she did, she thought of Mr. O\u2019Houlihan\u2019s sad face again.</p><p>No prenuptial, no. I believed we\u2019d last forever.</p><p>This was going to rip his heart out. It wouldn\u2019t be enough to break his heart. Oh, no. Meghann and Robin were going to take it one step further and show him the true character of the woman he\u2019d married. He\u2019d find it damn near impossible to trust his heart the next time.</p><p>With a sigh, she checked her schedule. Robin had been her last appointment. Thank God. Meghann didn\u2019t think she could handle another sad story of failed loved right now. She packed up her papers, grabbed her purse and briefcase, and left the office.</p><p>Outside, it was a balmy early-summer night. The hustle and bustle of rush hour traffic clogged the streets. In the market, tourists were still crowded around the fish stand. White-aproned vendors threw thirty-pound king salmons through the air to one another: at every toss, tourists snapped photographs.</p><p>Meghann barely noticed the familiar show. She was past the fish market and down to the vegetables when she realized what route she\u2019d chosen.</p><p>The Athenian was the next doorway.</p><p>She paused outside, smelling the pungent familiar odors of cigarette smoke and frying grease, listening to the buzz of conversations that were always the same, ultimately circling back to Are you here alone?</p><p>Alone.</p><p>It was certainly the most accurate adjective to describe her life. Even more so now that Ali was gone. It was amazing how big a hole her tiny niece had left behind.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to go into the Athenian, pick up some man she didn\u2019t know, and bring him back to her bed. She wanted\u2014</p><p>Joe.</p><p>A wave of melancholy came with his name, a deepening of the loneliness.</p><p>She pushed away from the doorway and headed home.</p><p>In the lobby of her building, she waved to the doorman, who started to say something to her. She ignored him and went into the elevator. On the penthouse floor, the elevator bell clanged, and she got out.</p><p>Her apartment door was open.</p><p>She frowned, wondering if she\u2019d left it that way this morning.</p><p>No.</p><p>She was just about to slink back into the elevator when a hand appeared in her doorway; it held a full bottle of tequila.</p><p>Elizabeth Shore stepped out into the hallway. \u201cI heard your transatlantic cry for help, and I brought the preferred tranquilizer for the slutty, over-the-hill set.\u201d</p><p>To Meghann\u2019s complete horror, she burst into tears.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>JOE WAS ALMOST FINISHED FOR THE DAY. IT WAS A GOOD thing because he actually had places to go and people to see.</p><p>It felt good to look forward to something, even if that something would ultimately cause him pain. He\u2019d been drifting and alone for so long that simply having an itinerary was oddly calming.</p><p>Now he lay on his back, staring up at the dirty underside of an old Impala.</p><p>\u201cHey there.\u201d</p><p>Joe frowned. He thought he\u2019d heard something, but it was hard to tell. The radio on the workbench was turned up loud. Willie Nelson was warning mamas about babies that grew up to be cowboys.</p><p>Then someone kicked his boot.</p><p>Joe rolled out from underneath the car.</p><p>The face looking down at him was small, freckled, and smiling. Earnest green eyes stared down at him. She squinted just a bit, enough to make him wonder if she needed glasses, then he realized that his worklight was shining in her face. He clicked it off.</p><p>\u201cSmitty\u2019s in the office,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know that, silly. He\u2019s always there. Did you know that the sand in Hawaii is like sugar? Smitty lets me play with the tools. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>He stood up, wiped his hands on his coveralls. \u201cI\u2019m Joe. Now, run along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Alison. My mom mostly calls me Ali. Like the gator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Ali.\u201d He glanced up at the clock. It was 4:00. Time to get going.</p><p>\u201cBrittani Henshaw always says, \u2018See you later, Ali Gator,\u2019 to me. Get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom says I\u2019m not \u2019posed to talk to strangers, but you\u2019re Joe.\u201d She scrunched up her face and stared up at him. \u201cHow come your hair is so long? It\u2019s like a girl\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it that way.\u201d He went to the sink and washed the grease from his hands.</p><p>\u201cMy backpack has Ariel on it. Wanna see?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, she scampered out of the garage. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d she yelled back at him.</p><p>He was halfway to his cabin when Alison skidded in beside him. \u201cSee Ariel? She\u2019s a princess on this side and a mermaid on the other.\u201d</p><p>He missed a step but kept moving. \u201cI\u2019m going into my house. You better run along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo ya hafta poop?\u201d</p><p>He was startled into laughter by that. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t tell me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI definitely would not. I need to get ready to go somewhere. It was nice to meet you, though.\u201d He didn\u2019t slow down.</p><p>She fell into step beside him, talking animatedly about some girlfriend named Moolan who\u2019d cut off all her hair and played with knives.</p><p>\u201cThey have school counselors for that kind of behavior.\u201d</p><p>Alison giggled and kept talking.</p><p>Joe climbed the porch steps and opened his door. \u201cWell, Alison, this is where\u2014\u201d</p><p>She darted past him and went inside.</p><p>\u201cAlison,\u201d he said in a stern voice. \u201cYou need to leave now. It\u2019s inappropriate to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour house smells kinda funny.\u201d She sat on the sofa and bounced. \u201cWho\u2019s the lady in all the pitchers?\u201d</p><p>He turned his back on her for a second; when he looked again she was at the windowsill, pawing through the pictures.</p><p>\u201cPut those down,\u201d he said more sharply than was necessary.</p><p>Frowning, she put it down. \u201cI don\u2019t like to share my stuff, either.\u201d She glanced at the row of photographs. There were three of them along the living-room window and two on the mantel. Even a child recognized an obsession when she saw one.</p><p>\u201cThe woman in the pictures is my wife. Diana.\u201d It still hurt to say her name aloud. He hadn\u2019t learned yet to be casual about her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at a small framed montage of shots on the table nearest him. Gina had taken those pictures at a New Year\u2019s Eve party. \u201cYes.\u201d He cleared his throat. It was 4:15 now. Getting late. \u201cDon\u2019t you have someplace to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sighed dramatically. \u201cI gotta go give Marybeth my Barbie. Mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke the head off hers. Grandpa says I hafta \u2019pologize and give her my doll. It\u2019s \u2019posed to make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>He squatted down to be eye level with her. \u201cWell, Ali Gator, I guess we have something in common, after all. I . . . broke something very special, too, and now I have to go apologize.\u201d</p><p>She sighed dejectedly. \u201cToo bad.\u201d</p> <p>He put his hands on his thighs and pushed to his feet. \u201cSo, I really need to get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Joe.\u201d She walked over to the door and opened it, then looked back at him. \u201cDo you think Marybeth will play with me again after I \u2019pologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBye, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya later, Ali Gator.\u201d</p> <p>That made her giggle, and then she was gone.</p><p>Joe stood there a minute, staring at the closed door. Finally, he turned and headed down the hallway. For the next hour, as he shaved and showered and dressed in his cleanest worn clothes, he tried to string together the sentences he would need. He tried pretty words\u2014Diana\u2019s death ruined something inside me; stark words\u2014I fucked up; painful words\u2014I couldn\u2019t stand watching her die.</p><p>But none of them were the whole of it, none of them expressed the truth of his emotions.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t figured out what he would say, when he turned onto their road or, a few minutes later, when he came to their mailbox.</p><p>Dr. and Mrs. Henry Roloff.</p><p>Joe couldn\u2019t help touching it, letting his fingertips trace along the raised gold lettering on the side of the mailbox. There had been a mailbox in Bainbridge like this one; that one read: Dr. and Mrs. Joe Wyatt.</p> <p>A lifetime ago.</p><p>He stared at his former in-laws\u2019 house. It looked exactly as it had on another June day, so long ago, when Joe and Di had gotten married in the backyard, surrounded by family and friends.</p><p>He almost gave in to panic, almost turned away.</p><p>But running away didn\u2019t help. He\u2019d tried that route, and it had brought him back here, to this house, to these people whom he\u2019d once loved so keenly, to say\u2014</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Just that.</p><p>He walked up the intricately patterned brick path, toward the white-pillared house that Mrs. Roloff had designed to look like Tara. There were roses and sculpted hedges on both sides of him, their scents a cloying sweetness. On either side of the front door stood a cast-iron lion.</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t let himself pause or think. He reached out and rang the bell.</p> <p>A few moments later, the door opened. Henry Roloff stood there, pipe in hand, dressed in khaki pants and a navy turtleneck. \u201cCan I\u2014\u201d At the sight of Joe, his smile fell. \u201cJoey,\u201d he said, his pipe aflutter now in a trembling hand. \u201cWe\u2019d heard you were back in town.\u201d</p><p>Joe tried like hell to smile.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Tina called out from somewhere inside the house.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe it,\u201d Henry said, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cHenry?\u201d she yelled again. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>Henry stepped back. A watery smile spilled across his face, wrinkled his cheeks. \u201cHe\u2019s home, Mother,\u201d he yelled. Then, softly, he said it again, his eyes filling with tears. \u201cHe\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is tequila? It tastes like lighter fluid.\u201d Meghann heard the sloppy slur in her voice. She was past tipsy now, barreling toward plastered, and it felt good.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s expensive tequila. Only the best for my friend.\u201d Elizabeth leaned sideways for a piece of pizza. As she pulled it toward her, the cheese and topping slid off, landing in a gooey heap on the concrete deck. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2019bout it.\u201d Meghann scooped up the mess and threw it overboard. \u201cPro\u2019ly just killed a tourist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s ten o\u2019clock. Seattle is empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth took a bite of her crust. \u201cSo what\u2019s the problem, kiddo? Your messages lately sounded depressed. And you don\u2019t usually cry when I show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see, I hate my job. My client\u2019s husband tried to shoot me after I ruined him. My sister married a country singer who happens to be a felon.\u201d She looked up. \u201cShall I go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI baby-sat my niece when Claire went on her honeymoon and now my house feels obscenely quiet. And I met this guy. . . .\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth slowly put down the pizza.</p><p>Meghann looked at her best friend, feeling a sudden wave of helplessness. Softly, she dared to say, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me, Birdie. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and my cheeks are wet. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you lonely yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Meg. We\u2019ve been friends for more than twenty years. I remember when you were a quiet, way-too-young freshman at the UW. One of those genius kids who everyone believes will either kill themselves or cure cancer. You used to cry every night back then. My bed was next to yours on the sleeping porch, remember? It broke my heart, how quietly you cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you started walking to class with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to take care of you\u2014it\u2019s what we Southern women do, don\u2019t you know? I waited years for you to tell me why you cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I stop? Crying, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJunior year. By then, it was too late to ask. When you married Eric, I thought\u2014I hoped\u2014you\u2019d finally be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited for you to meet someone else, try again.\u201d</p><p>Meghann poured two more straight shots. Downing hers, she leaned back against the railing. Cool night air ruffled the fine hairs around her face. The sound of traffic drifted toward her. \u201cI have . . . met someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe. I don\u2019t even know his last name. How pathetic is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked sex with strangers.\u201d</p><p>Meghann heard how hard Elizabeth was trying not to sound judgmental. \u201cI like being in control and waking up alone and having my life exactly the way I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Meghann felt that wave again, the feeling of being sucked under a heavy current. \u201cBeing in control . . . and waking up alone and having my life exactly the way I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this Joe made you feel something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you haven\u2019t seen him since you realized that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I so obvious?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth laughed. \u201cJust a little. This Joe scared you, so you ran. Tell me I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bitch who\u2019s right-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That kind of bitch. The worst kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember my birthday last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything up until the third martini. After that, it gets fuzzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t know if I loved Jack anymore. You told me to stay with him. Mentioned something about me losing everything and him marrying the salad-bar girl from Hooters.\u201d</p><p>Meghann rolled her eyes. \u201cAnother shining example of my humanity. You talk about love; I answer in settlement. I\u2019m so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is, I was dying in my marriage. All the lies I\u2019d been telling myself for years had worn thin. Everything poked through and hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it worked out. You and Jacko are like newlyweds again. It\u2019s frankly disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how I fell back in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did the thing that scared me the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had never lived alone, Meg. Never. I was so scared of not having Jack, I couldn\u2019t breathe at first. But I did it\u2014and you were there for me. That night you came down to the beach house, you literally saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were always stronger than you thought.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth gave her a so-are-you look. \u201cYou have to quit being afraid of love. Maybe this Joe is the place to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all wrong for me. I never sleep with men who have something to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t \u2018sleep\u2019 with men at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bitch returns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he so wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a mechanic in a small town. He lives in the run-down cabin that comes with the job. He cuts his hair with a pocket knife. Take your choice. Oh, and though he\u2019s not much on decoration, he has managed to fill his place with photos of the wife who divorced him.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth looked at her, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I don\u2019t really care about that stuff. I mean the photos are creepy, but I don\u2019t care about his job. And I sort of like Hayden. It\u2019s a nice town, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>In Elizabeth\u2019s gaze, Meghann saw a sad understanding; it comforted her. \u201cI left town without a word. Not even a good-bye. You can\u2019t turn that around easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been one to go for the easy route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought sex with strangers would be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Meg said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSo, call him. Pretend you had business that called you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the garage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him at work? I don\u2019t know. That seems kind of personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to assume you gave this guy a blow job, but a phone call is too personal?\u201d</p><p>Meghann laughed at that. She had to admit how weird it was. \u201cI sound like a psycho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Okay, Meghann. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. And I mean it. You and I are going to drive up to the Salish Lodge tomorrow, where I\u2019ve scheduled some spa treatments for us. We will talk and drink and laugh and plan a strategy. Before you complain, let me tell you that I\u2019ve already called Julie and told her you\u2019d be out of the office. When I leave, you\u2019re going to drop me off at the airport and then head north. You will not stop until you reach Joe\u2019s front door. Am I understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I have the guts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come with you? So help me, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why they call you women steel magnolias.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth laughed. \u201cHoney, you better believe it. You don\u2019t evah want to tell a Southern girl that you won\u2019t go after a good-looking man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth reached for the pizza. \u201cYou just remember that phrase, Meg. Sooner or later, it\u2019s going to come in handy again. Now, tell me about Claire\u2019s wedding. I can\u2019t believe she let you plan it.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>\u201cTHIS IS THE CLUB WHERE GARTH BROOKS WAS DISCOVERED.\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled at Kent Ames, the grand Pooh-Bah of Down Home Records in Nashville, and his assistant, Ryan Turner. Each one of them had imparted this pearl of information to her three times in the past hour. She wasn\u2019t sure if they had the memory of gnats or if they thought she was too stupid to understand their words the first time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She and Bobby had been in Nashville for two days now. It ought to have been perfect. Their room at the Loews Hotel was breathtakingly beautiful. They\u2019d splurged on romantic dinners in the restaurant and eaten breakfast in bed. They\u2019d toured Opryland and seen the Country Music Hall of Fame. Most important, Bobby had aced his auditions. All four of them. His first had been in a dank, windowless office, with a low-level executive listening. Bobby had come home depressed, complaining that his big shot had been heard by a kid with acne and a poor sense of style. That night, they\u2019d drunk champagne and tried to pretend it didn\u2019t matter. Claire had held him close and told him how much she loved him.</p><p>The callback had come at 8:45 the next morning, and it had been a Ferris wheel of opportunity since then. He\u2019d sung his songs for one executive after another until he\u2019d finally found himself in the big corner office that overlooked the street of Country and Western dreams: Music Row. Each new executive had introduced \u201chis\u201d discovery to the man above him.</p><p>Their lives had changed in the last twenty-four hours. Bobby was \u201csomeone.\u201d A guy who was \u201cgoing places.\u201d</p><p>Now, they sat at a front table in a small, unassuming nightclub, she and the executives and her husband. In less than an hour, Bobby was scheduled to take the stage. It was a chance to \u201cshow his concert stuff\u201d to the executives.</p> <p>Bobby had no trouble talking to the men. Among them, there was rarely a pause. They talked about people and things Claire knew nothing about\u2014demo records and studio time and royalty rates and contract provisions.</p><p>She wanted to keep it all straight. In her fantasies, she was Bobby\u2019s partner as well as his wife, but she couldn\u2019t seem to concentrate. The endless flight from Kauai to Oahu to Seattle to Memphis to Nashville had left its mark in a dull headache that wouldn\u2019t go away. And she kept remembering how disappointed Ali had been that Mommy wasn\u2019t coming home on time.</p><p>The smoke in the club didn\u2019t help. Neither did the thudding music or the shouting conversation. She clung to Bobby\u2019s hand, nodding when one of the executives spoke to her, hoping her smile wasn\u2019t as fragile as it felt.</p><p>Kent Ames smiled at her. \u201cBobby goes on in forty-five minutes. Usually it takes years to get a spot on this stage.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, widening her smile.</p> <p>\u201cThis is where Garth Brooks was discovered, you know. Not by me, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Claire felt an odd tingling sensation in her right hand. It took her two tries to reach out for her margarita. When she took hold, she drank the whole thing, hoping it would ease her headache.</p><p>It didn\u2019t. Instead, it made her sick to her stomach. She slid off the bar stool and stood there, surprised to find that she was unsteady on her feet. She must have had one too many drinks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she realized that she had interrupted a conversation when the men looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Bobby got to his feet.</p><p>She pulled up a smile. It felt a little weak, one sided. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bobby. My headache is worse. I think I need to lie down.\u201d She kissed his cheek, whispered, \u201cKnock \u2019em dead, baby.\u201d</p> <p>He put his arm around her, held her close. \u201cI\u2019ll walk her back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Ryan frowned. \u201cBut your set\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to call in a favor to get you this opportunity,\u201d Kent said stonily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in time,\u201d Bobby said. Keeping a close hold, he maneuvered her out of the club and onto the loud, busy street.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to escort me, Bobby. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing matters more than you. Nothing. Those guys might as well know my priorities right off the bat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s getting a little cocky.\u201d She leaned against him as they walked down the street.</p><p>\u201cLuck\u2019s been on my side lately. Ever since I took the stage at Cowboy Bob\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>They hurried through the lobby and rode the elevator to their floor. In their room, Bobby gently undressed her and put her to bed, making sure she had water and aspirin on the night table.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, my love,\u201d he whispered, kissing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, baby. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I don\u2019t need luck.\u201d</p><p>She knew when he was gone. There was a click of the door and the room felt colder, emptier. Claire roused herself enough to call home. She tried to sound upbeat as she told Ali and Sam about the exciting day and reminded them that she\u2019d be home in two days. After she hung up, she sighed heavily and closed her eyes.</p><p>When Claire woke up the next morning, her headache was gone. She felt sluggish and tired, but it was easy to smile when Bobby told her how it had gone.</p><p>\u201cI blew them away, Claire. No kidding. Kent Ames was salivating over my future. He offered us a contract. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>They were curled up in their suite\u2019s window seat, both wearing the ultrasoft robes provided by the hotel. Bright morning sunlight pushed through the window; Bobby looked so handsome he took Claire\u2019s breath away. \u201cOf course I can believe it. I\u2019ve heard you sing. You deserve to be a superstar. How does it all work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think it\u2019ll take a month or so in Nashville. Finding material, putting a backup band together, that sort of thing. Kent said it isn\u2019t unusual to go through three thousand songs to find the right one. After we make the demo, they\u2019ll start promoting me. They want me to tour through September and October. Alan Jackson needs an opening act. Alan Jackson. But don\u2019t worry. I told them we\u2019d have to work out a schedule that was good for the family.\u201d</p><p>Claire loved him more in that moment than she would have imagined was possible. She grabbed his robe and pulled him close. \u201cYou will only have men and ugly women on your bus. I\u2019ve seen movies about those tours.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, long and slow and hard. When he drew back, she was dizzy. \u201cWhat did I ever do to deserve you, Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved me,\u201d she answered, reaching into his robe. \u201cNow take me to bed and love me again.\u201d</p><p>Meghann was not relaxed by her day at the spa. Between massages, facials, and Jacuzzi tub soaks, she and Elizabeth had talked endlessly. No matter how often Meghann tried to control the direction of their discussions, one topic kept reemerging.</p><p>Joe.</p><p>Elizabeth had been relentless. For the first time, Meghann knew how it felt to be pummeled by someone else\u2019s opinions.</p><p>Call him. Quit being such a chicken. The advice had come in dozens of ways and hundreds of different sentences, but it all boiled down to the same thing:</p><p>Contact him.</p><p>Honestly, Meghann was glad to take her friend to the airport. The silence came as a sweet relief. But then Meghann returned to her silent condo and found that Elizabeth\u2019s voice had remained behind and so, she\u2019d kept busy. For dinner, she bought a slice of pizza and walked along the wharf, window shopping with the steady stream of tourists that came off the ferries and spilled down the hilly streets from the Public Market.</p><p>It was 8:30 by the time she got home.</p><p>Once again, the quiet of her home was the only greeting that came her way.</p><p>\u201cI need to get a cat,\u201d she said aloud, tossing her handbag onto the sofa. Instead, she watched Sex and the City, then a rerun of The Practice (Bobby Donnell was crying again). She turned it off in disgust.</p><p>Yeah. Male defense lawyers are a weepy set.</p><p>She went to bed.</p><p>And lay there, eyes wide open, for the rest of the night.</p><p>Call him, you chicken.</p><p>At 6:30 the next morning, she rolled out of bed, took a shower, and dressed in a plain black suit with a lavender silk shell.</p><p>One look in the mirror reminded her that she hadn\u2019t slept more than two hours the night before. As if she needed to notice her wrinkles to remember that.</p><p>She was at her desk by 7:30, highlighting the Pernod deposition.</p><p>Every fifteen minutes, she glanced at her phone.</p><p>Call him.</p><p>Finally, at 10:00, she gave up and buzzed her secretary.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ms. Dontess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the number for a garage in Hayden, Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat garage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the name or the address. But it\u2019s across the street from Riverfront Park. On Front Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014to be resourceful. It\u2019s a small town. Everybody knows everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Meghann hung up.</p><p>Ten long minutes passed. Finally Rhona buzzed on line one.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the number. It\u2019s called Smitty\u2019s Garage.\u201d</p><p>Meghann wrote down the number and stared at it. Her heart was beating quickly.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d She picked up the phone and dialed. With every ring, she had to fight the urge to hang up.</p><p>\u201cSmitty\u2019s Garage.\u201d</p><p>Meghann swallowed hard. \u201cIs Joe there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a sec. Joe!\u201d</p><p>The phone clanged down, then was picked up. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe? It\u2019s Meghann.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cI thought I\u2019d seen the last of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it won\u2019t be that easy.\u201d But the joke fell into silence. \u201cI . . . uh . . . I have a deposition in Snohomish County on Friday afternoon. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t want to . . . I shouldn\u2019t have called, but I thought you might like to get together for dinner.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cForget it. I\u2019m an idiot. I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could pick up a couple of steaks and borrow Smitty\u2019s barbecue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly, and the sound of it released that achy tension in her neck. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there about six. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring wine and dessert.\u201d</p><p>Meghann was smiling when she hung up. Ten minutes later, Rhona buzzed her again.</p><p>\u201cMs. Dontess, your sister is on line two. She says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Meg put on her headset and pushed the button. \u201cHey, Claire. Welcome back. Your flight must have been on time. Amazing. How was\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the airport. I didn\u2019t know who else to call.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice was shaky; it almost sounded as if she was crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember the flight from Nashville. I also don\u2019t remember getting my luggage, but it\u2019s right here. I don\u2019t remember getting my keys or walking through the garage, but I\u2019m sitting in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I, damn it,\u201d Claire screamed, then she started to sob. \u201cI can\u2019t remember how to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d Instead of panicking, Meghann took charge. \u201cDo you have a piece of paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her sobs slowed down. \u201cI\u2019m scared, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite this down. Eight twenty-nine Post Alley. Do you have that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep holding it. Now get out of your car and walk toward the terminal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay on the phone with you.\u201d She heard Claire slam the car door shut. The rolling thump of luggage followed her.</p><p>\u201cWait. I don\u2019t know which way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a covered walkway in front of you, with airlines listed above it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. It says Alaska and Horizon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo that way. I\u2019m right here, Claire. I\u2019m not going anywhere. Take the escalator down one floor. You see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so weak. It scared the hell out of Meghann. \u201cGo outside. Pick up the phone that says Taxi. What\u2019s the number above the door you just came through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell the cab driver to pick you up at door twelve, that you\u2019re going downtown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>Meghann heard her talking.</p><p>Then Claire said, \u201cOkay.\u201d She was crying again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Claire. Everything is going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d</p> <p>Meghann felt an icy rush of fear. \u201cIt\u2019s Meghann. Your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember calling you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jesus. Meghann closed her eyes. It took an act of will to find her voice. \u201cIs there a cab in front of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why is it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s there for you. Get in the backseat. Give him the piece of paper in your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Meg. How did you know I had this paper? What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Claire. I\u2019m here. Get in the cab. He\u2019ll drop you off at my building. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>The cab pulled along the curb and stopped. Before Claire could even say thank you, the front passenger-side door opened. Meghann threw a wad of bills at the driver, then slammed the door shut.</p> <p>Claire\u2019s door opened.</p><p>Meghann was there. \u201cHey, Claire, come on out.\u201d</p><p>Claire grabbed her handbag and climbed out of the cab. She felt shaky, confused.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your luggage?\u201d</p><p>Claire looked around. \u201cI must have left it in my car at the airport.\u201d She laughed, though it sounded weak, even to her. \u201cLook, Meg, I\u2019m feeling a lot better now. I don\u2019t know . . . I just spazzed out for a minute. The plane ride was awful, and they practically strip-searched me in Memphis. I\u2019m already missing Bobby, and he\u2019s going to be down there for the next few weeks. I guess I had a panic attack or something. Just take me to a quiet restaurant for a cup of coffee. I probably just need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Meg looked at her as if she were a science experiment gone bad. \u201cAre you kidding me? A panic attack? Believe me, Claire, I know panic attacks, and you don\u2019t forget how to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And you know everything.\u201d The stress of her . . . thing . . . snapped cleanly, left her exhausted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to. We\u2019re getting in that car and going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine now. Really. I\u2019m probably getting a sinus infection. I\u2019ll see my doctor at home.\u201d</p><p>Meghann took a step toward her. \u201cThere are two ways this can go down. You can get nicely in the car and we can leave. Or I can make a scene. You know I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Take me to the hospital, where we can spend the whole day and two hundred dollars to find out that I have a sinus infection that was exacerbated by air travel.\u201d</p><p>Meg took her arm and guided her into the cushy black interior of a Lincoln Town Car.</p><p>\u201cA limo to the emergency room. How chic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a limo.\u201d Meg studied her. \u201cAre you okay now, really?\u201d</p><p>Claire heard the concern in her sister\u2019s voice, and it touched her. She remembered suddenly that Meg always got loud and angry when she was frightened. It had been that way since childhood. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you.\u201d</p><p>Meg finally smiled. Leaning back in the seat, she said quietly, \u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged looks then, and Claire felt herself relaxing. \u201cBobby aced the auditions. They offered him a big fat contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t sign it until I review it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe standard response is: Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Meghann had the grace to blush. \u201cCongratulations. That\u2019s really something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it belongs in Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not! under the headline Eliana Sullivan Does Good Deed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good deed that benefits her. A famous son-in-law puts the spotlight on her, too, you know. Just think of the I-discovered-him-and-changed-his-life interviews.\u201d Meg pressed a hand to her breast, and said, \u201cI\u2019m so bighearted when it comes to family\u201d in a gooey Southern drawl.</p><p>Claire started to laugh. Then she noticed that the tingling in her right hand was back. As she stared down at her hand, her fingers curled into a kind of hook. For a split second, she couldn\u2019t open it. She panicked. Please, God\u2014</p><p>The spasm ended.</p><p>The car pulled up in front of the hospital and let them out.</p><p>At the emergency room\u2019s reception desk, a heavyset young woman with green hair and a nose ring looked up at them. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a killer headache.\u201d</p><p>Meghann leaned over the desk. \u201cWrite this down: Severe headache. Short-term memory loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I forgot.\u201d Claire smiled weakly.</p><p>The receptionist frowned at that and shoved a clipboard across the desk. \u201cFill that out and give me your insurance card.\u201d</p><p>Claire retrieved the card from her wallet and handed it to the receptionist. \u201cMy family doctor thinks I need to exercise more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all say that,\u201d the receptionist said with a little laugh. \u201cTake a seat until we call for you.\u201d</p><p>An hour later they were still waiting. Meghann was fit to be tied. She\u2019d yelled at the receptionist three times and in the last twenty minutes, she\u2019d been throwing around the word lawsuit.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of nerve calling this an emergency room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the bright side. They must not think I\u2019m very sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the headache. We\u2019ll both be dead from old age by the time they see you. Damn it.\u201d Meghann popped to her feet and started pacing.</p><p>Claire considered trying to calm her sister down, but the effort was too much. Her headache had gotten worse, which she definitely did not reveal to Meghann.</p><p>\u201cClaire Austin,\u201d called out a blue-scrubbed nurse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about fucking time.\u201d Meghann stopped pacing long enough to help Claire to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real comfort, Meg,\u201d Claire said, leaning against her sister.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift,\u201d Meg said, guiding her toward the tiny, birdlike nurse who stood in front of the white double doors of the ER.</p><p>Bird Woman looked up. \u201cClaire Austin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>To Meg, the nurse said, \u201cYou can wait out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with my sister. If the doctor asks me to leave for the exam, I will.\u201d</p><p>Claire knew she should be angry. Meg was being herself\u2014pushing in where she didn\u2019t belong\u2014but truthfully, Claire didn\u2019t want to be alone.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Claire clung to her sister\u2019s hand as they pushed through the double doors and entered the frightening white world that smelled of disinfectant. In a small exam room, Claire changed into a flimsy hospital gown, answered a few questions for the nurse, relinquished her arm for a blood pressure test and her vein for a blood test.</p><p>Then, again, they waited.</p><p>\u201cIf I were really sick, they\u2019d rush to take care of me,\u201d Claire said after a while. \u201cSo this waiting is probably a good thing.\u201d</p><p>Meghann stood with her back to the wall. Her arms were crossed tightly, as if she were afraid she\u2019d punch something if she moved. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Under her breath, she said, \u201cShitheads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever consider a career in health care? You\u2019ve got quite a bedside manner. God knows you\u2019re calming me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We all know how patient I am.\u201d</p><p>Claire leaned back on the paper-covered exam table and stared up at the acoustical tile ceiling.</p><p>Finally, someone knocked, then the door opened.</p><p>In walked a teenage boy in a white coat. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Lannigan. What seems to be the problem?\u201d</p><p>Meghann groaned.</p><p>Claire sat up. \u201cHello, doctor. I really don\u2019t need to be here, I\u2019m sure. I have a headache and my sister thinks a migraine is emergency-room-worthy. After a long flight, I had some kind of panic attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere she forgot how to get home,\u201d Meghann added.</p><p>The doctor didn\u2019t look at Meghann. He didn\u2019t look at Claire, either. Instead, he studied the chart in his hands. Then he asked her to perform a few functions\u2014lift one arm, then the other, turn her head, blink\u2014and answer some easy questions\u2014what year it is, who the president is. That sort of thing. When he finished, he asked, \u201cDo you often get headaches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, when I get stressed-out. More lately, though,\u201d she had to admit.</p><p>\u201cHave you made any big changes in your life recently?\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. \u201cPlenty. I just got married for the first time. My husband is going to be gone for a month. He\u2019s in Nashville, making a record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWell, Mrs. Austin, your blood work is all normal, as are your pulse and your blood pressure, and your temperature. I\u2019m sure this is all stress. I could run some expensive tests, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. I\u2019ll write you a prescription for a migraine medication. When you feel one coming on, take two tablets with plenty of water.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIf the headaches persist, however, I\u2019d recommend that you see a neurologist.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded, relieved. \u201cThank you, doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. So no.\u201d Meghann pulled away from the wall and moved toward the doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her, stepping back as she invaded his personal space.</p><p>\u201cI watch ER. She needs a CAT scan, at the very least. Or an MRI or an EKG. Some damn initial test. At the very least, she\u2019ll take that neurology consult now.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThose are costly tests. We can hardly run a CAT scan on every patient who complains of a headache, but if you\u2019d like, I\u2019ll recommend a neurologist. You can make an appointment to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my first year of residency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to do a second year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your supervisor in here. Now. We didn\u2019t spend three hours here so that an almost-doctor could tell us that Claire is under stress. I\u2019m under stress; you\u2019re under stress. We manage to remember our way home. Get a real doctor in here. A neurologist. We are not making an appointment. We\u2019ll see a specialist now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get a consult.\u201d He clutched his clipboard and hurried out.</p><p>Claire sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re being you again. It is stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it is, too, but I\u2019m not taking the prom king\u2019s word for it.\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, the nurse was back. This time her smile looked forced. \u201cDr. Kensington has reviewed your material for Dr. Lannigan. She\u2019d like you to have a CAT scan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe. Thank God,\u201d Meghann said.</p><p>The nurse nodded. \u201cYou can come with me,\u201d she said to Claire.</p><p>Claire looked to Meghann, who smiled and took her arm. \u201cThink of us as conjoined.\u201d</p><p>The nurse walked out in front of them.</p><p>Claire clung to Meghann\u2019s hand. The walk seemed to last forever, down one corridor and another, up the elevator and down another hallway, until they arrived at the Center for Nuclear Medicine.</p> <p>Nuclear. Claire felt Meghann\u2019s grip tighten.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d The nurse paused outside yet another closed door. She turned to Meghann. \u201cThere\u2019s a chair right there. You can\u2019t come in, but I\u2019ll take good care of her, okay?\u201d</p><p>Meghann hesitated, then slowly nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be here, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Claire followed the nurse through the door, then down another short hallway and into a room that was dominated by a huge machine that looked like a white doughnut. Claire let herself be positioned on the narrow bed that intersected the doughnut hole.</p><p>There, she waited. And waited. Periodically, the nurse came back, muttered something about the doctor, and disappeared again.</p><p>Claire started to get cold. The fear she\u2019d worked so hard to keep at bay crept back. It was impossible not to fear the worst here.</p> <p>Finally, the door opened and a man in a white coat walked in. \u201cSorry to keep you waiting. Something came up. I\u2019m Dr. Cole, your radiologist. You just lie perfectly still and we\u2019ll have you out of here in no time.\u201d</p><p>Claire forced herself to smile. She refused to think about the fact that everyone else wore lead aprons in the room, while she lay with only the thinnest sheet of cotton to protect her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done. Fine job,\u201d he said when it was finally over.</p><p>Claire was so thankful she almost forgot the headache that had steadily increased as she lay in the machine.</p><p>In the hallway, Meghann looked angry. \u201cWhat happened? They said it would take an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it did, once they corraled a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitheads.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. Already she felt better with that behind her. \u201cThey certainly teach you lawyers to be precise with your language.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear precisely what I think of this place.\u201d</p><p>They followed the nurse to another exam room.</p><p>\u201cShould I get dressed?\u201d Claire asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. The doctor will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet,\u201d Meghann said under her breath.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, the nurse was back. \u201cThe doctor has ordered another test. An MRI. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an MRI?\u201d Claire asked, feeling anxious again.</p><p>\u201cMagnetic resonance imaging. It\u2019s a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on. Very standard.\u201d</p><p>Another hallway, another long walk toward a closed door. Again, Meg waited outside.</p><p>This time, Claire had to remove her wedding ring, her earrings, her necklace, and even her barrette. The technician asked her if she had any steel surgical staples or a pacemaker. When she said no and asked why, he said, \u201cWell, we\u2019d hate to see \u2019em fly outta you when this thing starts up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely image,\u201d Claire muttered. \u201cI hope my fillings are safe.\u201d</p><p>The tech laughed as he helped her into the coffinlike machine. She found it difficult to breathe evenly. The bed was cold and hard; it curved up uncomfortably and pinched her upper back. The technician strapped her in. \u201cYou need to lie perfectly still.\u201d</p><p>Claire closed her eyes. The room was cold and she was freezing, but she lay still.</p><p>When the machine started it sounded like a jackhammer on a city street.</p><p>Quiet, Claire. Still. Perfectly still. She closed her eyes and barely breathed. She didn\u2019t realize she was crying until she felt the moisture drip down her temple.</p><p>The one-hour test lasted for two. Halfway through, they stopped and set up an IV. The needle pinched her arm; dye bled through her system, feeling ice-cold. She swore she could feel it pump into her brain. Finally, she was let go. She and Meghann returned to an examination room in the Nuclear Medicine Wing, where Claire\u2019s clothes were hanging. Then they went to another waiting room.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Meg grumbled.</p><p>They were there another hour. Finally, a tall, tired-looking woman in a lab coat came into the waiting room. \u201cClaire Austin?\u201d</p><p>Claire stood up. At the suddenness of the movement, she almost fell. Meg steadied her.</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Sheri Kensington, chief of Neurology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire Austin. This is my sister, Meghann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. Come this way.\u201d Dr. Kensington led them down a short hallway and into an office that was lined with books, diplomas, and children\u2019s artwork. Behind her, a set of X-ray\u2013like images glowed against the bright white backlighting boxes.</p><p>Claire stared at them, wondering what there was to see.</p><p>The doctor sat down at her desk and indicated that Claire and Meghann should sit opposite her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had problems with Dr. Lannigan. This is, as I\u2019m sure you know, a teaching hospital, and sometimes our residents are not as thorough as we would wish. Your demand for a higher level of care was a much-needed wake-up call for Dr. Lannigan.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cMeghann is good at getting what she wants. Do I have a sinus infection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Claire. You have a mass in your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a mass. A tumor. In your brain.\u201d Dr. Kensington rose slowly and went to the X rays, pointing to a white spot. \u201cIt appears to be about the size of a golf ball, and located in the right frontal lobe, crossing the midline.\u201d</p><p>Tumor.</p><p>Claire felt as if she\u2019d just been shoved out of an airplane. She couldn\u2019t breathe; the ground was rushing up to meet her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this,\u201d Dr. Kensington went on, \u201cbut I\u2019ve consulted with a neurosurgeon and we believe it\u2019s inoperable. You\u2019ll want second opinions, of course. You\u2019ll need to see an oncologist, also.\u201d</p><p>Smack.</p><p>Meghann was on her feet, pressed against the desk as if she were going to grab the doctor\u2019s throat. \u201cYou\u2019re saying she has a brain tumor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The doctor went back to the desk and sat down.</p><p>\u201cAnd that you can\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe it\u2019s inoperable, yes, but I didn\u2019t say we can\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeg, please,\u201d Claire was absurdly afraid that her sister was going to make it worse. She looked pleadingly at the doctor. \u201cAre you . . . saying I might die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need more tests to determine the exact nature of your tumor, but\u2014given the size and placement of the mass\u2014it\u2019s not a good outlook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInoperable means you won\u2019t operate,\u201d Meg said in a don\u2019t-screw-with-me voice that was almost a growl.</p><p>Dr. Kensington looked surprised. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone will. I consulted with our top neurosurgeon on this. He agrees with my diagnosis. The procedure would be too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? It might kill her, huh?\u201d Meg looked disgusted. \u201cWho will do this kind of operation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one in this hospital.\u201d</p><p>Meg grabbed her handbag off the floor. \u201cCome on, Claire. We\u2019re in the wrong hospital.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked helplessly from Dr. Kensington to her sister. \u201cMeg,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cyou don\u2019t know everything. Please . . .\u201d</p><p>Meg went to her, knelt in front of her. \u201cI know I don\u2019t know everything, Claire, and I know I\u2019m a blowhard. I even know I\u2019ve let you down in the past, but none of that matters now. From this second on, all that matters is your life.\u201d</p><p>Claire felt herself starting to cry. She hated how fragile she felt, but there it was. Suddenly she felt like she was dying.</p><p>\u201cLean on me, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Claire gazed into her sister\u2019s eyes and remembered how Meg had once been her whole world. Slowly, she nodded. She needed a big sister again.</p><p>Meghann helped her to her feet, then she turned to the doctor. \u201cYou go ahead and teach Dr. Lannigan how to read a thermometer. We\u2019re going to find a doctor who can save her life.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>A FEW YEARS AGO, CLAIRE HAD GONE THROUGH A foreign-film phase. Every Saturday night, she\u2019d handed Alison to Dad, gotten in her car, and driven to a small, beautifully decorated old movie house, where she\u2019d lost herself in the gray-and-black images on screen.</p><p>That was how she felt right now: A colorless character walking through an unfamiliar gray world. The sounds of the city felt muted and far away; all she could really hear was the thudding, even beat of her heart.</p><p>How could something like this happen to her?</p><p>Outside the hospital, the real world came at her hard. Sirens and horns and screeching brakes. She fought the urge to cover her ears.</p><p>Meghann helped her into the car. The blessed silence made her sigh.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Meghann asked, and Claire had the impression that her sister had asked this question more than once. Her voice was spiked and anxious.</p><p>She looked at Meg. \u201cDo I have cancer? Is that what a tumor is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the hell you have. Certainly those dipshit doctors don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the shadow on that X ray, Meg? It was huge.\u201d Claire felt tired suddenly. She wanted to close her eyes and sleep. Maybe in the morning things would look different. Maybe she\u2019d find out it was all a mistake.</p><p>Meghann grabbed her, shook her hard. \u201cListen to me, damn it. You need to be tough now. No getting by, no giving up. This isn\u2019t like cosmetology school or college, you can\u2019t take the easy road and walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a brain tumor, and you throw quitting college at me. You\u2019re amazing.\u201d Claire wanted to be angry, but her emotions felt distant. It was hard to think. \u201cI don\u2019t even feel sick. Everybody gets headaches, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll start getting second opinions. First we\u2019ll go to Johns Hopkins. Then we\u2019ll try Sloan-Kettering in New York. There\u2019s got to be a surgeon who has some balls.\u201d Meghann\u2019s eyes welled up, her voice broke.</p><p>Somehow that frightened Claire even more, seeing Meg crack. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she said automatically; comforting others was easier than thinking. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. We just need to keep positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith. Yes,\u201d Meghann said after a long pause. \u201cYou hold on to the faith and I\u2019ll start finding out everything there is to know about your condition. That way we\u2019ll have all the bases covered. God and science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean be a team?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomeone has to be there for you through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . you?\u201d</p><p>The whole of their childhood was between them suddenly, all the good times and, more important, the bad.</p><p>Claire stared at her sister. \u201cIf you start this thing with me, you have to stick around if things get tough.\u201d</p> <p>Meg glanced out the window at a passing motorist. \u201cYou can count on me.\u201d</p><p>Claire touched her sister\u2019s chin, made her turn to make eye contact. \u201cLook at me when you say that.\u201d</p><p>Meg looked at her. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must be near death if I agree to this. God help me.\u201d Claire frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should we say anything until we know for sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll just worry Dad and make Bobby come home.\u201d She paused, swallowed hard. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about telling Ali.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell everyone I\u2019m taking you to a spa for a week. Will they believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby will. And Ali. Dad . . . I don\u2019t know. Maybe if I tell him we need time together. He\u2019s wanted us to reconcile for years. Yeah. He\u2019d buy that.\u201d</p><p>Joe had read once about a species of frog that lived on the Serengeti Plain in Africa. These frogs, it seemed, laid their eggs on muddy riverbanks in the monsoon season when the earth was black and oozing with moisture. But the wet season turned dry in time, and on the Serengeti a drought could go on and on. The eggs could lay trapped in the arid, hard-packed ground for years. Amazingly, when the rains finally returned, newborn frogs would come bubbling up through the mud and go in search of mates, to begin the cycle of life again.</p><p>Impossible, he\u2019d thought at the time, for life to adapt to such conditions.</p><p>And yet, he felt a little like that now. The meeting with Diana\u2019s parents had released something in him. Not the guilt, or not all of it, certainly, but their forgiveness, their understanding, had eased his burdens. For the first time since his wife\u2019s death, he could stand straight again. He could believe that there was a way out for him. Not medicine. He could never go through that again, never watch death up close. But something . . .</p> <p>And there was Meghann. To his disbelief, she\u2019d called. Asked him on a date. His first real date with a woman in more than fifteen years.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure even how to prepare for it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t like Diana. There was no softness in Meghann. No single moment with her promised anything\u2014least of all another moment. Even when they were at their most intimate, when he was inside of her, she sometimes turned her face away from him.</p><p>He knew it would be smart to forget her and the desires she\u2019d rekindled. Smart, but impossible. That would be like expecting those frogs to feel the sweet rainwater and stay hidden in the safety of their riverbank. Thousands of years of evolution had honed certain instincts to the point where they couldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><p>Meghann, perhaps even more so than the Roloffs\u2019 forgiveness, had brought Joe back to life. He couldn\u2019t turn away from her now.</p><p>It was because of her that he dared\u2014at last\u2014to go to town. On his lunch break, he strode down Main Street, head down, face partially obscured by a baseball cap. He walked past the two old men sitting outside the Loose Screw Hardware Shop, past a woman dragging two small children out of the ice-cream store. He was aware of people pointing at him and whispering. He kept moving.</p><p>Finally, he ducked into the old barber shop and climbed up into the empty chair. \u201cI could use a haircut,\u201d he said, not making eye contact with Frank Hill, who\u2019d first cut Joe\u2019s hair for the fourth-grade class photo.</p><p>\u201cYou sure could.\u201d Frank finished sweeping the floor, then grabbed a comb and some scissors. After pinning a bib in place, he started combing Joe\u2019s hair. \u201cHead up.\u201d</p> <p>Joe slowly lifted his head. Across the room a mirror held his reflection. He saw the imprint of the last few years. Sadness and guilt had left their mark in the lines around his eyes and the silver in his hair. He sat still for the next thirty minutes, his stomach clenched, his hands fisted, waiting for Frank to recognize him.</p><p>When it was over and he\u2019d paid Frank for the haircut, he headed for the door. He\u2019d just opened it when Frank said, \u201cYou come on back and see me anytime, Joe. You still have friends in this town.\u201d</p><p>That welcome gave Joe the courage to walk down to Swain\u2019s Mercantile, where he bought new clothes. Several old acquaintances smiled at him.</p><p>He made it back to the garage by 1:00 and worked for the rest of the day.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about the tenth time you\u2019ve looked at that clock in the past half an hour,\u201d Smitty said at 4:30. He was at the workbench, putting together a skateboard for his grandson\u2019s birthday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve . . . uh . . . got someplace to be,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Smitty reached for a wrench. \u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>Joe slammed the truck\u2019s hood down. \u201cI thought maybe I\u2019d leave a couple of minutes early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t hurt my feelings none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Joe looked down at his hands; they were black with grease. He couldn\u2019t see touching Meghann with these hands, though the grease under his fingernails certainly hadn\u2019t bothered her in the past. It was one of the things he liked about her. The women he\u2019d known in his previous life looked down on men like the one he\u2019d become.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha got going on\u2014if you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d Smitty asked, moving toward him.</p><p>\u201cA friend is coming over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis friend drive a Porsche?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Smitty smiled. \u201cMaybe you want to borrow the barbecue. Cut a few flowers from Helga\u2019s garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Joe, you just do. Open your mouth and say please. That\u2019s part of being neighbors and coworkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelga made a cheesecake last night. I\u2019ll bet she has a few extra pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend is bringing dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Sort of a potluck, huh? That isn\u2019t how we did it in my day. \u2019Course in my day, us men never cooked a thing.\u201d He winked. \u201cNot on the stove, anyway. Have a nice night, Joe.\u201d Humming a jaunty tune, he headed back to the workbench.</p><p>Joe shoved the oily rag in his back pocket and left the shop. On his way to his cabin, he stopped by Smitty\u2019s house, talked to Helga for a few minutes, and left carrying a small hibachi. He set up the barbecue on the front porch, filling the black hole with briquettes that he\u2019d bought that morning at Swain\u2019s.</p><p>Inside the house, he looked around, making a mental list of things to be done.</p><p>Oil, wrap, and stab the potatoes.</p><p>Shuck the corn.</p><p>Season the steaks.</p><p>Arrange the flowers in the water pitcher.</p><p>Set the table.</p><p>He looked at the clock.</p><p>She\u2019d be there in ninety minutes.</p><p>He showered and shaved, then dressed in his new clothes and headed for the kitchen.</p><p>For the next hour, he moved from one chore to the next, until the potatoes were in the oven, the corn was on the stove, the flowers were on the table, and the candles were lit.</p><p>Finally, everything was ready. He poured himself a glass of red wine and went into the living room to wait for her.</p><p>He sat down on the sofa and stretched out his legs.</p><p>From her place on the mantel, Diana smiled down at him.</p><p>He felt a flash of guilt, as if he\u2019d done something wrong. That was stupid; he wasn\u2019t being unfaithful.</p><p>Still . . .</p><p>He set his glass down on the coffee table and went to her. \u201cHey, Di,\u201d he whispered, reaching for the photograph. This was one of his favorites, taken on New Year\u2019s Eve at Whistler Mountain. She wore a white fur hat and a silvery parka. She looked impossibly young and beautiful.</p><p>For three years, he\u2019d poured his heart out to her, told her everything; suddenly he couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say. Behind him, candles flickered on the table set for two.</p><p>He touched the photo. The glass felt cold and slick. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Diana would always be his first\u2014maybe his best\u2014love.</p><p>But he had to try again.</p><p>He collected the photographs, one by one, leaving a single framed picture on the end table. Just one. All the rest, he took into the bedroom and carefully put away. Later, he\u2019d return a few of them to his sister\u2019s house.</p><p>When he went back into the living room and sat down, he smiled, thinking of Meghann. Anticipating the evening.</p><p>By 9:30, his smile had faded.</p><p>He sat alone on the couch, half drunk now with an empty bottle of wine beside him. The potatoes had long ago cooked down to nothing and the candles had burned themselves out. The front door stood open, welcoming, but the street in front was empty.</p><p>At midnight, he went to bed alone.</p><p>In the past nine days, Meghann and Claire had seen several specialists. It was amazing how fast doctors would see you if you had a brain tumor and plenty of money. Neurologists. Neurosurgeons. Neuro-oncologists. Radiologists. They went from Johns Hopkins to Sloan-Kettering to Scripps. When they weren\u2019t on airplanes, they were in hospital waiting rooms or doctors\u2019 offices. They learned dozens of frightening new words. Glioblastoma. Anaplastic astrocytoma. Craniotomy. Some of the doctors were caring and compassionate; more were cold and distant and too busy to talk for long. They outlined treatment models that were all depressingly alike and stacked them on statistics that offered little hope.</p><p>They each said the same thing: inoperable. It didn\u2019t matter if Claire\u2019s tumor was malignant or benign; either way it could be deadly. Most of the specialists believed Claire\u2019s tumor to be a glioblastoma multiforme. A kind they called the terminator. Ha-ha.</p><p>Each time they left a city, Meghann pinned her hopes on the next destination.</p><p>Until a neurologist at Scripps took her aside. \u201cLook,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cyou\u2019re using up valuable time. Radiation is your sister\u2019s best hope right now. Twenty-five percent of brain tumors respond positively to the treatment. If it shrinks enough, perhaps it will be operable. Take her home. Stop fighting the diagnosis and start fighting the tumor.\u201d</p><p>Claire had agreed, and so they\u2019d gone home. The next day, Meghann had taken her sister to Swedish Hospital, where yet another neuro-oncologist had said the same thing, his opinion bolstered by yet another radiologist. They\u2019d agreed to begin radiation treatment the next day.</p><p>Once a day for four weeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to stay here for the treatments,\u201d Claire said as she sat on the cold stone fireplace in Meghann\u2019s condo. \u201cHayden\u2019s too far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll call Julie and take some more time off of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. I can take the bus to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to dignify that with an answer. Even I am not that big a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked out the window. \u201cA friend of mine went through chemo and radiation. . . .\u201d She stared at the sparkling city, but all she really saw was Diana wasting away, losing her soul along with her hair. In the end, all those treatments hadn\u2019t helped at all. \u201cI don\u2019t want Ali to see me like that. She can stay with Dad. We\u2019ll visit every weekend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll rent a car for Bobby.

He\u2019ll come home, and I couldn\u2019t stand that.\u201d Claire looked at her. \u201cHe\u2019s waited his whole life for this break. I don\u2019t want to ruin it for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut if he loves you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does love me,\u201d she answered fiercely. \u201cThat\u2019s the point. And I love him. I want him to have his chance. Besides, there\u2019s nothing he can do but hold my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the point of love was holding each other up through the hard times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? It sounds to me like you\u2019re afraid he won\u2019t want to come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Meghann went to her sister then, sat down beside her. \u201cI know you\u2019re scared, Claire. And I know Mama and I left you a long time ago. I know . . . we hurt you. But you have to give Bobby the chance to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy shrink says everything is about our past, and I\u2019m beginning to agree with her. The point is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not tell me the point of my own life. Please.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cI\u2019m the one who has a tumor. Me. You don\u2019t get to organize or critique my choices, okay? I love Bobby and I am not going to ask him to sacrifice everything for me.\u201d Claire stood up. \u201cWe better get going. I need to tell Dad what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Mama?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hear her say she\u2019s too busy picking out sofa fabrics to visit her sick daughter? No, thanks. I\u2019ll call her if I get worse. You know how she hates unnecessary scenes. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, Meg turned onto River Road and they were there. Late-afternoon sunlight drizzled down the yellow clapboard sides, caught the blooming pink roses and turned them orange. The garden was a riot of color. A small bicycle with training wheels lay on its side in the overgrown grass.</p><p>Claire whispered, \u201cOh, man . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Meg said. \u201cRadiation can save you. Just like we talked about. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s smile was wobbly. \u201cI need to do this alone.\u201d</p><p>Meg understood. This was Claire\u2019s family, not hers. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>Claire got out of the car and walked haltingly up the path. Meg fell in step beside her, offering a solid arm for support.</p><p>At the front door, Claire paused, drew in a deep breath. \u201cI can do this. Mommy\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the doctors are going to make her better.\u201d</p><p>She looked helplessly at Meghann. \u201cHow do I promise that? What if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about this, Claire. You promise it. We\u2019ll worry about what if later.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Forcing a smile, she opened the door.</p><p>Sam sat on the sofa, wearing a pair of faded overalls and a smile. \u201cHey, you two, you\u2019re late. How was the spa week?\u201d Halfway through the sentence, his smile faded. He looked to Claire, then to Meghann. Slowly, he got to his feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Alison was on the floor, playing with a Fisher-Price barnyard set. \u201cMommy!\u201d she said, scrambling to her feet and running for them.</p><p>Claire dropped to her knees and scooped Alison into her arms.</p><p>Meghann saw the way her sister was trembling, and she longed to reach out to her, to hold her as she had when they were kids. She felt a fresh surge of rage. How could this happen to Claire? How could her sister possibly look into her daughter\u2019s eyes and say I\u2019m sick without breaking like finely spun sugar?</p><p>\u201cMommy,\u201d Alison said at last, \u201cyou\u2019re squishing me.\u201d She wiggled out of her mother\u2019s arms. \u201cDid you bring me home a present? Can we all go to Hawaii for Christmas? Grandpa says\u2014\u201d</p><p>Claire stood up. She glanced nervously back at Meghann. \u201cPick me up at six, okay?\u201d Then, smiling, Claire faced her father and daughter. \u201cI need to talk to you two.\u201d</p><p>Meghann had never seen such bravery.</p><p>I need to do this alone.</p><p>She backed out of the door, ran for the safety of her car, and drove away.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even know where she was going until she was there.</p><p>The cabin looked dark, unoccupied.</p><p>She parked out front and killed the engine. Leaving her purse in the car, she headed across the street and walked up to the front door.</p><p>She knocked.</p><p>He opened the door. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>That was when she remembered their date. Last Friday. She was supposed to bring the wine and dessert. It felt like decades ago. She looked past him, saw a dying bouquet of flowers on the coffee table, and hoped he hadn\u2019t bought them for their date. But of course he had. How long had he waited, she wondered, before he ate his dinner alone? \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me one good reason not to slam the door in your face.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, feeling so fragile she could barely breathe. \u201cMy sister has a brain tumor.\u201d</p><p>His expression changed slowly. A look came into his eyes, a kind of harrowing understanding that made her wonder at the dark roads that had traversed his life. \u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>He opened his arms and she walked into his embrace. For the first time, she let herself really cry.</p><p>Joe stood on the porch, staring out at the falling night. At the park across the street, a baseball game was being played. An occasional roar of the crowd erupted through the silence. Otherwise, there was only the sound of a cool breeze rustling the honeysuckle leaves.</p><p>It had been better, he now understood, to be angry at Meghann, to write her off for standing him up. When she stepped into his arms and looked up at him with tears in her eyes, he\u2019d wanted desperately to help her.</p><p>My sister has a brain tumor.</p><p>He closed his eyes, not wanting to remember, not wanting to feel the way he did.</p><p>He\u2019d held Meghann for almost an hour. She\u2019d cried until there were no tears left inside her, and then she\u2019d fallen into a troubled sleep. He imagined that it was her first sleep in days.</p><p>He knew. After a diagnosis like that, sleep either came to a person too much or not at all.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t spoken of anything that mattered. He\u2019d simply stroked her hair and kissed her forehead and let her cry in his arms.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think of it without shame.</p><p>Behind him, the screen door screeched open and banged shut. He stiffened, unable to turn around and face her. When he did, he saw that she was embarrassed.</p><p>Her cheeks were pink, and that gorgeous hair of hers was a fuzzy mess. She tried to smile, and the attempt tore at him. \u201cI\u2019ll put you in for a Purple Heart.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to take her in his arms again, but he didn\u2019t dare. Things were different between them now, though she didn\u2019t know it. Hospitals. Tumors. Death and dying and disease.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be a part of all that again. He had only just begun to survive his last round of it. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not. It doesn\u2019t help much, though.\u201d She moved toward him; he wondered if she knew that she was wringing her hands.</p><p>He got the sense that the time in his arms had both soothed and upset her. As if maybe she hated to admit a need. He\u2019d been alone long enough to understand.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank you for . . . I don\u2019t know. Being there. I shouldn\u2019t have busted in on you.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was waiting for an argument, waiting for him to say I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.</p><p>At his silence, she stepped back, frowning. \u201cToo much too soon, I guess. I completely understand. I hate needy people, too. Well. I better go. Claire starts radiation tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>She paused, turned back toward him. \u201cSwedish Hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get second opinions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? We got opinions from the best people in the country. They didn\u2019t agree on everything, but inoperable was a favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a guy. A neurosurgeon at UCLA. Stu Weissman. He\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Meghann was watching him. \u201cThey\u2019re all good. And they all agree. How do you know Weissman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to school with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollege?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised. Just because I live like this now doesn\u2019t mean I always did. I have a degree in American lit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know nothing about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s better that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally I\u2019d have a funny comeback to that. But I\u2019m a little slow today. Having a sister with a brain tumor will do that to a girl. Pretend I was witty.\u201d Her voice cracked a little. She turned and walked away.</p><p>With every step she took, he wanted to go after her, apologize and tell her the truth, who he was and what he\u2019d been through. Then, perhaps, she\u2019d understand why there were places he couldn\u2019t go. But he didn\u2019t move.</p><p>When he went back inside the house, he saw the last remaining picture of Diana staring at him from the mantel. For the first time he noticed the accusing glint in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>Alison listened carefully to Claire\u2019s explanation of a golf-ball-size \u201cowie\u201d in her brain.</p><p>\u201cA golf ball is little,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>Claire nodded, smiling. \u201cYes. Yes it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a special gun is gonna shoot magic rays at it until it disappears? Like rubbing Aladdin\u2019s lamp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you hafta live with Aunt Meg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long drive to the hospital. I can\u2019t go back and forth every day.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Ali said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Then she got to her feet and ran upstairs. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, Mommy!\u201d she yelled down.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t looked at me,\u201d Dad said when Ali was gone.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He got up and crossed the room, then sat down beside her. She felt the comforting, familiar heat of him as he put an arm around her, pulled her close. She rested her head on the hard ledge of his shoulder. She felt a splash of tears on her face and knew he was crying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d drive you back and forth, you know,\u201d he said softly, and she loved him for it. But she didn\u2019t want to grow weak in front of him. She and Meghann had read about radiation; when it was focused on the brain it could really make a person sick. It would take everything she had to stay strong through the treatments. She couldn\u2019t come home every night and see herself through her dad\u2019s eyes. \u201cI know that. You\u2019ve always been there for me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily, wiping his eyes. \u201cHave you told Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. As soon as he\u2019s finished in Nashville\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked at him, confused by the sudden harshness of his voice. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know your Mama was pregnant, did I ever tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left one night to run to the store and when I got back, she\u2019d left me. I tried to get ahold of her, but you know Ellie, when she\u2019s gone, she\u2019s gone. I went back to my job at the paper plant and tried to forget her. It took a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Claire put her hand on his. \u201cI know all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know all of it. When Meg called me to come get you, I went from alone in the world to father of a nine-year-old in one phone call. I hated Ellie then like you can\u2019t believe. It took years before I stopped hating her for denying me your childhood. All I could think about was what I\u2019d missed\u2014your birth, your first words, your first steps. I never got to hold all of you in my arms, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make decisions for other people, Claire, especially not for people who love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can sacrifice for them. Isn\u2019t that what love is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou see it as sacrifice? What if he sees it as selfishness? If . . . the worst happens, you\u2019ve denied him the one thing that matters. Time.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked at him. \u201cI can\u2019t tell him, Dad. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could kill her for what she did to you and Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Mama dumping us,\u201d Claire said, believing it. \u201cThis is about how much I love Bobby. I won\u2019t make him give up his big break for me.\u201d</p><p>Before Dad could say anything else, Alison bounded into the room, dragging her worn, stained baby blanket, the one she\u2019d slept with every single night of her life. \u201cHere, Mommy,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can have my wubbie till you get all better.\u201d</p><p>Claire took the grayed pink blanket in her hands. She couldn\u2019t help herself; she held it to her face and smelled the little-girl sweetness of it. \u201cThanks, Ali,\u201d she said in a throaty voice.</p> <p>Alison crawled up into her arms and hugged her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mommy. Don\u2019t cry. I\u2019m a big girl. I can sleep without my wubbie.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>MEGHANN SAT IN THE WAITING ROOM, TRYING TO READ THE newest issue ofPeoplemagazine. It was the \u201cBest- and Worst-Dressed\u201d issue. Honest to God, she couldn\u2019t tell the difference. Finally, she tossed the magazine on the cheap wooden table beside her. The wall clock ticked past another minute.</p><p>She went up to the desk again. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than an hour. Are you sure everything is okay with my sister? Claire\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustin, I know. I spoke with radiology five minutes ago. She\u2019s almost finished.\u201d</p><p>Meghann refrained from pointing out that she\u2019d received the same answer fifteen minutes earlier. Instead, she sighed heavily and went back to her seat. The only magazine left to read was Field &amp; Stream. She ignored it.</p><p>Finally, Claire came out.</p><p>Meghann rose slowly. On the right side of her sister\u2019s head was a small area that had been shaved. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p> <p>Claire touched her bald spot, feeling it. \u201cThey tattooed me. I feel like Damien\u2014that kid from The Omen.\u201d</p><p>Meg looked at the tiny black dots on the pale, shaved shin. \u201cI could fix your hair so you couldn\u2019t even see the . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBald spot? That would be great.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other for a minute or so. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go, then,\u201d Meghann finally said.</p><p>They walked through the hospital and out to the parking garage.</p><p>On the short drive home, Meghann kept trying to think of what to say. She had to be careful from now on, had to say the right thing. Whatever that was.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hard to keep still, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . yeah. It would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI closed my eyes and imagined the rays were sunlight. Healing me. Like that article you gave me.\u201d</p><p>Meg had given her sister a stack of literature on positive thinking and visualization. She hadn\u2019t known if Claire had read them until just now. \u201cI\u2019m glad it helped. The lady at Fred Hutch is supposed to be sending me another box of stuff.\u201d</p><p>Claire leaned back in her seat and looked out the window.</p><p>From this side, she looked perfectly normal. Meghann wished she could say something that mattered; so much was unsaid between them.</p><p>With a sigh, she pulled into the underground lot and parked in her space.</p><p>Still silent, they went upstairs. In the condo, Meghann turned to Claire. She stared at the bald spot for a second too long. \u201cDo you want something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Claire touched her briefly, her fingers were icy cold. \u201cThanks for coming with me today. It helped not to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes met. Once again, Meghann felt the weight of their distance.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll lie down. I didn\u2019t sleep well last night.\u201d</p><p>So they\u2019d both been awake, staring at their separate ceilings from their separate rooms. Meghann wished she\u2019d gone to Claire last night, sat on her bed, and talked about the things that mattered. \u201cMe, either.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded. She waited a second longer, then turned and headed for the bedroom.</p><p>Meghann watched the door slowly close between them. She stood there, listening to her sister\u2019s shuffling footsteps beyond the door. She wondered if Claire was moving slower in there, if fear clouded her eyes. Or if she was staring at that small, tattooed pink patch of skin in the mirror. Did Claire\u2019s brave front crumble in the privacy of that room?</p><p>Meg prayed not, as she went to the condo\u2019s third bedroom, which was set up as an in-home office. Once, files and briefs and depositions had cluttered the glass desk. Now it was buried beneath medical books, memoirs, JAMA articles, and clinical trials literature. Every day, boxes from Barnes &amp; Noble.com and Amazon arrived.</p><p>Meghann sat down at her desk. Her current reading material was a book on coping with cancer. It lay open to a chapter called \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Talking Just When You Need to Start.\u201d</p><p>She read: This time of tragedy can be one of growth and opportunity, too. Not only for the patient, but for the family as well. It can be a time that draws you and your loved ones closer.</p><p>Meghann closed the book and reached for a JAMA article about the potential benefits of tamoxifen to shrink tumors.</p><p>She opened a yellow legal pad and began to take notes. She worked furiously, writing, writing. Hours later, when she looked up, Claire was standing in the doorway, smiling at her. \u201cWhy do I think you\u2019re planning to do the surgery yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know more about your condition than that first idiot we saw.\u201d</p><p>Claire came into the room, carefully stepping over the empty Amazon boxes and the magazines that had been discarded. She stared down at the filled legal pads and inkless pens. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re the best lawyer in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI research well. I\u2019m really starting to understand your condition. I\u2019ve made you a kind of abstract\u2014a synopsis of everything I\u2019ve read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I better read it for myself, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of it\u2019s . . . hard.\u201d</p><p>Claire reached for the standing file on the left side of the desk. In it was a manila file with the word Hope emblazoned in red ink on the notched label. She picked it up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Meg said. \u201cI\u2019ve just started.\u201d</p><p>Claire opened the file. It was empty. She looked down at Meghann.</p><p>\u201cThis goes in it,\u201d Meg said quickly, ripping several pages out of her notebook. \u201cTamoxifen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be people who beat brain tumors,\u201d Meghann said fiercely. \u201cI\u2019ll find every damn one and put their stories in there. That\u2019s what the file is for.\u201d</p><p>Claire leaned over, picked up a blank piece of paper. On it, she wrote her name, then she placed the paper in the file and returned the file to its stand.</p><p>Meg stared up at her sister in awe. \u201cYou\u2019re really something. You know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe Sullivan girls are tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had to be.\u201d</p><p>Meg smiled. For the first time all day, she felt as if she could draw an easy breath. \u201cYou want to watch a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything except Love Story.\u201d</p><p>Meg started to rise.</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWho could that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act like no one ever visits you.\u201d</p><p>Meghann sidled past Claire and walked to the door. By the time she got there, the bell had rung another eight times. \u201cDamn good doorman,\u201d she muttered, opening the door.</p><p>Gina, Charlotte, and Karen stood clustered together.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s our girl?\u201d Karen cried out.</p><p>Claire appeared and the screaming began. Karen and Charlotte surged forward, mumbling hello to Meghann, then enfolding Claire in their arms.</p><p>\u201cSam called us,\u201d Gina said when she and Meghann were alone in the hallway. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess. The radiation went well, I think. She goes every day for four weeks.\u201d At Gina\u2019s frightened look, Meghann added, \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to worry you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. She can\u2019t be alone for a thing like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Meghann answered, stung.</p><p>Gina squeezed her arm. \u201cShe\u2019ll need all of us.\u201d</p><p>Meghann nodded. Then she and Gina looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou call me. Whenever,\u201d Gina said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>After that, Gina eased past Meg and went into the living room, saying loudly. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got spas-in-a-bucket, gooey popcorn balls, hilarious movies, and, of course, games. What should we do first?\u201d</p><p>Meghann watched the four best friends come together; they were all talking at once. She didn\u2019t move toward them, and they didn\u2019t call out to her.</p><p>Finally, she went back to her office and shut the door. As she sat there, reading the latest literature on chemotherapy and the blood-brain barrier, she heard the high, clear sound of her sister\u2019s laughter.</p><p>She picked up the phone and called Elizabeth.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Meg said softly when her friend answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Elizabeth asked. \u201cYou\u2019re too quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d was all she could say before the tears came.</p><p>Joe sat sprawled across the sofa, drinking a beer. His third. Mostly, he was trying not to think.</p><p>The ephemeral chance for redemption\u2014the one that only last week had glittered in front of him like a desert oasis beside a long, hot highway\u2014had vanished. He should have known it was a mirage.</p><p>There would be no starting over. He didn\u2019t have the guts for it. He\u2019d thought, hoped, that with Meg he\u2019d be stronger.</p><p>\u201cMeg,\u201d he said her name softly, closed his eyes. He said a prayer for her and her sister. It was all he could really do now.</p><p>Meg.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t clear out of his mind. He kept thinking of her, remembering, wanting. It was what had sent him reaching for the bottles of beer.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he missed her, precisely. Hell, he didn\u2019t even know her last name. Didn\u2019t know where she lived or what she did in her spare time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What he grieved for was the idea of her. For those few moments\u2014unexpected and sweet\u2014he\u2019d dared to step onto old roads. He\u2019d let himself want someone, let himself believe in a new future.</p><p>He took a long drink. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>In the kitchen, the phone rang. He got slowly to his feet and started that way. It was probably Gina, calling to make sure he was okay. He had no idea what he\u2019d tell her.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Gina. It was Henry Roloff, sounding hurried. \u201cJoe? Could you meet me for a cup of coffee? Say in an hour?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the Whitewater Diner? Three o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>Joe hoped he could walk straight. \u201cSure.\u201d He hung up the phone and headed for the shower.</p><p>An hour later he was dressed in his new clothes and walking down Main Street. He still felt a faint buzz from the beer, but that was probably a good thing. Already he could feel the way people were staring after him, whispering about him.</p><p>It took an act of will to keep smiling as the hostess\u2014a woman he didn\u2019t know, thank God\u2014showed him to a booth.</p> <p>Henry was already there. \u201cHey, Joe. Thanks for coming so quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I was busy. It\u2019s Saturday. The garage is closed.\u201d He slid into the booth.</p><p>Henry talked for a few minutes about Tina\u2019s garden and the vacation they\u2019d taken to St. Croix last winter, but Joe knew it was all leading up to something. He found himself tensing up, straightening.</p><p>Finally, he couldn\u2019t take the suspense. \u201cWhat is it, Henry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Henry stopped midsentence and looked up. \u201cI want to ask a favor of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything for you, Henry. You know that. What do you need?\u201d</p> <p>Henry reached down under the table and brought out a big manila envelope.</p><p>Joe knew what it was. He leaned back, put his hands out as if to ward off a blow. \u201cAnything but that, Henry,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to look at this. The patient is\u2014\u201d Henry\u2019s beeper went off. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d Henry pulled out his cell phone and punched in a number.</p><p>Joe stared down at the envelope. Someone\u2019s medical charts. A record of pain and suffering.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go back to that world. No way. When a man had lost his faith and his confidence as profoundly as Joe had, there was no going back. Besides, he couldn\u2019t practice medicine anymore. He\u2019d let his license lapse.</p><p>He got to his feet. \u201cSorry, Henry,\u201d he said, interrupting Henry\u2019s phone call. \u201cMy consulting days are over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Henry said, raising a hand.</p><p>Joe backed away from the table, then turned and walked out of the restaurant.</p> <p>Though the radiation treatments themselves lasted only a few minutes a day, they monopolized Claire\u2019s life. By the fourth day, she was tired and nauseated. But the side effects weren\u2019t half as bad as the phone calls.</p><p>Every day, she called home at precisely noon. Ali always answered on the first ring and asked if the owie was all better yet, then Dad got on the phone and asked the same question in a different way. The strength it took to pretend was already waning.</p><p>Meghann stood beside her for every call. She hardly went to the office anymore. Maybe three hours a day, tops. The rest of the time, she spent huddled over books and articles, or glued to the Internet. She attacked the issue of a tumor the way she\u2019d once gone after deadbeat dads.</p><p>Claire appreciated it; she read everything that Meghann handed her. She\u2019d even consented to drink the \u201cBTC\u201d\u2014brain tumor cocktail\u2014Meghann had devised based on her research. It contained all kinds of vitamins and minerals.</p><p>They talked daily about treatments and prognoses and trials. What they didn\u2019t talk about was the future. Claire couldn\u2019t find the courage to say, I\u2019m afraid, and Meg never asked the question.</p><p>The only time Meg seemed willing to disappear into the woodwork was at 2:00. The designated Bobby Phone Call time.</p><p>Now, Claire was alone in the living room. In the kitchen, the 2:00 buzzer was beeping. As usual, Meg had heard it and made an excuse to leave the room.</p><p>Claire picked up the phone and dialed Bobby\u2019s new cell phone number.</p><p>He picked up on the first ring. \u201cHey, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re two minutes late.\u201d Bobby\u2019s voice poured through her cold, cold body, warming her.</p><p>She leaned back into the sofa\u2019s downy cushions. \u201cTell me about your day.\u201d She\u2019d found that it was easier to listen than to talk. At first, she\u2019d been able to laugh at his stories and make up pretty lies. Lately, though, her mind was a little foggy, and the exhaustion was almost unbearable. She wondered how long it would be before he noticed that she spent their conversations listening to him, or that her voice almost always broke when she said, I love you.</p><p>\u201cI met George Strait today. Can you believe it? He passed on a song\u2014one called \u201cDark Country Corners\u201d\u2014and then mentioned that it\u2019d be a good match with my voice. I listened to the song and it was great.\u201d He started to sing to her.</p><p>A sob caught in her throat. She had to stop him before she burst into tears. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful. Top 10 for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Everyone here is fine. Meg and I have been spending a lot of time together; you\u2019d be surprised. And Ali and Sam send their love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlap \u2019em right back with mine. I miss you, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too. But it\u2019s only a few more weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent thinks we should have all the songs chosen by next week. Then it\u2019s into the studio. Do you think you could come down for that? I\u2019d love to sing the songs to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, wondering what lie she\u2019d come up with when the time came. She was too exhausted to think of one now. \u201cAre you loving every minute down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I can love anything without you. But, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She was doing the right thing. She was. \u201cWell, babe, I\u2019ve got to run. Meg is taking me out to lunch. Then we\u2019re getting manicures at the Gene Juarez Spa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you got a manicure yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Claire winced. \u201cUh. Those were pedicures. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Claire. Is . . . is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>She felt the sting of tears again. \u201cEverything\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made us a picnic lunch,\u201d Meghann said the next morning after another treatment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very hungry,\u201d Claire answered.</p><p>\u201cI know that. I just thought . . .\u201d</p><p>Claire hauled up the will to think about someone else. Sadly, that was becoming difficult, too. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s a beautiful day.\u201d</p><p>Meghann led her to the car. Within minutes they were on the freeway. To their left, Lake Union sparkled in the sunlight. They passed the Gothic brick buildings of the University of Washington, then raced over the floating bridge.</p><p>Lake Washington was busy today. Boats zipped back and forth, hauling skiers in their wake.</p><p>On Mercer Island, Meghann exited the freeway and turned onto a narrow, tree-lined drive. At a beautiful, gray-shingled house, she parked. \u201cThis is my partner\u2019s house. She said we were welcome to spend the afternoon here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t fired you, with all the time you\u2019ve taken off lately.\u201d</p><p>Meghann helped Claire out of the car and down the grassy lawn to the silvery wooden dock that cut into the blue water. \u201cRemember Lake Winobee?\u201d she said, guiding Claire to the end of the dock, helping her sit down without falling.</p><p>\u201cThe summer I got that pink bathing suit?\u201d</p><p>Meghann set the picnic basket down, then sat beside her sister. They both dangled their feet over the edge. Water slapped against the pilings. Beside them, a varnished wooden sailboat called The Defense Rests bobbed easily from side to side, its lines screeching with each movement.</p><p>\u201cI stole that bikini,\u201d Meghann said. \u201cFrom Fred Meyer. When I got home, I was so scared I threw up. Mama didn\u2019t care; she just looked up from Variety and said, \u2018Sticky fingers will get a girl in trouble.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Claire turned to her sister, studying her profile. \u201cI waited for you to come back, you know. Dad always said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Claire-Bear, she\u2019s your sister, she\u2019ll be back.\u2019 I waited and waited. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Meghann sighed heavily, as if she\u2019d known this conversation couldn\u2019t be avoided anymore. \u201cRemember when Mama went down for the Starbase IV audition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t come back. I was used to her being gone for a day or two, but after about five days, I started to panic. There wasn\u2019t any money left. We were hungry. Then Social Services started sniffing around. I was scared they\u2019d put us in the system. So I called Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all this, Meg.\u201d</p><p>Meghann didn\u2019t seem to have heard her. \u201cHe said he\u2019d take us both in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t my father. I tried to fit in to Hayden; what a joke. I got in with a bad crowd and started screwing up. A therapist would call it acting out. Trying to get attention. Every time I looked at you and Sam together . . .\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI felt left out, I guess. You were all I really had, and then I didn\u2019t have you. One night I came home drunk and Sam exploded. He called me a piss-poor excuse for a big sister and told me to shape up or get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you got out. Where did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bummed around Seattle for a while, feeling sorry for myself. I slept in doorways and empty buildings, did things I\u2019m not proud of. It didn\u2019t take long to hit rock bottom. Then one day I remembered a teacher who\u2019d taken an interest in me, Mr. Earhart. He was the one who bumped me up a grade, back when we lived in Barstow. He convinced me that education was the way out of Mama\u2019s trailer-trash life. That\u2019s why I always got straight As. Anyway, I gave him a call\u2014thank God he was still at the same school. He arranged for me to graduate high school early and take the SAT, which I aced. Perfect score. The UW offered me a full scholarship. You know the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy genius sister,\u201d Claire said. For once, there was pride in her voice instead of bitterness.</p><p>\u201cI told myself it was the best thing for you, that you didn\u2019t need your big sister anymore. But . . . I knew how much I\u2019d hurt you. It was easier to keep my distance, I guess. I believed you\u2019d never forgive me. So I didn\u2019t give you the chance.\u201d Meg finally looked at her. She offered a small smile. \u201cI\u2019ll have to tell my shrink I finally got my money\u2019s worth. It cost me about ten thousand dollars to be able to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you did wrong was stay away,\u201d Claire said gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Claire looked out to the sparkling blue water. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done all this without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. You\u2019re the bravest person I ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so brave, believe me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meghann leaned back to open the picnic basket. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for just the right time to give you this.\u201d She withdrew a manila folder and handed it to Claire. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Meg. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Claire took the folder with a sigh. It was the one labeled Hope. She looked sharply at Meg, but didn\u2019t say anything. Her hands trembled as she opened the file.</p> <p>In it were almost a dozen personal accounts of people who had had glioblastoma multiforme tumors. Each of them had been given less than a year to live\u2014at least seven years ago.</p><p>Claire squeezed her eyes shut, but the tears came anyway. \u201cI needed this today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, then dared to look at her sister. \u201cI\u2019ve been so afraid.\u201d It felt good, finally admitting it.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Meg answered quietly. Then she leaned forward and took Claire in her arms.</p> <p>For the first time since childhood, Claire was held by her big sister. Meghann stroked her hair, the way she\u2019d done when Claire was young.</p><p>A handful of hair fell out at Meghann\u2019s touch, floated between them.</p><p>Claire drew back, saw the pile of her pretty blond hair in Meghann\u2019s hand. Strands drifted down to the water, where they looked like nothing at all. She stared down at the hair floating away on the current. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you it\u2019s been falling out. Every morning I wake up on a hairy pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should go home,\u201d Meg said finally.</p><p>\u201cI am tired.\u201d</p><p>Meghann helped Claire to her feet. Slowly they made their way back to the car. Claire\u2019s steps were shuffling and uncertain now, and she leaned heavily on Meg\u2019s arm.</p> <p>All the way home, Claire stared out the window.</p><p>Back in the condo, Meghann helped Claire change into her flannel pajamas and climb into bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just hair,\u201d Claire said as she leaned back against a pile of pillows.</p><p>Meghann set the Hope file on the nightstand. \u201cIt\u2019ll grow back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Claire sighed and closed her eyes.</p><p>Meghann backed out of the room. At the doorway, she stopped.</p><p>Her sister lay there, barely breathing it seemed, with her eyes closed. Strands of hair decorated her pillow. Very slowly, still not opening her eyes, Claire brought her hands up and started touching her wedding ring. Tears leaked down the sides of her face, leaving tiny gray splotches on the pillow.</p><p>And Meghann knew what she had to do.</p> <p>She closed the door and went to the phone. All of Claire\u2019s emergency numbers were on a notepad beside it. Including Bobby\u2019s.</p><p>Meghann dialed Bobby\u2019s number and waited impatiently for him to answer.</p><p>In the past twenty-four hours, Claire had lost almost half of her hair. The bare skin that showed through was an angry, scaly red. This morning, as she got ready for her appointment, she spent nearly thirty minutes wrapping a silk scarf around her head.</p><p>\u201cQuit fussing with it,\u201d Meghann said when they arrived at the Nuclear Medicine waiting room. \u201cYou look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like a Gypsy fortune-teller. And I don\u2019t know why you made me wear makeup. My skin is so red I look like Martha Phillips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the eighth grade. She fell asleep under a sunlamp. We called her Tomato Face for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids are so kind.\u201d</p><p>Claire left for her treatment and was back in the waiting room thirty minutes later. She didn\u2019t bother putting the scarf back on. Her scalp was tender.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out for coffee,\u201d she said when Meghann stood up to greet her.</p><p>\u201cCoffee makes you puke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t? Let\u2019s go anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go into the office today. I\u2019ve got a deposition scheduled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Claire followed Meghann down the hospital corridor, trying to keep up. Lately, she was so tired it was hard not to shuffle like an old woman. She practically fell asleep in the car.</p><p>At the condo door, Meghann paused, key in hand, and looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do what\u2019s right for you. What\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I screw up. I tend to think I know everything.\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled. \u201cAre you waiting for an argument?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to remember that. I\u2019m trying to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Meg. I\u2019ll remember. Now go to work. I don\u2019t want to miss Judge Judy. She reminds me of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d Meg looked at her a moment longer, then opened the condo door. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the longest farewell in history. Bye, Meg. Go to work.\u201d</p><p>Meghann nodded and walked away.</p><p>When Claire heard the ping of the elevator, she went into the condo, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Inside, the stereo was on. Dwight Yoakam\u2019s \u201cPocket of a Clown\u201d pumped through the speakers.</p><p>Claire turned the corner and there he was.</p><p>Bobby.</p><p>Her hand flew to her bald spot.</p><p>She ran to the bathroom, flipped open the toilet lid, and threw up.</p><p>He was behind her, holding what was left of her hair back, telling her it was okay. \u201cI\u2019m here now, Claire. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, holding back tears of humiliation one breath at a time.</p><p>He rubbed her back.</p><p>Finally, she went to the sink and brushed her teeth. When she turned to face him, she was trying to smile. \u201cWelcome to my nightmare.\u201d</p><p>He came toward her, and the love in his eyes made her want to weep. \u201cOur nightmare, Claire.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. She was afraid that if she opened her mouth, she\u2019d burst into tears, and she wanted to look strong for him.</p><p>\u201cYou had no right to keep this from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin everything. And I thought . . . I\u2019d get better. You\u2019d dreamed of singing for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dreamed of being a star, yeah. I like singing, but I love you. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d hide this from me. What if . . .\u201d</p><p>Claire caught her lip between her teeth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t trust me. Do you know how that feels?\u201d His voice was tight, not his voice at all.</p><p>\u201cI was just trying to love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if you even know what love is. I\u2019m in the hospital every day, honey, battling for my life, but don\u2019t you worry about it, just sing your stupid songs. What kind of man do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bobby. I just . . .\u201d She stared at him, shaking her head.</p><p>He grabbed her, pulled her toward him, and held her so tightly it made her gasp. \u201cI love you, Claire. I love you,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cWhen are you going to get that through your head?\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him, clung to him as if she might fall without him. \u201cI guess my tumor got in the way. But I get it now, Bobby. I get it.\u201d</p><p>Hours later, when Meghann returned to the condo, the lights were off. She tiptoed through the darkness.</p><p>When she reached the living room, a light clicked on.</p><p>Claire and Bobby lay together on the sofa, their bodies entwined. He was snoring gently.</p><p>\u201cI waited up for you,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Meghann tossed her briefcase on the chair. \u201cI had to call him, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know what he\u2019d do?\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked down at Bobby. \u201cHe was in the recording studio when I called. Actually recording a song. Honestly, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>Claire glanced down at her sleeping husband, then up at Meg. A look passed between the sisters; in it was the sad residue of their childhood. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said softly, \u201cneither did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hesitate for a second, Claire. Not a second. He said\u2014and I quote\u2014\u2018Fuck the song. I\u2019ll be there tomorrow.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the second time you\u2019ve called a man to come save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to be so loved.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s gaze was steady. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said, smiling at her sister. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>JOE WAS SITTING ON THE SOFA, STARING AT THE SMALL black-and-white television screen.</p><p>He was so caught up in the show, it was a moment before he noticed the footsteps outside.</p><p>He tensed, sat up.</p><p>A key rattled in the lock, then the door swung open. Gina stood in the opening, her fists on her hips. \u201cHey, big brother. Nice way you have of calling people.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cSmitty gave you a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the stack of beer cans and pizza boxes and smiled grimly. \u201cCome on. You\u2019re coming home with me. I have a roast in the oven and I rented Ruthless People. We are going to drink wine and laugh.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cI could use a laugh.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way she said it shamed him. He\u2019d forgotten about her troubles. He\u2019d been too busy swimming in the pool of his own. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, avoiding the question. \u201cSmitty told me to drag your sorry ass out of here\u2014his words. I intend to do just that.\u201d</p><p>He knew there was no point in fighting with her\u2014she had that look on her face\u2014and, truthfully, he didn\u2019t want to. He was tired of being alone. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He followed her out to her car; within minutes, they were in her bright, airy kitchen.</p><p>She handed him a glass of Merlot.</p><p>While she basted the roast and turned the potatoes, Joe wandered around the great room. In the corner, he found a sewing machine set up. A pile of bold, beautiful fabric lay heaped beside it. He picked up the garment she\u2019d made, ready to compliment her, when he saw what it was. There was no mistaking the slit back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hospital gown,\u201d Gina said, coming up behind him. \u201cI should have put that stuff away. I forgot. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He remembered the day Gina had come to his house, bearing pretty designer hospital gowns just like this one.</p><p>You shouldn\u2019t have to look like everyone else, she\u2019d said to Diana, who\u2019d wept at the gift.</p><p>Those gowns had meant so much to Diana. It didn\u2019t seem like a big deal\u2014just a change of fabric\u2014but it had brought back her smile. \u201cWho are they for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire. She\u2019s undergoing radiation right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d he said her name softly, feeling sick. Life was so damn unfair sometimes. \u201cShe just got married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because . . . well . . . I knew it would bring up memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s she getting the radiation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwedish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best place for her. Good.\u201d Radiation. He remembered all of it\u2014the sunburned-looking skin, the puffiness, the way Diana\u2019s hair started to fall out. In strands at first, then in handfuls.</p><p>He and Gina had spent their fair share of time in the cancer end zone. He couldn\u2019t imagine how Gina could handle it again.</p><p>\u201cClaire flew all around the country seeing the best doctors. I know she\u2019s going to get better.

I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He stared out the window at the backyard designed for children. Once, he and Diana had dreamed of bringing their babies here to play.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to go see Claire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said so quickly, he knew Gina understood. \u201cMy time in hospitals is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Gina said, \u201cnow let\u2019s go watch a funny movie.\u201d</p><p>He slipped an arm around his sister and pulled her in close. \u201cI could use a laugh.\u201d</p><p>Meghann sat in the chair that had once felt so comfortable and stared at Dr. Bloom.</p><p>\u201cIt was all bullshit,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cAll my appointments with you. They were just a way for a self-obsessed woman to vent about the mistakes she\u2019d made in her life. Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me that none of it mattered?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it does matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was sixteen years old when all that happened. Sixteen. None of it matters\u2014my fear, my guilt, her resentment. Who cares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it matter anymore?\u201d</p><p>Meghann closed her eyes, reaching for a bitterness that had moved on. All she felt was tired, lost. \u201cShe\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The word was a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, Harriet,\u201d Meghann finally admitted. \u201cWhat if . . . I can\u2019t do it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand by her bed and hold her hand and watch her die? I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll let her down again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Meghann. The only person you ever let down is yourself. You\u2019ll be there for Claire. You always have been.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t entirely true. She wished it were. She wanted to be the kind of person who could be depended upon.</p><p>\u201cIf I were ill, there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather have in my corner, Meghann. You\u2019re so busy swimming in old sorrows that you haven\u2019t bothered to come up for air. You\u2019ve made up with Claire, whether you two have said the words or not. You\u2019re her sister again. Forgive yourself and go forward.\u201d</p><p>Meghann let the advice sink in. Then, slowly, she smiled. It was true. This wasn\u2019t the time for fear and regret; she\u2019d spent too many years on that already. These were days that called for hope and, for once, she was going to be strong enough to believe in a happy ending for Claire. No running away from potential heartache. That was the mistake Meg had made in her marriage. She\u2019d feared a broken heart so keenly that she\u2019d never given the whole of her love to Eric.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Harriet,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI could have bought a Mercedes for what you charged me, but you\u2019ve helped.\u201d</p><p>Harriet smiled. It surprised Meg, made her realize that she\u2019d never seen her doctor smile before. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Meghann stood up. \u201cSo. I\u2019ll see you next week, same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She walked out of the office, went down the elevator, and emerged into the July sunlight.</p><p>Slinging her handbag over her shoulder, she headed for home.</p><p>She was almost there when she happened to look up. Across the street, the small park near the Public Market was a hive of activity. College-age kids playing hackey sack, tourists feeding the dive-bombing seagulls, shoppers taking a rest. She wasn\u2019t sure what had caught her eye and made her look.</p><p>Then she saw him, standing at the railing. His back was to her, but she recognized his faded jeans and denim shirt. He was probably the only man in downtown Seattle to wear a cowboy hat on a sunny day.</p><p>She crossed the street and walked up to him. \u201cHey, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cMeg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d Finally, he turned. His eyes were watery, red. \u201cShe threw up for almost an hour. Even when there was nothing left to vomit. Don\u2019t worry, I cleaned it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried,\u201d Meg said.</p><p>\u201cShe looks bad today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days are worse than others. I bet Nashville looks pretty good about now,\u201d she said, trying to lighten his mood.</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to be funny? My wife is puking and her hair is falling out. You think I\u2019m worried about my career?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She touched him. \u201cI\u2019ve always been as sensitive as a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I needed someone to yell at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always give you a reason, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but it was tired and worn. \u201cI\u2019m just . . . scared shitless, that\u2019s all. And I don\u2019t want her to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Meghann smiled up at him. Her sister was lucky to be loved by such a man. For no apparent reason, that made her think of Joe, of the day she\u2019d found him weeping over his divorce. Joe was the kind of man who knew how to love, too. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Bobby Jack Tom Dick. I was wrong about you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not half the bitch I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>Meghann slipped an arm around him. \u201cI\u2019m going to pretend that was a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s go make Claire smile.\u201d</p><p>The days passed slowly; each new morning found Claire a little more tired than the night before. She strove to keep a positive attitude but her health was deteriorating rapidly. She visualized rays of sunlight instead of radiation. She meditated for an hour a day, imagined herself in a beautiful forest or seated beside her beloved river. She ate the macrobiotic diet that Meghann swore would help heal her body.</p><p>The Bluesers came down often, separately and together, doing their best to keep Claire\u2019s spirits up. Meg\u2019s friend Elizabeth had even come for a few days, and the visit helped her sister immensely. The hardest times were weekends, when they went to Hayden; Claire tried to pretend that everything was okay for Ali.</p><p>In the evenings, though, it was just the three of them\u2014Claire, Meg, and Bobby\u2014in that too-quiet apartment. Mostly, they watched movies together. At first, when Bobby arrived, they\u2019d tried to spend the evening talking or playing cards, but that had proved difficult. Too many dangerous subjects. None of them could mention the future without flinching, without thinking, Will there be a Christmas together? A Thanksgiving? A next summer?? So, by tacit agreement, they\u2019d let the television become their nighttime soundtrack. Claire was grateful; it gave her several hours where she could sit quietly, without having to pretend.</p><p>Finally, the radiation ended.</p><p>The following morning Claire got up early. She dressed and showered and drank her coffee out on the deck overlooking the Sound. It amazed her that so many people were already up, going about their ordinary lives on this day that would define her future.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s the day,\u201d Meg said, stepping out onto the deck.</p><p>Claire forced a smile. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>God, how she\u2019d come to despise that question. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep last night?\u201d Meg asked, coming up beside her.</p><p>\u201cNo. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Meg slipped an arm around her, held her tightly.</p><p>Claire tensed, waiting for the pep talk, but her sister said nothing.</p><p>Behind them, the glass door opened. \u201cMorning, ladies.\u201d Bobby came up behind Claire, slid his arms around her, and kissed the back of her neck.</p><p>They stood there a minute longer, no one speaking, then they turned together and left the condo.</p><p>In no time, they were at Swedish Hospital. As they entered the Nuclear Medicine waiting room, Claire noticed the other patients who wore hats and scarves. When their gazes met, a sad understanding passed between them. They were members of a club you didn\u2019t want to join. Claire wished now that she hadn\u2019t bothered with the scarf. Baldness had a boldness to it that she wanted to embrace.</p><p>There was no waiting today, not on this day that would answer all the questions. She checked in and went right to the MRI. Within moments, she was pumped full of dye and stuck in the loud machine.</p><p>When she was finished, she returned to the waiting room and sat between Meghann and Bobby, who both reached out for her. She held their hands.</p><p>Finally, they called her name.</p><p>Claire rose.</p><p>Bobby steadied her. \u201cI\u2019m right here, babe.\u201d</p><p>The three of them began the long hallway-to-hallway walk, ending finally in Dr. Sussman\u2019s office. The plaque on the door read: Chief of Neurology. Dr. McGrail, the chief of radiology, was also there.</p><p>\u201cHello, Claire. Meghann,\u201d Dr. Sussman said. \u201cBobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Meghann demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe tumor responded to radiation. It\u2019s about twelve percent smaller,\u201d Dr. McGrail reported.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Meg said.</p><p>The doctors exchanged a look. Then Dr. Sussman went to the viewbox, switched it on, and there they were, the gray-and-white pictures of Claire\u2019s brain. And there was the stain. He finally turned to Claire. \u201cThe decrease has bought you some time. Unfortunately, the tumor is still inoperable. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>Claire sat down in the leather chair. She didn\u2019t think her legs would hold her up.</p><p>\u201cBut it worked,\u201d Meg said. \u201cIt worked, right? Maybe a little more radiation. Or a round of chemo. I read that some are crossing the blood-brain barrier now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Claire said. She\u2019d meant to say it softly, but her voice was loud. She looked at the neurologist. \u201cHow long do I have?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sussman\u2019s voice was gentle. \u201cThe survival rates aren\u2019t good, I\u2019m afraid, for a tumor of this size and placement. Some patients live as long as a year. Perhaps a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix to nine months.\u201d</p><p>Claire stared down at her brand-new wedding ring, the one Grandma Myrtle had worn for six decades.</p><p>Meghann went to Claire then, dropped to her knees in front of her. \u201cWe won\u2019t believe it. The files\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said softly, shaking her head, thinking about Ali. She saw her baby\u2019s eyes, the sunburst smile that was missing the front teeth, heard her say, You can sleep with my wubbie, Mommy, and it ruined her. Tears ran down her cheeks. She felt Bobby beside her, felt the way his fingers were digging into her hard, and she knew he was crying, too. She wiped her eyes, looked up at the doctor. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>Meghann jerked to her feet and began pacing the room, studying the pictures and diplomas on the walls. Claire knew her sister was scared and, thus, angry.</p><p>Dr. Sussman pulled a chair around and sat down opposite Claire. \u201cWe have some options. None too good, I\u2019m afraid, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d It was Meghann\u2019s voice but she sounded shrill and desperate. She was holding a framed photograph she\u2019d taken off the wall.</p><p>Dr. Sussman frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s a group of us from medical school.\u201d He turned back to Claire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meghann slammed the photograph on the desk so hard the glass cracked. She pointed at someone in the picture. \u201cWho\u2019s that guy?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sussman leaned forward. \u201cJoe Wyatt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a doctor?\u201d</p><p>Claire looked at her sister. \u201cYou know Joe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know Joe?\u201d Meghann said sharply.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a radiologist, actually.\u201d It was Dr. McGrail who answered. \u201cOne of the best in the country. At least he was. He was a legend with MRIs. He saw things\u2014possibilities\u2014no one else did.\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned. \u201cMeghann, let go of it. We\u2019re long past the need for a radiologist. And believe me, Joe wouldn\u2019t be the one to ask for help. What I needed was a miracle.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked steadily at Dr. McGrail. She wasn\u2019t even listening to Claire. \u201cWhat do you mean he was the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe quit. Disappeared, in fact.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed his wife.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>THE RIDE HOME SEEMED TO LAST FOREVER. NO ONE SPOKE. When they got back to the condo, Bobby held Claire so tightly she couldn\u2019t breathe, then stumbled back from her. \u201cI need to take a shower,\u201d he said in a broken voice.</p><p>She let him go, knowing what he needed. She\u2019d cried a few tears of her own in Meghann\u2019s expensive glass-block shower.</p><p>She went to the sofa, collapsed on it. She was tired and dizzy. There was a ringing in her ears and a tingling in her right hand, but she couldn\u2019t admit any of that to Meghann, who had that bulldog don\u2019t-quit look in her eyes.</p> <p>Meg sat down on the coffee table, angled toward her. \u201cThere are all kinds of clinical trials going on. There\u2019s that doctor in Houston\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one the government tried to prosecute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a fraud. His patients\u2014\u201d</p><p>Claire held up a hand for silence. \u201cCan we be real for just a minute?\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked so stricken that Claire had to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Meg demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was little, I used to dream about getting some rare illness that would bring you and Mama to my bedside. I imagined you crying over my death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p> <p>Claire stared at her sister, so pale now, and shaky. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to cry over it.\u201d</p><p>Meg stood up so abruptly she banged her shin on the coffee table and swore harshly. \u201cI . . . can\u2019t talk about you dying. I can\u2019t.\u201d She couldn\u2019t get out of the room fast enough.</p><p>\u201cBut I need you to,\u201d Claire said to the empty room. A headache started behind her eyes again. It had been lurking nearby all day.</p><p>She started to lean back into the sofa when the pain hit. She gasped at it, tried to cry out. Her head felt as if it were exploding.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t breathe. She tried to scream her sister\u2019s name.</p><p>But the stereo was playing \u201cThunder Road\u201d and the music swallowed her tiny voice.</p><p>Alison, she thought.</p><p>Then everything went dark.</p><p>Meghann stood by her sister\u2019s bed, holding on to the metal bed rails. \u201cIs the medication helping?\u201d</p><p>Claire looked small in the hospital bed, delicate, with her pale, pale skin and patchy hair. Her attempt at a smile was heartrending. \u201cYeah. A grand mal seizure. Welcome to my new world. I guess the good news is I didn\u2019t have a heart attack, too. How long will I be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to call Mama.\u201d</p><p>Meghann flinched. Her mouth trembled traitorously. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Dad and Ali and the Bluesers they can come down to see me, too. Gina can always make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>Meghann heard the defeat in her sister\u2019s voice; even worse was the acceptance. She wanted to disagree, to make her sister angry enough to fight, but her voice had abandoned her. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYes, Meg,\u201d Claire said with a resolve that surprised Meg. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to go to sleep. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the meds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Claire smiled knowingly. \u201cGood night. And take care of Bobby tonight, okay? Don\u2019t cut out on him. He\u2019s not as strong as he looks.\u201d Then she closed her eyes.</p><p>Meghann reached out. Being careful not to disturb the IV in Claire\u2019s arm, she held her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d She said it at least a dozen times; every time she expected a response, but one never came. A few minutes later, Bobby walked into the room, looking haggard. His eyes were red and swollen.</p><p>\u201cShe woke up,\u201d Meghann said gently. \u201cAnd went back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d He took Claire\u2019s hand in his and squeezed it.\u201cHey, baby. I\u2019m back. I just went for a cup of coffee.\u201d He sighed, said quietly, \u201cShe\u2019s giving up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She wants me to call everyone. Tell them to come see her. How do we tell Ali this?\u201d Tears stung her eyes as she looked up at Bobby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her,\u201d Claire said quietly, opening her eyes. She smiled tiredly at her husband. \u201cBobby,\u201d she breathed, reaching for him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Meghann couldn\u2019t stand there another second. Every breath her sister exhaled seemed to whisper good-bye. \u201cI\u2019ve got phone calls to make. Bye.\u201d She raced from the room.</p><p>Anything was better than standing there, trying to smile when it felt as if someone were ripping her heart apart. Even calling Mama.</p><p>It was late now; the night shift was on duty and the hallways were quiet. She went to the bank of pay phones and dialed Mama\u2019s number.</p><p>Mama herself answered, sounding boozy and loud. \u201cHello, Frank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Mama. Meghann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeggy? I thought you prowled the bars this time of night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on her honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a month ago, Mama. Now she\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis better not be one of your stunts, Meggy. Like the time you called me at work \u2019cause Claire had fallen out of bed and you thought she was paralyzed. I lost forty dollars in tips to find out she was asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was eleven years old when that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a brain tumor, Mama. The radiation treatments didn\u2019t work and no one has the guts to operate on her.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause on the other end; then, \u201cWill she be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Meghann said because she couldn\u2019t imagine any other response. Then, very softly, she said, \u201cMaybe not. You should come see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a Starbase IV event tomorrow at two, and a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe here tomorrow or I call People magazine and tell them you didn\u2019t visit your daughter who has a brain tumor.\u201d</p><p>It was a long moment before Mama said, \u201cI\u2019m no good with this sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us are, Mama.\u201d Meghann hung up without saying good-bye, then punched in the 800 number on her calling card and dialed Sam. The phone rang once and she lost her nerve. She couldn\u2019t tell Sam this over the phone.</p><p>She slammed the receiver onto the hook and went back to her sister\u2019s room.</p><p>Bobby stood by the bed, singing softly to Claire, who snored gently. It brought Meghann up short.</p><p>Bobby looked up at her. Tears glistened on his cheeks. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t opened her eyes again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will. Keep singing. I\u2019m sure she loves it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His voice cracked.</p><p>Meg had never seen a man in so much pain; she knew the look in Bobby\u2019s eyes matched her own. \u201cI\u2019m going to go tell Sam in person. I can\u2019t give him this news over the phone. If Claire wakes up\u2014\u201d She caught herself. \u201cWhen Claire wakes up, tell her I love her and I\u2019ll be back soon. Do you have your keys to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Meghann wanted to say something else but didn\u2019t know what. So she left the room. She practically ran for her car. Once inside, she hit the gas and headed north.</p><p>Ninety minutes later, she reached Hayden. She slowed down through town, stopped at the light.</p><p>And there it was: the silver Quonset hut.</p><p>Joe Wyatt.</p><p>He\u2019s a radiologist. Probably one of the best in the country. It came rushing back to her now, the stunning news that had been lost somehow, buried beneath a thick layer of grief.</p><p>Dr. Joseph Wyatt. Of course. No wonder he\u2019d looked familiar. His trial had been front-page news. She and her colleagues had speculated about his fate over many a beer. She\u2019d been firmly in his camp, certain he\u2019d be acquitted. It had never occurred to her to wonder what had become of him after the trial.</p><p>Now she knew. He\u2019d run away, hidden out. But he was still one of the best radiologists in the country. He saw things\u2014possibilities\u2014no one else did.</p><p>Yet when she\u2019d come to him, sobbing about her sick sister, he\u2019d done nothing. Nothing.</p><p>And he knew Claire.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d She glanced sideways. The envelope from the hospital was on the passenger seat.</p><p>She turned the wheel hard and slammed on the brakes, parking along the curb. Then she grabbed the envelope and marched toward the cabin.</p><p>She pounded on the door, screaming, until she heard footsteps coming from inside.</p><p>When he opened the door, saw her, and said \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d she shoved him in the chest so hard he stumbled backward.</p><p>\u201cHey, Joe. Invite me in.\u201d She kicked the door shut behind her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s practically midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is, Doctor Wyatt.\u201d</p><p>He sank onto the sofa and looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cYou held me. You let me cry in your arms.\u201d Her voice trembled; the ache in her heart only made her madder. \u201cAnd you offered a referral. What kind of man are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind who knows his hero days are behind him. If you know who I am, you know what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed your wife.\u201d At his flinch, she went on. \u201cIf I\u2019d known your last name, I would have remembered. Your trial was a big deal in Seattle. The prosecution of the doctor who euthanized his dying wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEuthanasia is a prettier word than manslaughter.\u201d</p><p>Some of the steam went out of her at the soft sadness in his voice. She\u2019d learned about that kind of sorrow in the past month. \u201cLook, Joe. In an ordinary world, I\u2019d talk to you about what you did. I might even take you in my arms and tell you that I understand, that anyone with a drop of compassion in their soul would have done the same thing. That\u2019s what your acquittal meant. I might even ask you about the road you\u2019ve been on, the journey that led one of the country\u2019s best radiologists to this place. But it\u2019s not an ordinary world for me right now. My sister is dying.\u201d She tripped over the word, felt the sting of tears. She tossed the oversize manila envelope on the coffee table in front of him. \u201cThese are her MRI films. Maybe you can help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let my license lapse. I can\u2019t practice medicine anymore. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry? Sorry? You have the power to save people\u2019s lives and you hide out in this dump of a cabin drinking cheap scotch and feeling sorry for yourself? You selfish son of a bitch.\u201d She stared down at him, wanting to hate him, hurt him, but she couldn\u2019t imagine how to do either one. \u201cI cared about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send you an invitation to the funeral.\u201d She turned on her heel and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cTake this with you.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, gave him one last withering look. \u201cNo, Joe. You\u2019ll have to touch them. Throw them in the trash yourself. Try looking in the mirror after that.\u201d</p> <p>Then she left. She made it all the way to her car before she started to cry.</p><p>Outside the trailer, Meg sat in her car, trying to compose herself. Every time she opened her compact to fix her makeup, she looked at her watery eyes and it made her cry all over again.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long she\u2019d sat there, but at some point it started to rain. Drops thumped on the convertible\u2019s soft top and tapped on the windshield.</p><p>Finally, she got out of the car and walked up to the trailer.</p><p>Sam opened the door before she even knocked. He stood there, frowning, his eyes already watery. \u201cI wondered how long you were going to sit out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know I was here.\u201d</p><p>He tried to smile. \u201cYou always did think you were smarter than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just you, Sam. I think I\u2019m smarter than everyone.\u201d She wanted to smile but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad.\u201d When she said it, the tears came back. She wiped them away.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Sam said gently, opening his arms.</p> <p>Meg hesitated.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She surged forward, let him hold her. She couldn\u2019t seem to stop crying. Then he was crying, too.</p><p>When they finally drew back, they stared at each other. Meg had no idea what to say.</p><p>Suddenly there were footsteps in the hallway. Ali came running out, dressed in pink footed pajamas, carrying her Groovy Girl. She looked up at Meg. \u201cDo we get to go see Mommy now? Is she all better?\u201d</p><p>Meg knelt down and pulled her niece into her arms, holding her tightly. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said in a throaty voice. \u201cYou get to see Mommy tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Meghann tossed and turned all night, finally falling into a troubled sleep around dawn. When she woke up again, bleary-eyed and exhausted, she was surprised to see that it was 9:30. A quick check of the condo told her that Sam and Ali had already gone to the hospital. Bobby hadn\u2019t come home last night. She forced herself out of bed and stumbled into the shower. By the time she got to the hospital and parked, it was 10:00.</p><p>The waiting room was already full.</p> <p>Gina sat in a chair by the windows, knitting a delicate pink blanket. Beside her, Karen and Charlotte were playing cribbage. Bobby stood at the window, staring out. At Meghann\u2019s entrance, he looked up. She could tell by his eyes that Claire had had a bad night. Ali sat at his feet, coloring.</p><p>\u201cAunt Meg,\u201d the little girl cried out, scampering to her feet.</p><p>Meghann scooped her niece into her arms and hugged her.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa\u2019s in with Mommy. Can I go now? Can I?\u201d</p><p>Meg looked at Bobby, who sighed and shrugged, as if to say, I can\u2019t take her.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Meg said. Slowly, dreading every step, she carried Ali down the long hallway.</p><p>At the closed door, she paused, pulled up a bright smile, and went inside.</p><p>Sam stood by Claire\u2019s bedside. He was crying and holding her hand.</p><p>Ali wiggled out of Meg\u2019s arms and slid to the floor. She immediately went to her grandfather, who picked her up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Grandpa? Do you have something in your eye? One time Sammy Chan got poked in the eye and then Eliot Zane called him a crybaby.\u201d</p><p>Meghann and Claire exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cLeave my baby with me,\u201d Claire said, opening her arms. Ali didn\u2019t notice the way her mother winced at every movement, every touch.</p><p>Sam wiped his eyes and managed a smile. \u201cI better go call that plumber. The pool filter sounds bad.\u201d</p><p>Ali nodded. \u201cLike shit.\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled. Tears glittered in her eyes. \u201cAlison Katherine, I\u2019ve told you not to copy Grandpa\u2019s bad language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d Ali grinned.</p><p>Sam and Meg looked at each other, and a question hung between them, clear as a sunny day. Who will tell Ali things like that . . . ?</p><p>Meg backed out of the room, left the three of them alone. She went back to the waiting room and thumbed through a magazine.</p><p>An hour or so later, a commotion in the hall got her attention. She looked up.</p><p>Mama had arrived. Sheathed in elegant, flowing black, she marched forward carrying a tiny dog in a beaded carrier and leading the way. Behind her was a cluster of people; one of them was snapping photographs.</p><p>Mama came to the waiting room and looked around. When she saw Meghann, she burst into tears. \u201cHow is our girl?\u201d She pulled a silk handkerchief out of her sleeve and dabbed her eyes.</p><p>A photographer flashed a photo.</p><p>Mama offered a brave smile. \u201cThis is m\u2019other daughter, Meghann Dontess. D-O-N-T-E-S-S. She\u2019s twenty-nine years old.\u201d</p><p>Meghann counted silently to ten. Then, in a steady voice, she said, \u201cDogs aren\u2019t allowed in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I had to sneak him in. You know, Elvis, he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cElvis is going to be as dead as his namesake in about ten seconds.\u201d At Mama\u2019s affronted gasp, Meghann looked at the man standing slightly apart from the crowd. Dressed in black, neckless, he looked like a WWF combatant. \u201cYou. Mr. Bodyguard. Take the dog to the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hotel,\u201d Mama said with a dramatic, suffering sigh. \u201cThe suite has plenty of room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Neckless took the dog carrier and walked away.</p><p>That left just Mama, the photographer, and a thin, mouse-faced man with a tape recorder. The reporter.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Meghann said to the men as she grabbed Mama\u2019s arm and pulled her into a quiet corner. \u201cWhat did you do, hire a publicist?\u201d</p><p>Mama drew herself up to her full height and sniffed. \u201cI was talking to her on the other line when you called. What was I supposed to tell her? It\u2019s hardly my fault that Us magazine wanted to cover my visit to my gravely ill daughter. I am, after all, news. Celebrity can be such a burden.\u201d</p><p>Meghann frowned. She should have been mad as hell right now, ready to deep-fry Mama in some down-home chicken grease. But when she looked into her mother\u2019s heavily made-up eyes, she saw something that surprised her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s why you brought the entourage. So it would be a performance.\u201d</p><p>Mama rolled her eyes. \u201cNothing scares me. I just . . . just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Claire,\u201d Mama finally answered, looking away. \u201cClaire.\u201d Her voice thickened, and Meghann saw something honest for once. \u201cCan I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re bringing the circus with you.\u201d</p><p>Mama said quietly, \u201cWill you go in with me?\u201d</p><p>Meghann was surprised by that. She\u2019d always imagined Mama to be shallow as a pie pan and tough as nails, a woman who knew what she wanted in life and made a beeline for it, the kind of woman who would cross police tape and step over a body if it was in her way. Now, she wondered if she\u2019d been wrong, if Mama had always been this weak and frightened.</p><p>She wondered if it was all an act. Fear was something Meghann understood. Especially when it grew out of guilt.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>They went over to the magazine people. Mama made a teary plea for privacy in this difficult time, then recommended a restaurant across the street for the rest of the interview.</p><p>Mama\u2019s high heels clacked on the linoleum floor. The sound seemed designed to draw attention, but no one noticed.</p><p>At Claire\u2019s room, Meghann stopped. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Mama pulled up a smile, nodded, and swept into the room like Auntie Mame, her long black sleeves fluttering out behind her. \u201cClaire, darlin\u2019, it\u2019s Mama.\u201d</p><p>Claire tried to smile, but against the white mound of pillows and industrial gray blankets, she looked worn, impossibly pale. The patch of baldness gave her an odd, lopsided look. \u201cHey, Mama. You just missed Sam and Ali. They went down to the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>Mama stumbled, her arms lowered. She glanced back at Meghann.</p><p>\u201cI know I look like shit, Mama,\u201d Claire said, trying for a laugh.</p><p>Mama moved slowly this time. \u201cWhy, darlin\u2019, that isn\u2019t true at all. You\u2019re lovely.\u201d She pulled up a chair and sat down beside the bed. \u201cWhy, I remember an episode of Starbase IV. It was called \u2018Attack Buffet,\u2019 remember that? I ate a bad bit of space food and all m\u2019hair fell out.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI sent that episode in to the Emmy voters. \u2019Course it didn\u2019t work. Too much politics. I sort of liked the freedom of no hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a rubber skullcap, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. It makes a woman\u2019s eyes look beautiful. I do wish I\u2019d brought my makeup though. You could use a little blush, maybe a touch of liner. Meghann should have told me. And I\u2019ll pick you up a pretty little bed jacket. Maybe with some fur around the collar. I remember a dress I once wore to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama.\u201d Claire tried to lean forward. The effort clearly cost her. \u201cThere\u2019s a tumor eating through my brain.\u201d</p><p>Mama\u2019s smile fluttered. \u201cThat\u2019s awfully graphic of you, darlin\u2019. We Southern women\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Mama. Please.\u201d</p><p>Mama sank into her chair. She seemed to lose mass somehow, become smaller, ordinary, until the flapping black outfit swallowed her up, leaving behind a thin, heavily made-up woman who\u2019d had one too many face-lifts. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want from me.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time in twenty years Meghann had heard her mother\u2019s real voice. Instead of the sweet lilt of the South, it had the pinched flatness of the Midwest.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mama,\u201d Claire said, \u201cof course you don\u2019t. You never wanted children. You wanted an audience. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m too tired to be polite. I want you to know that I love you, Mama. I always did. Even when you . . . looked away.\u201d</p><p>Looked away.</p><p>That was how Mama always put it: I was standing there one day, takin\u2019 care of my babies, then I looked away for a minute, and they were both gone.</p><p>It had been easier, Meghann thought, than confronting the fact that Mama had simply let Claire go.</p><p>\u201cSam was a good man,\u201d Mama said so softly they had to strain to hear it. \u201cThe only good one I ever found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was,\u201d Claire agreed.</p><p>Mama waved her hand airily. \u201cBut y\u2019all know me. I\u2019m not one to go pickin\u2019 through the past.\u201d The accent was back. \u201cI keep movin\u2019. That\u2019s always been my way.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d lost Mama; whatever opportunity had been opened by the sight of Claire\u2019s illness had closed. Mama had rallied. She stood up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tire you out. I\u2019m goin\u2019 to run over to Nordstrom and buy y\u2019all some makeup. Would you mind if a friend of mine took a little picture of us together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama\u2014\u201d Meghann warned.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Claire said, sagging back into the pillows. \u201cMeghann, would you send Bobby and Ali in? I want to kiss them before I take another nap.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mama bent down and kissed Claire\u2019s forehead, then barreled out of the room. Meghann almost fell into her when she left. Mama was standing in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cMakeup, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if she is dyin\u2019, there\u2019s no need to let herself go like that.\u201d Mama\u2019s composure cracked.</p><p>Meghann reached out.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch me, Meggy. I couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d She turned and walked away, skirts flapping behind her, heels clattering on the floor.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a single person who didn\u2019t look at her as she passed.</p><p>Claire grew weaker. By her second day in the hospital, she wanted simply to sleep.</p><p>Her friends and family had begun to exhaust her. They\u2019d shown up religiously. All of them. The Bluesers had descended on her tiny hospital room, bringing life and laughter, flowers and fattening food, and Claire\u2019s favorite movies. They talked and told jokes and remembered old times. Only Gina had had the guts to brave the harsh, icy landscape of Claire\u2019s fear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be there for Ali, you know,\u201d she said when everyone else had gone to the cafeteria.</p> <p>Claire had never loved her friend as much as in that moment. No wartime charge ever took more courage. \u201cThank you,\u201d was all she\u2019d been able to say. Then, softly, \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to tell her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d</p><p>Gina\u2019s eyes met hers, filling slowly with tears. They\u2019d both been thinking about how a woman said good-bye to her five-year-old daughter. After a long pause, Gina smiled. \u201cSo. What are we going to do about your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d cut it off. Maybe dye what\u2019s left of it platinum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery chic. We\u2019ll all look like old housewives next to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my dream now,\u201d Claire said, unable to help herself. \u201cBecoming an old housewife.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, as much as she loved to see her friends, she was glad when they went home. Late that night, in the quiet darkness, she gave in to the meds and fell asleep.</p><p>She woke with a start.</p><p>Her heart was pounding too fast, skipping beats. She couldn\u2019t seem to breathe, couldn\u2019t sit up. Something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cClaire, are you okay?\u201d It was Bobby. He was sitting beside her bed. He\u2019d obviously been sleeping. Rubbing his eyes, he stood up, came to her bedside. For a second, she thought it was a hallucination, that the Pacman tumor had eaten through the good parts of her brain and left her crazy. Then he moved closer to the bed, and she heard the jingle of the keys.</p><p>\u201cBobby,\u201d she whispered, trying in vain to lift her heavy, heavy arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, baby.\u201d</p><p>It took effort, a painful amount, but she reached up and touched his wet cheek. \u201cI love you, Robert Jackson Austin. More than anything in the world except my Ali Gator.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she said. \u201cGet into bed with me.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at all the machines, the IVs, the tubes and cords. \u201cOh, baby . . .\u201d He leaned down and kissed her instead.</p><p>The sweet pressure of his lips felt so good. She closed her eyes, feeling herself sinking into the pillows. \u201cAli,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI need my baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>Pain exploded behind her right eye.</p><p>Beside her bed, an alarm went off.</p><p>There is no pain. No ache. She feels for the dry, itchy patch of skin on her head and feels long, beautiful hair instead.</p><p>She sits up. The tubes that connect her to the machines are gone. She wants to shout out that she is better, but there are people in her room. Too many of them, all dressed in white. They\u2019re crowding her, talking all at once so she can\u2019t understand.</p><p>She realizes suddenly that she is watching herself from above\u2014in the air somewhere\u2014watching the doctors work on her body. They\u2019ve ripped open her gown and are ramming something on her chest.</p><p>\u201cClear!\u201d one yells.</p><p>There is such relief in being here, above them, where there is no pain . . .</p><p>\u201cClear.\u201d</p><p>Then she thinks of her daughter, her precious baby girl whom she didn\u2019t hold one last time.</p><p>Her baby, who will have to be told that Mommy has gone away.</p><p>The doctor stepped back. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Meghann ran to the bed, screaming. \u201cDon\u2019t you do it, Claire. Come back. Come back, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Someone tried to pull her away. She elbowed him hard. \u201cI mean it, Claire. You come back. Alison is in the waiting room. You cannot run out on her this way. You haven\u2019t told her good-bye. She deserves that, damn it. Come back.\u201d She grabbed Claire\u2019s shoulders, shook her hard. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare do this to Alison and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a heartbeat,\u201d someone cried out.</p><p>Meghann was pushed aside. She stumbled back into the corner of the room, watching, praying, as they stabilized her sister.</p><p>Finally, the doctors left, dragging their crash cart with them. Except for the buzz and beep of machines, the room was quiet.</p><p>She stared at Claire\u2019s chest, watching it rise and fall. It was a moment before she realized that she was breathing intently, trying to will her sister\u2019s body to keep up the rhythm.</p><p>\u201cI heard you, you know.\u201d</p><p>At Claire\u2019s voice, Meg pulled away from the wall and moved forward.</p><p>There was Claire, half bald, pale as parchment, smiling up at her. \u201cI thought: Christ, I\u2019m dead and she\u2019s still yelling at me.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>JOE HAD TRIED TO THROW OUT THE DAMN ENVELOPE AT least a dozen times. The problem was, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to touch it.</p><p>Coward.</p><p>He heard the word so clearly he looked up. The cabin was empty. He stared at Diana, who looked back at him from her place on the mantel.</p><p>He closed his eyes, wishing she\u2019d come to him again, maybe sit down on the bed beside him and whisper, You break my heart, Joey, the way she used to.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t come to him in so long that he\u2019d forgotten how those hallucinations felt. Although he didn\u2019t need to conjure her image to know what her words would be right now.</p><p>She would be ashamed of him, as ashamed as he was of himself. She would remind him that he\u2019d once taken an oath to help people.</p><p>And not just anyone, either. This was Claire Cavenaugh, the woman who\u2019d sat by Diana\u2019s bedside hour after hour when she was ill, playing dirty-word Scrabble and watching soap operas. Joe remembered one night in particular. He\u2019d worked all day, then headed for Diana\u2019s hospital room, exhausted by the prospect of another evening spent beside his dying wife. When he\u2019d opened the door, Claire was there, wearing nothing but her bra and panties, dancing. Diana, who hadn\u2019t smiled in weeks, was laughing so hard there were tears on her cheeks.</p><p>No way, Claire had laughed when he asked what was going on. We are not going to tell you what we were doing.</p><p>A girl has to have some secrets, Diana had said, even from the love of her life.</p><p>Now it was Claire in a bed like that, in a room that smelled of despair and looked out on graying skies even in the height of summer.</p><p>There was probably nothing he could do for her, but how could he live with himself if he didn\u2019t try? Maybe this was God\u2019s way of reminding him that a man couldn\u2019t hold on to old fears if he wanted to start over.</p><p>If she were here right now, Diana would have told him that chances didn\u2019t come any plainer than this. It was one thing to run away from nothing. It was quite another to turn your back on a set of films with a friend\u2019s name in the corner.</p><p>You\u2019re killing her, and this time no pretty word like euthanasia will fit.</p><p>He released a heavy breath and reached out, pretending not to notice that his hands were shaking and that he was suddenly desperate for a drink.</p><p>He pulled out the films and took them into the kitchen, where full sunlight streamed through the window above the sink.</p><p>He studied the first one, then went through the rest of them. Adrenaline made his heart speed up.</p><p>He knew why everyone had diagnosed this tumor as inoperable. The amount of skill needed to perform the surgery was almost unheard-of. It would require a neurosurgeon with godlike hands and an ego to match. One who wasn\u2019t afraid to fail.</p><p>But with a careful resection . . . there might be a chance. It was possible\u2014just possible\u2014that this one thin shadow wasn\u2019t tumor, that it was tissue responding to the tumor.</p><p>There was no doubt about what he had to do next.</p><p>He took a long, hot shower, then dressed in the blue shirt he\u2019d recently bought and the new jeans, wishing he had better clothes, accepting that he didn\u2019t. Then he retrieved the film, put it back in the envelope, and walked over to Smitty\u2019s house. Helga was in the kitchen, making lunch. Smitty was in the living room, watching Judge Judy. At Joe\u2019s knock, he looked up. \u201cHey, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is irregular, but could I borrow the truck? I need to drive to Seattle. I may have to stay overnight.\u201d</p><p>Smitty dug in his pocket for the keys, then tossed them.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Joe went to the rusty old \u201973 Ford pickup and got inside. The door clanged shut behind him.</p><p>He stared at the dashboard. It had been years since he\u2019d been in the driver\u2019s seat. He started the engine and hit the gas.</p><p>Two hours later, he parked in the underground lot on Madison and Broadway and walked into the lobby of his old life.</p><p>The painting of Elmer Nordstrom was still there, presiding over the sleek black high-rise that bore his family name.</p><p>Joe kept his head down as he walked toward the elevators. There, making eye contact with no one, his heart hammering, he pushed the up button.</p><p>When the doors pinged open, he stepped inside. Two white-coated people crowded beside him. They were talking about lab results. They got off on the third floor\u2014the floor that led to the sky bridge that connected this office building to Swedish Hospital.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help remembering when he\u2019d walked through this building with his head held high; a man certain of his place in the world.</p><p>On the fourteenth floor, the doors opened.</p><p>He stood there a half second too long, staring at the gilt-edged black letters on the glass doors across the hall.</p><p>Seattle Nuclear Specialists. The business he\u2019d started on his own. There were seven or eight doctors listed below. Joe\u2019s name wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>At the last second, as the doors were closing, he stepped out of the elevators and crossed the hall. In the office, there were several patients in the waiting room\u2014none of which he knew, thank God\u2014and two women working the reception desk. Both of them were new.</p><p>He considered walking straight down to Li\u2019s office, but he didn\u2019t have the guts. Instead, he went to the desk.</p><p>The woman\u2014Imogene, according to her name tag\u2014looked up at him. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see Dr. Li Chinn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him an out-of-town doctor is here for an emergency consult. I\u2019ve come a long way to see him.\u201d</p><p>Imogene studied Joe, no doubt noticing his cheap clothes and small-town haircut. Frowning, she buzzed Li\u2019s office, gave him the message. A moment later, she hung up. \u201cHe can see you in fifteen minutes. Take a seat.\u201d</p><p>Joe went to one of the chairs in the waiting room, remembering that Diana had picked the fabric and colors for the office. There had been a time when their home had been wall-to-wall samples. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I want it just right, she\u2019d said when he made fun of her. Your job is the only thing you love more than me.</p><p>He wished he could smile at the memory; it was a good one.</p><p>\u201cDoctor? Doctor?\u201d</p><p>He looked up, startled. That was a word he hadn\u2019t heard directed at him for a long time. \u201cYes?\u201d He stood.</p> <p>\u201cDr. Chinn will see you now. Go down the hall and turn right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where his office is.\u201d He went to the door, stood there, trying to breathe evenly. He was sweating and his palms were damp. His fingerprints would be all over the envelope.</p><p>\u201cDoctor? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He released a heavy sigh and opened the door.</p><p>The interior hallways and offices were filled with familiar faces. Nurses, physician\u2019s assistants, radiology techs.</p> <p>He forced his chin up.</p><p>One by one, the people he\u2019d known made eye contact, recognized him, and looked quickly away. A few of them smiled awkwardly or waved, but no one spoke to him. He felt like a ghost passing through the land of the living. No one wanted to admit they\u2019d seen him.</p><p>Some of the gazes were frankly condemning; that was the look he remembered, the one that had sent him running in the first place. Others, though, seemed embarrassed to be seen looking at him, confused by his sudden appearance. What did you say to a man you\u2019d once admired who\u2019d been prosecuted for killing his wife and then vanished for three years?</p><p>He walked past the row of women in hospital gowns waiting for mammograms, past the second waiting room, then turned onto another, quieter hallway. In the far end, he came to a closed door. He took a deep breath and knocked.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d said a familiar voice.</p><p>Joe entered the big corner office that had once been his. Huge picture windows framed the Seattle high-rise view.</p> <p>Li Chinn was at his desk, reading. At Joe\u2019s entrance, he glanced up. An almost comical look of surprise overtook his normally impassive face. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said, remaining in his seat.</p><p>\u201cHey, Li.\u201d</p><p>Li looked awkward, uncertain of how to proceed, what to say. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? I meant to come by here and tell you I was leaving. But\u2014\u201d he sighed, hearing how pathetic he sounded \u201c\u2014I didn\u2019t have the guts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept your name on the door for nearly a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Li. It was probably bad for business.\u201d</p> <p>Li nodded; this time his dark eyes were sad. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some film I\u2019d like you to look at.\u201d At Li\u2019s nod, Joe went to the viewbox and put the film up.</p><p>Li came closer, studying it. For a long moment, he said nothing. Then, \u201cYou see something I do not?\u201d</p><p>He pointed. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>Li crossed his arms, frowned. \u201cNot many surgeons would attempt such a thing. The risks are grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to die without the surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may die because of the surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s worth a try?\u201d</p><p>Li looked at him, his frown deepening. \u201cThe old Joe Wyatt never asked for other men\u2019s opinions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings change,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cDo you know a surgeon who would do it? Who could do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStu Weissman at UCLA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. The cowboy. Yes, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t practice. I\u2019ve let my license lapse. Could you send Stu the film? I\u2019ll call him.\u201d</p><p>Li flicked off the light. \u201cI will. You know, it\u2019s an easy thing to reinstate your license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Joe stood there a moment longer. Silence spread like a stain between the men. \u201cWell. I should go call Stu.\u201d He started to leave.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>He turned back around.</p><p>\u201cDid any of the staff speak to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s hard to know what to say to a murderer.\u201d</p><p>Li moved toward him. \u201cA few believed that of you, yes. Most . . . of us . . . just don\u2019t know what to say. Privately, many of us would have wanted to do the same thing. Diana was in terrible pain, everyone knew that, and there was no hope. We thank God that we were not in your shoes.\u201d</p><p>Joe had no answer to that.</p><p>\u201cYou have a gift, Joe,\u201d Li said slowly. \u201cLosing it would be a crime, too. When you\u2019re ready\u2014if you ever are\u2014you come back to see me. This office is in the business of saving lives, not worrying about old gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d They were small words, too small to express his gratitude. Embarrassed by the depth of his emotion, Joe mumbled thanks again, and left the office.</p><p>Downstairs, in the lobby, he found a bank of pay phones and called Stu Weissman.</p><p>\u201cJoe Wyatt,\u201d Stu said loudly. \u201cHow the hell are you? I thought you fell off the face of the earth. Damn shame, that hell you went through.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t want to waste time with the where-have-you-been stuff. There would be time for that when Stu got up here. So he said, \u201cI have a surgery I want you to do. It\u2019s risky as hell. You\u2019re the only man I know who is good enough.\u201d Stu was a sucker for compliments.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>Joe explained what he knew of Claire\u2019s history, told him the current diagnosis, and outlined what he\u2019d seen on the film.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think there\u2019s something I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Joe. Your eyes are the best in the business. Send me the film. If I see what you do, I\u2019ll be on the next plane. But you make sure the patient understands the risks. I don\u2019t want to get there and have to turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Thanks, Stu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear from you,\u201d Stu said, then hung up.</p><p>Joe replaced the receiver. Now all he had to do was speak to Claire.</p><p>He went back to the elevators, then crossed the sky bridge and headed into Swedish Hospital. He kept his gaze pinned on the floor. A few people frowned in recognition, a few more whispered behind him. He ignored them and kept moving. No one had the guts to actually speak to him or ask why he was back here, until he reached the ICU.</p><p>There someone said, \u201cDr. Wyatt?\u201d</p><p>He turned slowly. It was Trish Bey, the head ICU nurse. They\u2019d worked together for years. She and Diana had become close friends at the end. \u201cHello, Trish.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you back here. We missed you.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders relaxed. He almost smiled in return. \u201cThanks.\u201d They stood there, staring at each other for an awkward moment, then he nodded, said good-bye, and headed for Claire\u2019s room.</p><p>He knocked quietly and opened the door.</p><p>She was sitting up in bed, asleep, her head cocked to one side. The patchy hairless area made her look impossibly young.</p><p>He moved toward her, trying not to remember when Diana had looked like this. Pale and fragile, her hair thinning to the point where she looked like an antique doll that had been loved too hard and then discarded.</p><p>She blinked awake, stared at him. \u201cJoey,\u201d she whispered, smiling tiredly. \u201cI heard you were home. Welcome back.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a chair over and sat down beside her bed. \u201cHey, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve looked better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. You always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBless you, Joe. I\u2019ll tell Di hi for you.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be in such a hurry to see my wife.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she opened her eyes. It seemed to take her a minute to focus on him. \u201cThere\u2019s no hope, Joe. You of all people know what that\u2019s like. It hurts too much to pretend. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see it . . . differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the white coats are wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give you false hope, Claire, but yeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is ever sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking anyone else\u2019s opinion. I want yours, Joey. Are you telling me I shouldn\u2019t give up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurgery might save you. But there could be bad side effects, Claire. Paralysis. Loss of motor skills. Brain damage.\u201d</p><p>At that, she smiled. \u201cDo you know what I was thinking about just before you got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow to tell Ali Kat that Mommy is going to die. I\u2019d take any risk, Joe. Anything so I don\u2019t have to kiss Ali good-bye.\u201d Her voice cracked, and he saw the depth of her pain. Her courage amazed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent your films to a friend of mine. If he agrees with my diagnosis, he\u2019ll operate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Joe,\u201d she said softly, then closed her eyes again.</p><p>He could see how tired she was. He leaned down and kissed her forehead. \u201cBye, Claire.\u201d</p><p>He was almost to the door when she said, \u201cJoe?\u201d</p><p>He turned. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She was awake again, barely, and looking at him. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have asked it of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked, but he knew.</p><p>\u201cDiana. I would never ask such a thing of Bobby. I know what it would do to him.\u201d</p><p>Joe had no answer to that. It was the same thing Gina always said. He left the room and closed the door behind him. With a sigh, he leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have asked it of you.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and stumbled away from the wall. Meghann stood a few feet away, staring up at him. Her cheeks and eyes were reddened and moist.</p><p>He had a nearly irresistible urge to wipe the residue of tears from her eyes.</p><p>She walked toward him. \u201cTell me you found a way to help her.\u201d</p><p>He was afraid to answer. He knew, better that most, the double edge of hope. Nothing hit you harder than the fall from faith. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a colleague at UCLA. If he agrees with me, he\u2019ll operate, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Meghann launched herself at him, clung to him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s risky as hell, Meg. She might not survive the surgery.\u201d</p><p>Meghann drew back, blinked her tears away impatiently. \u201cWe Sullivan girls would rather go down fighting. Thank you, Joe. And . . . I\u2019m sorry for the things I said to you. I can be a real bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe warning comes a little late.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, wiped her eyes again. \u201cYou should have told me about your wife, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn one of our heart-to-heart talks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. In one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hardly good between-the-sheets conversation. How do you make love to a woman, then tell her that you killed your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her. Cancer killed her. You ended her suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her breathing.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked up at him steadily. \u201cIf Claire asked it of me, I\u2019d do it. I\u2019d be willing to go to prison for it, too. I wouldn\u2019t let her suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray to God you never have to find out.\u201d He heard the way his voice broke. Once, he would have been ashamed by such obvious vulnerability; those were the days when he\u2019d believed in himself, when he\u2019d thought he was a demigod at least. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d she said into the silence that felt suddenly awkward. \u201cFor Claire, I mean.\u201d She stepped back from him, put some distance between them.</p><p>\u201cWe wait to hear from Stu Weissnar. And we pray he agrees with my assessment.\u201d</p><p>Joe was at the front door when he heard his name called. He stopped, turned.</p><p>Gina stood there. \u201cI hear my brother is acting like a doctor again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I did was call Stu.\u201d</p><p>She came closer, smiling now. \u201cYou gave her a chance, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see what Stu says, but yeah. Maybe. I hope so.\u201d</p><p>Gina touched his arm. \u201cDiana would be proud of you. So am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome sit with us in the waiting room. You\u2019ve been alone long enough. It\u2019s time to start your new life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to take care of first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, he was on the ferry headed to Bainbridge Island. He stood at the railing on the upper deck as the ferry turned into Eagle Harbor. The pretty little bay seemed to welcome him, with all its well-maintained homes and the sailboats clustered at the marina. He was glad to see that it looked the same; still more trees than houses, and the beachfront hadn\u2019t been cut into narrow lots.</p><p>This is it, Joey. This is where I want to raise our kids.</p> <p>His fingers tightened around the railing. That day hadn\u2019t been so long ago\u2014maybe ten years\u2014but it felt like forever. He and Diana had been so young and hope-filled. It had never occurred to either one of them that they wouldn\u2019t be together forever.</p><p>That one of them would have to go on alone.</p><p>The ferry honked its horn.</p><p>Joe returned to his truck, below deck. When the boat docked, he drove off.</p><p>Memories came at him from every street corner and sign.</p><p>Pick up that armoire for me, won\u2019t you, Joey, it\u2019s at Bad Blanche\u2019s.</p><p>Let\u2019s go to the winery today. I want to smell the grapes.</p><p>Forget dinner, Joey, take me to bed or lose me.</p> <p>He turned onto his old road. The trees were huge here; they towered in the air and blocked out the sun. The quiet road lay shadowed and still. There wasn\u2019t a house to be seen out here, just mailboxes and driveways that led off to the right.</p><p>At the last one, he slowed down.</p><p>Their mailbox was still there. Dr. and Mrs. Joe Wyatt. It had been one of Diana\u2019s first purchases after they\u2019d closed on the house.</p><p>He drove down his long, tree-lined driveway. The house\u2014his house\u2014sat in a patch of grassy sunlight beside a wide gravel beach. It was a pretty little Cape Cod\u2013style home with cedar shingles and glossy white trim.</p><p>The wisteria had gone wild, he noticed, growing thick and green along the porch railings, around the posts and up some of the exterior walls.</p><p>He was moving slowly now, breathing hard, as he left the safety of his car and walked toward the house.</p><p>The first thing he noticed was the smell. The salty tang of sea air mixed with the sweetness of blooming roses.</p><p>He found the key in his wallet\u2014the one he\u2019d kept especially for this day.</p><p>In truth, there had been weeks, months even, when he\u2019d never believed he\u2019d find the guts to reach for it again.</p><p>The key fit the lock, clicked.</p><p>Joe opened the door\u2014</p><p>Honey, I\u2019m home</p><p>\u2014and went inside.</p><p>The place looked exactly as he\u2019d left it. He still remembered the day he\u2019d come home from court\u2014supposedly an innocent man (no, a not-guilty one)\u2014and packed a suitcase. The only phone call he\u2019d made had been to Gina. I\u2019m sorry, he\u2019d said, too tired to be eloquent. I need to go.</p><p>I\u2019ll take care of the place, she\u2019d answered, crying. You\u2019ll be back.</p><p>I don\u2019t know, he\u2019d said. How can I?</p><p>And yet, here he was. True to her word, Gina had taken care of the place. She\u2019d paid the taxes and the bills from the money he\u2019d left in a special account. No dust collected on the furniture or windowsills, no spiderwebs hung from the high pitched ceilings.</p><p>He walked from room to room, touching things, remembering. Every stick of furniture reminded him of a time and place.</p><p>This chair is perfect, Joey, don\u2019t you think? You can sit in it to watch TV.</p><p>Every knickknack had a story. Like a blind man, he moved slowly, putting his hands on everything, as if somehow touch elicited the memories more than sight.</p><p>Finally, he was in the master bedroom. The sight of it was almost too much. He forced himself to go forward. It was all still there. The big antique bed they\u2019d gotten from Mom and Dad as a wedding present, the beautiful quilt that had come to them on Dad\u2019s death. The old nightstands that had once been piled with books\u2014romance novels on her side, military histories on his. Even the tiny needlepoint pillow that Diana had made when she first got sick.</p><p>He sat down on the bed and picked up the pillow, seeing the tiny brown spots that marred the fabric.</p><p>I don\u2019t think needlework is a good therapy. I\u2019m losing so much blood I\u2019m getting light-headed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Diana,\u201d he said, wishing for the days when he\u2019d been able to conjure her image. He stroked the pillow, trying to remember how it had felt to touch her. \u201cI was at the hospital today. It felt good.\u201d</p><p>He knew what she\u2019d say to that. But he didn\u2019t really know if he was ready to go back. His life had changed so much, degraded somehow into tiny bits that might not fit together again.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t forgotten the way people looked at him at his old office. They saw him and wondered, Is that what a murderer looks like?</p><p>He stared down at the pillow, stroking it. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have asked it of me, Di. It . . . ruined me.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . maybe I ruined me, too,\u201d he admitted quietly. He should have stayed here, in this community he\u2019d cared so much for. His mistake had been in running away.</p><p>It was time to quit hiding and running. Time to stand up to the people who judged him poorly and say, No more.</p><p>Time to take his life back.</p><p>Slowly, he got up and went to the closet, opening the louvered doors.</p><p>Diana\u2019s clothes filled two-thirds of the space.</p><p>Three years ago, he\u2019d tried to box them up and give them away. He\u2019d folded one pink cashmere sweater and been done for.</p><p>He reached out for a beige angora turtleneck that had been her favorite. He eased it off of the white plastic hanger and brought it to his face. The barest remnant of her scent lingered. Tears stung his eyes. \u201cGood-bye, Diana,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Then he went in search of a box.</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING STU WEISSMAN CALLED CLAIRE. HE spoke in clipped, rushed sentences. She was so groggy and disoriented, it took her several seconds to understand him.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d she finally said, sitting up. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019ll do the surgery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But this thing will be a bear cat. Could be a bad outlook all the way around. You could end up paralyzed or brain damaged or worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse sooner, you mean.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will, too. I\u2019ll be there tonight. I\u2019ve scheduled the surgery for eight A.M. tomorrow.\u201d His voice softened. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be negative, Claire. But you should put your affairs in order today. If you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. Thank you, Dr. Weissman.\u201d</p><p>All that day, Claire said good-bye to her friends. She did it one at a time, feeling that each of them deserved that kind of attention.</p><p>To Karen, she joked about the gray hairs Willie was sure to cause her in the upcoming years and begged her friend to make this third marriage work. To Charlotte, she said, Don\u2019t give up on babies; they\u2019re the mark we leave in this world. If you can\u2019t have one of your own, find one to adopt and love her with all you\u2019ve got. Gina was more difficult. For almost an hour they were together, Claire dozing off every now and then, Gina standing by the bedside, trying not to cry.</p><p>Take care of my family, Claire said at last, fighting to keep her eyes open.</p><p>Take care of them yourself, Gina had responded, her voice spiking for humor that it couldn\u2019t reach. Then, softly, she said, You know I will.</p><p>They were awkward, painful partings, full of things unsaid and boundaries upheld. They all pretended Claire would still be here tomorrow night, laughing and screwing up as she always had. She left her friends with that faith, and though she wanted to own it for herself, hope felt like a borrowed sweater that didn\u2019t quite fit.</p><p>She was bone tired, but most of all, she was afraid. Dr. Weissman had been guarded in his optimism and blunt in his assessment of the risk. A bad outlook all the way around, he\u2019d said. The worst part of her fear was how alone it made her feel. There was no one she could tell.</p><p>Time and again throughout the long, drawn-out day, she found herself wishing that she\u2019d died already, simply floated from this world unexpectedly. There was no way to be stealthy now, not with all her loved ones in the waiting room, praying for her, and the thought of the good-byes she still had left was devastating. Bobby and Sam would hold her and cry; she\u2019d have to be ready for that. Meg would get angry and loud.</p><p>And then there was Ali. How could Claire possibly get through that?</p><p>The hospital had a small nondenominational chapel on the second floor.</p><p>Meghann stood outside it, paused in the open doorway. It had been years since she\u2019d gone to a church in search of comfort; decades, in fact.</p><p>Slowly, she went inside, let the door ease shut behind her. Her footsteps were hushed and even on the mustard-colored carpet. She slid into the middle pew and knelt on the floor. There was no cushion for her knees, but she knelt anyway. It seemed right to be on her knees when she asked for a miracle.</p><p>She clasped her hands together and bowed her head. \u201cI\u2019m Meghann Dontess,\u201d she said by way of introduction. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve forgotten me. I haven\u2019t talked to you since . . . oh . . . the ninth grade, I think. That\u2019s when I prayed for enough money to get Claire ballet lessons. Then Mama got fired again and we moved on. I . . . stopped believing you could help.\u201d She thought of Claire upstairs, so pale and tired-looking in that hospital bed, and of the risks the surgery entailed. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the good ones, God. Please. Protect her. Don\u2019t let Ali grow up without her mom.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut. Tears slid down her cheeks and plopped on her hands. She wanted to say more, maybe find a way to bargain, but she had nothing to offer beyond desperation.</p><p>Behind her, the door opened, closed. Someone walked down the aisle.</p><p>Meghann wiped her eyes and eased back onto the pew.</p><p>\u201cMeg?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, surprised. Sam stood beside her, his big body hunched in defeat, his eyes a watery red. \u201cShe\u2019s saying good-bye to her girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand watching each one come out of her room. The minute they close the door, their smiles fade and the crying starts.\u201d</p><p>Meghann had run from the same thing. \u201cShe\u2019s lucky to have so many friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Can I join you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sidled to the right, making room. He sat down beside her. He was close enough that she could feel the heat of his body, but they didn\u2019t touch, didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Finally Sam said, \u201cI was thirty years old when you called me.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cOh.\u201d What did he want her to say?</p><p>\u201cI had no brothers and sisters and no other children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that, Sam. You pointed it out every time I screwed up.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI was pissed at Eliana. She\u2019d denied me my daughter\u2019s childhood. All those years I\u2019d been alone when I didn\u2019t have to be . . . and the way you and Claire lived from hand to mouth. I couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>He twisted around to face her. \u201cClaire was easy. She looked up at me with those big, trusting eyes and said, Hi, Daddy; just like that, I fell in love. But you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me. You were tough and mouthy and you thought everything I said to Claire was wrong. I didn\u2019t know you were just being a teenager. I thought you were like . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. And I didn\u2019t want Claire to be hurt. It took me a while\u2014years\u2014to see that you weren\u2019t like Ellie. By then it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am like Mama,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cYou\u2019ve been Claire\u2019s rock through this nightmare. You have the kind of heart that saves people, even if you don\u2019t believe it. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t see that when I was younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of things have become clearer lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sat back in the pew. \u201cI don\u2019t see how I\u2019ll get through this,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Meghann had no answer. How could she, when the question haunted her as well?</p> <p>A few minutes later, the door opened again. This time it was Bobby. He looked terrible.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to see Ali,\u201d he whispered harshly. \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Sam made a fluttery sound. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Meg said, slowly rising.</p><p>Claire must have fallen asleep again. When she woke, the sunlight outside had faded, leaving the room a soft, silvery color.</p><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s awake.\u201d</p><p>She saw her daughter then. Ali clung to Meghann like a little monkey, arms wrapped around her aunt\u2019s neck, feet locked around her waist.</p><p>Claire made a quiet, whimpering sound before she rallied and pulled out a tired smile. The only way to get through this moment was to pretend there would be another. For Ali, she had to believe in a miracle.</p> <p>\u201cHey there, Ali Kat. I hear you\u2019re eating all the cinnamon rolls in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>Alison giggled. \u201cOnly three, Mommy. Aunt Meg said if I had one more I\u2019d throw up.\u201d</p><p>Claire opened her arms. \u201cCome here, baby.\u201d</p><p>Meg leaned forward and gently deposited Ali into Claire\u2019s thin arms. She hugged her daughter tightly, couldn\u2019t seem to let go. She was battling tears and hanging on to her smile by a thread when she whispered into her daughter\u2019s tiny, shell-pink ear, \u201cYou remember how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mommy,\u201d Ali said, burrowing closer. She lay still as a sleeping baby, quieter than she\u2019d lain in years. That was when Claire knew that Ali understood, but when her daughter leaned closer to say, \u201cI told God I\u2019d never ask for Cap\u2019n Crunch again if He made you all better,\u201d Claire felt something inside her tear away. She clung to her daughter for as long as she could. \u201cTake her home,\u201d she finally said when the pain became more than she could bear.</p><p>Meghann was there instantly, pulling Ali into her arms again.</p><p>But Ali wiggled out of Meg\u2019s grasp and slithered to the molded plastic chair beside the bed. She stood there, on the wobbly chair, staring at Claire.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to die, Mommy,\u201d she said in a husky little voice.</p><p>It hurt too much even to cry. Claire looked at her precious baby and managed a smile. \u201cI know that, punkin, and I love you more than all the stars in the sky. Now you skedaddle on home with Grandpa and Bobby. I hear they\u2019re going to take you to see a movie.\u201d</p><p>Meghann picked Ali up again. Claire could see that she was near tears, too. \u201cMake Bobby go home,\u201d she said to her sister. \u201cHe\u2019s been here every night. Tell him I said Ali needs him tonight.\u201d</p><p>Meg reached out, squeezed her hand. \u201cWe need you.\u201d</p><p>Claire sighed. \u201cI need to sleep now\u201d was all she could think of to say.</p><p>Hours later, Claire came awake with a start. Her heart was pounding so hard she felt light-headed. For a split second, she didn\u2019t know where she was. Then she saw the flowers and the machines. If she squinted, she could make out the wall clock. Moonlight glinted on the domed glass face. It was 4:00.</p><p>In a few hours, they\u2019d crack her skull open.</p><p>She started to panic, then saw Meg was in the corner, sprawled in one of those uncomfortable chairs, sleeping.</p><p>\u201cMeg,\u201d she whispered, hitting her control button; the bed tilted upward. The buzzing of the machinery sounded loud, but Meghann didn\u2019t wake.</p><p>\u201cMeg,\u201d she said in a louder voice.</p><p>Meghann sat upright and looked around. \u201cDid I miss the test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver here.\u201d</p><p>Meghann blinked, pushed a hand through her wild, tangled hair. \u201cIs it time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We have four more hours.\u201d</p><p>Meghann got up, dragged the chair over to the bed. \u201cDid you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff and on. The prospect of someone cracking your skull open keeps a girl wideawake.\u201d Claire glanced out the window at the moonlight. Suddenly, she was so afraid, she was shaking. All the veneer of bravery she\u2019d applied for her family and friends had worn off, leaving her vulnerable. \u201cDo you remember what I used to do when I had a nightmare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to crawl into bed with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That old cot in the trailer\u2019s living room.\u201d Claire smiled. \u201cIt smelled like spilled bourbon and cigarette smoke, and it was too small for the two of us. But when I got into bed and you hugged me, I thought nothing could hurt me.\u201d She looked up at Meghann, then very gently peeled back the blanket.</p><p>Meghann hesitated, then climbed into bed with Claire, drawing her close. If she noticed how thin Claire had gotten, she didn\u2019t comment on it.</p><p>\u201cHow come we forgot all the things that mattered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wasted a lot of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Meg said. \u201cI should have said that a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Claire reached for Meg\u2019s hand, held it. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you something, Meg, and I don\u2019t want any of your bullshit to get in the way. I can\u2019t ask this twice; saying each word is like swallowing broken glass. If the worst happens, I want you to be a part of Ali\u2019s life. She\u2019ll need a mother.\u201d</p><p>Meg squeezed Claire\u2019s hand so tightly it cut off the blood flow to her fingers. Long seconds passed before she answered in a throaty voice, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she always remembers you.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded; she couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>After that, they lay in the darkness, each holding the other one together until dawn lit the room and the doctors took Claire away.</p><p>Meghann stood at the window, staring out at the jumble of beige buildings across the street. In the three hours since they\u2019d taken Claire to surgery, Meghann had counted every window and every door in this view. Twenty-three people had passed the corner of Broadway and James. Another sixteen had stood in line outside the tiny Starbucks.</p><p>Someone tugged on her sleeve. Meghann looked down. There was Alison, staring up at her. \u201cI\u2019m thirsty.\u201d</p><p>Meghann stared into those bright green eyes and almost burst into tears. \u201cOkay, honey,\u201d she said instead, scooping Ali into her arms. Forcing herself not to squeeze the girl too hard, she carried her down to the cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cI want a Pepsi Blue. That\u2019s what you got me last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only eleven in the morning. Juice is better for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Meg swallowed hard. \u201cDid you know your Mommy loved Tab when she was little? And Fresca. But I made her drink orange juice.\u201d</p><p>Meghann paid for the juice, then carried Alison back to the waiting room. But when she leaned over to put Ali down, the girl squeezed harder.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ali,\u201d Meg said, holding her niece. She wanted to promise that Mommy would be better, but the words caught in her throat.</p><p>She sat down, still holding Ali, and stroked her hair. Within minutes, the child was asleep.</p><p>From across the room, Gina looked up, saw her holding Ali, then went back to her crossword puzzle. Sam, Mama, Bobby, Karen, and Charlotte were playing cards. Joe sat off in the corner, reading a magazine. He hadn\u2019t looked up in hours, hadn\u2019t spoken to anyone. But then, none of them had spoken much. What was there to say?</p><p>Around noon, the surgical nurse came out, told them all that it would be several more hours.</p><p>\u201cYou should get something to eat,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cIt won\u2019t help Claire if you all pass out.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded, stood up. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said to everyone. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here for a while. Lunch is on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here,\u201d Meghann said. Food was the last thing on her mind. \u201cAli needs the sleep.\u201d</p><p>Bobby squeezed her shoulder. \u201cYou want us to bring you something back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a sandwich for Ali\u2014peanut butter and jelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>When they\u2019d gone, Meghann leaned back in her chair, rested her head against the wall. In her arms, Ali snored quietly. It seemed like yesterday that Meg had held Claire this way, telling her baby sister that everything would be okay.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost four hours, damn it. What\u2019re they all doin\u2019 in there, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Meg looked up. Mama stood there, holding an unlit Virginia Slims cigarette. Her makeup had faded a little, been smudged off in places, and without it, she looked faded, too. \u201cI thought you went out for lunch with everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat cafeteria food? I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ll eat an early dinner in my hotel suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Her mother collapsed into the molded plastic chair beside her. \u201cThis is the worst day of my life, honest to God. An that\u2019s sayin\u2019 something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard. Waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go find Sam. Maybe he\u2019ll want to play cards or somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave him, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man\u201d was all Mama said.</p><p>At first, Meghann thought it wasn\u2019t an answer. Then she understood.</p><p>Mama had run away because Sam was a good man. Meghann could relate to that kind of fear.</p><p>\u201cThere are things I should have said,\u201d Mama whispered, gesturing impatiently with her unlit cigarette. \u201cBut I never was too good without a script.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us talks really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd thank God. Talkin\u2019 doesn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d Mama stood up suddenly. \u201cTalkin\u2019 to reporters always cheers me up. Bye, Meggy. I\u2019ll be across the street when\u201d\u2014her voice trembled\u2014\u201cy\u2019all hear that she\u2019s fine.\u201d With that, she sailed out of the waiting room, her smile Hollywood bright. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One hour bled into the next until finally, around 4:00, Dr. Weissman came into the waiting room. Meghann was the first to see him. She tightened her hold on Ali and got to her feet. Bobby stood next; then Sam and Mama; then Joe, Gina, Karen, and Charlotte. In a silent group, they moved toward the doctor, who rubbed a hand through his thinning hair and managed a tired smile.</p><p>\u201cThe surgery went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d they whispered together.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s a long way from out of the woods. The tumor was more invasive than we thought.\u201d He looked up at Joe. \u201cThe next few hours will tell us more.\u201d</p> <p>THIRTY-ONE</p><p>CLAIRE WOKE UP IN RECOVERY FEELING GROGGY AND confused. A headache pounded behind her eyes. She was about to hit her call button and ask for an Advil when it struck her.</p><p>She was alive.</p><p>She tested her memory by counting to one hundred and trying to list all the towns she\u2019d lived in as a child, but she\u2019d only made it to Barstow when the first of the nurses came in. After that, she was poked and prodded and tested until she couldn\u2019t think.</p><p>Her family took turns sitting with her. Two of her most vivid postsurgery memories were of Bobby, sitting by her bed, holding an ice pack to her head for hours at a time, and of her dad, feeding her ice chips when she got thirsty. Meghann had brought in Ali\u2019s newest drawing; this one was three brightly colored stick figures standing by a river. In an uncertain scrawl across the bottom it read: I love you Momy.</p> <p>By the second full postop day, Claire had become irritable. She hurt now; her body ached everywhere and the bruises on her forehead from the iron halo had begun to throb like hell. They wouldn\u2019t give her much in the way of pain medication because they didn\u2019t want to mask any surgical aftereffects.</p><p>\u201cI feel like shit,\u201d she said to Meghann, who sat in the chair by the window.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p><p>Claire managed to smile. \u201cAgain with the bedside manner. Do you think they\u2019ll come soon?\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked up from her book, which Claire noticed was upside down. \u201cI\u2019ll check again.\u201d Meg put the book down and stood up as the door opened.</p><p>Claire\u2019s day-shift nurse, Dolores, walked into the room, smiling. She was pushing an empty wheelchair. \u201cIt\u2019s time for your MRI.\u201d</p> <p>Claire panicked. Suddenly she didn\u2019t want to go, didn\u2019t want to know. She felt better. That was good enough\u2014</p><p>Meghann came to her side, squeezed her hand. The touch was enough to get Claire over the hump. \u201cOkay, Dolores. Take me away.\u201d</p><p>When they rolled into the hallway, Bobby was there, waiting for them. \u201cIs it time?\u201d</p><p>It was Meghann who answered. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Bobby held Claire\u2019s hand all the way to Nuclear Medicine. It took an act of will to leave them behind and go down that familiar white hallway alone.</p><p>A few minutes later, as she lay once again in the jackhammer coffin of the MRI, she visualized a clean, clear scan of her brain, saw it so clearly that by the time it was over, her temples were wet with tears.</p><p>Bobby, Meghann, and Dolores were waiting for her when she was finished.</p><p>Dolores helped Claire into the wheelchair, then positioned her slippered feet on the footrests. Back to the room they went.</p> <p>After that, the waiting was unbearable. Meghann paced the small hospital room; Bobby squeezed Claire\u2019s hand so tightly she lost all feeling in her fingers. Sam came in every few minutes.</p><p>Finally, Dolores returned. \u201cThe docs are ready for you, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Little things got Claire through the wheelchair ride without screaming\u2014the warm pressure of Bobby\u2019s hand on her shoulder, the easy patter of Dolores\u2019s monologue, the way Meghann stayed close.</p><p>\u201cWell. Here we are.\u201d Dolores stopped at the office door and knocked.</p><p>Someone called out, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Dolores patted Claire\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re praying for you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Meghann took control of the wheelchair and guided Claire into the office. There were several doctors in the room. Dr. Weissman was the first to speak. \u201cGood morning, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she answered, trying not to tense up. The men waited for Meghann to sit down. Finally they realized that she wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>Dr. Weissman clicked on the viewbox. There were Claire\u2019s films. Her brain. She grabbed the wheels and rolled forward.</p><p>She studied the film, then looked up at the men. \u201cI don\u2019t see any tumor.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Weissman smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t, either. I think we got it all, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She\u2019d hoped for this, prayed for it. She\u2019d even worked to believe it, but now she saw that her belief had stood on a shaky foundation.</p><p>\u201cInitial lab reports indicate that it was a low-grade astrocytoma,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot a glioblastoma multiforme? Thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that was good news. Also, it was benign,\u201d Dr. Weissman said.</p><p>One of the other doctors stepped forward. \u201cYou are a very lucky woman, Mrs. Austin. Dr. Weissman did an incredible job. However, as you know, most brain tumors will regenerate. Twenty-eight percent of all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Claire didn\u2019t realize that she\u2019d yelled out the word until she saw the startled looks on the doctors\u2019 faces. She glanced at Meg, who nodded encouragingly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your statistics. It was benign, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cbut benign in the brain is a rather misleading term. All brain tumors can ultimately be fatal, benign or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah. Limited space in the head and all that,\u201d Claire said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a cancer that\u2019s going to spread through my body, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s gone now and it was benign. That\u2019s all I want to hear. You can talk to me about treatments from here on, but not about chances and survival rates. My sister immersed herself in your numbers.\u201d She smiled at Meg. \u201cShe thought I wasn\u2019t listening, but I was. She had a file that she kept on the kitchen counter\u2014a file she labeled Hope. In it, there were dozens of personal accounts of people who\u2019d been diagnosed with brain tumors more than seven years ago and were still alive. You know what they all had in common?\u201d</p><p>Only Dr. Weissman was smiling.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d all been told they\u2019d live less than six months. You guys are like Seattle weathermen in June. All you ever predict is rain. But I\u2019m not taking an umbrella with me. My future is sunny.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Weissman\u2019s smile grew. He crossed the room and bent down to her ear. \u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cThere are no words to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe Wyatt is the man you should thank. Good luck to you, Claire.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she was back in her room, Claire broke down and cried. She couldn\u2019t seem to stop. Bobby held her tightly, kissing her bald head, until finally she looked up at him. \u201cI love you, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her fiercely.</p><p>She clung to him, then whispered in his ear, \u201cGo get our little girl. I want to tell her Mommy\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>He hurried out.</p><p>\u201cYou were amazing in there,\u201d Meg said when they were alone.</p><p>\u201cMy new motto is: Don\u2019t screw with Baldie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Meg grinned.</p><p>Claire reached for her sister\u2019s hand, held it. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Meg kissed Claire\u2019s screw-marked forehead and whispered, \u201cWe\u2019re sisters.\u201d It was answer enough. \u201cI\u2019ll go get Mama now. She\u2019ll probably bring a film crew.\u201d With a smile, Meghann left the room.</p><p>\u201cThe tumor is gone,\u201d Claire practiced saying aloud to the empty room.</p><p>Then she laughed.</p><p>Meghann found everyone in the cafeteria. Bobby was already there, talking to Sam. Mama was at the food line, signing autographs. The Bluesers and Alison were sitting in the corner, talking quietly among themselves. The only one missing was Joe.</p><p>\u201cAnd there I was,\u201d Mama was saying to a rapt audience, \u201call ready to take the stage in a dress that wouldn\u2019t zip up. I am not,\u201d she said, laughing prettily, \u201ca flat-chested woman, so y\u2019all can imagine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d Meghann said, touching her arm.</p><p>Mama spun around. When she saw Meghann, her painted smile faded. For a moment, she looked smaller, vulnerable. Little Joanie Jojovitch from the wrong side of the tracks in Detroit. \u201cWell?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGo on up, Mama. It\u2019s good news.\u201d</p><p>Mama sighed heavily. \u201cOf course it is. Y\u2019all were so dramatic.\u201d She turned back to her audience. \u201cI hate to leave in the middle of a story, but it seems my daughter has made a miraculous recovery. I am reminded of a television movie I once did, where. . . .\u201d</p><p>Meghann walked away.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Meg!\u201d Alison said, jumping up, throwing herself at Meg, who scooped her up and gave her a kiss. \u201cMy mommy is all better!\u201d</p><p>At that, another whoop went up from the Bluesers. \u201cCome on,\u201d Gina said to her friends. \u201cLet\u2019s go see Claire.\u201d</p><p>Bobby walked up to Meghann. \u201cCome on, Ali Gator,\u201d he said, pulling the little girl into his arms. \u201cLet\u2019s go kiss Mommy.\u201d He started to walk away, then paused and turned back. Very gently, he kissed Meghann\u2019s cheek, whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Meghann closed her eyes, surprised by the depth of her emotion. When she looked up again, through a blur of tears, Sam was coming toward her.</p><p>He moved slowly, as if he were afraid his legs would give out. He reached out, touched her cheek.</p><p>It was a long moment before he said softly, \u201cI\u2019ll expect you at the house this Thanksgiving. None of your lame-ass excuses. We\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>Meg thought of all the years she\u2019d declined Claire\u2019s offer, and all the years one hadn\u2019t been extended. Then she thought of last Thanksgiving, when she\u2019d eaten Raisin Bran for dinner by herself. All that time, she\u2019d pretended that she wasn\u2019t lonely. No more pretending for her, and no more being alone when she had a family to be with. \u201cJust try and keep me away.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded and kept walking. She saw that he looped over by the food line and grabbed Mama\u2019s arm, dragging her away from the crowd. She blew air-kisses as she stumbled along beside him.</p><p>Meghann stood there a minute longer, uncertain of where she should go.</p><p>Joe.</p><p>She ran through the hallways, smiling and giving thumbs-ups to the nurses and aides who had become more than friends in the past few weeks.</p><p>In the waiting room, she skidded to a stop.</p><p>It was empty. The magazine he\u2019d been reading lay, still open, on the table.</p><p>She glanced back down the corridor, but Claire didn\u2019t need her right now. There would be time for them later, when the excitement had dimmed and real life returned. There was a lifetime left for them. Right now, what Claire needed was clothes to wear home from the hospital.</p><p>Meghann went to the elevators and rode down to the lobby, then headed outside. She couldn\u2019t wait to call Elizabeth with the news.</p><p>It was a glorious, sunny day. Everything about the city felt sharper, cleaner. The distant Sound shone silvery blue between the gray high-rises. She walked downhill, thinking about so many things\u2014her life, her job, her family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe she\u2019d change her career, practice a different kind of law. Or maybe she\u2019d start a business, sort of an informational clearinghouse for people with brain tumors; maybe she could find a disillusioned doctor to partner with her. Or maybe a charitable company, one that helped finance the best of care in the worst of times. The world seemed wide-open to her now, full of new possibilities.</p><p>It took her less than a half an hour to walk home. She was just about to cross the street when she saw him, standing outside the front door of her building.</p><p>When he saw her, Joe pulled away from the wall he\u2019d been leaning against and crossed the street. \u201cGina told me where you lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStu told you about the MRI?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI spent the last hour with him. It looks good for Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He moved toward her. \u201cI\u2019m tired of not caring, Meg,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m tired of pretending I died when Diana did.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. They were close now, close enough so that he could kiss her if he chose. \u201cWhat chance do we have, a couple like us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a chance. It\u2019s all any of us gets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve survived it before.\u201d He touched her face tenderly; it made her want to cry. No man had ever been so gentle with her. \u201cAnd maybe we could fall in love.\u201d</p><p>She gazed up into his eyes and saw a hope for the future. More than that, even. She saw a little of the love he was talking about and, for the first time, she believed in it. If Claire could get well, anything was possible. She put her arms around him and pressed onto her toes. Just before she kissed him she dared to whisper, \u201cMaybe we already have.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>One Year Later</p><p>THE NOISE WAS DEAFENING\u2014THE FAIRGROUNDS WERE jammed with people; kids screaming from the carnival rides, parents yelling after them, carnies barking out enticements to play the games, the musical cadence of the calliope.</p> <p>Alison was up ahead, dragging Joe from ride to ride. Meghann and Claire walked along behind, talking softly, carrying the collection of cheesy stuffed animals and cheap glass trinkets that Joe had won. Claire\u2019s limp was the only physical reminder of her ordeal, and it was getting less pronounced each day. Her hair had grown out; it was curlier and blonder than before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Claire said, signaling to Joe. The four of them fell in line together, walking past the refreshment stand and turning left toward the fairgrounds\u2019 bleachers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a crowd already,\u201d Claire said. She sounded nervous.</p><p>\u201cOf course there is,\u201d Meghann said.</p><p>\u201cHurry, Mommy, hurry!\u201d Alison was bouncing up and down. At the special side door, Claire showed her backstage pass. They made their way through the staging area, past the musicians and singers who were warming up.</p><p>Bobby saw them coming and waved. Alison ran for him. He scooped her into his arms and twirled her around. \u201cMy daddy\u2019s gonna sing tonight,\u201d she said loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>\u201cI sure am.\u201d Bobby looped an arm around Claire and pulled her in for a kiss. \u201cWish me luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p> <p>They talked to him for a few more minutes, then left him to get ready.</p><p>They climbed the bleachers and found their seats in the fourth row. Meghann helped Claire sit down; her sister was still unsteady sometimes.</p><p>\u201cKent Ames called last week,\u201d Claire said. \u201cMama ripped him a new one for canceling Bobby\u2019s contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been cussing him out for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Last week she told him she\u2019d gotten Bobby an audition at Mercury Records. Kent Ames threw a fit. It seems he wants to give Bobby another chance, after all. Said he hopes Bobby\u2019s priorities are straight this time.\u201d Claire smiled.</p><p>A man took the stage and announced, \u201cBob-by Jack Austin!\u201d</p><p>The crowd applauded politely.</p><p>Alison jumped up and down, screaming, \u201cYay, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>Bobby leaped up onstage with his guitar. He scanned the audience, found Claire, and blew her a kiss. \u201cThis song is for my wife, who taught me about love and courage. I love you, baby.\u201d He strummed the guitar and started to sing. His clear, beautiful voice wrapped around the music and mesmerized the crowd. He sang about finding the woman of his dreams and falling in love with her, about standing by her side in dark times. In the final stanza, his voice fell to a throaty whisper; the crowd leaned forward to hear the words.</p><p>When I saw you stumble</p><p>over rocks along the way</p><p>I learned the truth of real love</p><p>and the gift of one more day.</p><p>The applause this time was explosive. Half the women in the audience were weeping.</p><p>Meghann put an arm around her sister. \u201cI told you he\u2019d make a great husband. I liked that guy from the first moment I saw him.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. \u201cYeah, right. And what about you and Joe? You guys are practically living together. It looks to me like maybe there\u2019s a prenuptial agreement in your future.\u201d</p><p>Meghann looked at Joe, who was on his feet, clapping. Alison was in his arms. Since he\u2019d started practicing medicine again, he said anything was possible. They\u2019d taught each other to believe in love again. \u201cA prenup? Me? No way. We were thinking about a small wedding. Outside\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere it rains? Where bugs breed? That outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe with hamburgers and hot dogs and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGina\u2019s potato salad.\u201d</p><p>They both said it at the same time and laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Meghann said, leaning against her sister. \u201cThat kind of wedding.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
