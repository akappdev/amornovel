We\u2019ve all heard of them\u2014eating pop rocks and soda will make your stomach explode; the tourist who gets his kidney stolen in a faraway land; alligators living in the sewers. By the time you reach adulthood, you realize they\u2019re all crocks of shit. Stories that get passed on from generation to generation to scare the hell out of us and keep us on the straight and narrow.</p> <p>Well . . . except for the alligator one\u2014I\u2019ve lived in New York City my whole life and that\u2019s completely possible.</p><p>But the others, yeah, all lies.</p><p>In the latter part of the last century, new urban legends sprung up that society\u2019s all too willing to fall for: action stars who die on movie sets doing stunts; rain-forest plants that cure obesity; and Justin Bieber actually having a set of balls.</p><p>Sometime in the late 1970s, after the city\u2019s crime rate began to drop and New York became more tourist friendly, another urban legend was started\u2014one that annually throws a fucking wrench into the otherwise smoothly operating machine that is my life.</p><p>That would be the myth that New York City is a prime place to go Christmas shopping.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what moron started the rumor, but I will gladly stick my foot up his ass if I ever find out. Because now, scores of people from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, and upstate clog our bridges, tunnels, and streets from Black Friday to Christmas Eve, scurrying to make their holiday purchases like rats going after a gourmet piece of cheese. To get little Timmy a train set from FAO Schwarz and grandma a brooch from Tiffany.</p> <p>Sure, they\u2019ve heard of the Internet. Of course they know it\u2019d be easier\u2014and less expensive\u2014to order online and have packages delivered right to their front door.</p><p>But for them, it\u2019s not about what\u2019s easier. Christmas shopping in the city is now\u2014say it with me\u2014tradition.</p><p>They want to see the big tree, the lights. They want to stand in an endless line to skate in Rockefeller Center and take a picture with Santa at Macy\u2019s in Herald Square. They want to watch the fucking Rockettes and eat a family dinner at a restaurant whose menu has been price-gouged to the gills.</p><p>You can forget about getting a cab\u2014they\u2019re all taken. And even walking down the sidewalk is an exercise in frustration, because every few feet a stroller-pushing, shopping-bag-carrying tourist will come to a complete frigging stop right in front of you to take a picture of the red-and-green-lit Empire State Building.</p><p>You think I sound pissed off? How very perceptive of you. The Christmas spirit and me? We\u2019re not friends. Ebenezer Scrooge had the right idea: bah fucking humbug.</p><p>The reason for my current antiholiday rant is because I\u2019m in line\u2014the same line I\u2019ve been in for forty-five minutes\u2014trying to buy a last-minute gift for my perfect wife.</p><p>Please, take my money and just let me fucking leave.</p><p>When it comes to gifts, I\u2019m usually way ahead; eleventh-hour purchases aren\u2019t my style. But walking past Saks Fifth Avenue, I saw a pair of Valentino crystal and silk heels that would look amazing on Kate. She\u2019ll enjoy wearing them, and I will definitely enjoy watching her wear them\u2014especially naked\u2014so it\u2019s a win-win.</p> <p>Except for the line.</p><p>I\u2019m not used to waiting in lines. I\u2019m used to personal shoppers and commission-seeking salespeople vying for my attention with phrases like, \u201cCan I hold that for you, Mr. Evans?\u201d \u201cWe have that in four other colors, Mr. Evans.\u201d \u201cWould you like that wrapped, Mr. Evans?\u201d</p><p>But this is Christmas Eve. Which means stores don\u2019t give a crap about the quality of the shopping experience. It\u2019s all about quantity\u2014getting as many shoppers through their doors as possible before closing time. Which brings me to my next point:</p><p>Most people in the world today are fucking idiots.</p><p>Don\u2019t laugh\u2014you may be one of the walking stupid and just not know it. But it\u2019s true. Say what you want about income inequality or the inferior public school system\u2014the harsh truth is, the majority of the population is simply not intelligent. And even more suck at their job. They don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about doing it well or longevity; they\u2019re only interested in performing the minimum required to get a check.</p><p>And there\u2019s no better example of that than the temporary holiday employee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Companies don\u2019t hire them because of their skill or what they may contribute to the work force. They\u2019re hired because they have a pulse. Spare bodies, decked out in holiday ensembles, whose main purpose is to corral consumers the same way a fence encages cattle. And they\u2019re equally as helpful.</p><p>The twentysomething blonde behind the register is one such employee. You can tell by the slow, cautious way she pecks at the keys and her confused expression if someone\u2014God forbid\u2014asks her where an item can be found. She\u2019s the reason for the sick amount of time I\u2019ve wasted waiting to buy these shoes.</p><p>The good news is, I\u2019m about to cross the finish line. I step up, with only one more customer left in front of me\u2014a tall, regal-looking older lady in a pricey red coat and genuine pearl earrings. I take out my wallet so I can pay as quickly as possible and get the hell out of here.</p><p>See the blazing yule before us,</p> <p>Fa la la la la la, la la la la.</p><p>Strike the harp and join the chorus,</p><p>Fa la la la la, la la la la</p><p>But my hope of an imminent escape is crushed when the blond temp rings up the purple Burberry of London tie and tells the old lady, \u201cThat will be one hundred and ninety-five dollars and thirty cents.\u201d</p><p>Pearl Earrings looks offended. \u201cThat can\u2019t be correct. This tie is on sale for one hundred and fifty dollars\u2014not one eighty.\u201d</p> <p>A panicked expression swamps the blonde\u2019s face. She taps a few buttons on the register and swipes the tie\u2019s bar code with the red laser beam. \u201cIt\u2019s ringing up at one hundred and eighty. Plus tax.\u201d</p><p>I push a hand through my dark hair and listen for the predictable old woman response.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s false advertising! I refuse to pay a penny over one fifty.\u201d</p><p>The hopeless temp looks around for assistance, but there\u2019s none to be found. So, like the knight in shining armor I am, I come to her rescue.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do a manual override?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes gaze at me without a clue. \u201cA what?\u201d</p> <p>I gesture to the register. \u201cIt\u2019s a computer\u2014it has to do what you tell it to. Override the price and put it in as one fifty.\u201d</p><p>She gulps. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know how to do that.\u201d</p><p>Of course she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to find my manager.\u201d</p><p>No. No way I\u2019m gonna stand here twiddling my thumbs for another twenty frigging minutes. And I refuse to walk out, either\u2014too much of my precious time is already invested in these shoes.</p><p>Despite the frustration churning in my gut, I shift my attention to the pearl-wearing red coat and turn on the charm that\u2014even with a ring on my finger\u2014women of all ages are still helpless to resist. \u201cLast-minute Christmas shopping?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cThat\u2019s right, for my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have excellent taste. I\u2019m a connoisseur of ties myself, and that one is superb.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s working\u2014she smiles. \u201cThank you, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what, how about we save some time and I\u2019ll front the extra thirty dollars so you can purchase this tie for your lucky husband, at not a penny over one hundred and fifty dollars?\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkles. It was already wrinkled with age\u2014but now it wrinkles more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the cost, it\u2019s the principle of the matter. They should stand by the price advertised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more. Principles are important\u2014which is exactly why I\u2019m making my offer. Here it is, Christmas Eve, and I\u2019ve been too busy to show any goodwill toward my fellow man\u2014or woman. This gesture will make me really feel the Christmas spirit. You\u2019d be doing me a favor, miss.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cmiss\u201d was just the right touch. Because her eyes sparkle, and she grins warmly. \u201cWell, when you put it that way, how can I say no?\u201d</p><p>I wink. \u201cI guess you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I smack thirty dollars on the counter and the old lady hands over her black card. While the very relieved temp places the boxed tie in a shopping bag with a ridiculous amount of useless tissue paper, Pearl Earrings glances at my left hand. Then she pulls a business card out of her purse, slides it toward me, and whispers low, \u201cMy husband and I host parties every month. Parties for . . . adventurous . . . couples.\u201d</p><p>Oh boy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d certainly be doing me a favor if you attend.\u201d She winks. \u201cI would thoroughly enjoy having you. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>I wait until she walks away before I chuckle. Just goes to show you\u2014don\u2019t judge a freak by their cover. The wild ones come in all shapes, sizes . . . and ages.</p><p>The holiday-hire hands me my prized shoes, and I\u2019m finally able to head home to my wife and our terribly wonderful son.</p><p>Follow me in merry measure,</p><p>Fa la la, la la la, la la la.</p><p>While I tell of Yuletide treasure,</p><p>Fa la la la la, la la la la</p><p>I shut the door to our apartment and toss the mail down on the front hall table\u2014mostly last-minute Christmas cards. Nothing says \u201cyou were an afterthought\u201d like getting a Christmas card on Christmas Eve. I hang up my black wool coat and slide the shopping bag with Kate\u2019s new shoes under the table, to be wrapped later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unlike me, Kate is good about waiting. She likes to be surprised, so I don\u2019t have to put in the extra effort of hiding her gifts to keep her from sneaking a peek.</p><p>I walk into the living room\u2014and stop dead in my tracks. I was planning on going home only for a few minutes, to let Kate know I\u2019d be at the office the rest of the evening. But those plans get tossed out the window.</p><p>Because reclining in the chaise longue is a gift that beats the hell out of anything I\u2019ve ever seen sitting under a tree.</p><p>My wife, Kate Brooks-Evans.</p> <p>Kate Brooks-Evans in lingerie.</p><p>Kate Brooks-Evans in see-through, Christmas-themed lingerie.</p><p>Her smooth legs are crossed at the ankle, bare except for the spiky heeled, shiny black boots that end below her knees. A sheer red nightie, trimmed in fluffy white fur, covers tiny red panties\u2014held together by two silk bows tied at her hips. A shiny black belt cinches her flat stomach, and more white fur embellishes the strapless neckline, bringing my attention to her perfect breasts and pink nipples pressing against the gauzy fabric. Kate\u2019s luscious dark hair falls over her shoulders, curled at the ends, and a fleecy red-and-white Santa hat sits on top of her head.</p><p>She smiles mischievously. \u201cWelcome home, Santa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Claus,\u201d I smirk, \u201cyou\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was time for a makeover.\u201d</p><p>I start unbuttoning my shirt. \u201cWant to sit on my lap . . . or my face . . . and tell me if you\u2019ve been a nice girl this year?\u201d</p><p>Kate chuckles. Then she tucks her legs under her, rises onto all fours, and crawls down the chaise toward me.</p><p>It\u2019s so damn sexy my cock stiffens so hard that you could hang an ornament from it.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve tried to be nice, but every time I look at you, the naughty just takes over.\u201d</p><p>Kate bites her lip\u2014\u2019cause she knows it drives me crazy\u2014and watches my every move as I toss my shirt on the floor. Her eyes caress my arms, chest, and abs, then focus on my fingers as I slowly unbutton my jeans and lower the zipper.</p> <p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought \u2018nice\u2019 was way fucking overrated.\u201d</p><p>With my typical lack of shyness, I push my pants down and step out of them. My dick juts out proudly, eye level with Kate, straining for her attention. But before she touches me, I remember James\u2014our five-year-old.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the evil elf, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dropped him off at your sister\u2019s. He\u2019s decorating gingerbread cookies with Mackenzie and Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd biting their heads off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Here\u2019s an interesting fact: how you eat a gingerbread man says a lot about your personality. Head-first eaters are ambitious, independent, and magnetic. Feet-first are the more artistic, creative types, and those who start with the hands are kind and nurturing. Same rules apply for chocolate Easter bunnies.</p><p>Maybe you\u2019re wondering how I came to know this information?</p> <p>I looked it up. Because James is a head-first eater.</p><p>And Kate and I were . . . unsettled . . . by all the headless chocolate bunnies lying around last Easter.</p><p>But\u2014good news\u2014he\u2019s not a serial killer in the making, he just has the same driven, bound-to-be-a-success temperament as his parents.</p><p>During my research, I also discovered that sociopaths and CEOs share a lot of character traits\u2014but we\u2019ll talk about that another time.</p><p>There are other, more crucial matters at hand.</p><p>\u201cSo, we have the whole apartment to ourselves?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Kate licks her lips happily. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>My dick gets even harder, thinking of the possibilities. \u201cThat means we can fuck in the living room? The hallway? The kitchen?\u201d</p><p>A center island is the perfect height to comfortably eat a woman out while she\u2019s perched on the counter.</p><p>Coincidence?</p><p>I think not.</p><p>Kind of makes you rethink the meaning of \u201ceat-in kitchen,\u201d doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>Kate replies, \u201cYes. Yes. And definitely yes. I\u2019ve missed kitchen sex.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve missed bending her over the arm of the sofa and pounding her from behind.</p><p>Oh\u2014and sleeping naked. I haven\u2019t slept naked for a year and a half. Not since my son crawled into our bed in the middle of the night and asked why I wasn\u2019t wearing pajamas. Telling him the truth\u2014that it\u2019s liberating and makes it more convenient to screw his mother\u2014was out of the question. So I just said I forgot.</p><p>He thought that was funny. And I\u2019ve slept in boxers almost every night since.</p><p>When people tell you having kids changes things\u2014they\u2019re not screwing around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But all thoughts of our child fly out of my head as Kate envelops my dick in her warm, wet mouth. My head lolls back, relishing the sensation of her stroking tongue. But after a few seconds, I have to look and take in the sensual sight of Kate\u2019s head bobbing up and down, doing what she does so very well.</p><p>My hand skims her spine. I lift the sheer red fabric, exposing her firm ass, scarcely covered by the red silk panties. My stomach contracts in hot pleasure as she sucks me harder. I pull on the red ribbons tied at her hips and the panties fall away. Then I knead the soft flesh of her ass before sliding my fingers between her open legs\u2014into her warm *. She\u2019s already slick for me; her muscles tighten around my fingers as I pump them slowly.</p><p>I pull my hips back and I slide out of Kate\u2019s awesome mouth. I cradle her face with my hands and bring her up to meet my lips. We kiss playfully, my teeth scraping along her jaw to her neck, licking and sucking\u2014both of us moaning. I wrap an arm around her waist and lift her to her feet, dragging us to the couch.</p><p>Without a word, Kate assumes my favorite position\u2014bent at the waist, her stomach draped over the arm, feet apart, her delectable ass high and waiting. Her hands brace against the cushions and my hand rests on her shoulder. My other hand grasps my dick and makes two teasing passes across the opening of her sweet cunt. She wriggles back against me, reaches out her hand, and pushes behind my thigh\u2014trying to maneuver me where she needs me to be.</p><p>Always so eager.</p><p>Although our sex life is fantastically frequent, we can\u2019t be as . . . vocal . . . as we once were. Not with a kid in the house. So I plan on taking advantage of this opportunity to hear Kate\u2019s voice in all its hedonistically desperate beauty.</p><p>I cover her\u2014my chest flush with her back\u2014nudge her silken hair with my nose, and bring my lips to her ear. \u201cDo you want me to fuck you, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she groans. \u201cYessss.\u201d</p><p>I nip her earlobe. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Yeah. She\u2019s gonna have to do better than that.</p><p>I straighten up, smiling, and tease her again with the head of my dick. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t quite get that.\u201d</p><p>Her hips squirm with frustration, and she yells, \u201cI want you to fuck me, Drew!\u201d</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cGod, now . . . do it . . . please. Fuck . . .\u201d</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>I push inside her with a moan and her back arches. I rest my hand on her hip, holding her in place as I rear back. Then thrust in long and slow and deep.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she keens loudly. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>I look down where I move in and out of her\u2014disappearing into her gorgeous, welcoming body. It\u2019s a view that never gets old.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you feel good, Kate. Always so goddamn good.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true. And it\u2019s got nothing to do with the fact that Kate\u2019s is the only * I\u2019ve ever been inside without a rubber.</p><p>It\u2019s her. The life we\u2019ve made together\u2014the way she matches me in every way\u2014her desire, her humor, her mind.</p><p>Her soul.</p> <p>I used to think that stuff about soul mates was bullshit. The idea that out of the billions of people on Earth, there was only one that you\u2019re supposed to be with. That you belong to. Sounded like a fairy tale, a stupid chick flick, or a terrible romance novel that my sister would read.</p><p>But now . . .</p><p>Now I believe there\u2019s something to it. Maybe not for everyone\u2014but definitely for us. Because I just can\u2019t fathom having this profound, intense love that borders on obsession\u2014the good kind\u2014with anyone except her.</p><p>It\u2019s crazy. Like . . . a miracle.</p><p>The rhythm of my hips speeds up, \u2019cause it feels too fucking amazing not to. And Kate drives back against me, meeting me thrust for thrust and moan for moan.</p><p>But then I find the strength to grasp her waist with both hands.</p><p>And still our movements.</p><p>I pull out and Kate groans, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>I spin her around, cup her ass, and press her against me with a squeeze. She stands on her toes to trail hot kisses across my throat.</p><p>\u201cI want you on top,\u201d I explain with a grin. \u201cI want you to ride me.\u201d</p><p>Kate wiggles her eyebrows. \u201cSo you can watch my \u2018bells\u2019 jingle.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She pushes my shoulders, backing me up to the couch. I sit down heavily and she wastes no time climbing aboard. I surge up into her\u2014deeper from this angle\u2014and once again thank God for the wonderfully tight grip of Kate\u2019s snatch.</p><p>She closes her eyes and rocks against me. I yank the strapless nightie down, freeing her breasts, and they jiggle as she rotates her hips in tantalizing circles. I palm them in my hand, so soft and full. Kate gasps as I pinch her already puckered nipples. And she groans when I replace my fingers with my lips. Suckling greedily, I rub my tongue against the pointy peak, savoring the exquisite taste of her skin. Kate rises and falls on me quicker\u2014bucking harder.</p><p>When I grasp her nipple between my teeth, she holds the back of my head\u2014pressing me against her\u2014pulling my hair. I moan around her flesh and lave at her breast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then Kate stiffens, and the sound of her screaming my name echoes around the room as her inner walls clamp down. My fingers dig into her hips as I thrust up once, twice more, then I\u2019m pulsing inside her, grunting and cursing against her chest.</p><p>For a few moments we stay right there\u2014catching our breath. Until Kate leans back and gently brushes my black hair from my forehead. \u201cWere you surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery pleasantly, yes.\u201d</p><p>Her smile is joyful. \u201cGood. It\u2019s nice to finally give you a present that you didn\u2019t already know was coming.\u201d</p> <p>I kiss her soft lips. Then glance down the hall toward the kitchen. \u201cSpeaking of coming . . .\u201d</p><p>Later, after some quality countertop time, Kate and I lay bare ass on the chaise longue, under a downy red throw blanket\u2014recuperating.</p><p>I check my watch. Shit. I have to go, though a big part of me\u2014the large lower part\u2014wants nothing more than to stay right in this spot with my wife. But I kiss Kate\u2019s forehead and force myself to stand. I grab my discarded shirt from the floor, slipping my arms into it.</p><p>Kate rests back on her elbows. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t find my underwear, so I slide on my jeans without them\u2014being ever so careful with the zipper. \u201cI\u2019m going to head into the office for a few hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Kate stutters. \u201c. . . but it\u2019s Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But Media Solutions is finally ready to have a sit-down with Hawaii. We\u2019re going to video conference at nine our time.

Think Twitter, reality TV, and YouTube combined\u2014posting broadcasts from and on your television, the star of your own channel.</p><p>Narcissistic techies will bow down like it\u2019s the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p><p>I give Kate a wink. \u201cBut your holiday seduction was definitely worth the lost work time. That Mrs. Claus outfit is going straight to the top of the spank-bank pile.\u201d</p><p>She blinks and sits up straight. The blanket falls down, exposing one creamy breast . . . and suddenly three hours seems like a whole lot of extra time.</p> <p>I can make do with two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about your lost work time, Drew. Why are you working at all?\u201d Her enunciation sharpens\u2014the way you\u2019d talk to an old person who\u2019s hard of hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>Kate Brooks-Evans is many things\u2014a loving wife, an amazing mother, a brilliant businesswoman. It\u2019s that last one that has me expecting her to understand my rationale.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t do this tonight, I lose the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should have told them it\u2019s their loss, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that\u2019s what you would\u2019ve done if you were in my position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>I button my shirt. And call bullshit. \u201cEasy to say when the deal isn\u2019t actually on your desk, Kate.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t confirm or deny my observation, which means I\u2019m on right on the money. She stands and wraps the blanket snugly around her body. Kate hiding her assets from my appreciative gaze is never a good sign. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be at your sister\u2019s in an hour for dinner. They\u2019re expecting us.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth is pursed, her cheeks are flushed, and there\u2019s a fire in her eyes that . . . well . . . that gives me a renewed boner. Always has, always will.</p><p>My dick likes to argue. Sue him.</p><p>\u201cGo without me. You can represent. Drink eggnog with my mother, pretend to listen to my old man talk about holidays past.\u201d</p><p>Her voice rises. \u201cI don\u2019t want to represent! I want to spend the evening with my husband! There\u2019s a time for work and a time for family, and tonight is supposed to be about family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is about family!\u201d I counter, my voice doing a little raising of its own. \u201cIn the next several hours I\u2019m going to make a shitload of money for our family.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cOh, please. This has nothing to do with the money, Drew. Not for you.\u201d Then a new thought occurs to her. \u201cAnd what about James\u2019s gifts? For weeks we\u2019ve been pushing off putting his big presents together\u2014the bike, the trampoline . . .\u201d</p><p>Damn it. I forgot about those.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if Matthew can come over later and help you out. Until he does, after James is asleep, start to do it on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known I was going to be alone, I would\u2019ve gone home to see my mother.\u201d</p><p>I step closer. \u201cFirst of all, this is your home. Second, we talked about this\u2014I\u2019m not dragging James out to Bumfuck, Ohio, for Christmas. We\u2019d be in line at airport security longer than we\u2019d actually be at your mother\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe spent last Christmas with your side\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if your side wanted to see us that badly, she could\u2019ve hauled her ass to New York. She\u2019s one person\u2014our three beats her one. Majority rules, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew your \u2018sweetheart\u2019\u2014I am so angry at you right now!\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cAnd we both know you\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s mouth widens in a gasp. And a black boot comes hurtling at my head. She has the aim of a major-league closer, but in the last few years I\u2019ve become a master ducker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Smash.</p><p>Another lamp bites the dust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fact you were well aware of before you married me.\u201d I shrug. \u201cNo take-backs.\u201d</p> <p>Kate growls.</p><p>So hot.</p><p>Then she stomps down the hall into our bedroom and slams the door behind her, rattling the picture frames on the walls.</p><p>And they say men are the violent ones.</p><p>I sigh. I just don\u2019t have time to deal with this right now. Don\u2019t look at me like that\u2014I\u2019m not trying to be a prick. I love Kate; I hate that she\u2019s mad. But give me a break\u2014it\u2019s one day. Why does she\u2014why do women everywhere\u2014have to make such a big fucking deal over one day?</p> <p>I put my shoes on, then walk down the hall and brace my hands on the frame of the bedroom door. And talk through it.</p><p>\u201cOkay . . . so, I\u2019m gonna head out.\u201d</p><p>I wait. I listen.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how you\u2019re gonna play this? Not speaking to me? Real nice, Kate\u2014very mature.\u201d</p><p>Still nothing.</p> <p>I admit\u2014her cold shoulder bothers me. Not enough to change my plans, but enough for me to try to talk her out of the silent sulk one last time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even gonna kiss me good-bye? What if I get pushed in front of a subway train by a deranged homeless person? It could happen. And if it does, you\u2019re going to feel awful.\u201d</p><p>That does the trick. The bedroom door is yanked open.</p><p>Kate stands there, with one hand on her hip and a sugary sweet smile on her face. \u201cAnd we both know I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Then she slams the door in my face.</p><p>chapter 2</p><p>Although I don\u2019t believe I have any actual firsthand knowledge, it\u2019s colder than a witch\u2019s tit outside. Wind cuts through the city streets and the sky is a gloomy gray, hinting at a coming snowstorm.</p><p>On the corner, a block from my building, a scraggily faced man in layered, shabby clothes shouts about the apocalypse\u2014the end of days\u2014and how we all need to turn our lives around before time runs out. It\u2019s not an uncommon occurrence; guys like him litter the city. But today it seems weirdly . . . foreboding.</p> <p>I open the door to the building and am greeted by Sam, a security guard in his early twenties who typically helms the night shift.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Mr. Evans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you, Sam.\u201d He swipes my ID badge and I ask, \u201cThey put you on Christmas Eve?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI volunteered. Hard to argue with time and a half. Plus it gives the fellas with families time to spend at home.\u201d</p><p>Guilt pokes at me like the spring of worn-out couch. But I ignore it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. My girlfriend and I are going to my mother\u2019s for dinner tomorrow. She\u2019s out in Yonkers.\u201d</p><p>I slide my badge into my pocket and pull a fifty out of it. \u201cI\u2019ll be here pretty late tonight. In case I don\u2019t catch you on the way out, have a happy holiday.\u201d We shake hands and I slip him the fifty. Because I subscribe to my father\u2019s line of thought: an employee who feels appreciated\u2014and well compensated\u2014is a productive employee. And if I want anyone to be productive, it\u2019s the guy responsible for keeping the building safe.</p><p>He smiles gratefully. \u201cThanks a lot, Mr. Evans.\u201d</p><p>I nod and head up the elevator to the fortieth floor.</p><p>The offices are dark, the only light coming from the full-size Christmas tree in the corner and the illuminated electric menorah on the table beside it. The whole floor is quiet and still.</p><p>Not a creature is stirring, not even a mouse.</p><p>I flick the lights on in my office and sit down at my desk to get to work. While my laptop boots up, I look at the phone.</p><p>And consider calling Kate.</p><p>I don\u2019t like it when she\u2019s pissed at me. It feels . . . wrong. Off-kilter. And it\u2019s distracting. Tonight I need to be focused\u2014on top of my game.</p><p>I don\u2019t pick up the phone.</p><p>Because calling her to say I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m staying at the frigging office anyway, won\u2019t go over well. Besides, she\u2019s never been able to stay mad at me for long. By the time I get home, I bet she\u2019ll be over it, just like I said.</p><p>An hour later, I\u2019m staring at my computer screen, reviewing the proposal I\u2019m gonna pitch to Media Solutions. I yawn deeply and my vision blurs. The scorching rechristening of our living room and kitchen must\u2019ve worn me out more than I thought. I stretch my arms and crack my neck, trying to wake myself up.</p><p>But after five minutes, as I read paragraph seventeen, my eyelids become heavy. Until they droop and drag to a close.</p><p>I bolt awake at my desk\u2014disoriented and slightly panicked. The way my grandfather used to snore away in his recliner, before jerking up and claiming he was just \u201cresting my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at my watch, I\u2019m relieved to see it\u2019s only been a few minutes since I dozed off. \u201cWake the fuck up, Evans. No time for a nap.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I head over to the conference room and make myself a quick cup of coffee. I sip the hot beverage of the gods and step back into my office.</p><p>And there, sitting on my suede couch\u2014the same suede couch that played such a prominent role in my early Kate Brooks fantasies\u2014is a woman.</p><p>Do you see her, too?</p><p>She\u2019s strikingly beautiful. A pert nose, full lips, bright green eyes, and aristocratic cheekbones. Her hair is honey blond and long with a slight curl. She\u2019s wearing a conservative white dress, blazer, and heels\u2014something Kate would wear to the office. A string of pearls adorns her long neck and matching earrings decorate her lobes.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d she greets me in a warm voice.</p><p>My eyes dart from her to the door. Security always calls before letting a client up.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I return. \u201cCan I . . . help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m here to help you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Huh. She knows my name.</p> <p>Has she crawled from the sea of my former one-night stands? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time one tracked me down at my place of business. But with me riding the monogamy bandwagon these last eight years, it hasn\u2019t happened for a long time.</p><p>\u201cHave we met somewhere before?\u201d I ask\u2014but I really mean Have we fucked somewhere before?</p><p>She laughs, though I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s a pleasant, alluring sound. \u201cAlways so clever. I\u2019ve been watching you for a long time, Drew. You never fail to entertain.\u201d</p><p>I set my coffee on the desk and face her head-on. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching me for a long time? Yeah, \u2019cause there\u2019s nothing weird about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s my job to watch you. I\u2019m your guardian angel, after all.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of crazy walking around New York City. And I don\u2019t just mean the obvious vagrants mumbling around Penn Station or the naked cowgirl in Times Square. Professional dog walkers, bicyclists, and most employees of the sanitation department have several fucking screws loose, too.</p> <p>You have to be careful with insane people. Getting them worked up isn\u2019t a good idea. So I just nod and try to keep her calm.</p><p>\u201cInteresting. You don\u2019t look like an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you imagine I should look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWings, halo, blinding heavenly light.\u201d</p><p>She winks. \u201cI only bring the halo out for formal events. As for my wings . . . I\u2019m still working on earning them.\u201d</p><p>I snap my fingers. \u201cThat sounds familiar. To earn your wings, you have to, like, stop me from offing myself, right?\u201d</p><p>Her jade eyes round with surprise. \u201cOh, nothing as drastic as that. If things became that desperate I wouldn\u2019t be doing a very good job. I\u2019m here because you\u2019re starting down the wrong path, Drew. We need to nip your behavior in the bud; get you back to where you should be.\u201d</p><p>With a chuckle, I sit down in my chair and roll closer to the phone.</p> <p>Her head tilts to the side, regarding me. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe anything I\u2019m telling you, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but no, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s unperturbed. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. No one believes at first.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2019m not getting the hell out of here. I\u2019m a fantastic judge of character, and in this case, I\u2019m just not feeling the psycho vibe. In fact, despite the words that are coming out of her mouth, she seems completely harmless. So I play along.</p><p>\u201cFor argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s suspend reality for a second and say that you are my guardian angel. I think I should fire you. You\u2019ve done a shitty job. Where were you when I thought Kate was cheating on me, and I pulled that stupid stunt with the stripper? That would\u2019ve been a good time to show up, kick me in the shin, and say, \u2018Hey asshole, it\u2019s not what you think.\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She nods sympathetically. \u201cIt was difficult to watch you go through that. But I couldn\u2019t intervene. It was a lesson you could only learn by living through it. Kate, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m about to commit some grievous sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you already have.\u201d</p><p>I brace my elbows on the chair, clasp my hands, and rest my fingers against my lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your wings crossed, honey. I haven\u2019t done anything. I work hard every single day to be a good father and a devoted, thoughtful husband.\u201d</p><p>She raises a doubtful eyebrow, reminding me of Kate.</p><p>\u201cThoughtful? Really? Were you being thoughtful when you came to work on Christmas Eve, even though Kate asked you not to?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cThis is a onetime thing. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never a big deal, Drew. Until it is. Do you think the Grand Canyon was created in a day? No. It happened in increments\u2014one small grain of soil at a time. Tonight is how it starts. Then you\u2019re missing birthdays, basketball games, anniversaries, simple but crucial quiet moments. You mean to make it up to them later, but later never comes.\u201d</p><p>I put up my hand. \u201cHold up\u2014that\u2019s . . . that\u2019s not gonna happen. I would never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you would never leave Kate to put together your son\u2019s gifts all alone on Christmas Eve?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>She has a point.

Taking our loved ones for granted works the same way.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for a moment.

An actress?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cTonight, you will be visited by three spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, a foursome. Will they all look like you?\u201d</p><p>That makes her chuckle. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>I pick up the phone from my desk. \u201cWhile this has been memorable\u2014and totally bizarre\u2014I have work to get done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will come to you one by one\u2014the spirits of Christmas past, present, and future\u2014to show you what you will never again forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s Christmas Eve and all, it seems only fair to warn you\u2014I\u2019m calling security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Drew. It was a pleasure meeting you, at last.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the phone and punch in the extension for the security desk, then glance back at the couch. But\u2014you guessed it\u2014she\u2019s gone.</p><p>What. The. Fuck?</p> <p>I stand up and look out the door. No trace.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, Mr. Evans?\u201d Sam asks through the receiver.</p><p>\u201cDid you see . . .\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cHave you let anyone up to our floor tonight? A woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. It\u2019s been quiet down here.\u201d</p><p>I knew he was going to say that.</p><p>\u201cWell, if anyone comes by, make sure you call before letting them up. Okay, Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Mr. Evans.\u201d</p><p>I put the phone in its cradle and stand there, brow furrowed. What the hell was that?</p> <p>My cell phone chimes with an incoming email. It\u2019s Media Solutions\u2019 lead attorney, confirming our conference in . . . damn it, in two hours.</p><p>I brush off the uncomfortable, eerie feelings left from the crazy woman\u2019s little visit, and sit down at my desk to focus on what\u2019s really important.

Her blond hair is pulled back in a long ponytail, and she\u2019s wearing a red coatdress with pearl buttons, black leggings, and flat black boots.</p><p>I have no frigging idea how she got here or why, but you can bet your ass I\u2019m going to find out.</p><p>She talks into a glitter-covered cell phone. \u201cTell them if we don\u2019t have those numbers by tomorrow, their balls are going to be sitting in a glass case on my desk, goddamn it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s safe to say the whole bad-word jar thing didn\u2019t work out like my sister had hoped.</p><p>\u201cMackenzie?\u201d</p><p>She ends her call and flops down into the chair across from my desk. \u201cHi, Uncle Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come here by yourself? Do your parents know where you are? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on\u2014you know why I\u2019m here.\u201d Mischief dances in her big green eyes.</p><p>Which is frigging strange, because Mackenzie\u2019s eyes are blue.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to comment, because in a flurry of red fabric, she\u2019s on her feet holding her hand out to me. \u201cLet\u2019s get going. Places to go, people to see. Time is money.\u201d</p><p>I take her hand and we walk out of my office, down the hall to my father\u2019s closed office door. Mackenzie opens the door and we step over the threshold.</p><p>And I feel the color drain from my face.</p><p>Because this isn\u2019t my father\u2019s office. Not even close.</p><p>I stumble backward, making contact with the yellow living room wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck . . .\u201d I whisper. Confused. A little horrified.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look so good, Uncle Drew,\u201d Mackenzie comments.</p><p>Losing your mind will do that to you.</p><p>I turn in a circle, taking in beige couches and an oak entertainment center housing a television that is definitely not a flat screen. Miracle on 34th Street is on, and the air smells like fresh baked cookies. A modest Christmas tree sits decorated in the corner and dark red poinsettias are scattered between multiple framed family photos on the shelves. Family photos of my parents, my sister, and me\u2014until I\u2019m about five years old.</p><p>And then I finally fucking realize what\u2019s going on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is a dream,\u201d I say, in a voice that can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s a question or a declaration. \u201cI fell asleep at my desk and I\u2019m dreaming right now.\u201d</p><p>Funny. Usually my dreams are the more X-rated variety. Involving me and Kate in multiple porn-toned scenarios. Sometimes I\u2019m a Roman emperor and she\u2019s my toga-less slave girl who feeds me grapes and happily caters to my every whim. Sometimes I\u2019m Han Solo and she\u2019s Princess Leia, screwing our way across the galaxy.

Do you know why we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>I try really hard. \u201cUm . . . the sushi I ate for lunch was bad and the toxins have spread to my brain, causing some strange-ass hallucinations?\u201d</p><p>Giggling, Mackenzie drags me forward. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p> <p>We enter the kitchen. Sitting at a small round table is the preteen version of my sister, Alexandra. Around this time, she hadn\u2019t yet grown into her nickname, \u201cThe Bitch,\u201d but the early signs were there. She\u2019s chewing gum and flipping through a Tiger Beat magazine with the New Kids on the Block on the cover. And her hair\u2014Jesus Christ, she must\u2019ve used a whole can of hair spray, because her bangs form a poof on top of her head, stiff and unnaturally high.</p><p>Sitting beside her, looking dapper in a long-sleeved Back to the Future T-shirt, is me. Five-year-old me. I\u2019m kind of small for my age; the growth spurt won\u2019t hit for another few years. But with my thick black hair brushed to the side, my deep blue eyes shining with youthful exuberance, I\u2019m nothing short of fucking adorable.</p><p>There\u2019s a plate of cookies in the middle of the table, with still-warm gooey chocolate chips. My mom\u2019s homemade cookies. They\u2019re indescribably awesome. But when young Drew reaches for one, Alexandra smacks his hand. \u201cNo more cookies, Drew. You\u2019re going to give yourself a stomachache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re so good,\u201d I whine. And I give her the puppy dog eyes. \u201cJust one more? Please?\u201d</p><p>At first Lexi\u2019s expression is stern. But under the power of young Drew\u2019s cuteness, she melts. \u201cOkay. One more.\u201d</p><p>Are you feeling the foreshadowing here?</p> <p>He smiles his thanks and talks with a mouthful of cookie. \u201cYou\u2019re the best sister ever, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>She ruffles his hair.</p><p>I chuckle and tell Mackenzie, \u201cHow irresistible am I? Didn\u2019t even have to work at it.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie laughs. \u201cYou were really cute. Watch\u2014this part is important.\u201d</p><p>My mother breezes into the kitchen, smooth skinned, blond, and beautiful\u2014despite the atrocious Christmas tree sweater she\u2019s sporting. In her hand she holds a cordless telephone.</p><p>A heavy, square cordless phone. With an antenna.</p><p>\u201cDrew, guess who\u2019s on the phone?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cIs it Daddy?\u201d he asks hopefully.</p> <p>\u201cNo, darling\u2014it\u2019s Santa Claus! He took time out of his busy day-before-Christmas-Eve schedule just to talk to you.\u201d She taps five-year-old Drew on the nose.</p><p>He flies off the chair, knocking it over behind him. Lexi, who by this time was old enough to know the truth, smiles at his excitement.</p><p>Young Drew brings the phone to his ear. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHo, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\u201d</p><p>And it all comes back to me. Like a door opening to a dark room, finally letting the light in, I remember this.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know this is the real Santa?\u201d My five-year-old self asks skeptically. Because even as a kid, I was damn sharp.</p><p>My father answers in a deep, bellowing, disguised voice, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got the Christmas list you mailed to me here in my hand.\u201d</p><p>Young Drew braces the phone on his shoulder and walks out to the living room. Mackenzie and I follow. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>Santa clears his throat. \u201cA BMX bicycle, the new Sega system, GI Joe action figures, a Walkman.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right, a Walkman. Because this is the eighties, kiddies.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, it really is you!\u201d five-year-old Drew yells.</p><p>\u201cIt really is. Now tell me, young man, have you been a good boy this year?\u201d</p><p>His face scrunches up as he attempts to be honest. \u201cI try. It\u2019s hard to be good.\u201d</p><p>Santa chuckles. \u201cDo you do what your mother tells you?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you listen to your sister?\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cLexi\u2019s bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is bossy. But she\u2019s your big sister, Drew\u2014she wants what\u2019s best for you. You should always listen to her.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, he nods. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, young man,\u201d my father exclaims. \u201cI\u2019m getting my sleigh all ready for the big night!

Then he speaks hesitantly into the phone. \u201cHey, Santa, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be okay to add something to my list?\u201d</p> <p>I hear worry in the old man\u2019s voice when he responds, \u201cAdd something?

And . . . she\u2019s sad about it. We all are. It\u2019s not as fun. I miss him.\u201d He sighs. \u201cSo, if you can make sure he\u2019s home tomorrow\u2014you can keep the other stuff.\u201d</p><p>I grin. Because I know what\u2019s coming next.</p><p>Wait for it.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . maybe not all the other stuff,\u201d he amends. \u201cYou could still drop off the Sega. But you can keep all Lexi\u2019s gifts\u2014she won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Santa\u2019s voice turns rough with emotion and conviction as he promises, \u201cYour daddy will be home for Christmas Eve, Drew. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Young Drew smiles with so much enthusiasm. Delight. Innocence.</p> <p>It makes me think of my son. The sound of his laughter. The warmth of his embrace. The way he bounces on the bed\u2014even when Kate tells him not to\u2014and he jumps into my arms, with total abandon. Complete faith and trust. Because he knows I\u2019ll catch him. That I\u2019d never let him fall.</p><p>That I\u2019d never let him down.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Santa,\u201d my younger self whispers earnestly.</p><p>Mackenzie looks up into my eyes. \u201cDid Pop make it home in time?\u201d</p><p>My voice takes on a faraway tone, because I remember what happened the next day\u2014and I remember exactly how it felt.</p><p>\u201cWe went to the Fishers\u2019 for Christmas Eve dinner. We were all there\u2014me, Matthew, Steven. At seven years old, your dad was already following your mom around, wanting to hang out with her. I kept watching the door. Waiting for my dad to walk through it. Hoping.\u201d</p><p>A smile comes to my lips. \u201cAnd then he did. Laughing and loud and bigger than life. I ran to him and\u2014even before he hugged my mother\u2014he scooped me up and spun me around. Carried me on his shoulder like Tiny fucking Tim. And it felt . . . magical. Like real Christmas magic. And I was so . . . proud of myself. Because I thought my wish brought him home.\u201d</p><p>I blink, snapping out of my reverie. And I gaze down at Mackenzie. \u201cOut of all the Christmases I enjoyed as a kid . . . that one . . . that one was the best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you forgot about it?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s how it happens, right? You grow up, and the wonder of the holidays fades. It becomes more of a burden\u2014places to go, traffic, gifts that have to be found and bought. And you forget the little things, the simple moments that are supposed to make a regular day\u2014more.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess I did.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s only when I glance up from Mackenzie\u2019s face that I realize we\u2019re not in that small apartment anymore. We\u2019re back in my office. My head swims a little\u2014like vertigo. I sit down on the suede couch until it passes. I glance at my watch, and it\u2019s the same time as before Mackenzie walked through my door. Still two hours to go before my conference.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I showed you this particular memory tonight?\u201d Mackenzie asks me.</p><p>I snort. \u201cTo demonstrate I\u2019m obviously more like my father than I ever realized?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo. I showed you this because moments matter. You may not have remembered it, but it still played a part in who you grew up to be. And how you felt about Christmas, your dad, and in some ways, yourself. It\u2019s the little things, all added together, that make us who we are. So now that you remember, what are you going to do, Uncle Drew?\u201d</p><p>I rub the back of my neck. \u201cI\u2019ll . . . I\u2019ll find a way to make it up to James after Christmas. Maybe take him to a basketball game for some quality time. Just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie sighs. And she seems disappointed. It\u2019s similar to how Kate looks at me when she comes home from the salon and I\u2019m not excited by the fact that she trimmed off a whole quarter of an inch.</p><p>Like . . . I\u2019m missing something.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she laments, \u201cit\u2019s time for me to go.\u201d</p><p>Even though I\u2019m still sure this is a dream\u2014I\u2019m not taking any chances. \u201cHold on, sweetheart. I can\u2019t leave yet. Hang out here with me and I\u2019ll get you home when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>She sits down on the couch. \u201cOkay, Uncle Drew. Whatever you say.\u201d</p><p>I head back around my desk, sit, and refocus all my attention on my presentation.</p><p>chapter 4 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mackenzie plays quietly on her phone while I work. She\u2019s mature and considerate like that. After a half hour I glance at the couch to thank her\u2014and see that she\u2019s fucking gone.</p><p>I shoot to my feet. \u201cMackenzie?\u201d When there\u2019s no answer, I rush for the door. Flinging it open I call, \u201cMack\u2014\u201d</p><p>I actually said her full name, but you couldn\u2019t hear it.</p><p>Because the blaring of \u201cAngels We Have Heard on High\u201d drowned out my voice. And if that wasn\u2019t loud enough, there\u2019s the echo of bells jingling in the background, the hum of a dozen audio-animatronic elves, reindeer and headless gingerbread men scattered around\u2014and let\u2019s not forget the crunch and whistle of falling snow.</p> <p>Yes, actual snow\u2014inside my goddamn office building.</p><p>The main floor outside the offices has been transformed into a winter wonderland.</p><p>I just stand there. Stunned.</p><p>But I have to say, this beats the shit out of anything the mall has ever come up with.</p><p>Then my sister, Alexandra, comes walking around the corner. She\u2019s decked out in elegant holiday finery\u2014a red, strapless satin dress, black heels, her hair piled high on her head, with a pearl tiara nestled in the blond curls.</p> <p>She surveys the room. \u201cGod, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms and lean back against a snow-covered desk. \u201cA little overdone, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Alexandra raises her shoulder. \u201cIf you can\u2019t overdo Christmas, what can you overdo?\u201d Then she regards me with bright green eyes.</p><p>And I deduce, \u201cYou\u2019re not here to pick up your daughter, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my daughter is safe and sound. Why do you think I\u2019m here, little brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s because every member of my family has been body snatched by green-eyed aliens hell-bent on keeping me from getting any fucking work done.\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cEven your alien invasion theories are egomaniacal.\u201d</p><p>I push off from the desk. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s go. The sooner we do this, the sooner I can get back to my desk.\u201d And I can\u2019t keep the sarcasm out of my voice. \u201cShow me your vision, Christmas ghost. Teach me the error of my ways.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra scowls. And checks out her manicure. \u201cNow I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth. \u201cAlexandra . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to be rushed, Drew. You have to invest the time\u2014smell the holly bush, get the full experience. I\u2019m not some wham-bam-thank-you-ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>My face contorts. \u201cI certainly hope not. That\u2019s fucking gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heavens have chosen to intercede on your behalf!\u201d She stomps her foot. \u201cTo help you. A little gratitude would be nice.\u201d</p><p>I pinch my nose, breathe deep, and compose myself. Because the spirit bitch is obviously in a tormenting mood, like a cat toying with a mouse before it\u2019s devoured. Trying to wriggle out from under her paw will only prolong it. My best option is to just give in. Play dead.</p> <p>Submit.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for being flippant, Alexandra. Thank you for taking the time tonight to educate me. I\u2019m truly fortunate to have a sister and heavenly angel who care so much for my emotional well-being.\u201d</p><p>Her head bobs side to side, weighing my sincerity. \u201cAnd do you like the decorations?\u201d she asks petulantly.</p><p>I smile. \u201cThe decorations are lovely.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra\u2019s expression slides toward appeasement. \u201cAnd the music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my favorite songs\u2014a classic.\u201d</p><p>She grins teasingly. \u201cI worked really hard on the snow.\u201d</p><p>Submission isn\u2019t my forte.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Lex!\u201d</p><p>She holds her hands up. \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d She straightens and clasps my hand. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Together we walk to Steven\u2019s office. Instinctively, I close my eyes as we step through the doorway. Then I open them.</p><p>\u201cThis is . . . this is your apartment,\u201d I state.</p><p>My sister\u2019s condo has the typical regal appointments of an exclusive and ultraexpensive New York City living space. Panoramic views, high ceilings, detailed dark wood moldings, shiny, pristine marble floors. But there\u2019s a warmth to it\u2014earth-toned walls, comfy couches, colorful throw pillows, children\u2019s framed artwork\u2014that makes it a family friendly home.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant observation, as always,\u201d she returns.</p><p>\u201cWhen is this?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alexandra\u2019s eyes turn sympathetic. \u201cThis is tonight. At this very moment. These are the memories you won\u2019t be a part of.\u201d</p><p>We go into the family room, where all the familiar faces are congregated. There\u2019s my father, in a black suit and red tie, with a ridiculous Santa hat on his head, talking to Frank Fisher\u2014my father\u2019s lifelong friend and business partner\u2014at the wet bar. He pours apple cider into a shot glass for Mackenzie, who\u2019s perched on a stool between the two men. A small smile comes to my lips as I gaze at my mom, who looks a couple of decades older than her earlier incarnation, but every bit as beautiful\u2014this time in a simple red dress and black pumps. She\u2019s chatting with my sister on the couch. On the far side of the room is my brother-in-law, Steven, his blue eyes sparkling with pride behind his dark-rimmed glasses as he bends his head to hear what his son, Thomas, tells him. They stand in front of the Ping-Pong table\u2014our latest family get-together pastime. They\u2019re getting ready to play my best friend, Matthew Fisher, and his five-year-old son, Michael, as they stand on the other side of the table, looking a little like twins with their short light brown hair and similar button-down green shirts.</p><p>Adjacent to the table is a love seat, where Matthew\u2019s wife and Kate\u2019s best friend, Delores \u201cDee-Dee\u201d Warren, is seated, surprisingly wearing one of her lower-key outfits\u2014a short red leather skirt, a snug white striped sweater, and glowing, dangly Santa Claus earrings.</p><p>Next to Dee is Kate, and I can\u2019t take my eyes off of her.</p> <p>An elegant long-sleeved black velvet dress hugs her in all the right places, her dark, shiny hair falls over her shoulder in waves, and open-toe green heels encase her feet. Three-carat diamond earrings\u2014earrings I gave her for our second wedding anniversary\u2014glitter on her ears. She\u2019s flawless. And so gorgeous I actually feel my chest tighten with a mixture of pride and ever-present desire.</p><p>It\u2019s the perfect family gathering. Evergreens and bows add a holiday flair to the decor, Christmas music plays cheerfully in the background, and dozens of delicious-smelling dishes rest on a buffet table, waiting to be uncovered. It\u2019s a modernized version of an idyllic Norman Rockwell image\u2014the entire room is alive with laughter and joyful chatter. Everyone\u2019s happy to be there, everyone\u2019s having a good time.</p><p>Everyone except my son, James.</p><p>He\u2019s unusually quiet, sitting on the recliner next to the love seat. His dark brown eyes alternate between watching the Ping-Pong match and glancing down the hall toward the front door.</p><p>Steven, who\u2019s always been attuned to how others are feeling, nudges James with his elbow. \u201cWhat do you say, buddy? You want to be on Thomas\u2019s and my team? We could use another man.\u201d</p> <p>My five-year-old son smiles genuinely and glances down at the two Ping-Pong paddles in his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, Uncle Steven\u2014I\u2019m gonna wait for my daddy. I\u2019ll be on his team.\u201d</p><p>And doesn\u2019t that just make me feel like two cents\u2019 worth of shit. Because he\u2019s completely unaware that I have no intention of showing up.</p><p>James\u2019s words immediately grab Kate\u2019s attention, and she crouches down in front of him. \u201cHoney, remember I told you Daddy had to work tonight? He didn\u2019t want to, but he had to. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be here to play Ping-Pong.\u201d</p><p>James smiles at her reassuringly. \u201cYeah, I remember, but he\u2019ll come after he\u2019s done working. I know he will. He\u2019ll make it in time.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes cloud with worry, because she doesn\u2019t want our little boy disappointed. Not on Christmas Eve. And sure as hell not because of his father.</p><p>\u201cCan I play with you?\u201d she offers. \u201cI play a mean game of Ping-Pong.\u201d</p> <p>James giggles. \u201cThanks, Mommy, but I want to wait for Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Kate tries again. \u201cBut what if he can\u2019t come, honey?\u201d</p><p>James gazes back at her calmly, confidently, because he believes every word he\u2019s saying. \u201cDaddy told me that \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 isn\u2019t a real word. That anything someone wants to do badly enough\u2014they\u2019ll do. He said \u2018can\u2019t just means they won\u2019t,\u2019 or that they don\u2019t want to. So that\u2019s how I know he\u2019s coming. Because it\u2019s Christmas Eve, and there\u2019s nowhere Daddy wants to be more than here with us. So he\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>Guilty pain lances my heart, and I cover it with my hand. I think I might actually fucking cry.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d my spirit sister says beside me. \u201cThat\u2019s gotta hurt. And you thought the mother guilt was bad.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m such a dick. How can I be such a giant asshole and not know it?\u201d</p><p>Christmas Alexandra takes pity on me. She pats my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not really that bad. You\u2019re just a little self-absorbed sometimes. You don\u2019t see things from others\u2019 perspectives\u2014how your actions may affect them.\u201d</p><p>Back in the apartment, Kate brushes back the locks of James\u2019s hair that have fallen over his forehead. \u201cYou are the smartest, sweetest little boy ever, you know that?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grins. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re pretty lucky.\u201d</p><p>My wife laughs. Then she kisses his forehead and moves back to the love seat, next to her best friend. She glances worriedly down the hall toward the front door, and there\u2019s sharp anger in her tone when she whispers to Delores, \u201cIf James gets hurt tonight because of Drew, he and I are going to have a major problem.\u201d</p><p>Delores nods. But then\u2014maybe Christmas really is magic, because she defends me. Kind of. \u201cDon\u2019t give up hope, Katie. Dipshit may actually pull his head out of his ass long enough to realize where he should be. He\u2019s come through before when I didn\u2019t think he would. So . . . keep the faith. You never know.\u201d</p><p>Kate sips her wine, looking distinctly uncomforted.</p> <p>Then the Ping-Pong participants shout loudly as Michael gets the ball past his uncle\u2014scoring the winning point. His father gives him a high five and a hug.</p><p>\u201cWell played, sir,\u201d Steven congratulates.</p><p>\u201cNice shot,\u201d my son calls sincerely.</p><p>Then he sighs. And goes back to watching the door.</p><p>Though I know he can\u2019t hear me, I start to move toward him so I can explain how crucial tonight\u2019s conference call is. So he\u2019ll understand. But even in my head, the justifications sound pretty fucking hollow.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t get the chance to, anyway. My sister\u2019s hand on my shoulder stops me. \u201cCome along\u2014we still have another stop to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can feel even worse than I do right now?\u201d I give a sarcastic two-thumbs-up. \u201cYay.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hand and I reluctantly follow her out the front door.</p><p>And we step seamlessly into my apartment.</p><p>There\u2019s a fire burning in the living room fireplace but the lights are turned down low. And it\u2019s quiet\u2014the only sound to be heard is Kate\u2019s singing voice floating softly down the hall from James\u2019s bedroom. She does that sometimes\u2014sings him to sleep. At the moment, she\u2019s doing a fucktastic rendition of \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\u201d I imagine her running her fingers through his soft hair as his eyes grow heavy. Then, when he\u2019s finally out\u2014she\u2019ll kiss his forehead and smell the still-child-sweet scent of his skin.</p><p>\u201cThis is later tonight,\u201d my sister informs me. \u201cWhile you\u2019re at the office on your video business meeting.\u201d</p> <p>A few seconds later, the song ends and Kate comes walking down the hall. Her hair is pulled up and she\u2019s wearing a dark green silk nightshirt that accentuates the green flecks in her eyes. With white socks, because hardwood floors are freaking freezing in the winter.</p><p>In her hands, Kate holds a bottle of wine and a single glass. She uncorks it on the coffee table and pours a double serving into the glass. Then she opens the hall closet and sticks her head inside. As she rummages around, pulling out baseball bats and ski jackets that I astutely used to camouflage the presents inside, the back of her nightgown starts to ride up, and the \u201cHo, ho, ho\u201d written across the ass of her red panties peeks out.</p><p>I tilt my head for a better angle of the luscious sight.</p><p>Addiction is an illness. But there are times\u2014like this one\u2014that it\u2019s an enjoyable one. I can\u2019t help myself, and if I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t really want to.</p><p>Alexandra frowns at me. \u201cFocus, please.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat and nod.</p><p>Eventually, Kate succeeds in dragging out two boxes that are longer than she is.</p><p>She opens them, lays out all the pieces neatly, and settles herself among them on the floor. She takes a sip of her wine, opens the instruction manual, and gives herself a pep talk.</p> <p>\u201cIf Drew wants to work, he can work. I got this covered. How hard could it be?\u201d</p><p>We should pause here briefly and think about that statement. How hard can putting a child\u2019s toy together really be?</p><p>Past experience tells me\u2014pretty fucking hard. If you have kids, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.</p><p>I don\u2019t get it. Clear illustrations, simple direct steps\u2014is that really too goddamn much to ask for? And don\u2019t get me started on the packaging. I realize that shoplifting is a drain on stores, but is it necessary to wrap every single fucking component in plastic, wire, and industrial-strength tape? The only people that deters are the parents trying to put it together.</p><p>I\u2019ve wondered who makes that call at the toy companies. Who decides which pieces get tied down and at what potency. Whoever it is\u2014I bet he was bullied in high school. Or maybe he was poor and didn\u2019t get to play with any toys when he was a kid. So now\u2014every day\u2014he takes his sick, twisted revenge by making it as difficult as humanly possible for anyone to put together a toy that should be a piece of fucking cake.</p><p>I feel better now that I got that off my chest. Thanks.</p><p>So, back to Kate: fifteen minutes after getting started, she\u2019s got all of three pieces put together on James\u2019s bicycle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She picks up the instructions and turns them sideways. Then she holds them upright and tries turning her head sideways.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d she yells at the paper, flinging it to the ground. Then she speaks threateningly to the bike parts as she tries to force them to connect. \u201cJust. Go. In. You. Bastard!\u201d</p><p>When that doesn\u2019t work, she takes a breath and a sip of wine. She brushes the wisps of hair that\u2019ve escaped her bun away from her face. Then she picks up a blue metal rod. \u201cYou are component A. You need to be inserted into component B\u2019s hole. Work with me, here.\u201d</p><p>And now she\u2019s back to shoving.</p> <p>I squat down next to her. \u201cIt looks like rod A is too well endowed for B\u2019s hole. Maybe they need some lube.\u201d</p><p>If she could hear me, Kate would chuckle. And she\u2019d look at me like I was the cleverest man in the world.</p><p>But she can\u2019t. So she just continues to grit her teeth and struggle with the metal bars.</p><p>Until her hand slips.</p><p>And her finger gets pinched between two pieces of steel.</p> <p>With a curse, Kate drops the bike pieces and flaps her hand, trying to shake the pain away. Then she puts her finger in her mouth.</p><p>It\u2019s something I would\u2019ve done if I were here. Sucked her finger until it was all better. Then I would\u2019ve gotten her a Band-Aid or ice.</p><p>Once her finger is probably just a dull throb, Kate rubs her forehead. She looks tired.</p><p>And sad.</p><p>And for the first time tonight, I wish I\u2019d chosen differently. It\u2019s not only because I feel guilty\u2014though I do. But if I could go back, I\u2019d be here with her right now. And it would be a shitload more enjoyable for both of us.</p><p>Kate picks up her glass of wine, eyes the red liquid, then holds it up unhappily. \u201cMerry Christmas, Kate.\u201d</p> <p>And I\u2019m done.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to watch this anymore. I don\u2019t want to know that my actions have hurt the feelings of the two people who mean the most to me.</p><p>Because I\u2019m a guy. And to the great annoyance of women everywhere\u2014guys are doers. We don\u2019t just listen to you babble about your problems; we tell you how to fix them.</p><p>And we never understand why you get pissed off about that. Why you just want us to be a \u201csounding board\u201d or a \u201cgood listener.\u201d What the fuck is the point of sounding off if you\u2019re not going to do anything about it?</p><p>So I\u2019m going back to my office, and then I\u2019m going to haul ass home to help Kate assemble James\u2019s presents. And I\u2019m going to wake up my son and tell him I\u2019m sorry. That I\u2019ll play Ping-Pong with him every damn day if it makes him happy.</p><p>I stand up and look into the eyes of my big sister. Almost like she can read my mind, she says, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go, then.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra holds my hand and we walk to the elevators outside my apartment door. We step inside and they close behind us. When they reopen, we\u2019re on the fortieth floor of my office building. And all the decorations\u2014the music, the snow\u2014are gone now.</p><p>Outside my closed office door, I turn toward my sister.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Alexandra. Really, this time.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cDo you know what life is, Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cosmic joke?\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cNo. Life is a memory. Sure, we enjoy the moments as they come, but for many, time goes by too fast to truly appreciate those moments as they happen. It\u2019s only later, when we remember them, that they become precious to us. A life well lived is one where the good memories outweigh the bad.\u201d</p><p>I rub the back of my neck. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of depressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d She shakes her head softly. \u201cNever pass up the opportunity to make a beautiful memory, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Then she kisses my cheek and disappears.</p><p>chapter 5</p><p>After Alexandra is gone, I wait.</p><p>My guardian angel said there\u2019d be three spirits visiting me, and I have a feeling I\u2019m not going to wake up from this dream until bachelorette number three gets her turn.</p><p>When nothing happens, I try to help things along. \u201cHello? Anybody here? You win\u2014I feel really fucking guilty. I\u2019m going to cancel my conference and go home now. Happy?\u201d</p><p>The only answer I receive is silence.</p><p>I take one last glance around, then open my office door and step inside.</p><p>And I\u2019m blinded by flashing green and red lights. A pounding electric guitar version of \u201cJingle Bells\u201d pierces my eardrums? while a white foggy mist clouds my vision of the room. Out from behind my desk steps a tall creature whose face is obscured by a flowing red satin hooded robe.</p><p>Suddenly, the flashing lights disappear and the music cuts off.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m scared . . . but intimidated fits nicely. \u201cAre you . . . are you the spirit of Christmas future?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t expect an answer. In the movie, the last, most frightening spirit never talks. If it pulls the hood back, I suppose it\u2019ll have a black hole where its face should be\u2014maybe a skeleton head. I brace myself as hands with long red nails reach for the hood and reveal the countenance beneath it.</p><p>Did I think this was a dream? Nope.

Waste of time, as far as I\u2019m concerned. Besides, Kate and I did meet, so the would\u2019ve, could\u2019ve, should\u2019ve doesn\u2019t apply.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have,\u201d she says. \u201cI always suspected Katie would\u2019ve been better off without you. So we\u2019re not going to the future. I\u2019m going to show you this night as it would be if Kate had never come to New York, and never fell victim to your man-whore charms.\u201d</p> <p>Is that something you want to see?</p><p>Because I\u2019m not interested. Because . . . if Delores is right, and Kate really is better off without me? That knowledge would break my fucking heart like nothing else ever could.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ll sit this one out.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes gleam. Almost menacingly. \u201cLucky for me, you don\u2019t have a choice in the matter.\u201d</p><p>With that, she spins toward me, the red cloak billowing around us. I feel her hand on my arm and the whole world shifts\u2014falls\u2014then comes to a jerking stop, like the end of a roller-coaster ride.</p><p>I look around. We\u2019ve landed back in the outer hallway of my sister\u2019s condo. The door is open and a version of me stands in the doorway, saying good-bye to his family inside. He seems a little more worn around the edges\u2014but still one hell of a good-looking guy.</p> <p>\u201cSo this me made it to Christmas Eve dinner?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWithout a wife and kid taking up your time, you were able to get the conference with Hawaii done earlier.\u201d Then Delores points at the other me. \u201cNotice the crow\u2019s-feet. Since he didn\u2019t settle down with Kate, there\u2019s a few more years of hard partying under his belt\u2014and his eyes. But, sorry to say, no one\u2019s kicking you out of her bed yet.\u201d</p><p>I wave my hand, quieting her annoying commentary so I can hear the conversation going on at the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want to stay the night?\u201d Alexandra asks. \u201cYou could wake up with us, open presents\u2014nothing makes Christmas feel more like Christmas than kids getting up at the crack of dawn.\u201d</p><p>Kateless Drew hugs Mackenzie and Thomas, then kisses Alexandra on the cheek. \u201cSounds tempting, but I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>His mother clicks her tongue disapprovingly. \u201cI hate the idea of you being all alone.\u201d</p><p>He smirks. \u201cThen you have nothing to worry about, Mom. I hardly ever spend the entire night alone.\u201d</p><p>Steven chuckles and taps Drew\u2019s fist.</p> <p>His mom rolls her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve, don\u2019t be vulgar.\u201d</p><p>Drew shakes his father\u2019s hand. \u201cSee you guys tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>With that, he leaves. But he doesn\u2019t go home.</p><p>He walks a few blocks until he comes to the most dependable pickup spot in any city. The place responsible for more sexual encounters than a highway rest stop bathroom.</p><p>A hotel bar.</p><p>While he stands at the entry, scanning for prospects, I do the same. It\u2019s been awhile for me, but spotting the easy pickings is like riding a bike\u2014a skill you never really forget.</p><p>Our eyes settle on a forty-something redhead in phenomenal shape, sitting alone at a corner table. Drew orders two drinks from the bartender\u2014a Jack and Coke for himself, and whatever the lady is having.</p><p>Then he makes his move.</p><p>\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d he asks her with a smile.</p><p>After her eyes shamelessly undress him, she nods. \u201cPlease.\u201d He sets her drink in front of her and she thanks him.</p><p>He assumes she\u2019s at the hotel because she doesn\u2019t actually live in New York. So he asks, \u201cAre you visiting the city for business or pleasure?\u201d</p><p>She sips her drink and licks her lip provocatively. \u201cOriginally, business\u2014I\u2019m in real estate. But now it seems I\u2019ll be multitasking.\u201d</p><p>Drew winks. \u201cI\u2019m an excellent multitasker. I\u2019m able to give my attention to many different areas at once. I\u2019d love to demonstrate that talent for you sometime.\u201d</p><p>Redhead smiles wider. Then she says, \u201cMistletoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>She points above them. \u201cMy hotel room has mistletoe printed on the sheets, in honor of the holiday season. How would you feel about kissing me under it?\u201d</p><p>Drew chuckles. \u201cI believe that\u2019s a holiday tradition that should always be observed.\u201d They finish their drinks, then stand. Ever the gentleman, Drew motions with his hand. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>And together they head upstairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The redhead\u2019s room is actually a suite.

I mean, it\u2019s not really me, so I have nothing to feel guilty about. But still . . .\u201d</p><p>Hearing any version of myself banging the hell out of a woman who isn\u2019t Kate is just . . . bizarre. In a disturbing kind of way. Not a turn-on.</p> <p>After a high-pitched scream and a roaring grunt, the noise from the bedroom quiets down.

Why didn\u2019t you think of that sooner?\u201d</p><p>I follow her out of the hotel room door. And we step into the living room of my apartment. My old apartment, before Kate and I lived together. The ultimate bachelor pad\u2014black, stainless steel, and big-boy toys, remember?</p><p>We stand in the living room as Kateless Drew comes strolling through the door\u2014his shirt half buttoned, whistling a merry tune. He takes a quick shower, then, clad only in boxers, pours himself a bowl of cereal. He sits back on the couch, puts his feet on the coffee table, and flicks on the television.</p><p>With a mouthful of cereal, he smiles. \u201cA Christmas Story. Cool.\u201d And he settles in to watch.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201c?\u2019Cause you\u2019re a moron,\u201d Delores answers flatly.</p><p>\u201cInstead of insulting me, can you explain what the hell I\u2019m supposed to be getting from this? I thought the point of showing me my life without Kate was to demonstrate how miserable I\u2019d be without her.\u201d I gesture to my other self on the couch. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. He loves his life. What\u2019s the lesson here?\u201d</p><p>With restrained impatience, Dee explains. \u201cOf course he loves his life\u2014being a raging man-slut was one of your favorite things. You always enjoyed your work, your life before Kate. But if you can\u2019t see the lesson, then you\u2019re not looking hard enough, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I push a frustrated hand through my hair and look again. The other me chuckles at the TV and puts his empty bowl on the table. Then I gaze around the apartment. The pristine neatness, the monotone furniture, the valuable abstract art on the walls.</p><p>And for the very first time, it feels . . . cold. Flat.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>I think of my apartment with Kate and James\u2014our home. It\u2019s light and vibrant and messy in the best frigging way. There\u2019s pencil marks on the wall showing how James has grown and a few scratches on the hardwood floors. There are mementos from vacations and pictures all over of our wedding and every significant moment in James\u2019s life. There are toys and work papers, coats and shoes. It\u2019s not messy, but\u2014lived in. Busy.</p><p>Full.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s happy,\u201d I realize. \u201cBecause he has no idea what he\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>Delores nods. \u201cThat\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>A cold shiver runs through me. Because this easily could\u2019ve been me. It could\u2019ve turned out so differently, and I never would\u2019ve known.</p><p>\u201cI want to go back,\u201d I tell her firmly. \u201cRight now. I want to see Kate and James. Take me back, Dee.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me with an unfamiliar sympathetic expression. \u201cAlmost, Drew. One more stop to make.\u201d</p><p>She laces her arm in mine and we\u2019re off.</p><p>We stand inside a corner office on an impressively high floor of a city high-rise. Beige granite and polished glass accent the desk, while unwelcoming white couches face off with a glass table between them. Before I can ask Delores where we are, the door opens and in strides Katherine Brooks.</p><p>Her hair is pulled back in a low bun; she\u2019s wearing just a touch of makeup, an immaculate white-and-black skirt with a coordinating jacket, and high heels. She\u2019s stunning, perfectly professional and cock-stiffening sexy all in one petite package.</p><p>In long confident steps, she makes her way behind the desk while talking into a headset microphone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not a stipulation we\u2019re willing to budge on.

It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause in this reality, this is where Kate and Billy moved after she got her MBA.\u201d She pauses. \u201cAnd after they got married.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps to her. \u201cWhat? She actually fucking married Douche Bag? Are you shitting me?\u201d</p> <p>For those who need a little backstory, here you go: Billy \u201cDouche Bag\u201d Warren is Delores\u2019s cousin and Kate\u2019s high school sweetheart. He was her fianc\u00e9 when we first met. Not too long after, he became her ex-fianc\u00e9, clearing the way for her and me to enjoy a stupendous fuck-fest of a weekend. It still ranks as one of the best weekends of my life. And it was during that very weekend that I came to the shocking realization that I was utterly and *-whippedly in love with Kate Brooks.</p><p>Because Kate and Billy had grown up together, had so much history together, they stayed close friends\u2014much to my dismay\u2014after their breakup, after she and I got together, and after we were married.</p><p>Which all explains why I\u2019m feeling frustration, disgust, jealousy, anger. Pick a negative emotion, and I\u2019m feeling it at this moment.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d I demand.</p><p>Dee lifts a shoulder casually. \u201cBecause they were engaged. Because they thought they loved each other . . . enough. Because they settled. And also because she never met you\u2014so she never realized what genuine passion and love are supposed to feel like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she married him.\u201d Again, my hand covers my heart.</p> <p>Because it aches.</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you feel any better, they got divorced.\u201d</p><p>I perk right up. \u201cYou should have started with that. It makes me feel hugely fucking better, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Under her breath, she hisses, \u201cAss.\u201d Then she explains. \u201cBilly and Katie stuck it out for three years, then called it quits. He went out to LA and she threw herself into her work like never before. They don\u2019t speak at all. When a marriage goes sour, it always leaves a bitter taste.\u201d</p><p>My attention turns back to Kate as she speaks into the headset again. \u201cStop busting my balls, Saul. You and I both know the glory days of your technology division are behind you.\u201d</p><p>I take a seat on the stiff couch and watch her. I could look at Kate all day and never get bored, but watching her work? Seeing her in her element?</p><p>It\u2019s fascinating. A thing of true beauty.</p><p>She braces her hands on the desk, tapping her toe on the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re quickly becoming a small fish in a very large ocean. Before long, a big bad shark is going to come along and chomp you into little pieces. But if you do the smart thing, sign with me and let me make this deal for you\u2014I\u2019ll be your own personal harpoon. And we\u2019ll feast on shark fin soup together. What\u2019s it gonna be, Mr. Anderson?\u201d</p> <p>Fucking Christ almighty.</p><p>Saul Anderson.</p><p>There\u2019s a blast from the past.</p><p>The first client Kate and I tried to close. The one who basically sexually harassed her, and who I told to go screw a pooch. And now Kate has him on the ropes.</p><p>Even though this is some weird, fucked-up alternate reality, I\u2019m so damn proud of her.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear Anderson\u2019s answer, but I don\u2019t have to. The adorable hand-flapping, hip-shaking dance of joy she does around her desk says it all.</p><p>Though she\u2019s smiling wide enough to pull a cheek muscle, she composes her voice. \u201cThat sounds perfect. I\u2019ll have the papers overnighted to you. Excellent. Yes, to you as well\u2014I think this will be a very happy New Year.\u201d</p><p>She ends the call, and her dancing turns to jumping. Laughing.</p><p>And I laugh with her.</p><p>She picks up the phone and dials a new number. \u201cHi, Christopher. Oh . . . yes, Merry Christmas to you, too. It sounds like you\u2019re having quite the party there.\u201d</p><p>She pauses as Christopher responds.</p><p>I ask Dee sharply, \u201cWho\u2019s Christopher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Hulk\u2014he\u2019s her boss. Nothing more. In fact, she has a less-than-zero social life.\u201d</p><p>I consider that for a moment. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t date? No boyfriend? No random hookups, no no-strings-attached fuck-buddy waiting in the wings?\u201d</p><p>Delores shakes her head. \u201cKate was never a one-night-stand kind of girl. After Billy, she gave up on relationships altogether. Too much effort, very little payoff.\u201d</p><p>I smile.</p><p>And Dee inquires, \u201cThat makes you happy, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I cannot tell a lie. \u201cYeah, it really does.\u201d</p><p>She throws a pillow at my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kate\u2019s voice brings my eyes back to her. \u201cI wanted to let you know that I just signed Saul Anderson.

Yes. Absolutely\u2014you can count on me, Chris. Okay, I will. Have a pleasant evening, as well.\u201d</p><p>She hangs up and more dancing commences. Her boobs bounce in time with her hips, and the only thing that would make this show better is popcorn.</p><p>Well . . . and if her clothes spontaneously fell off.</p> <p>Kate picks up the phone and tells her mother all about the big promotion. They only talk for a few minutes\u2014Kate promises to come home soon to visit. Then she hangs up.</p><p>She takes a bottle of champagne out of her minifridge and pours a single glass. Then she kicks off her shoes and walks to the window, gazing out over the lights of the city.</p><p>I stand up so my view is unobstructed.</p><p>As Kate stands there, her joyous expression slowly falters. Turns . . . sad . . . awash with yearning. Lonely.</p><p>I think about all the different faces of Kate that I\u2019ve seen. Passionate, hot and horny, sweet and tender, silly and smart-assy . . . nurturing, loving . . . motherly.</p> <p>She\u2019s a perfect wife.

The family portrait of me, Kate, and James sitting on my desk proves that this is my time, my reality\u2014where Kate and I met, fell in love, spawned, and married.</p><p>And I sigh with blessed fucking relief.</p><p>I\u2019m at my desk while Delores sits cross-legged in one of the chairs across from me.</p><p>\u201cYou were thinking about soul mates before. Remember? The truth is, soul mates are real: halves of the same coin. They can live without each other, go on to have successful, content existences. But they\u2019ll never be as perfectly happy as they would\u2019ve been, and could be, if they find their other half. That\u2019s what you and Kate are like.\u201d</p> <p>I smile. \u201cThat sounds just about right to me.\u201d I rub a hand down my face. \u201cI want to go home, Dee. I want to hug my kid and kiss my wife and just . . . be with them. I want to look back and remember having this awesome night\u2014with them.\u201d</p><p>Delores grins and she almost looks proud of me. \u201cFirst you have to wake up, Drew.\u201d</p><p>And she snaps her fingers.</p><p>chapter 6</p><p>I jolt violently awake at my desk, nailing my shin on the drawer in the process. \u201cGoddamn it!\u201d</p><p>I rub my leg and check the time. Seven thirty. Though it feels like a lot longer, only an hour and a half has passed since I arrived at the office.</p><p>I still have time.</p><p>I rattle off a quick email, canceling my conference with Media Solutions and attaching a PDF of my proposal. I tell them, in a professional sounding way, that they can take it or leave it, and if they leave it\u2014it\u2019s their loss.</p><p>Then I grab my stuff and sprint through the city.</p><p>I walk through my sister\u2019s apartment door twenty minutes later, brushing snowflakes off my shoulders from the storm that just started. I head right for the family room\u2014and see everyone there, just like I knew they would be.</p><p>A dark-haired little blur runs toward me. \u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I scoop him up and hug James until he squeaks. He leans back and gifts me with a faultless smile. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>A lump clogs my throat.</p><p>I push past it to tell him, \u201cAnd I\u2019m so happy that you knew that. I love you, buddy. More than anything else in the whole world.\u201d</p><p>He giggles. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I keep him in my arms as Alexandra comes to greet me. \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d And I hug her just a little longer than usual. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve told you lately, but you\u2019re the best sister ever, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>She ruffles my hair. \u201cHow sweet are you?\u201d</p><p>From across the room, Mackenzie raises her shot glass of apple cider. \u201cGlad you could make it, Uncle Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to be here, sweetheart! You and I need to talk\u2014I owe you. I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d</p><p>My sister insists, \u201cNo ponies, or farm animals of any kind!\u201d</p><p>And the whole room laughs.</p><p>I pass Delores and shock the shit out of her by kissing her on the cheek. \u201cMerry Christmas, Dee.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cKind of feels like it.\u201d</p><p>Then I spot Kate. And every fiber of my being hums with devotion and relief.</p><p>She eyes me warily. Stiffly. Still annoyed.</p><p>I set James on his feet. \u201cYou want to kick Uncle Matthew\u2019s and Uncle Steven\u2019s asses in Ping-Pong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jerk my head to the table. \u201cGo set it up.

And hopeful. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause being here with you is more important than any deal. I never should\u2019ve scheduled work on Christmas Eve. I never should\u2019ve left the apartment when you were upset about it. I won\u2019t do it again. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Kate gazes into my eyes, reading my sincerity. Then she smiles. With so much love, it makes my knees tremble.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you.\u201d</p> <p>I pull her to me and kiss her deeply. Tenderly. Stroking her cheek with my thumb.</p><p>Then Kate looks up into my face. \u201cAre you okay? You seem different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had this really screwed-up dream. I\u2019ll tell you about it later.\u201d Then I think of something else. \u201cHey\u2014what do you think of going to Bumfuck, Ohio, for New Year\u2019s Eve?\u201d</p><p>She smiles even brighter. \u201cI would love that.\u201d</p><p>I wink. \u201cThen so will I.\u201d</p><p>Later, after we tuck James into bed and he\u2019s out cold, Kate and I spend two hours putting together a shiny blue bicycle and an eight-foot-wide kid\u2019s trampoline with enclosure that will take up residence in the formal dining room.</p> <p>At least that room will finally have a frigging purpose.</p><p>When we\u2019re finished, just after midnight, we sit back on the couch and gaze at the fruits of our labor. The twinkling lights of the tree reflect magically off the big red bows and the green reindeer wrapping paper. Behind the tree, outside the large picture window, delicate snowflakes cascade down from the dark sky\u2014it\u2019s a picture straight out of a goddamn Hallmark holiday special.</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes settle on me. Adoringly. \u201cWe make a pretty good team.\u201d</p><p>I rub her shoulder. \u201cWe really do.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget again.</p><p>I get up and head to the kitchen. When I come back, there\u2019s two wineglasses and a bottle of Chateau Petrus 2002 in my hands. I uncork the bottle, letting it breathe for less time than I should, and pour a generous glass for each of us.</p><p>Kate takes the wine with a smile, and I raise my glass.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Kate.\u201d</p> <p>She taps my glass with a clink. \u201cMerry Christmas, Drew.\u201d</p><p>We sip, then I lean in for a wine-flavored kiss.</p><p>Delicious.</p><p>Next, I stand up and mess with the stereo. The sound of Michael Bubl\u00e9 singing \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d fills the room, low enough not to wake James. I take her glass and set it on the table.</p><p>Then I hold out my hand to my amazing wife. \u201cMay I have this dance, Mrs. Evans?\u201d</p><p>Her warm hand slides into mine. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do, Mr. Evans.\u201d Then\u2014because Kate is the perfect woman\u2014she adds, \u201cWell, maybe there\u2019s one thing\u2014but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to that later.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle deeply. My arms wrap around her, holding her against me, her head resting against my chest. And in the light of the Christmas tree, we sway in time to the music.</p><p>Was it all just a dream?</p><p>Honestly? I don\u2019t fucking know. But I\u2019m grateful it happened. Because even someone as brilliant as me needs a refresher once in a while about what\u2019s really important. The moments that matter. And the people we can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to imagine living without.</p><p>As I dance with the love of my life on Christmas Eve, I swear I hear the soft ring of a bell.

Since it shows a special moment in Drew and Kate\u2019s relationship, I\u2019m excited to be able to release it now for all fans of the Tangled series to enjoy.</p><p>It takes place after the events in Twisted (Tangled series, Book 2) but before Tied (Tangled series, Book 4).</p><p>indecent proposal</p><p>It\u2019s a perfect fall day. The leaves are just starting to change, and the sky is a cerulean-blue backdrop for cotton-white clouds. The air is still comfortably warm, but the breeze has that subtle bite to it\u2014a reminder that winter is around the corner.</p><p>Our son, James, is six months old now\u2014a good age. No longer just a screaming head, he\u2019s interactive, expressive, and fun, but not mobile enough to be any real trouble. After dropping him off at my parents\u2019 condo, Kate and I take the Lincoln Tunnel out of the city, to destinations unknown.</p><p>Well . . . unknown to her.</p><p>From the passenger seat, she looks sideways at me, and makes a terrible attempt at tripping me up. \u201cWhere did you say we were going again?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My hand rests on her knee, left bare by the casual gray sweater dress that covers the gorgeous contours of her fuck-hot curves. I squeeze the muscle just above her knee\u2014making her jump. \u201cI said it was a surprise. Stop fishing for hints, you\u2019re not good at it.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s brilliant and strong-minded, but her expressive eyes, tendency to blush, and complete inability to lie convincingly undermine any hope of a successful interrogation. Unless a striptease were being exchanged for information. If that were the case, the prisoners at GTMO would happily spill their guts.</p><p>\u201cYou seem kind of nervous.\u201d She peers at me. \u201cI\u2019m wondering why.\u201d</p><p>Me? Nervous?</p> <p>We\u2019ve been over this, but it bears repeating: I don\u2019t get nervous. Anxiety is for incapable chumps. When the world\u2019s at your fingertips, there\u2019s no room\u2014no reason\u2014for worry. Just because I\u2019m about to ask Kate the most important question of our lives, just because I\u2019m going to practically put my balls in her hands\u2014giving her the power to crush them with a single word . . . Christ, that hurts to even think about.</p><p>Just because I\u2019ve planned this day down to the finest detail, waited for it, frigging prayed about it, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m nervous.</p><p>The ring feels like a lead weight in my back pocket. I\u2019ve wanted to give it to her a dozen times\u2014but I\u2019ve held out. Because this will be the grandest of all gestures, the kind of romantic fantasy that plays out in those terrible mommy porn books my sister reads, but that you rarely see in real life. After this, there\u2019s no way Kate will say no.</p><p>Except . . . she still fucking could.</p><p>And that\u2019s the rub. The risk.</p> <p>It\u2019s infinitesimally small, but it\u2019s there. She might not be ready. She may think I\u2019m not ready. She might think things between us are fantastic\u2014and she\u2019d be right\u2014so why change anything? She might say, \u201cIf it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t screw with it.\u201d</p><p>My stomach twists and turns at all the thoughts. I swallow hard and grip the steering wheel tighter, with suddenly slick palms.</p><p>Okay, I\u2019m nervous. There, I fucking said it. Happy now?</p><p>But I do a good job of covering it as I answer her. \u201cWork has me tense. If you\u2019d like to relieve my tension,\u201d I glance at my crotch meaningfully, \u201cI\u2019m more than willing to pull over. Or\u2014even more fun\u2014keep driving while you do what you do so well.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles. \u201cNo, don\u2019t want any possible delays\u2014or you crashing into a tree. I want to see my surprise.\u201d</p><p>The second the car comes to a stop, Kate climbs out, stands between the open door and the car, hand on the roof, transfixed by the scene in the grassy valley below. Five huge hot-air balloons\u2014each more colorful than the next. It\u2019s an impressive sight. Vibrant, like a bowl full of candy from Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory.</p> <p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Kate squeals. \u201cThis is the surprise? I\u2019ve never been on a hot-air balloon ride!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Giving Kate new, memorable experiences has kind of become a fetish for me. The joy in her voice, the sparkle in her eyes, the astoundingly physical way she expresses her gratitude\u2014it\u2019s a rush. Like an adrenaline junkie searching for the next cliff to dive off of\u2014I\u2019m always looking for another fix.</p><p>My smile mirrors Kate\u2019s expression and her exuberance withers the nervous tentacles that wind their way into my brain. I take her hand and together we walk down the lush hill to the boarding platform, toward Mark Jonas.</p><p>Mark is the owner of Tri-State Ballooning, a company that offers hot-air balloon rides and courses in ballooning certification. After my fifty-five hours of training, Mark and I are well acquainted.</p><p>Kate stares up at the massive air-filled bulbs while I shake Mark\u2019s hand. \u201cHow ya doing, Drew?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, Mark.\u201d I gesture to my dark-haired temptress. \u201cThis is Kate.\u201d</p><p>Kate tears her eyes away from the balloons and shakes Mark\u2019s offered hand. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood to meet you, Kate. Drew\u2019s talked so much about you, I feel like I know you already.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes narrow with confusion, until I gesture toward one of the baskets and ask Mark, \u201cShe all set to go?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cShe is. And the other arrangements are ready, too.\u201d With a wink he wishes me good luck.</p><p>I smack Mark\u2019s shoulder and slip him a fifty-dollar tip. I open the wicker-basket door and step aboard. Then I hold out my hand to Kate.</p><p>Her mouth is slightly ajar. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fly this?\u201d</p><p>With a smirk I explain. \u201cYou know how much I adore your body\u2014and my own, for that matter. Do you honestly think I\u2019d trust anyone else to make sure we don\u2019t splatter all over the Hudson Valley?\u201d</p><p>Mark passes Kate a folded jacket with his company logo. \u201cIn case it gets chilly up there.\u201d</p><p>She accepts the jacket with a chuckle and steps into the basket with me. \u201cOkay, then.

Five minutes later, I give Mark the thumbs-up. He and a few of his employees untie the weighted ropes that keep the balloon anchored. The burner comes to life with a noisy whoosh as I open the propane valve, and a bright orange-blue flame surges into the envelope.</p><p>Then, gracefully, we float up into the sky.</p><p>Biting her lip, Kate looks over the edge, watching our growing distance from the earth.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re flying, Drew! We\u2019re actually flying!\u201d Her dark eyes glitter, like a kid getting her first glimpse of Disneyland.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are, baby.\u201d Pride swells in my chest as I soak up every expression that dances across her face: exhilaration, excitement, awe. But there\u2019s no fear\u2014no hesitation or doubt.</p><p>Kate knows I\u2019m capable of a lot of things\u2014putting her in any kind of danger would never be one of them.</p><p>The sun is low, casting the autumn-hued trees and hills with a magical, golden glow, and it\u2019s surprisingly peaceful at ten thousand feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s breathtaking, Drew,\u201d Kate sighs. \u201cThe most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>Smiling, my eyes don\u2019t leave her face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d</p><p>Like she can read my mind\u2014and by this point in our relationship, that\u2019s frighteningly possible\u2014she turns to me, beaming. As I adjust the propane controls, Kate wraps her arms around my waist and rests her head against my back. Her breasts push against me in the most delicious fucking way. Supple and sexy.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I feel her press a kiss between my shoulder blades. \u201cThank you. This is . . . beyond amazing\u2014even for you.\u201d</p><p>I want to turn around and kiss her for all I\u2019m worth. Strike that, I want to hoist her legs up around my hips, lift her very convenient dress and fuck her into oblivion.</p><p>Cuddling midair would be awesome. Screwing midair would be so much more awesome.</p> <p>But . . . making sure we don\u2019t crash and die takes precedence.</p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p>Kate is wrapped around me, oohing and ahhing at the stunning spectacle. An hour later, we arrive at our destination\u2014a lavish field of green. After a few bumps, we set down gently, and I turn off the balloon\u2019s burner. Mark\u2019s employees grasp the basket and tie it down.</p><p>\u201cThanks, fellas,\u201d I call, as I help Kate step onto solid earth.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Kate shakes her head as we walk up the hill. \u201cHow are you ever going to top that?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle huskily. \u201cI can think of a few ways.\u201d I pull her by the hand onto a dirt path that leads into the forest. \u201cThe day\u2019s not over yet.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is high-pitched when she asks, \u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve arranged for a limo to pick us up in a few hours, not too far from our next stop. Then we\u2019ll spend the night at a \u201cquaint\u201d bed-and-breakfast. At least, my sister said it\u2019s quaint\u2014though I don\u2019t understand the B and B attraction. It\u2019s weird\u2014staying in a stranger\u2019s house, sharing a bathroom with people I don\u2019t know from a frigging hole in the wall. But . . . I figured Kate would enjoy it, and this night is all about her.</p><p>After walking through the woods for five minutes, she presses, \u201cWhere are we going? Is this like a Little Red Riding Hood, Well-Hung Big Bad Wolf kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>Kate and I have been experimenting with role-play lately. You have got to try it.</p><p>I put my arm around her, grinning. \u201cNo, but we\u2019ll add that to the list. You in a slutty Red Riding Hood costume would be fucking hot.\u201d</p><p>The last leg of the trail is all uphill. Kate\u2019s breathing is heavy as we step out of the woods into a clearing that overlooks a swath of vibrant swells and valleys. It\u2019s a kaleidoscope of greens, browns, oranges and reds\u2014almost as stunning as the views from the balloon basket.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d I announce.</p><p>She stops in her tracks and gasps. Laid out just a few feet away is a thick cashmere blanket, illuminated by flickering LED candelabras at the four corners. A bottle of champagne chills in a silver ice bucket; there are two place settings with delicate china, crystal flutes and gleaming silverware; and gourmet sandwiches and chocolate-covered strawberries are hidden in a large antique picnic basket. Surrounding the display are stone planters, which overflow with fragrant white gardenias.</p><p>\u201cOh my . . .\u201d Kate is literally speechless.</p><p>I mentally pat my own fucking back.</p><p>We stand hand in hand next to the blanket. The candlelight glows in Kate\u2019s eyes as she looks over the spread. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky,\u201d she whispers, in a voice heavy with gratitude.</p><p>I turn her toward me. \u201cI won\u2019t argue with that, but which good fortune are you thinking about specifically?\u201d</p><p>Her hands slide up over my shoulders, encircling my neck. Her head tilts delicately as she regards me, total devotion on her face. \u201cDo you remember The Notebook?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a chuckle, I nod.</p><p>\u201cIf that were to happen to me\u2014if for some reason I forgot everything else . . . I would still remember you. How it feels to be loved by you. I\u2019m the luckiest woman in the world, because I\u2019m the only one who gets to say \u2018Drew Evans is in love with me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I cup her jaw, holding her precious face in both hands. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who ever will.\u201d</p><p>Before I can utter another word, Kate rises on her toes and kisses me. Unhurriedly, she worships my mouth with her own, conveying her veneration with every deliberate brush of her tongue.</p><p>And . . . and I just can\u2019t fucking wait anymore. With my lips against hers, the words bubble up from my chest. A rough, eager plea.</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Kate.\u201d</p><p>For a second, she doesn\u2019t move. I feel her breath against my chin as she digests the words. Slowly, she leans back to look into my eyes, her face blank\u2014staring\u2014as if she\u2019s not sure she heard what she thinks she just heard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks softly.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I had this whole speech, all the reasons we should get married. But the only reason that matters is\u2014I love you. You\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ve ever loved\u2014the only one I want to\u2014for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Holding her gaze, I sink down on one bended knee and take the ring box from my pocket. \u201cWe already have a life together, but I want to make it official. I want to grow old next to you, I want to know you\u2019ll be there to smack my hand when I\u2019m a dirty old man and try to cop a feel.\u201d</p><p>The corners of her mouth arch up into a smile.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re the luckiest woman in the world because I love you,\u201d I continue, \u201cthen I\u2019d be the most blessed son of a bitch in the universe if I get to be your husband.\u201d</p><p>I open the box, revealing the impeccable two-carat princess-cut diamond, encased in an elegant platinum band. I was tempted to go bigger\u2014flashier\u2014but this is Kate. It had to be something she\u2019d love\u2014a ring she\u2019d gaze at adoringly on her hand. Beautiful, simple, flawless\u2014like her.</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes dance between the ring and my face. She doesn\u2019t cry, and I\u2019m relieved. I want her laughter, her moans, her gasps\u2014not her tears. Instead, she smiles, and it\u2019s like the sunrise, when those first soft shades of light peek out from the horizon\u2014new and stunning and full of possibilities.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Her breath hitches. And she whispers, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The effect of those three tiny letters is immediate and extraordinary. Warmth rushes through my veins. I exhale a lungful of air I didn\u2019t realize I was holding.</p><p>Fucking yes.</p><p>I mean, of course she said yes. Never doubted it.</p><p>I take the ring from the box, and slip it on her slender finger. Perfect fit. Bending her head, Kate seeks out my lips and I\u2019m more than happy to give them to her. Our tongues stroke each other, gentle but sincere, like a vow. Kate falls to her knees, and my fingers caress the soft wisps of hair at the base of her neck. I angle my mouth and encase her bottom lip in my own, sucking gently. She moans and pulls me against her.</p><p>I skim my fingers up the smooth skin of her outer thighs, where her dress ends. Grasping the material, I lift it up over her head in one sure move. Leaving her only in a red lace bra and matching panties\u2014a thong.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>I grasp her hips, dragging her closer. A groan of satisfaction rumbles from my throat when I cup the supple flesh of her perfect ass in both palms. That gorgeous ass\u2014my favorite part. I hold her steady as I grind against her, making my already needy cock harder.</p><p>While we\u2019re still lip-locked, Kate\u2019s deft fingers unbutton my shirt, impatiently yanking it down my arms. I shrug out of the offending garment, and make quick work of the clasps on her bra. I sigh when those pale globes tumble from the confines of their red lace. Cupping the heavy flesh with both hands, I duck my head to take one already peaked, tight nipple into my mouth. Kate\u2019s hands burrow through my hair, tugging and clasping. I suck at the tasty little nub, squeezing it between my tongue and the roof of my mouth with barely restrained pressure.</p> <p>We fall back on the blanket, a tangle of moans and writhing limbs. Kate\u2019s nails scour the muscles of my bare back, and I know she\u2019s feeling just as wild as I am.</p><p>With my heartbeat drumming in my ears, I rear back and jerk the scrap of pantie fabric down her hips\u2014tossing the thong over my shoulder. Luscious, rapid pants escape Kate\u2019s lips as my tongue travels up her inner thigh. I hook her knee over my shoulder, spreading her open, savoring the view of her hot, pink flesh in the light of the setting sun.</p><p>I hover over her, just close enough to caress her with my breath. \u201cFuck, Kate, the things I want to do to you . . .\u201d</p><p>Her round, dark eyes drift over my face\u2014filled with love and need. Docile and demanding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Drew,\u201d she tells me in a low voice. \u201cYou can do anything . . . everything.\u201d</p><p>Does she even know what she\u2019s offering? How badly I want to own her\u2014fucking claim her\u2014out here in the open? How desperately I want to hear her voice, soaked with pleasure, screaming my name until it echoes off the hills?</p><p>Anything?</p><p>Oh the possibilities.</p><p>Feeling Kate\u2019s eyes on mine\u2014watching her watch me\u2014I slide down till I\u2019m face level with that sweet juncture between her thighs. A groan of gratification rumbles from my chest when my open mouth envelops her delectable *. I spear her slick folds with my tongue and revel in her taste\u2014the feel of her against my tongue. Kate arches her back and swivels her hips, urging me on\u2014seeking wet, firm friction. I love her roughly with my mouth, sucking, nipping, and laving\u2014scratching the tender skin of her thighs with the stubble of my chin.</p><p>When her legs are trembling and her words become a jumbled chant of need, I rise, grasp her hips, and flip her over. She goes oh so willingly, bracing herself on hands and knees. Gripping her shoulder, I plunge inside, grunting and grinding, skimming my other hand down her back, over the swell of her ass, across her stomach, then back up again. My pelvis crashes against her ass, jerking her forward. Until she pushes back against me, welcoming every hard thrust.</p><p>It\u2019s unbridled fucking. Passion at its most raw.</p><p>I\u2019m all senses, pure sensation\u2014the wet, gripping muscles of her *, her smooth skin under my palm, her silky hair wrapped around my fingers, her keening whimpers, the scent of sweat and sex, the feel of her hand on my thigh, pushing for more. Faster. Deeper.</p><p>I pull her up harshly, her back against my chest, still fully buried inside. My teeth scrape her ear, her neck. Kate moans low and loud. My hand slides down between her legs, rubbing her clit until she quivers.</p><p>I\u2019m possessed with the animalistic need to mark her. My lips latch on to the fragile skin where her shoulder and neck meet. I suck until she screams\u2014on the razor-edge of pleasure and pain. Then I move my mouth upward and do it again. Leaving a trail of brands.</p><p>Because she\u2019s mine.</p><p>The thought makes me harder and I surge forward again, needing to feel her come around me, all my focus centered on where I\u2019m enveloped. But it\u2019s the brush of Kate\u2019s lips against my hand that pulls me back, that slows the shallow plunge of my cock. She kisses each fingertip tenderly, then begs, \u201cI want to see you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I untangle my hand from her hair, and Kate turns on her knees, facing me. Without a word, I sit back on my ass and she straddles my waist, her small hands resting on my shoulders. She looks down, gyrates until we\u2019re lined up, and I grind my jaw with pleasure as she slowly sinks down on my dick.</p><p>Our hard breaths mingle, face-to-face, and I\u2019m caught in her eyes. Drowning in the depths of those dark pools\u2014with no thought of looking anywhere else. My hands grasp her slender hips, helping her rise and fall. And it\u2019s even more powerful, more fucking intense than our desperate vigorous movements just minutes before.</p><p>I gather Kate closer, her breasts brush my chest, her forehead rests against mine, and with a strangled cry she comes. The feel of her contracting, tight and hot, sends me straight over the edge with her. My hips surge upward one final time, and our bodies go stiff, racked with helpless, pulsating ecstasy.</p><p>Breathlessly, Kate rubs her nose against mine and I kiss her with languid ease. I lay back on the blanket and she squirms on top of me until her head rests comfortably on my chest, her legs surrounding mine. For a few minutes, neither of us speaks. We just enjoy the satiated looseness of our limbs and the slight breeze on our heated skin.</p><p>Then Kate lifts her head and rests her hand on my jaw. \u201cRemember that night, when you asked me to move in with you? You made me dinner at your apartment and we danced?\u201d</p><p>Jesus, as if I could forget. The desperation, the resolve to convince Kate her heart was safe with me, the amazing sensation of holding her again after what felt like fucking forever, and the perfect elation when she agreed to give us a shot.</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>Kate squeezes my hand. \u201cAnd you told me you wanted to make all my dreams come true?\u201d</p><p>I run my finger across her cheek. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She stares at the glittering ring on her finger with a contented smile. \u201cYou just did.\u201d</p><p>Keep reading for a sneak peek at Brent\u2019s story in</p> <p>APPEALED</p><p>The third book in New York Times bestselling author Emma Chase\u2019s sexy Legal Briefs series</p><p>Coming Fall 2015 from Gallery Books!</p><p>I look across the yard at the crowd of chattering, monochromatic people.

But the body within it is the real highlight. She\u2019s tiny but unmistakably womanly\u2014warm peach-hued skin, an elegant neck, delicate arms, a slight swell of cleavage, a tight waist, and toned legs with the sweetest hint of muscle. Her hair is thick, a multifaceted blond\u2014pale, almost white strands grace her dainty jaw\u2014but there\u2019s shades of honey-gold and caramel leading back to a low bun.</p><p>She\u2019s fucking stunning.

I\u2019m sure the birthday girl is ecstatic. Caviar and champagne\u2014what every one-year-old wants.\u201d</p> <p>Sarcasm. I like sarcasm. It suggests intelligence.

All those nasty casinos and dust and desert.\u201d She caresses her cheek. \u201cThat dry air has wreaked havoc on your skin.

Though we already considered Randy, didn\u2019t we? It wasn\u2019t a good fit\u2014I\u2019ll keep working on it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, checking her out all over again. Because now that I know who she is, we\u2019re talking a whole other level of depraved interest.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn. You look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d She sighs, then gazes at her manicure in that bitchy way women do. \u201cThank you.\u201d There\u2019s not a shred of sincerity in her tone\u2014like she\u2019s heard a million compliments before. Which, with her level of hotness, is possible. Except for one thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do to your eyes?\u201d I lean in, frowning.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re called contact lenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, take them out. I don\u2019t like them. Your real eyes are incredible.\u201d</p><p>Breathtaking, actually\u2014deep, warm brown with flecks of gold. I\u2019d know Kennedy\u2019s eyes anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do to your face?\u201d she asks, folding her arms.</p><p>I touch my chin. \u201cI grew a beard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ungrow it. It looks like a vagina from a 1970s porn film.\u201d</p> <p>My lips twitch\u2014because, fuck, the things that come out of her mouth.</p><p>That always did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to get the impression you don\u2019t like me anymore, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>Challenge rises in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re assuming I actually liked you to begin with. You know what they say about people who assume, ass.\u201d</p><p>I square off against Kennedy. Game on.</p><p>\u201cYou definitely liked me. Remember that summer you flashed me your boobs? That has to count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not flash you my boobs.\u201d She scowls.</p><p>\u201cYou totally did. They were the first I\u2019d ever seen\u2014made an indelible impression.\u201d</p> <p>She grinds her teeth. \u201cI jumped in the pool and my bathing suit rode up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was a Freudian Nip Slip. Subconsciously, you meant to do it, because you liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a pompous bastard. Possibly a sociopath.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>Over Kennedy\u2019s shoulder, I catch my mother\u2019s eager gaze on us. She\u2019d be less obvious if she had a spotlight and binoculars aimed our way.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s watching us.\u201d</p><p>Kennedy places her empty glass on the tray of a passing waiter and picks up a full one. \u201cOf course she\u2019s watching us. For years, her greatest wish was that I\u2019d grow up to bear your spawn.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Then I glance sideways at Kennedy, gauging her reaction. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d She looks me straight in the face. \u201cI could never be with someone like you\u2014you have the maturity of a twelve-year-old boy.\u201d</p><p>I raise my glass. \u201cAnd you have the chest of one.\u201d</p><p>I expect her to come back with a clever, biting retort, but she just gestures to me with an open palm. \u201cI rest my case.\u201d</p><p>Ironically, my first instinct is to stick my tongue out at her. But I won\u2019t give her the satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d she adds with a haughty smile. \u201cI\u2019m seeing someone. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of him? David Prince.\u201d</p><p>David Prince is a junior senator from Illinois with his eye on the White House. He\u2019s a rock star, the second coming of John F. Kennedy. I bet the entire Democratic Party and a good percentage of Republicans have his picture hanging on their office wall\u2014the same way that poster of a feather-haired Jon Bon Jovi hung on the bedroom walls of all sixteen of my girl cousins\u2019. And two of the boys.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating a politician?\u201d I say it like it\u2019s a dirty word, because in my experience politicians are rarely clean.</p><p>She raises a perfectly manicured eyebrow. \u201cYou were almost a politician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in my father\u2019s wet dreams,\u201d I volley back. \u201cAlthough, you always said you were going to marry a prince. Sounds like you\u2019re on your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother said that\u2014not me.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cThen she must be ecstatic. You\u2019re finally everything she always wanted you to be.\u201d</p><p>Game. Set. Match.</p><p>Something shifts in Kennedy\u2019s eyes, and I suddenly get the feeling we\u2019re not playing anymore. \u201cNot everything. Mother wanted me to be a ballerina.\u201d</p><p>Years ago, I\u2019d heard she was doing undergrad at Brown University. But other than that tiny detail there\u2019s been nothing. Her father is a talker, her mother a bragger, but when Kennedy dropped off the grid after boarding school, information on her locked up like Fort Knox.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you were doing in Las Vegas\u2014dancing? Kind of short for a showgirl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Though I\u2019d be sitting front and center for that show if I could.</p><p>She nods slowly, smiling way too smugly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, too short for a showgirl . . . but just the right height for a federal prosecutor.\u201d</p><p>That stops me cold.

You\u2019re now the Lex Luthor to my Superman, the Magneto to my Professor Xavier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your comic book obsession obviously still in full effect, I\u2019d say I\u2019m more the Wendy to your Peter Pan complex.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the dig because I\u2019m too busy connecting the dots. \u201cWait a second\u2014your middle name is Suzanne.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThought we covered that, already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re K.

If you want a real feel for jurisprudence today, forget Judge Judy\u2014watch Let\u2019s Make a Deal instead.</p><p>She chuckles in a distinctly not-nice way. \u201cBrent, Brent, Brent\u2014I don\u2019t make plea deals. Ever. It\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m known for. Oh, and I\u2019ve never lost a case. I\u2019m known for that too.\u201d</p><p>I was wrong\u2014this match isn\u2019t anywhere near over.
