S. ELIOT, FROM \u201cBURNT NORTON\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>In northwest Washington state, jagged granite mountains reach for the misty sky, their peaks inaccessible even in this age of helicopters and high-tech adventurers. The trees in this part of the country grow thick as an old man\u2019s beard and block out all but the hardiest rays of the sun. Only in the brightest months of summer can hikers find their way back to the cars they park along the sides of the road.</p><p>Deep in the black-and-green darkness of this old-growth forest lies the tiny town of Last Bend. To visitors\u2014there are no strangers here\u2014it is the kind of place they\u2019d thought to encounter only in the winding tracks of their own imaginations. When they first walk down the streets, folks swear they hear a noise that can only be described as laughter. Then come the memories, some real, some manufactured images from old movies and Life magazine. They recall how their grandmother\u2019s lemonade tasted ... or the creaky sound of a porch swing gliding quietly back and forth, back and forth, on the tail end of a muggy summer\u2019s night.</p><p>Last Bend was founded fifty years ago, when a big, broad-shouldered Scotsman named Ian Campbell gave up his crumbling ancestral home in Edinburgh and set off in search of adventure. Somewhere along the way\u2014family legend attributed it to Wyoming\u2014he took up rock climbing, and spent the next ten years wandering from mountain to mountain, looking for two things: the ultimate climb and a place to leave his mark.</p> <p>He found what he was looking for in Washington\u2019s North Cascade mountain range. In this place where Sasquatches were more than a campfire myth and glaciers flowed year round in ice-blue rivers, he staked his claim. He drove as close to the mighty Mt. Baker as he could and bought a hundred acres of prime pastureland, then he bought a corner lot on a gravel road that would someday mature into the Mount Baker Highway. He built his town along the pebbly, pristine shores of Angel Lake and christened it Last Bend, because he thought the only home worth having was worth searching for, and he\u2019d found his at the last turn in the road.</p><p>It took him some time to find a woman willing to live in a moss-chinked log cabin without electricity or running water, but find her he did\u2014a fiery Irish lass with dreams that matched his own. Together they fashioned the town of their combined imagination; she planted Japanese maple saplings along Main Street and started a dozen traditions\u2014Glacier Days, the Sasquatch race, and the Halloween haunted house on the corner of Cascade and Main.</p><p>In the same year the Righteous Brothers lost that lovin\u2019 feeling, Ian and Fiona began to build their dream home, a huge, semicircular log house that sat on a small rise in the middle of their property. On some days, when the sky was steel blue, the glaciered mountain peaks seemed close enough to touch. Towering Douglas firs and cedars rimmed the carefully mowed lawn, protected the orchard from winter\u2019s frozen breath. Bordering the west end of their land was Angel Creek, a torrent in the still gloaming of the year, a quiet gurgling creek when the sun shone high and hot in the summer months. In the wintertime, they could step onto their front porch and hear the echo of Angel Falls, only a few miles away.</p><p>Now the third generation of Campbells lived in that house. Tucked tightly under the sharply sloped roofline was a young boy\u2019s bedroom. It was not unlike other little boys\u2019 rooms in this media-driven age\u2014Corvette bed, Batman posters tacked to the uneven log walls, Goosebumps books strewn across the shag-carpeted floor, piles of plastic dinosaurs and fake snakes and Star Wars action figures.</p><p>Nine-year-old Bret Campbell lay quietly in his bed, watching the digital clock by his bed flick red numbers into the darkness. Five-thirty. Five thirty-one. Five thirty-two.</p><p>Halloween morning.</p> <p>He had wanted to set the alarm for this special Saturday morning, but he didn\u2019t know how, and if he\u2019d asked for help, his surprise would have been ruined. And so he snuggled under the Mr. Freeze comforter, waiting.</p><p>At precisely 5:45, he flipped the covers back and climbed out of bed. Careful not to make any noise, he pulled the grocery sack from underneath his bed and unpacked it.</p><p>There was no light on, but he didn\u2019t need one. He\u2019d stared at these clothes every night for a week. His Halloween costume. A sparkly pair of hand-me-down cowboy boots that they\u2019d picked up at the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes used-clothing shop, a fake leather vest from the Dollar-Saver thrift shop, a pair of felt chaps his mom had made, a plaid flannel shirt and brand-new Wrangler jeans from Zeke\u2019s Feed and Seed, and best of all, a shiny sheriff\u2019s star and gun belt from the toy store. His daddy had even made him a kid-sized lariat that could be strapped to the gun belt.</p><p>He stripped off his pj\u2019s and slipped into the outfit, leaving behind the gun belt, guns, chaps, lariat, and ten-gallon hat. Those he wouldn\u2019t need now.</p><p>He felt like a real cowboy. He grabbed the index card with the instructions on it\u2014just in case\u2014and went to his bedroom door, peeking out into the shadowy hallway.</p><p>He peered down at the other two bedrooms. Both doors were closed and no light slid out from underneath. Of course his sixteen-year-old sister, Jacey, was asleep. It was Saturday, and on the day after a high-school football game, she always slept until noon. Dad had been at the hospital all night with a patient, so he\u2019d be tired this morning, too. Only Mom would be getting up early\u2014and she\u2019d be in the barn, ready to go, at six o\u2019clock.</p><p>He pushed the flash button on his Darth Maul watch. Five forty-nine.</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d He flicked up the collar on his flannel shirt and bounded down the last set of stairs. Feeling his way through the darkened kitchen, he hit the \u201con\u201d button on the coffeepot (another surprise) and headed for the front door, opening it slowly.</p> <p>On the porch, he was spooked by the black shape of a man beside him, but in the second after he saw the outline, he remembered. It was the pumpkin-headed farmer he and Mom had made last night. The smell of fresh straw was strong\u2014even a day later.</p><p>Bret picked his way past the decorations and jumped off the porch, then he ran up the driveway. At the empty guest cottage, he zagged to the right and slithered between the fence\u2019s second and third rail. Breathing hard, he clambered up the slippery grass pasture.</p><p>A single floodlight lit up the huge, two-storied barn his granddad had built. Bret had always been in awe of the famous grandfather he\u2019d never met, the man who\u2019d left his name on streets and buildings and mountains, the man who\u2019d somehow known that Last Bend belonged right here.</p><p>The stories of granddad\u2019s adventures had been told and retold for as long as Bret could remember, and he wanted to be just like him. That\u2019s why he was up so early on this Halloween morning. He was going to convince his overprotective mother that he was ready to go on the Angel Falls overnight trail ride.</p><p>He grabbed the cold iron latch on the barn door and swung it open. He loved the smell of this old barn; it always made him think of his mom. Sometimes, when he was away from home, he\u2019d smell something\u2014hay or leather or neat\u2019s-foot oil\u2014and he\u2019d think of her.</p><p>Horses nickered softly and moved around in their stalls, thinking it was feeding time. He flicked on the lights and hurried down the wide cement aisle toward the tack room. He struggled to pull his mom\u2019s jumping saddle off the wooden tree. He dropped it twice before he figured out how to balance it on his arm. With the girth dragging and clanging behind him, he headed to Silver Bullet\u2019s stall.</p><p>There he stopped. Jeez, Bullet looked bigger this morning ...</p><p>Granddad would never chicken out.</p><p>Bret took a deep breath and opened the stall door.</p><p>It took him lots of tries\u2014lots of tries\u2014but he finally got the saddle up on the horse\u2019s high back. He even managed to tighten the girth. Not enough, maybe, but at least he\u2019d buckled the strap.</p><p>He led Bullet to the center of the arena. He couldn\u2019t see his boots\u2014they were buried in the soft dirt. The lights overhead cast weird shadows on him and Bullet, but he liked those slithering black lines. They reminded him that it was Halloween.</p><p>Bullet dropped her head and snorted, pawing at the ground.</p><p>Bret tightened his hold on the lead rope. \u201cWhoa, girl,\u201d he said softly, trying not to be afraid. That was the way his mom always talked to animals. She said you could talk down the craziest animal if you were patient and quiet.</p><p>The barn door shuddered, then let out a long, slow creaking sound. Wood scraped on cement, and the door opened.</p><p>Mom stood in the doorway. Behind her, the rising sun was a beautiful purplish color and it seemed to set her hair on pink fire. He couldn\u2019t quite see her face, but he could see her silhouette, black against the brightness, and he could hear the steady click-click-click of her boot heels on the concrete. Then she paused, tented one hand across her eyes. \u201cBret? Honey, is that you?\u201d</p><p>Bret led Bullet toward Mom, who stood at the edge of the arena with her hands planted on her hips. She was wearing a long brown sweater and black riding pants; her boots were already dusty. She was staring at him\u2014one of those Mommy looks\u2014and he sure wished she\u2019d smile.</p><p>He yanked hard on the rope and brought the mare to a sudden stop, just the way they\u2019d taught him in 4-H. \u201cI saddled her myself, Mom.\u201d He stroked Bullet\u2019s velvet-soft muzzle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get her to take the bit, but I cinched up the saddle just like I\u2019m s\u2019posed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got up early\u2014on Halloween, your third favorite holiday\u2014and saddled my horse for me. Well, well.\u201d She bent down and tousled his hair. \u201cHate to let me be alone for too long, eh, Bretster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how lonely you get.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, then knelt down in the dirt. She was like that, his mom, she never worried about getting dirty\u2014and she liked to look her kids in the eyes. At least that\u2019s what she said. She pulled the worn, black leather glove off her right hand and let it fall. It landed on her thigh, but she didn\u2019t seem to notice as she reached out and smoothed the hair from Bret\u2019s face. \u201cSo, young Mr. Horseman, what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>That was another thing about his mom. You could never fool her. It was sorta like she had X-ray vision. \u201cI want to go on the overnight ride to Angel Falls with you this year. Last year you said maybe later, when I was older. Well, now I\u2019m a whole year older, and I did really good at the fair this year\u2014I mean, hardly any nine-year-olds got blue ribbons\u2014and I kept my stall clean and kept Scotty brushed all down. And now I can saddle a big old Thoroughbred by myself. If I was at Disneyland, I would definitely reach Mickey\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>Mom sat back on her heels. Some dirt must have gotten in her face, because her eyes were watering. \u201cYou\u2019re not my baby boy anymore, are you?\u201d</p><p>He plopped onto her bent legs, pretending that he was little enough to still be held in her arms. She gently took the lead rope from him, and he wrapped his arms around her neck.</p><p>She kissed his forehead and held him tightly. It was his favorite kind of kiss, the kind she gave him every morning at the breakfast table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He loved it when she held him like this. Lately (since he\u2019d started fourth grade) he\u2019d had to become a big boy. Like he couldn\u2019t let Mom hold his hand as they walked down the school corridors ... and she definitely couldn\u2019t kiss him good-bye. So now they only had times like this when he could be a little boy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess any kid big enough to saddle this horse is ready to go on an overnight ride. I\u2019m proud of you, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>He let out a loud Whoopee! and hugged her. \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problema.\u201d She gently eased away from him and got to her feet. As they stood there together, she let her gloved hand sort of hang there in the space between them, and Bret slipped his hand in hers.</p> <p>She squeezed his hand. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to work Bullet for an hour or so before Jeanine gets here to worm the horses. I\u2019ve got a zillion things to do today before trick-or-treating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she giving any shots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d She ruffled his hair again, then reached down for her glove.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay and watch you ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember the rules?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGee, no, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but no talking and no getting off the fence.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou just have to tell me the rules again, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSit down, Jim Carrey.\u201d Turning her back to him, she tightened the girth and bridled the mare. \u201cGo and get me my helmet, will you, Bretster?\u201d</p><p>He ran to the tack room. At the chest marked Mike\u2019s stuff, he bent down and lifted the lid, rummaging through the fly sprays, brushes, lead ropes, buckets, and hoof picks until he found the dusty black velvet-covered helmet. Tucking it under his arm, he let the lid drop shut and ran back into the arena.</p><p>Mom was on Bullet now, her gloved hands resting lightly on the horse\u2019s withers. \u201cThanks, sweetie.\u201d She leaned down and took the helmet.</p> <p>By the time Bret reached his favorite spot on the arena fence, Mom was easing Bullet toward the path that ran along the wall. He climbed up the slats and sat on the top rail.</p><p>He watched as she went \u2019round and \u2019round. She pushed Bullet through her paces as a warm-up: walk, trot, extended trot, and then to a rocking-horse canter. Bret watched as horse and rider became a blur of motion.</p><p>He knew instantly when Mom had decided it was time to jump. He\u2019d watched so many times, he knew the signs, although he couldn\u2019t have said what they were. He just knew that she was going to head for the first two-foot jump.</p><p>Just like he knew something was wrong.</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cWait, Mommy. The jump is in the wrong place. Someone musta moved it ...\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t hear him. Bullet was fighting her, lunging and bucking as Mommy tried to rein the mare down to a controlled canter.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, girl, slow down. Calm down ...\u201d</p><p>Bret heard the words as Mom flew past him. He wanted to scramble down from his perch, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to\u2014not when she was working a horse over jumps.</p> <p>It was too late to yell anyway. Mom was already at the fence. Bret\u2019s heart was hammering in his chest.</p><p>Somethingiswrong. The words jammed together in his mind, growing bigger and uglier with every breath. He wanted to say them out loud, to yell, but he couldn\u2019t make his mouth work.</p><p>Silver Bullet bunched up and jumped over the fake brick siding with ease.</p><p>Bret heard his mom\u2019s whoop of triumph and her laugh.</p><p>He had a split second of relief.</p><p>Then Silver Bullet stopped dead.</p><p>One second Mom was laughing, and the next, she was flying off the horse. Her head cracked into the barn post so hard the whole fence shook. And then she was just lying there in the dirt, her body crumpled like an old piece of paper.</p><p>There was no sound in the big, covered arena except his own heavy breathing. Even the horse was silent, standing beside her rider as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Bret slid down the fence and ran to his mom. He dropped to his knees beside her. Blood trickled down from underneath her helmet, smearing in her short black hair.</p><p>He touched her shoulder, gave her a little shove. \u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>The bloodied hair slid away from her face. That\u2019s when he saw that her left eye was open.</p><p>Bret\u2019s sister, Jacey, was the first to hear his scream. She came running into the arena, holding Dad\u2019s big down coat around her. \u201cBretster\u2014\u201d Then she saw Mommy, lying there. \u201cOh my God! Don\u2019t touch her!\u201d she yelled at Bret. \u201cI\u2019ll get Dad.\u201d</p><p>Bret couldn\u2019t have moved if he\u2019d wanted to. He just sat there, staring down at his broken mommy, praying and praying for her to wake up, but the prayers had no voice; he couldn\u2019t make himself make any sound at all.</p><p>Finally Daddy ran into the barn.</p><p>Bret popped to his feet and held his arms out, but Daddy ran right past him. Bret stumbled backward so fast, he hit the fence wall. He couldn\u2019t breathe enough to cry. He just stood there, watching the red, red blood slither down his mommy\u2019s face. Jacey came and stood beside him.</p><p>Daddy knelt beside her, dropping his black medical bag into the dirt. \u201cHang on, Mikaela,\u201d he whispered. Gently he removed her helmet\u2014should Bret have done that?\u2014then Daddy opened her mouth and poked his fingers between her teeth. She coughed and sputtered, and Bret saw blood gush across his daddy\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Daddy\u2019s hands that were always so clean ... now Mommy\u2019s blood was everywhere, even on the sleeves of Daddy\u2019s flannel pajamas.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Mike,\u201d his dad kept saying, over and over again, \u201chang on. We\u2019re all here ... stay with us....\u201d</p><p>Stay with us. That meant don\u2019t die ... which meant she could die.</p><p>Dad looked up at Jacey. \u201cCall nine-one-one now.\u201d</p><p>It felt like hours they all stood there, frozen and silent. Finally red lights cartwheeled through the dim barn, sirens screamed; an ambulance skidded through the loose gravel alongside the horse trailer.</p><p>Blue-uniformed paramedics came running into the barn, dragging a bumping, clanking bed on wheels behind them. Bret\u2019s heart started beating so loud he couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>He tried to scream Save her! but when he opened his mouth, all that came out was a thick black cloud. He watched the smoke turn into a bunch of tiny spiders and float away.</p><p>He clamped his mouth shut and backed away, hitting the fence so hard it knocked him dizzy. He covered his ears and shut his eyes and prayed as hard as he could.</p><p>She is dying.</p><p>Memories rush through her mind in no particular order, some tinged with the sweet scent of roses after a spring rain, some smelling of the sand at the lake where she tasted the first kiss that mattered. Some\u2014too many\u2014come wrapped in the iridescent, sticky web of regret.</p><p>They are moving her now, strapping her body to a strange bed. The lights are so bright that she cannot open her eyes. An engine starts and the movement hurts. Oh, God, it hurts ...</p><p>She can hear her husband\u2019s voice, the soft, whispering love sounds that have guided her through the last ten years of her life, and though she can hear nothing from her children, her babies, she knows they are here, watching her. More than anything in the world, she wants a chance to say something to them, even if only a sound, a sigh, something ...</p><p>Warm tears leak from the corners of her eyes, slide behind her ears, and dampen the stiff, unpleasantly scented pillow behind her head. She wishes she could hold them back, swallow them, so that her children won\u2019t see, but such control is gone, as distant and impossible as the ability to lift her hand for a final wave.</p><p>Then again, maybe she isn\u2019t crying at all, maybe it is her soul, leaking from her body in droplets that no one will ever see.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>When he was young, Liam Campbell hadn\u2019t been able to get out of Last Bend fast enough. The town had seemed so small and constrained, squeezed as it was inside his famous father\u2019s fist. Everywhere Liam went, he was compared to his larger-than-life dad, and he fell short. Even at home, he felt invisible. His parents were so in love ... there simply wasn\u2019t much room left over for a boy who read books and longed to be a concert pianist.</p><p>To his utter astonishment, he had been accepted at Harvard. By the time he\u2019d finished his undergraduate studies, he\u2019d learned that he wasn\u2019t good enough to be a concert pianist. The best player at Last Bend, even the best at Harvard, wasn\u2019t good enough. He could be a music teacher at an expensive private school, maybe, but his talent didn\u2019t include the power or the anger or the desperate passion of the best of the best. So he\u2019d quietly tucked that youthful dream aside and turned his attention to medicine. If he wasn\u2019t talented enough to entertain people with his hands, he believed he was caring enough to heal them.</p><p>He studied day and night, knowing that a quiet man like him, so reserved and ordinary, needed to be better than the competition.</p><p>He graduated at the top of his class and took a job that stunned and appalled his Ivy League classmates\u2014at an AIDS clinic in the Bronx. It was the early days of the epidemic and people were terrified of the disease. But Liam believed that there, amidst true suffering, he would discover the man he was meant to be.</p><p>In hallways that smelled of death and despair, he made a difference in patients\u2019 lives, but he never once got to say \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re cured.\u201d</p><p>Instead, he dispensed medicines that didn\u2019t work and held hands that got weaker and weaker. He held newborn babies who would never have the chance to dream of living in Paris. He wrote out death certificates until he could no longer hold a pen without horror.</p><p>When his mother died of a sudden heart attack, he came home and tended to the father who, for the first time, needed his only son. Liam had always meant to leave again, but then he\u2019d met Mikaela ...</p><p>Mike.</p><p>With her, at last, he had found his place in the world.</p><p>Now he was in the hospital, waiting to hear whether she would live ...</p><p>They had been here for only a few hours, but it felt like forever. His children were in the waiting room\u2014he could picture them, huddled together, weeping, Jacey drying her little brother\u2019s tears\u2014and though he longed to be with them, he knew that if he looked at his children now, he would break, and the tears that fell from his eyes would scald them all.</p><p>\u201cLiam?\u201d</p><p>He spun toward the voice. His hip cracked into a crash cart and set the supplies rattling. He reached out and steadied them.</p><p>Dr. Stephen Penn, the chief of neurology, stood before him. Though he was Liam\u2019s age\u2014just turned fifty\u2014Stephen looked old now, and tired. They had played golf together for years, he and Stephen, but nothing in their relationship had prepared them for this moment.</p><p>He touched Liam\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>They walked side by side down the austere corridor and turned into the ICU. Liam noticed the way the trauma nurses wouldn\u2019t look at him. It was humbling to know how it felt to be the \u201cnext of kin.\u201d</p><p>At last they entered a glass-walled private room, where Mikaela lay in a narrow bed, behind a pale privacy curtain. She looked like a broken doll, hooked up to machines\u2014ventilators, IVs, monitors that tracked everything from her heart rate to her intracranial pressure. The ventilator breathed for her, every breath a rhythmic thwop-whoosh-clunk in the quiet room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe ... her brain is functioning, but we don\u2019t know at what level because of the meds.\u201d Stephen produced a straight pin and poked Mikaela\u2019s small, bare feet, saying nothing when she failed to respond. He conducted a few more tests, which he knew Liam could assess along with him. Quietly he said, \u201cThe neurosurgeon is on board and up to speed, just in case, but we haven\u2019t identified anything surgical. We\u2019re hyperventilating her, controlling her pressure and temperature. Barring development of any bleeding ... well, you know we\u2019re doing everything we can.\u201d</p><p>Liam closed his eyes. For the first time in his life, he wished he weren\u2019t a doctor. He didn\u2019t want to understand the reality of her condition. They had a state-of-the-art medical center and some of the best doctors north of San Francisco, all drawn here by the quality of life. But the truth was, there wasn\u2019t a damn thing that could be done for her right now.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to speak, but he couldn\u2019t seem to hold it all inside. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to live without her ...\u201d</p><p>When Stephen turned to Liam, a sad, knowing expression filled his eyes. For a split second, he wasn\u2019t a specialist, but just a man, a husband, and he understood. \u201cWe\u2019ll know more tomorrow, if ...\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence; it wasn\u2019t necessary.</p> <p>If she makes it through the night.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Steve,\u201d Liam said, his voice barely audible above the whirring of the machines and the steady drip-drip-drip of the IVs.</p><p>Stephen started to leave but paused at the doorway and turned back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Liam.\u201d Without waiting for a response, he left the room. When he came back, there were several nurses with him. Together they wheeled Mikaela out of the room for more tests.</p><p>Courage, Liam thought to himself, wasn\u2019t a hot, blistering emotion held only in the hands of men who joined the special forces and jumped out of airplanes and scaled unnamed mountains. It was a quiet thing, ice-cold more often than not; the last tiny piece you found when you thought that everything was gone. It was facing your children at a time like this, holding their hands and brushing their tears away when you were certain you hadn\u2019t the strength to do it. It was swallowing your own grief and going on, one shallow, bitter breath at a time.</p><p>He put away his own fear. Where, he couldn\u2019t have said, but somehow he boxed and buried it. He focused on the things that had to be done. Tragedy, he\u2019d learned, came wrapped in details\u2014insurance forms that had to be filled out, suitcases that had to be packed in case, schedules that needed to be altered. All of this he managed to do without breaking; if he did it without making eye contact with another human being, well, that was the way it had to be. He called Rosa Luna\u2014Mike\u2019s mother, who lived on the eastern side of the state\u2014and left an urgent \u201cCall me\u201d message on her answering machine. Then, unable to put it off any longer, he walked down the busy corridor to the hospital\u2019s lobby.</p> <p>Jacey was sitting in one of the red vinyl chairs by the gift shop, reading a magazine. Bret was on the floor, idly playing with the toys the hospital staff kept in a plastic box.</p><p>Liam\u2019s hands started to shake. He crossed his arms tightly and stood there, swaying a little. Help me, God, he prayed, then he forced his arms to his sides and strode into the area. \u201cHi, guys,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Jacey lurched to her feet. The magazine she\u2019d been reading fluttered to the floor. Her eyes were swollen and red-rimmed; her mouth was drawn into a tremulous line. She was wearing a wrinkled pink sweatshirt and baggy jeans. \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>Bret didn\u2019t stand. He pushed the toys away and wiped his moist eyes, tilting his little chin upward. \u201cShe\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she?\u201d he said in a voice so dull and defeated that Liam felt the grief well up inside him again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead, Bretster,\u201d he said, feeling the hot sting of tears. Damn. He\u2019d promised himself that he wouldn\u2019t cry, not in front of them. They needed his strength now; the fear was his alone to bear. He forced his eyes to open wide and pinched the bridge of his nose for a second, then he knelt down beside his son and scooped him into his arms, holding him tightly. He wished to God there was something he could say, some magical bit of verbal wizardry that would banish their fear. But there was nothing save \u201cwait and see,\u201d and that was a cold comfort.</p><p>Jacey knelt beside Liam and pressed her cheek against his shoulder. He slipped an arm around her, too.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in bad shape right now,\u201d he said slowly, searching for each word. How could you tell your children that their mother could die? \u201cShe\u2019s suffered a pretty severe head injury. She needs our prayers.\u201d</p><p>Bret wiggled closer to Liam. His body started to shudder; tears dampened Liam\u2019s lab coat. When Bret looked up, he was sucking his thumb.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t know what to do. Bret had stopped sucking his thumb years ago, and here he was, huddled against his dad like a boy half his age, trying desperately to comfort himself.</p><p>Liam knew that from now on his children would know that dark and terrifying truth, the one that he and Mike had tried so hard to keep from them: The world could be a frightening place. Sometimes a single moment could change everything, and people\u2014no matter how much you loved them\u2014could die.</p><p>The hours of their vigil dripped into one another and formed a day.</p><p>Finally it was evening. Liam sat in the waiting room with his children, each of them watching the slow, methodical pirouette of the wall clock\u2019s black hands. It had been hours since anyone had spoken. Words, he\u2019d learned, had the density of lead. Each one seemed to weigh you down. And so they sat, together and yet alone.</p><p>At eight o\u2019clock they heard footsteps coming down the hallway toward them. Liam tensed instantly and leaned forward. Please, don\u2019t let it be bad news ...</p><p>Jacey\u2019s boyfriend, Mark Montgomery, swept into the quiet room, bringing with him a swell of energy. \u201cJace?\u201d he said, his voice too loud. He stood in the doorway, wearing a red-and-white letterman\u2019s sweater and baggy black sweatpants. \u201cI just heard ...\u201d</p> <p>Jacey ran into his arms, sobbing against his chest. Finally she drew back and looked up at him. \u201cWe ... haven\u2019t gotten to see her yet.\u201d Mark kept his arm around her and led her to the sofa. Together they sat down. Jacey leaned against him. The quiet flutter of their whispery voices floated through the room.</p><p>Liam went to Bret and hugged him, cradling his son in his arms, carrying him back to the chair. And still they watched the clock.</p><p>Just before nine o\u2019clock, Stephen came into the room.</p><p>Liam eased Bret onto the floor. Then he stood up and went to Stephen.</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d Stephen said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do for her tonight. We just have to wait and see.\u201d He lowered his voice then, speaking with a friend\u2019s concern. \u201cTake your children home, Liam. Try to get some sleep. We\u2019ll talk again in the morning. If anything ... happens, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Liam knew that Stephen was right. He should take his children home, but the thought of walking into that empty, empty house ...</p><p>\u201cTake them home, Liam,\u201d Stephen said again.</p><p>Liam sighed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Stephen patted him on the shoulder, then turned and left.</p><p>Liam took a deep breath. \u201cCome on, kids. It\u2019s time to go home. We\u2019ll come back in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Jacey stood up. \u201cHome?\u201d She looked terrified. Liam knew that she didn\u2019t want to walk into that house, either.</p><p>Mark glanced at her, then at Liam. \u201cA bunch of us were going to go to the haunted house. Maybe ... maybe you want to come?\u201d</p><p>Jacey shook her head. \u201cNo, I need to stay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, Jace,\u201d Liam said softly. \u201cJust take your beeper. I\u2019ll call you if anything happens.\u201d</p><p>She moved toward him. \u201cNo, Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and held her tightly, whispering, \u201cGo, Jace. Think of something else for an hour or two. We can\u2019t help her this way.\u201d</p><p>She drew back. He could see the war going on within her; she wanted to go and she wanted to stay. Finally she turned to Mark. \u201cOkay. Maybe just for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Mark came over, took Jacey\u2019s hand in his, and led her out of the room.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d Bret said after she\u2019d left. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Bretster, I\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Bret popped his thumb back in his mouth and got to his feet. He looked small and pathetic. For the first time, Liam noticed the clothes his son was wearing. Plaid flannel shirt, fake leather vest with a tin sheriff\u2019s star pinned on the chest, crisp Wrangler jeans, and cowboy boots. A costume. The haunted house.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>It was almost nine-fifteen. For the last few hours, all over town, kids dressed as astronauts and aliens and princesses had been piling in and out of minivans. Their parents, already tired and headachy before it began, would crank the music up\u2014mostly comfort rock and roll from their youth\u2014and drive to the single housing development in Last Bend. In a town where your nearest neighbor was often half a mile away, trick-or-treating had to be carefully planned.</p><p>Liam glanced down at his son. He had a sudden flash of memory\u2014Mike staying up late at night to finish the chaps that went with the costume. \u201cYou want to drive over to Angel Glen and go trick-or-treating?\u201d</p><p>Bret\u2019s cheeks bunched up as he sucked his thumb, then slowly he shook his head.</p><p>Liam understood. It was Mommy who always organized Halloween. \u201cOkay, kiddo. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Together they walked outside, into the cold, crisp October night. The air smelled of dying leaves and rich, black earth.</p><p>They climbed into the car and drove home. The garage door, when it opened, cut a whining, scraping hole in their silent cocoon.</p><p>Liam took his son\u2019s hand and led him into the house. They talked in fits and starts\u2014about what, Liam couldn\u2019t have said. He turned on the interior lights, all of them, until the house was awash in false brightness.</p><p>If only it weren\u2019t so damned quiet.</p><p>Make Bret dinner.</p><p>There, focus on that.</p><p>The phone rang. Mumbling something to Bret, Liam stumbled into the kitchen and answered it.</p><p>\u201cHi, Liam. It\u2019s Carol. I just heard ... really sorry ...\u201d</p><p>And so it began.</p><p>Liam sagged against the log wall, hearing but not listening. He watched as Bret went into the living room and lay on the sofa. There was the hm-click of the television as it came on. The Rugrats. Screamingly loud. Bret stared dry-eyed at his least favorite cartoon, one that only last week he\u2019d said was \u201cfor babies.\u201d He curled into a ball and sucked his thumb.</p><p>Liam hung up. He realized a second too late that Carol had still been talking, and he made a mental note to apologize.</p><p>Then he stood in the empty kitchen, wondering what in the hell to fix Bret for dinner. He opened the refrigerator and stared at a confusing jumble of jars and cartons. He found a plastic container of leftover spaghetti sauce but had no idea how old it was. In the freezer, he found dozens of similar containers, each marked with a date and contents, but no instructions for cooking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone rang again. This time it was Marion from the local 4-H chapter. He tossed out a jumbled explanation, thanked her for her prayers, and hung up.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make it five feet before the phone rang again. This time he ignored it and went into the living room, where he knelt beside his son. \u201cWhat do you say we order pizza?\u201d</p><p>Bret popped the thumb out of his mouth. \u201cJerry doesn\u2019t deliver on Halloween. Not after the Monroes tee-peed his truck last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s stir-fry night, anyway. Mommy and me put the chicken in its sauce last night. It\u2019s marinatin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStir-fry.\u201d Chicken and veggies. How hard could it be? \u201cYou want to help me cook it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can slice open a man\u2019s abdomen, remove his appendix, and sew him back up. I\u2019m sure I can cook one little boy\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p><p>Bret frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to know all that for stir-fry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you climb up onto one of the kitchen stools? We\u2019ll do it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out. It\u2019ll be fun. Come on.\u201d He helped Bret off the sofa and followed him into the kitchen. When Bret was settled on the stool, Liam went to the fridge and got out the plastic bags full of veggies and the marinated chicken. After some searching, he found the cutting board and a big knife.</p><p>He started with the mushrooms.</p><p>\u201cMommy doesn\u2019t put \u2019shrooms in it. I don\u2019t like \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Liam put the mushrooms back in the bag and reached for the cauliflower.</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d Bret was starting to look scared. \u201cI tole you you don\u2019t know how to do it ...\u201d</p><p>Liam grabbed the broccoli. \u201cThis okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Lots of trees.\u201d</p><p>He started to chop it up.</p><p>\u201cLittler!\u201d Bret shouted.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t look up. He sliced the broccoli in small pieces, but the contours made it difficult.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta put oil in the wok.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang. Liam reluctantly picked it up. It was Mike\u2019s friend Shaela, from the Saddle Club, wondering if there was anything she could do.</p> <p>Liam found the electric wok. \u201cThanks, Shaela,\u201d he said in the middle of her sentence\u2014God, I can\u2019t believe it\u2014or something close, and hung up. Then he plugged in the wok and poured a cup of oil into it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of oil,\u201d Bret said with a frown as the phone started ringing again.</p><p>\u201cI like it crispy.\u201d Liam answered the phone\u2014Mabel from the horse rescue program\u2014and repeated what he\u2019d told everyone else. By the time Mabel said \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d for the fourth time, Liam almost screamed. He appreciated the calls\u2014truly\u2014but they made it all too real. And now the damn oil was popping and smoking.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2014\u201d</p><p>He hung up on Mabel in the middle of a word. \u201cSorry, Bretster. Sorry.\u201d He tossed the chicken and marinade into the oil. It splattered everywhere. Tiny drops of scalding oil hit his cheeks and stung.</p><p>Swearing, he went back to the broccoli.</p><p>The phone rang again, and he cut his finger. Blood squirted across the vegetables and dotted the countertop.</p><p>Bret screamed, \u201cDaddy, you\u2019re bleeding!\u201d</p><p>Riiiiing ... riiiiing ...</p><p>The smoke detector went off, buzzzzzz. Liam reached for the phone and knocked the wok with his hip. Greasy chicken and burning oil and smoke flew everywhere.</p><p>It was Myrna from Lou\u2019s Bowl-O-Rama, wondering if there was anything she could do.</p><p>When Liam hung up, he was breathing so hard he felt dizzy. He saw Bret, backed against the cold fridge, his whole body shaking, his thumb in his mouth.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t know if he wanted to scream or cry or run. Instead, he knelt in front of Bret. The smoke alarm was still bleating, blood was still dripping from Liam\u2019s forefinger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bretster. But it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how Mommy cooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll starve.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands behind Bret\u2019s head and stared into his son\u2019s eyes, as if by pure will he could make Bret feel safe. \u201cWe won\u2019t starve. Now, how about we go to town for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Bret looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go change my clothes, okay?\u201d</p><p>Liam hugged him again. It was the only thing he could think of to do.</p><p>Bret was crying, softly now, silently, and Liam felt as if his own heart would break at the pathetic silence of those tears.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Jacey came home earlier than Liam expected, looking wan and tired. She hardly said a word; instead, she kissed his cheek and headed up to her room.</p><p>When he was pretty sure that both kids were asleep, Liam went into Mikaela\u2019s office. He opened the door and flicked on the light.</p><p>The first thing he noticed was her fragrance, soft and sweet as newfallen rain. Her desk was scattered with piles of haphazardly stacked papers. If he closed his eyes, he could imagine her sitting at that desk, a cup of steaming French Roast coffee in her hand, her gaze glued to the computer screen as she wrote letter after letter on behalf of animals that were being neglected.</p><p>On an ordinary day, she would have looked up at him, her mouth turned downward, her beautiful eyes filled with compassion. There\u2019s a mare in Skykomish so starved she can\u2019t stand up ... Can we take in one more?</p><p>He went to her desk and pushed a pile of newspapers off the chair. They hit the wooden floor with a thwack. He turned on the computer and maneuvered himself onto the Internet, where he ran a search for \u201cHead injury.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, he read about other people\u2019s pain. He filled up almost an entire yellow legal pad with scribbled bits of information\u2014books, specialists, medications. Anything and everything that might make a difference. But in the end, he knew only what he\u2019d known at the beginning. There was nothing to do but wait ...</p><p>He clicked the machine off without even bothering to close out of the program and left the room.</p><p>Downstairs, he poured himself a double shot of tequila\u2014something he hadn\u2019t done since the Tex-Mex hoedown at the Legion Hall two summers ago. He drank it in one swallow. Disappointed that the world still seemed remarkably stable, he poured and drank another. This, at last, lent his mind a soft dullness, and finally the knot in his throat eased.</p><p>He went to the big picture window that framed the darkened pastures below. The horses couldn\u2019t be seen now on this black night, but they were out there. A dozen horses that Mikaela had saved; they\u2019d come from all over the western half of the state, from groups and individuals and bankrupt farms. They arrived, broken and starved and untended, but Mike healed them, one by one, then gave them away to good homes. She had such a tender heart. It was one of the things he loved most about her.</p><p>But when was the last time he\u2019d told her that? He couldn\u2019t remember, that was the hell of it.</p><p>He\u2019d never been good with words. He showed his love, over and over again, but he knew that words mattered, too.</p><p>He wished to hell he could remember the last time he\u2019d told her that she was his sun and his moon, his whole world.</p><p>He poured another shot and slumped on the overstuffed down sofa.</p><p>She could die ...</p><p>No. He wouldn\u2019t let his mind wander down that road. Mike would wake up soon, any minute now, and they would laugh together about how afraid he\u2019d been.</p><p>But the road beckoned him anyway; he could smell despair burned into the asphalt, hear the fear rustling treelike along the shoulders.</p><p>He closed his eyes, remembering everything about her, and when he opened his eyes, she was there, beside him on the couch. She was wearing the ratty, torn old Levi\u2019s that he was always threatening to throw away, and a black chenille boat-neck sweater that could have fit a woman twice her size. She leaned back and looked at him.</p><p>He wished he could reach for her, touch the softness of her favorite sweater, kiss the fullness of her lower lip, but he knew she wasn\u2019t really there. She was inside him, filling him so full that she\u2019d spilled out. \u201cYou would have laughed if you\u2019d seen me in the kitchen tonight, babe.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold the grief inside him anymore; he couldn\u2019t be strong. At last, he leaned back on the sofa, and he cried.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d The small, hesitant voice floated down the stairs. \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d</p><p>Mike vanished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking to anyone.\u201d He wiped his eyes and rose unsteadily to his feet. He crossed the room and climbed the stairs.</p><p>Bret stood at the top in his makeshift pj\u2019s\u2014a purple glow-in-the-dark triceratops T-shirt and flannel boxers. Somewhere in his jumbled chest of drawers were several sets of real pajamas, but only Mike could find anything in that mess.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Liam scooped Bret into his arms and carried him up to the master bedroom, tucking him into the bed that was too big without Mike in it. He curled against his son.</p><p>\u201cShe was lookin\u2019 at me, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Liam tightened his hold on Bret. It was funny, but only last week, Liam had thought that Bret was growing up too fast. Now the boy in his arms seemed impossibly young, and since this morning, he had been regressing. It was something that would have to be dealt with ... later.</p><p>\u201cWhen you saw Mommy, her eyes were open. Is that what you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was lookin\u2019 right at me, but ... she wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was just too hurt to close her eyes and now she\u2019s too hurt to open them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see her tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Liam thought about how she looked\u2014her face battered and swollen and discolored, a nasogastric tube snaking up one nostril, all those needles tucked into her veins, the machines ... It would terrify a child. Liam knew what those memories were like\u2014he had them of his father. Some things, once seen, could never be forgotten, and they could taint an image forever.</p><p>\u201cNo, kiddo, I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s against hospital policy to let a child into Intensive Care. You can see her ... as soon as she gets moved to the regular ward.\u201d</p><p>Bret said quietly, \u201cThat\u2019s how dead looks in the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead. She\u2019s just ... resting for a little while. Like Sleeping Beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you try kissin\u2019 her?\u201d</p><p>It took Liam a long time to answer. He knew he would remember this moment forever, and that\u2019s how long it would hurt. \u201cYeah, Bretster. I tried that.\u201d</p><p>Liam stayed in bed until Bret fell asleep, then he cautiously extricated himself and went downstairs. This time he made himself a cup of tea. God knew the tequila hadn\u2019t worked.</p><p>Did you try kissing her?</p><p>Liam glanced up at the slanted wooden ceiling. \u201cDid you hear that, babe? He wanted to know if I\u2019d tried kissing you.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang.</p><p>He ignored it. On the fourth ring, the answering machine clicked on. He wasn\u2019t ready to hear Mike\u2019s soft, throaty voice. He squeezed his eyes shut. You have reached the Campbell residence, and the winter office of Whatcom County\u2019s horse rescue program. No one is available right now ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the message clicked off, another voice came on. \u201cHola, Dr. Liam. This is Rosa. I am returning\u2014\u201d</p><p>Liam picked up the phone. \u201cHello, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Liam. This is you? I am sorry not to call earlier, but I was working the dinner shift this ni\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike\u2019s had an accident,\u201d he said quickly, while he still had the nerve to form the words. Then, taking a deep breath, he told his mother-in-law everything.</p> <p>A pause slid through the lines. \u201cI will be there tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, not realizing until that moment how very much he needed her help in this. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange for a plane ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It will be quicker if I drive. I will leave first thing in the morning. Will she ...\u201d</p><p>Make it through the night.</p><p>\u201cWe hope so,\u201d he answered the unfinished question. \u201cThe morning should be ... fine. Thanks, Rosa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDr. Liam?\u201d Another pause, then a soft \u201cPray for her. More than medicines and machines, she will need God now. You pray for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery minute, Rosa. Every minute.\u201d</p><p>When he hung up the phone, he went to his bedroom. It took all his strength to merely cross the threshold. When he\u2019d come in here earlier, he\u2019d had Bret with him, and the child in his arms had acted as a talisman. Now, Liam felt acutely vulnerable and alone. This was where Mikaela belonged; in this room, theirs, the one she\u2019d once painted fire-engine red just for fun; the one that now had gold moons and stars and suns stenciled on its smooth eggshell-white walls and a chiffon-draped canopy bed that she said made her feel like Candice Bergen in The Wind and the Lion. Unfortunately, it made him feel like Candice Bergen, too, but so what? She loved their room, and so he\u2019d crawled into their bed every night and thanked God that she wanted him there. Him, an ordinary man whose only claim to the extraordinary was the depth of his love for a woman.</p><p>Rosa Elena Luna walked toward the small altar in her living room and carefully lit two votive candles. Thin spots of light glowed reassuringly within the pebbled red glass.</p><p>She sank to her knees on the cracked linoleum floor and clasped her hands, staring at the figurine of the Virgin Mary as she began to pray. First, the Lord\u2019s Prayer.</p><p>But the familiar words didn\u2019t ease this ache spreading through her chest. Tears blurred her eyes but didn\u2019t fall. She\u2019d learned long ago that tears were just bits of water that had no power to heal.</p> <p>She grabbed the rickety table leg and pulled herself to a stand. After a long night at the diner, her knees made a sound like popping corn.</p><p>For the first time in many years, she wanted to call William Brownlow. She glanced longingly at the phone on the wall.</p><p>He would be no help, of course. She hadn\u2019t seen him in several years. Sunville was a small town, but even in so small a place, they traveled in different circles. He owned a modest apple orchard\u2014not a powerful, wealthy man by anyone\u2019s standards, but compared to Rosa, he might as well have been a Kennedy. Though he had fathered Mikaela, he had never been a father to her. He had another family, a lily-white one. He had spent fifteen years in Rosa\u2019s bed, but every moment had been stolen from his wife and legitimate children.</p><p>He would not come to the rescue of his bastard daughter.</p><p>Rosa stood in the darkened living room. Here and there, watery moonlight peeked through the worn, tattered curtains, illuminating the garage-sale sofa, the wood-grained plastic end tables, the religious paintings on the walls. Mikaela and Liam had often tried to get Rosa to move from this house, or to accept money to repair it, but she always refused them. She was afraid that if she left, she would forget the mistakes God wanted her to remember.</p><p>It had all started here, in this house she never should have accepted. It had seemed safe enough at the time, a present from a man who loved her. In those days, she had still believed he would leave his wife.</p><p>Candlelight illuminated the streaks of condensation that slid down the too-thin glass windows.</p><p>When Mikaela was young, she used to love that condensation. She would shout to Rosa, Look, Mama, it\u2019s raining inside the house.</p> <p>Rosa wondered now if Mikaela had ever understood why her mother never came to stand beside her at the window. Rosa had seen tears instead of raindrops, had always known that this old house wept at the sadness it had seen.</p><p>Bad love.</p><p>It was the heart of this house; it had purchased every nail and paid most of the bills. It was mixed into the paint. Bad love had planted the hedge and made it grow tall; it had crafted the gravel walkway that led to a front door designed to conceal that love from all who would recognize it; it was woven into the fabric of the curtains that hid the windowpanes.</p><p>She had always known that she would pay for these sins. No amount of confession could cleanse her soul, but this ... she\u2019d never imagined this.</p><p>\u201cPlease God,\u201d she said, \u201csave mi hija ...\u201d</p><p>Again, silence. She knew that if she stepped outside, she would hear the rustling of the bare willow tree, and that it would sound like an old woman weeping.</p><p>With a tired sigh, she walked into her small bedroom, pulled her only suitcase out of the closet, and began to pack.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The bedside phone rang at six o\u2019clock the next morning. Liam had been dreaming\u2014a good dream in which he and Mikaela were sitting on the porch swing, listening to the children\u2019s distant laughter. For a second, he could feel the warmth of her hand in his ... then he noticed the boy sleeping quietly beside him and it all came rushing back.</p><p>His heart was clattering like a secondhand lawn mower as he reached for the phone.</p><p>It was Sarah, a nurse from the hospital. Mikaela had made it through the night.</p><p>Liam leaned carefully over Bret and hung up the phone. He crawled out of bed, showered\u2014not realizing until he\u2019d gotten out that he forgot to use soap or shampoo\u2014then went to wake his children.</p><p>Within an hour, the three of them drove to the hospital. Liam settled the kids in the waiting room, then went to the ICU.</p><p>He went to Mikaela\u2019s bedside, hoping\u2014absurdly\u2014to find her sitting up, smiling ...</p><p>But the room was deathly still; she hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>She looked worse. The right side of her face was swollen almost beyond recognition. Both eyes were hidden beneath puffy discolored flesh.</p><p>Clear plastic tubing invaded her left nostril, and her mouth was completely slack. A tiny silver trail of spittle snaked down her discolored cheek, collected in a moist gray blotch on the pillow. The flimsy blanket was drawn up high on her chest; it had been folded with methodical precision and tucked in tight to her body in a way that made Liam think of death.</p><p>The team of specialists arrived. They examined her, tested her, and talked among themselves. Liam waited silently beside them, watching as his beloved wife failed one test after another.</p><p>Truth is, Liam, we don\u2019t know why she\u2019s not waking up.</p><p>Some of the best doctors in the country, and that was all they could say. They didn\u2019t know why she wasn\u2019t waking up.</p><p>Just wait and hope. Pray she lives another day, then another day after that. Pray she wakes up on her own ...</p><p>Although Liam hadn\u2019t really expected a medical miracle, he\u2019d certainly hoped for one. Even a radical surgery would be better than this ... nothing.</p><p>The next time Liam glanced at his watch, it was eleven A.M. Through a sliver opening in the curtains, he saw a rosy line of morning sunlight.</p><p>It was time to tell his children ... something.</p><p>He walked slowly toward the waiting room.</p><p>What a joke. As if expectation would sit only in that particular space. From now on, he knew, every room would be a waiting room. They would bring it with them, him and the children. At home they would see the empty spaces as clearly as their own hands. A vacant chair at the dinner table, an empty place on the sofa.</p><p>He allowed himself a moment\u2019s pause before he turned into the alcove beyond the nurses\u2019 station.</p><p>The room was good sized\u2014big enough for large families to gather in grief or celebration. It was antiseptic white, with brown Naugahyde chairs and fake wood-grain tables that held scattered magazines and a few carefully placed Bibles. Like all such rooms, it seemed to amplify the ticking of the clock on the wall.</p><p>Jacey stood at the window, with her back to him. She appeared to be intently studying the parking lot, but he doubted that she saw anything except the image of her mother, broken and bleeding on the arena\u2019s dirt floor.</p><p>Bret was on the gold sofa, his small body curled into the fetal position, his eyes squeezed shut. God knew what he was seeing. Again today he was sucking his thumb.</p><p>Liam found just enough strength to remain where he was. Maybe that\u2019s how it would be from now on; he would make it through on \u201cjust enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, guys,\u201d he said at last, his voice so soft he wasn\u2019t sure for a second that he\u2019d spoken aloud at all.</p><p>Jacey spun to face him. Her long black hair\u2014normally manicured to teenaged perfection\u2014hung limply along her arms. She was wearing a pair of baggy flannel drawstring pants and an oversized knit sweater. Silver tear marks streaked her pale cheeks. Her eyes were red and swollen, and in them he saw the agonizing question.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still alive,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jacey brought a shaking hand to her mouth. He could see how hard she was trying not to cry in front of her younger brother. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Liam went to the sofa and scooped Bret onto his lap. The little boy was so still he seemed to have stopped breathing. \u201cSit down, Jace,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sat down on the chair beside them, reaching out for Liam\u2019s hand.</p><p>Bret snuggled closer and opened his eyes. Tears rolled down the boy\u2019s pink cheeks. \u201cCan we see her today?\u201d</p><p>Liam drew in a deep breath. \u201cNot yet. Yesterday I told you that her head was hurt, but there\u2019s ... a little more to it than that. She\u2019s in a very deep sleep. It\u2019s called a coma, and it\u2019s the body\u2019s way of healing itself. You know how when you have a really bad case of the flu, you sleep all the time to get better? It\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s colorless lips trembled. \u201cWill she wake up?\u201d</p><p>Liam flinched. Any answer\u2014every answer\u2014felt like a lie. \u201cWe hope so.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Jacey and saw the sad, desperate knowing in her eyes. She was a doctor\u2019s kid; she knew that not everyone woke up from a coma.</p><p>God help him, Liam couldn\u2019t say anything to save her from the truth. Hope was something he could offer, but it wasn\u2019t a prescription he could fill. \u201cShe needs us to believe in her,\u201d he said, \u201cto keep our hope fresh and strong. When she\u2019s ready, she\u2019ll wake up.\u201d</p><p>Bret wiped his eyes. \u201cFix her, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe docs are doing everything they can right now, Bretster, but she\u2019s asleep ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Sleeping Beauty,\u201d Jacey said to her little brother.</p><p>Bret burst into tears. \u201cSleeping Beauty was asleep for a hundred years!\u201d</p><p>Liam pulled Bret into his arms and held on to his son tightly. Jacey scooted closer and hugged them both.</p><p>When Liam felt Bret\u2019s tiny shudder, and the warm, wet rush of his daughter\u2019s tears, he buried his face in his son\u2019s coarse, red hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he prayed.</p><p>There were too many cars in the hospital parking lot. Absurdly, that was Rosa\u2019s first thought as she drove into the Ian Campbell Medical Center that afternoon. It took her several minutes to find a vacant parking space. Finally, she pulled in between a battered Ford pickup truck and an old Impala, and turned off the engine.</p><p>She took a deep breath and released her grip on the steering wheel, one finger at a time. When she finished, she found that she was sweating, though the heater hadn\u2019t worked in years and it couldn\u2019t be more than forty degrees outside.</p><p>She gazed at the small figurine of the Virgin Mary anchored to the beige plastic dashboard. Then she got out of the car and walked toward the hospital.</p> <p>The electronic doors whooshed open; the bitter, astringent smell of stale, medicated air assaulted her.</p><p>Rosa\u2019s step faltered. She tucked her black vinyl purse against her narrow body and focused on the floor at her feet. It was an old habit, one she\u2019d never been able to break. When she was nervous, she counted every step between where she was and where she wanted to be.</p><p>At the front desk, she stopped, barely looking up when the receptionist greeted her.</p><p>\u201cI am here to see Dr. Liam Campbell,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll page him,\u201d the girl answered. \u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d</p> <p>Rosa nodded and turned away. She kept her head down and counted the steps back to the collection of gray plastic chairs. Fourteen, to be exact.</p><p>She heard her son-in-law\u2019s name echo through the halls. A few minutes later, she watched him walk toward her.</p><p>He looked as she would have expected, tired and beaten. He was a tall man, her son-in-law, although you didn\u2019t notice that most of the time. There had been several occasions over the years when Rosa had turned to speak to Liam, or hand him something, and had been startled by his height. Ordinarily, he just didn\u2019t seem to take up that much space. But he had the heart of a lion. Rosa had never known anyone who loved as completely as her son-in-law.</p><p>\u201cHola, Dr. Liam,\u201d she said, pushing to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHello, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>For an awkward moment, she waited for him to say something. She stared up at him. In his green eyes, she saw a harrowing sadness that told her everything she needed to know.</p> <p>\u201cIs she still alive?\u201d Her voice was barely a whisper.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAh ... thank God. You will take me to see her now?\u201d she said, her fingers toying nervously with the brass closure on her purse.</p><p>Liam looked away. His sandy blond hair was clumpy and tousled, as if he\u2019d forgotten to wash it. \u201cI wish ...\u201d</p><p>His voice, always quiet and carefully modulated, was now as thin as a strand of silk thread. The whispery tenor of it sent a chill down her back.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could spare you this, Rosa,\u201d he finished, and when he was done, he tried to smile. It was a desperate failure that frightened Rosa more than his words.</p><p>\u201cLet us go,\u201d was all she could say.</p><p>They walked down one hallway after another. All the way, Rosa kept her head down, counting every step. Liam\u2019s body beside her was like a guardrail, keeping her on course.</p> <p>Finally Liam stopped at a closed door.</p><p>Then he did the most remarkable thing\u2014he touched her shoulder. It was a brief, comforting touch, and it surprised her. They were not that free with each other. She couldn\u2019t remember him ever touching her.</p><p>That he wanted to comfort her now, in the midst of his own pain, moved her deeply.</p><p>She wanted to smile up at him, or better yet, touch him in return, but her fingers were trembling and her throat was dry.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look good, Rosa. Do you want to go in alone?\u201d</p><p>She meant to say yes, thought she\u2019d said yes, but she heard herself say no. Liam nodded in understanding and followed her into the room.</p><p>When she saw her daughter, Rosa stopped and drew in a sharp breath. \u201cDios mio.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela lay in a narrow bed\u2014a child\u2019s bed, with silver railings. All around her, machines hissed and beeped. The room was dim; thank God. Rosa didn\u2019t know if she could stand to see this under harsh fluorescent lighting.</p><p>Nine steps. That\u2019s how many it took to get to her daughter\u2019s bedside.</p><p>Mikaela\u2019s beautiful face was scratched and bruised and swollen, her eyes hidden beneath puffy black folds of flesh.</p><p>Rosa leaned over the railing and touched her daughter\u2019s cheek. The skin felt bloated, hard to the touch, like a balloon overfilled with air. She was silent for many minutes. \u201cMy little girl,\u201d she said at last, \u201cI have seen you looking better, s\u00ed? That must have been quite a fall you took.\u201d She drew back. Her hand was shaking so badly, she was afraid Mikaela would hear the rattling of her fingers against the bed rail.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much she can hear ... or if she can hear at all,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know ... if she\u2019ll wake up.\u201d</p><p>Rosa looked up at him. At first she was stung by his words, but then she realized it was the doctor in him speaking. He couldn\u2019t change himself any more than she could. He was a man of science; he believed in evidence. Rosa was a woman of faith, and a long, hard life had taught her that truth almost never revealed itself to the human eye. \u201cDo you remember when you all went to Hawaii last summer?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you got home, Jacey called me. She had been surfing, s\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she got into trouble. The board, it hit her on the head, and when she was underwater, she was scared. She did not know up from down.\u201d She noticed the way Liam\u2019s fingers tightened around the bed rail, and she understood. \u201cDo not be afraid, Dr. Liam. Mikaela is like Jacey. She is lost in a place she cannot understand. She will need us to guide her home. All we have is our voices, our memories. We must use these as ... flashlights to show her the way.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze softened. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. It is hard to be alone for something like this.\u201d</p><p>He flinched at the word alone, and she knew what he was thinking, that without his wife, there would be a lifetime of alone. He had his children, s\u00ed, whom he loved, but still there was a kind of loneliness that only a lover could ease. This, Rosa knew too well.</p><p>And one thing Rosa knew about Liam\u2014she\u2019d known it from the first time she saw him, almost twelve years ago\u2014he loved his Mikaela. Loved her in the bone-deep way that most women long for and only a handful ever find.</p><p>Rosa couldn\u2019t help wondering if Mikaela knew this, if she understood her good fortune. Or if, in some dark, forbidden corner of her heart, there grew the untamed remains of an old, bad love.</p><p>Rosa knew how deep the roots of that love had gone into her daughter\u2019s heart, and she knew, too, that sometimes a first love went to seed, growing in wild disarray until there was no room for anything\u2014or anyone\u2014else.</p><p>Rosa spent almost an hour with her daughter, then she left Liam at Mikaela\u2019s bedside and went in search of her grandchildren.</p><p>Jacey and Bret were in the waiting room, sitting together on the sofa, their arms wrapped around each other.</p><p>It took her a moment to find her voice. \u201cChildren?\u201d</p><p>With a cry, Jacey pulled out of her brother\u2019s arms and hurled herself at Rosa.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right, ni\u00f1a,\u201d Rosa said over and over again, holding her granddaughter.</p><p>Bret sat quietly on the couch, sucking his thumb.</p><p>Rosa eased away from Jacey and went to the sofa. In front of Bret, she knelt. \u201cHola, my little man.\u201d</p><p>Bret\u2019s red-rimmed eyes looked huge in the tear-streaked pallor of his face. \u201cShe\u2019s dead, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is alive, Bret, and she needs us now.\u201d Slowly Rosa took hold of Bret\u2019s right hand, tugging gently until the thumb popped out of his mouth. Then she pressed her hands against his in prayer. \u201cThese hands of ours, they are for praying.\u201d</p><p>Jacey layered her hands on top of theirs.</p><p>Rosa bowed her head and began to pray: \u201cOur Father, Who art in Heaven ...\u201d She let the words fill her aching heart. It was the prayer she\u2019d offered to God every day since her First Communion more than five decades before.</p><p>At last Bret and Jacey joined their voices to the prayer.</p><p>The house was quiet now, not like it should be at nine-thirty in the evening, but the way it had become.</p><p>Jacey was in Mike\u2019s office, surfing the Internet for a school report. Liam came up behind her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked, squeezing her shoulder gently.</p><p>She looked up. Her eyes were still a little puffy; he knew she was like all of them, prone to sudden, unexpected tears. \u201cOkay, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could move the computer into the living room if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I ... like being in her office. I can feel her in here. Sometimes I forget and think she\u2019ll poke her head in here and say, \u2018That\u2019s enough, kiddo, I need to use the computer.\u2019\u201d Jacey tried to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s better than the quiet.\u201d</p><p>Liam knew what she meant. \u201cWell, don\u2019t stay up too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He left her there, in that room that held Mike\u2019s presence like a favorite scent, and headed to Bret\u2019s room.</p><p>He knocked on his son\u2019s door. There was a scuffling noise from inside, then a quiet \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door. The room was dark except for a small Batman night-light that tossed a triangle of golden light toward the bed, and a skylight cut into the sharply angled ceiling that revealed the starry night sky, making the room seem almost like an astronaut\u2019s capsule.</p><p>\u201cHeya, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>It was a baby\u2019s voice that came out of the darkness, not at all the voice of a nine-year-old boy who\u2019d hit his first home run last spring, and the sound of it brought Liam to a halt.</p><p>When he realized he wasn\u2019t moving, he forced a watered-down laugh. \u201cSorry. I think I just stepped on Han Solo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis legs were missing awready. Joe Lipsky bit \u2019em off last summer.\u201d</p><p>Liam folded himself awkwardly onto the narrow bed. He brushed a lock of red hair from Bret\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou know you can sleep with me anytime you want.\u201d</p><p>Bret nodded but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou used to come into our bed whenever you had a nightmare. You can still do that ... even if you haven\u2019t had a nightmare and you just feel like being with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t getting them anywhere. It had always been Mike who could get the kids to talk about anything; Liam wasn\u2019t quite sure how to go about it.</p><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>Of course. The king-sized bed seemed as big and empty to Bret as it did to Liam. \u201cI\u2019m still here, Bret, and you know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret. Will you promise not to tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>Bret\u2019s blue eyes looked impossibly big in his small face. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I get really scared ... especially at night when I\u2019m alone. It would help me an awful lot to be cuddled up with you. So, you come on in, anytime you want to. Okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bret laid his head on Liam\u2019s shoulder and burrowed close.</p><p>They lay there a long time, so long the stars twinkled and faded one by one. Liam started to pull away, thinking that Bret had fallen asleep, but the moment he moved, his son said, \u201cDon\u2019t go, Daddy ...\u201d</p><p>Liam stilled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d He twisted to the right and pulled a slim paperback book out of his back jeans pocket. \u201cI thought I could start reading to you every night, the way Mo\u2014Mommy and I used to. I know you\u2019re big enough to read your own books, but I thought you might like it. Might help you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI brought one of your mom\u2019s favorite books. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it scary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Liam positioned himself against the bed\u2019s headboard and pulled Bret up beside him. Opening the book, he flipped to the first page and began to read aloud. \u201cOnce there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy ...\u201d</p><p>The words gently bound father and son, and transported them to a world where children could step into an armoire and discover a magical land.</p><p>Finally Liam came to the end of a chapter and closed the book. The bedside clock read ten-thirty, well past time for Bret to go to sleep. \u201cThat seems like a good enough place to stop for tonight. We\u2019ll pick up where we left off tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Bret looked at him. \u201cDo you believe in magic, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cEvery time I look at you or Jacey or Mommy, I know there\u2019s magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about when I was born again.\u201d</p><p>It was a well-worn legend, a quilt of often-told stories that could warm them on the coldest night. \u201cShe cried,\u201d Liam said. \u201cShe cried and said you were the most perfect, most beautiful baby she\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Bret smiled. \u201cAnd you said I looked like I wasn\u2019t done cookin\u2019 yet.\u201d</p><p>Liam touched his son\u2019s soft, soft cheek. \u201cYou were so little ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I had big lungs, and when I got hungry, I cried so loud the windows rattled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the nurses had to cover their ears.\u201d</p><p>Bret\u2019s genuine smile warmed Liam\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, the kids that went through that ... armwar. Do they come back?\u201d</p><p>Liam wasn\u2019t surprised that Bret wanted a guaranteed happy ending. \u201cYes, they do. Sometimes they get lost, but sooner or later, they always come back to the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you read me more tomorrow night? Promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d He leaned down and kissed Bret\u2019s forehead. As he did it, he remembered the \u201cMommy Kiss.\u201d Mike had invented it when Bret was three years old. A magical kiss that prevented nightmares. \u201cShould we start a daddy kiss? I have a bit of magic myself, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>Liam understood. Bret wanted to save that kiss for his mom. Trading it would make it feel as if she wasn\u2019t ever coming home.</p><p>Bret looked up. Tears flooded his blue eyes. \u201cI think about her all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey,\u201d he said, pulling Bret close. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, perhaps no more than a heartbeat, life settled into a comfortable place. Liam smelled the sweet scent of his little boy\u2019s hair, felt the soft twining of arms around his neck, and it was enough. A dozen treasured images came back to him, memories he\u2019d collected over the years of their lives together. And in remembering what had been, he found the strength to pray for what could be.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Rosa moved into the small cottage beside the main house, set her few personal items in the pink-tiled bathroom, and stocked the refrigerator with iced tea and a loaf of wheat bread. There was no point in doing more; she planned on spending all of her time with the children or Mikaela.</p><p>The next morning, after Liam left for the hospital, Rosa made the children a hot breakfast and tried to take them to school.</p><p>Not yet, Grandma, please ...</p><p>She had not the heart to deny them. She granted their wish for one more day at the hospital\u2014but after that, she said, they must go to school. The waiting room was no place for children, not hour upon hour, day upon day.</p><p>They drove the few miles to the medical center, and then Rosa settled the kids in the waiting room.</p><p>She hurried through the busy corridor, head down, purse tucked against her body, counting the three hundred and eleven steps to Mikaela\u2019s room in the ICU.</p><p>The small, curtained room still frightened her\u2014there were so many unfamiliar noises and machines. At the bedside, she gazed down at her beautiful, broken child. \u201cI guess it does not matter how old we get, or that you have children of your own, you will always be my little girl, s\u00ed, mi hija?\u201d She gently stroked Mikaela\u2019s unbruised cheek. The skin was swollen and taut, but Rosa thought she could feel a little more softness in the flesh than had been there yesterday.</p><p>She picked up the brush from the bedside table and began brushing Mikaela\u2019s short hair. \u201cI will wash your hair today, hija.\u201d</p><p>She forced her lips into a smile and kept talking. \u201cI am still not used to this short hair of yours, even though it has been many years like this. When I close my eyes, I still see my ni\u00f1a with hair streaming like spilled ink down her back.\u201d</p><p>Rosa\u2019s thoughts turned to the bleak days when her daughter had been so unhappy that she\u2019d chopped off her own hair with a pair of drugstore scissors. Mikaela had been waiting for him. Waiting and waiting for a man who never showed up, and when she realized that he had no intention of returning, she\u2019d cut off her lovely hair. The thing he liked best about her.</p><p>You cannot make yourself ugly\u2014that\u2019s what Rosa had said when she\u2019d seen what Mikaela had done, but what she\u2019d meant was, He isn\u2019t worth this broken heart of yours. She hadn\u2019t said that; she was the last person in the world to devalue a woman\u2019s love for the wrong man.</p><p>She had thought that Mikaela would get over him, and that when she got over him, she would one day grow her hair long again.</p><p>Yet still, Mikaela\u2019s hair was as short as a boy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rosa said aloud, \u201cI will not think about him. He was not worth our thoughts then and he is not worth my words now. I will think instead about my little girl. You were so bright and beautiful and funny. Always you make me laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou had such big dreams. Remember? You used to pin all those fotograf\u00edas up on your bedroom wall, pictures of faraway places. You dreamed of going to London and France and China. I used to say to you, \u2018Where do you get such big dreams, Mikita?\u2019 And do you remember your answer?\u201d</p><p>She stroked her daughter\u2019s hair gently. \u201cYou told me, \u2018I have to have big dreams, Mama ... I have them for both of us.\u2019</p><p>\u201cIt broke my heart when you said that.\u201d Rosa\u2019s hand stilled. She couldn\u2019t help remembering how her daughter\u2019s swollen dreams had shriveled beneath the hot California sun.</p><p>It had happened years ago, so many that the scent should not remain in the air, and yet here it was.</p><p>\u201cI am the one with big dreams now, querida. I dream that you will sit up in this bed and open your eyes ... that you will come back to us.\u201d Her voice cracked, fell to a throaty whisper. \u201cI have a dream now. Just like you always wanted. I am the carrier of my dreams now ... and yours, too, Mikita. I am dreaming for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Later that afternoon, Stephen called Liam and Rosa into his office.</p><p>\u201cThe good news is, she has stabilized. She\u2019s off the ventilator and breathing on her own. We didn\u2019t need to do a tracheotomy. She\u2019s being fed intravenously. We\u2019ve moved her out of the ICU\u2014to a private room on Two West.\u201d</p><p>Liam barely heard the words. He knew that whenever a doctor started a sentence with \u201cThe good news is,\u201d there was a hell of a right hook coming.</p><p>Rosa stood near the door. \u201cShe is breathing. This is life, s\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded. \u201cYes. The problem is, we don\u2019t know why she isn\u2019t waking up. She\u2019s healthy, stable. Her brain activity is good. By all measures, she should be conscious.\u201d</p><p>Rosa asked, \u201cHow long can a person sleep like this?\u201d</p><p>Stephen hesitated. \u201cSome people wake up in a few days, and some ... stay in a coma for years and never wake up. I wish I could tell you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Steve.\u201d</p><p>Stephen didn\u2019t smile. \u201cShe\u2019s in Two forty-six.\u201d</p><p>Liam rose to his feet and went to Rosa, gently taking her arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go see her.\u201d</p><p>Rosa nodded. Together they left Stephen\u2019s office and headed for Mikaela\u2019s new room.</p><p>Once inside, Liam went to the window and shoved it open, sticking his head out into the cold afternoon air. Turning, he went to his wife\u2019s bedside and gently touched her swollen cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s winter, baby. You went to sleep in the fall, and already it\u2019s winter. How can that be, in only three days?\u201d He swallowed hard. His life flashed before him, an endless collection of busy days and empty, empty nights. A calendar of weeks without her. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter.</p><p>Rosa came up beside him. \u201cYou must not give up hope, Dr. Liam. She will be one of the lucky ones who wake up.\u201d</p><p>Liam had given his mother-in-law the gift of ignorance. He\u2019d told her that a bad outcome was possible, but he\u2019d made it sound improbable. Now he didn\u2019t have the strength for subterfuge. Brain damage, paralysis, even a lifetime of coma; these were the possibilities. He knew that tomorrow morning he would be stronger, better able to hang on to his wobbling faith. That\u2019s what the last few days had been\u2014long stretches of hope punctuated by moments of severe, numbing fear.</p><p>He stood perfectly still, trying not to imagine how it would feel to wait for Mike to wake up, day after day, week after week. He drew in a deep, calming breath and exhaled slowly. \u201cI won\u2019t ever give up, Rosa. But I need ... something to pin my faith on, and right now my colleagues aren\u2019t giving me much to work with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith in God will be your floor, Dr. Liam. Do not be afraid to stand on it.\u201d</p><p>He held a hand up. \u201cNot now, Rosa. Please ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you cannot speak to God, then at least talk to Mikaela. She needs to be reminded she has a life out here. Now it is up to love to bring her back.\u201d</p><p>Liam turned to Rosa. \u201cWhat if my love doesn\u2019t bring her back, Rosa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will.\u201d</p><p>Liam envied Rosa\u2019s simple faith. He searched deep inside himself for a matching certainty, but all he found was fear.</p><p>Rosa gazed up at him. \u201cShe needs you now ... more than ever. She needs you to be the light that guides her home. This is all you should be thinking about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Rosa.\u201d Then, stronger, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what you talk about is importante, s\u00ed? Talk to her about the things that matter.\u201d She moved toward him. Her mouth was trembling as she said, \u201cI have slept through my life, Dr. Liam. Do not let my daughter do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Bret made it past lunchtime without screaming, but now he could feel the temper tantrum coming on, building inside him. At first he\u2019d just been crabby, then he\u2019d ripped the head off his action figure and thrown the brand-new People magazine in the garbage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was tired of being in this waiting room, tired of being ignored.</p><p>No one seemed to care that Bret was always by himself in this grody, disgusting room. Jacey\u2019s friends came at lunchtime\u2014they had driver\u2019s licenses\u2014and it didn\u2019t bother her one bit to leave her little brother alone while she went to the cafeteria with \u201cthe gang.\u201d Even Grandma and Daddy seemed to have forgotten all about him.</p><p>The only people who talked to Bret were the nurses, and whenever they looked at him, they had that poor you look in their eyes that made him want to puke.</p><p>Bret went to the sofa again and tried to interest himself in drawing, but he couldn\u2019t do it. There was that sick feeling in his stomach and it was getting bigger and bigger. He was pretty sure that he was going to start screaming.</p> <p>Instead, he picked up the nearest crayon\u2014black\u2014and went to the wall. He didn\u2019t even bother looking around to see if he was alone. He didn\u2019t care. In fact, he wanted someone to see him. In bold, sweeping letters, he wrote I hate this hospital across the bumpy wall. When he finished, he felt better. Then he turned around and saw Sarah, the head nurse, standing in the doorway, holding a bunch of comic books.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bret,\u201d she said softly, giving him that poor you look.</p><p>He waited for her to say something else, maybe to come in and yell at him, but all she did was turn around and walk away. A few minutes later, he heard his dad\u2019s name ringing out through the hospital paging system.</p><p>He dropped the crayon on the floor and went back to the sofa. Picking up the headless action figure, he started playing.</p><p>\u201cBretster?\u201d</p> <p>Dad\u2019s voice.</p><p>Bret\u2019s cheeks burned. Slowly he turned.</p><p>Dad was standing there, holding a bucket and a sponge. He set the bucket down and crossed the room in a few big steps, then he sat down on the coffee table in front of Bret.</p><p>\u201cI know, Daddy.\u201d He tried not to cry, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. Every time he sucked in a breath, he tasted his tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Dad wiped Bret\u2019s tears away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we left you alone, Bretster. There\u2019s so much going on ... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Bret drew in a great, gulping breath. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve written on the walls, Daddy. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Dad almost smiled. \u201cI know you want to see your mom, kiddo. It\u2019s just ... she doesn\u2019t look good. Her face is pretty bruised up. I thought it would give you bad dreams.\u201d</p><p>Bret thought about how she\u2019d looked, with her eye open, staring at him, and he shuddered. He wiped his eyes and whispered, \u201cWhen dead people have their eyes open, can they see you, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead, Bret. I swear to you.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cDo you want to see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rules won\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could break the rules. If you want.\u201d</p><p>Bret sniffed and wiped the snot away from his upper lip. That image of Mommy flashed through his mind again, and when he saw it, his heart did a little ka-thump. \u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna see her.\u201d</p><p>Dad pulled him into a hug, and Bret felt himself slowly, slowly relaxing. The hug felt so good. He felt almost safe. He clung to his dad for a long, long time.</p><p>Then, finally, Daddy said, \u201cWell, pal, I guess you\u2019d better start washing that wall. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to make the custodians do it.\u201d</p> <p>Bret scooted back. On wobbly legs, he got to his feet and went over to the bucket. When he picked it up, soapy water splashed over the rim and hit his pant legs. Holding on to the metal handle with both hands, he carried the bucket to the wall and set it down. He plunged the sponge into the water, squeezed it almost dry, and started cleaning up his mess.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even a minute later that Dad was beside him, crouching down. He grabbed a second sponge, dunked it into the water, and wrung it out.</p><p>Dad smiled at him, right at eye level. \u201cI guess this is sort of a family mess, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>At dinnertime Rosa took the children home. Liam knew he should have gone with them, but he couldn\u2019t leave Mikaela. It was as simple as that.</p><p>He stared down at his wife. She was lying on her side now; the nurses had turned her. \u201cI hired Judy Monk to take care of your horses,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey all seem to be doing great. Even that whacko mare\u2014what\u2019s her name, Sweetpea? She\u2019s eaten through the top rail of the corral, but other than that, she\u2019s okay. And the vet said Scotty\u2019s colic is completely cleared up.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the box he\u2019d brought from home. \u201cI brought you a few things.\u201d He lifted the cardboard box from the chair and brought it to the bedside table. He pulled out a beribboned bag of scented potpourri. \u201cMyrtle down at the drugstore told me this brand was your favorite.\u201d He poured the multicolored clippings into a small glass bowl. The soft scent of vanilla wafted upward. Then he pulled out a collection of family photographs and layered them along the windowsill\u2014just in case she opened her eyes when none of them were here.</p><p>He set a tape player on another table and popped a cassette in. Madonna\u2019s \u201cCrazy for You\u201d\u2014to remind her of the old days. The last item was a sweater of Bret\u2019s, one he\u2019d outgrown long ago. Liam smoothed it over her shoulders, tucking the tiny Shetland wool arms around her. If anything could reach her, it would be the never-to-be-forgotten smell of her little boy.</p><p>Memories tiptoed into this quiet room. He remembered the first time he\u2019d seen Mikaela. It had been here, in this very hospital. He\u2019d come home for his mother\u2019s funeral and found his father\u2014the great Ian Campbell\u2014suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s. The disease had slowly and methodically erased every larger-than-life aspect of Ian\u2019s personality.</p><p>When the inevitable slide to death began, Ian had been moved into the medical center that bore his name.</p><p>That was when Liam met Mikaela. She\u2019d been young then\u2014only twenty-five\u2014and the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cDid you know how much I longed to talk to you?\u201d he said softly, leaning toward her. \u201cYou were sitting by my dad\u2019s bedside. Do you remember that day? I didn\u2019t say anything. I just stood in the doorway, listening to the way you talked to my father.\u201d</p><p>He sat down in the chair by the bed and took her left hand in his, coiled his fingers around hers. \u201cI still remember the first time you looked at me. You\u2019d seen me, of course, but you never really noticed me until I told you that he was my father.</p><p>\u201cIt was springtime ... remember that? You\u2019d opened his window and brought him a small azalea plant that was a riot of pink flowers. I saw the sadness in you right away. Was it so close to the surface? I wonder about that now. Then, I thought I was special to see it, like we were soldiers of a similar war. The walking wounded. All I could think was how it would feel to be the one to make you smile. Do you remember what you said to me?</p><p>\u201c\u2018Do you talk to him?\u2019 you asked me. I was so embarrassed. I said, \u2018No one really talks to my dad anymore.\u2019</p><p>\u201cAnd you said, \u2018Then you should. It doesn\u2019t matter what you say, just that you\u2019re here. He needs to know you care.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Care. It was such a little word. Like love or hate. There was so much packed into those four letters. Up until that moment, Liam and his father hadn\u2019t spent much time caring.</p><p>\u201cYou gave him back to me, you know. I never really knew him when he was strong and bold and sucking up all the sunlight, but when he was old and shrunken and afraid, he finally became mine. You taught me to talk to him, and in those last weeks, there were moments when he saw me, moments when he knew who I was and why I was there. The day before he died, he held my hand and told me he loved me for the first and only time in my life. You gave me that, Mikaela, and I don\u2019t know if I ever thanked you for it.\u201d</p><p>He stood and leaned over the bed rail. He slowly released her hand and touched her swollen cheek. \u201cI love you, Mike, with everything inside me. I\u2019ll be here, waiting for you, for the rest of our lives. The kids and I ... Come back to us, baby.\u201d His voice broke. He gave himself a minute, then kissed her forehead, whispering, \u201cForever,\u201d against her skin.</p><p>Then he sat back down in the chair, still holding her hand.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>Still do the stars impart their light</p><p>To those that travel in the night.\u2014WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>For four weeks, Mikaela had seen only darkness.</p><p>By the end of the first week, Liam and the children had learned the age-old truth that life went on. As much as they wanted the world to stop for them, it didn\u2019t. Day by day, ordinary life pushed into their sterile, grieving circle, demanding, prodding. Amazingly, the sun still rose in a world without Mikaela, and hours later, it set. Thanksgiving came and went, and in the last week in November, the first snow fell.</p><p>Liam had learned that it was possible to appear to move forward when you were really standing still. As the coma dragged on, he\u2019d had no choice. The kids went back to school; Rosa knit enough sweaters and blankets to cover everyone in town. Liam hired people to care for the horses; he paid the bills. And eventually he began seeing patients again. At first he\u2019d only seen a few, but now he was up to a half-day schedule. He left the office at two o\u2019clock every afternoon and sat by Mike\u2019s bed until dinnertime. Some days Jacey showed up, some days she didn\u2019t. Bret hadn\u2019t yet found the courage to visit his mother, but Liam knew he would.</p><p>Liam\u2019s patients kept him busy a few hours a day, and he thanked God for it. Because when he wasn\u2019t working, he was waiting, watching his beautiful, cherished wife lie in a bed that had held someone else a month ago and would hold others again in the future.</p><p>He stood at his office window, staring out. Next door, the snow was beginning to stick to Mrs. Peterson\u2019s picket fence.</p><p>In a few hours, the last elementary-school bell would ring; children would begin to gather at Turnagain Hill, dragging their sleds and inner tubes along the snow-slicked street, careening down the hill on their breathless journey to the lip of Mr. Robbin\u2019s frog pond.</p><p>By tomorrow morning, Liam knew those same kids would wake early and race to their bedroom windows, hoping to find that their backyards were white. Parents would watch the morning news beside their shrieking children, praying silently that the buses could still make their routes. But their prayers would be drowned out by younger, more enthusiastic voices\u2014and school would be canceled. By noon, Mrs. Sanman at the bakery would begin simmering pots of whole milk on her stove, offering free hot chocolate to anyone brave enough to venture to her street corner, and the firemen would blast water along the turnout at the end of Sasquatch Street, creating the best ice rink in the state.</p><p>Liam forgot for a second what his life had become. The urge swept through him to pick up the phone and call her, Hey, Mike, come quick, it\u2019s snowing, but he caught himself just in time.</p><p>She loved the snow, his Mikaela, loved the crisp, pure taste of a single snowflake and the tiny spray of icy water that was left on her face when she came inside. She loved mittens with fake fur trim and black angora cowled hoods that turned an ordinary housewife into Grace Kelly. She loved watching her children eat Cup-A-Soup at the kitchen table while snow melted from their bangs and slid down their pinkened cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He closed the curtains, went back to his desk, and sat down, stacking the last of the charts in a neat pile. He knew that in a matter of minutes, his nurse, Carol Audleman, would come to tell him what time it was. As if he didn\u2019t know, as if he hadn\u2019t been waiting for and dreading this exact minute all day.</p><p>A knock at the door. \u201cDoctor?\u201d Carol pushed the partially open door and stepped into the small, darkened room. \u201cIt\u2019s one o\u2019clock. Marian was your last patient for the day. We scheduled a short day today, because ...\u201d She glanced away. \u201cWell, you know why.\u201d</p><p>He smiled tiredly, knowing she would see the weariness in his face, wishing he could change it.</p><p>\u201cMidge called around noon. She left a lasagna and salad on your kitchen table.\u201d</p> <p>That was something else Liam had learned. People didn\u2019t know how else to help\u2014so they cooked. This town had banded together to help the Campbells through this terrible time, and they would remain at the ready for a long time. Liam was grateful for their help, but sometimes at night, as he wrote out thank-you notes, the pain was so flashing and deep that he had to put down his pen. Every baking dish and salad bowl reminded them all that Mikaela wasn\u2019t home ... that she couldn\u2019t do the things she\u2019d once done.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Carol.\u201d He pushed back in his chair, got up, and reached for his down parka, grabbing it off the hook on the wall. Shrugging out of his white coat, he carefully laid it over the chair-back and followed Carol out of the office, past the empty waiting room. At the door, he patted her shoulder, then went out into the cold.</p><p>As he drove toward the hospital, he passed the hand-painted, hand-carved wooden sign that read: GOOD-BYE FROM LAST BEND. HOME OF THE GRIZZLIES, 1982 STATE B-8 FOOTBALL CHAMPS. A banner hung suspended across the road, advertising Glacier Days, the annual winter festival.</p><p>Coming soon ... don\u2019t forget ...</p><p>He pulled into the hospital parking lot. The medical center was unusually quiet today. Snow covered everything now, turning the cars into white humps. He parked in his spot and reached under the seat for the two things he\u2019d brought, a photo album and a small wrapped box. Without reaching for his coat, he flipped up the flannel collar of his shirt and headed for the hospital.</p> <p>The center\u2019s electronically monitored glass doors whooshed open. Inside, a few candy stripers were putting up the first Christmas decorations.</p><p>He paused at the threshold, then forced himself to plunge into the antiseptic environment that used to be as welcoming to him as his own living room, but now brought him instantly to despair.</p><p>He nodded hellos to the familiar faces but never stopped, never slowed. Too many of the doctors and nurses wouldn\u2019t meet Liam\u2019s eyes.</p><p>They no longer believed that Mikaela would wake up ... or if she did, they thought, whispering among themselves late at night in the midst of a surprisingly quiet shift, she wouldn\u2019t be Mikaela anymore. At best, they imagined a diminished imitation of what she had been, at worst ... well, no one wanted to think about the worst possibilities.</p><p>He passed the nurses\u2019 station and waved briefly at Sarah, the head nurse. She smiled back, and in her eyes he saw a hope that mirrored his own. Ragged, a little worn at the edges, but there all the same.</p><p>He paused at the closed door to Mikaela\u2019s room, gathering his strength, then he turned the knob and went inside. The curtains were closed\u2014no matter how often he opened them on his visits, he always found them closed when he returned. He walked past her bed and pulled back the blue fabric.</p> <p>At last he turned to his wife. As always the first sight of her was difficult; it simultaneously made him breathe too hard and not at all. She lay as still as death on the metal-railed bed. A single strand of hair fell across one eye and stuck to her lip. Her chest rose and fell with deceptive regularity; she breathed. The only sign of life. He could see that her hair had been recently washed\u2014it was still a little damp. The nurses took extra care of Mikaela; she\u2019d been one of them. They\u2019d even exchanged the utilitarian, hospital-issue gown for a soft, delicate, hand-sewn version.</p><p>He settled into the chair beside her bed. The hard, vomit-colored plastic had molded to his shape in the past weeks and was now almost comfortable.</p><p>\u201cHeya, Mike,\u201d he said, putting new potpourri in the dish beside her bed. Bayberry this week, to remind her of the passing of time. To let her know that Christmas was on its way.</p><p>Bit by bit, he carried out his daily ritual\u2014the potpourri, the careful placement of one of the kids\u2019 shirts on Mikaela\u2019s chest, the music that seeped softly from the tape player in the corner. The Eagles\u2019 Greatest Hits to remind her of high school. The Phantom of the Opera to remind her of the time they\u2019d gone to Vancouver to see the show. Even the Rocky Horror Picture Show soundtrack ... just to make her smile. He did anything and everything he could think of to engage her senses and remind her that life was still here, that they were still here, her loving family, waiting for her to open her eyes and join them once again.</p><p>In the corner, the small electric pond he\u2019d placed on a wooden box pumped the music of falling water into the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike ...\u201d He took hold of her foot and began gently manipulating it the way the physical therapists had taught him. When he\u2019d run through all the exercises on both legs, her ankles, and all ten toes, he reached for a bottle of expensive, perfumed body lotion and began smoothing it on her calves.</p><p>Then he set to work on her left hand, starting with the thumb. A careful, precise movement, bend ... extend ... bend ... extend.</p><p>He set his actions to the music of his voice. \u201cIt was a quiet day at the office,\u201d he said in a throaty voice, the only kind he seemed able to manage when he was beside her. \u201cJimmy McCracken came in again, this time with a marble stuck up his nose, and old Mrs. Jacobsen had another migraine. Of course, she really just wanted to talk. Since Robbie and Janine moved to Chelan, she\u2019s lonely. But she brought me some of her excellent cranberry rum cake. Remember how fast you used to sell out of that at the school bake sales?\u201d</p> <p>Across the room, the tape player clicked and changed. It was Barbra Streisand now, singing about people who needed people.</p><p>He squeezed Mike\u2019s hand. \u201cRemember when we danced to this song, Mike? It was in the Center Hall at the Minors\u2019 fiftieth wedding anniversary, with that local band playing? Remember how the lead singer mangled the words and sang about peepers needing other peepers? We were laughing so hard we were crying\u2014and you said if he said that word again, you were going to peeper in your pants?</p><p>\u201cYou were so beautiful that night, in your jeans skirt and Western blouse. I think every man in the place wished you were his. At the end of the song, I kissed you and it went on so long, you smacked me on the back and said, \u2018Jesus, Lee, we\u2019re not teenagers,\u2019 but I felt you shiver ... and for a split second, we were kids again ...\u201d</p><p>This was how his evenings were spent now. In a gentle stream of words, he poured himself into her, his heart and soul. As if she were a dying flower that needed only a tiny taste of water to lend it the strength to reach again for the sun. He talked and talked and talked, all the while searching desperately for some movement, some blink of the eye or flutter in her hand that would tell him that the heat of his voice reached the cold darkness of her world.</p><p>\u201cHeya, Mike, I\u2019ll bet you thought I forgot our anniversary.\u201d He started to reach for the photo album on the bedside table, but at the last second, he drew his hand back.</p><p>It was a collection of pictures from last year\u2019s Christmas in Schweitzer. Mike had chosen each photograph carefully to represent their vacation.</p><p>He\u2019d been a fool to think that he could open it and look through the picture trail. Now he saw the album for what it was, a wound that, once torn open, would only seep infection and cause more pain. Instead, he glanced down at the thin, flat box beside the album.</p><p>It had been wrapped for almost two months and hidden deep in the sample drawer in his office. He\u2019d been so damned excited on the day he\u2019d decided what to give her for their tenth anniversary. He and Carol had scheduled a half day at the office, so Liam could spend this special day alone with his wife.</p><p>\u201cI got us tickets on the Concorde, Mike. Paris ...\u201d For New Year\u2019s. His voice cracked. For years they\u2019d talked about Paris, dreamed together about New Year\u2019s at the Ritz. Why had he taken so long to get tickets? It wasn\u2019t money, it wasn\u2019t even time. Plenty of friends had offered to watch the kids for two weeks at winter break. It was ... life. Mike\u2019s saddle club activities and her horse training; Jacey\u2019s volleyball, skiing, and violin recitals; Bret\u2019s Little League and hockey practice; Liam\u2019s patients.</p><p>Just life. They\u2019d blithely thrown their line of dreams out again and again, reeling in nothing but lost chances and missed opportunities. Why hadn\u2019t they realized how precious every moment was? Why hadn\u2019t they seen that one fall from an ordinarily gentle horse could take their future away?</p><p>He stood and grabbed the bed rail, lowering it. The railing fell with a clattering whine and clunked into the bottom position. Slowly he climbed into bed with her. Tucking one arm behind her head, he drew her close, being careful not to pull out her IVs. Her body was limp and seemed frail, though she\u2019d lost only a pound or two.</p><p>He held on to her lifeless hand, squeezing gently so that she would know he was here. \u201cHelp me, Mike. Squeeze my hand, blink your eyes. Do something. Show me how to reach you ...\u201d</p><p>He lay there for almost an hour. When he next tried to speak, nothing came out except the broken, rusty moan that held her name.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>For a second, Liam thought his wife had spoken, but her hand was limp as death and her eyes were sealed. Slowly he turned to see Jacey standing in the open doorway. She was holding a cake.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey.\u201d He climbed awkwardly out of the bed and slumped into his chair.</p><p>She moved toward him, her long black hair swinging gently against the oversized flannel work shirt that swallowed her lithe, sixteen-year-old body. Her face was winter pale, and what little color her cheeks might have produced was sucked clean away by the sight of her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s your tenth anniversary. You and Mom always made such a big deal out of it ...\u201d Her words fell away, and he knew she was looking to him for reinforcement.</p><p>It was difficult, but he nodded and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right. She would have wanted us to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>Jacey set the cake on the table by the bed. It was a round, two-layered affair with pink butter-cream frosting, the same cake that Suzie Sanman at the Lazy Susan Bake Shop had concocted for them every year. Only this year, instead of the normal Happy Anniversary Mike and Liam, it was blank on top. Liam wondered how long Suzie had spent trying to think of something festive and hopeful to write before she gave up.</p><p>Jacey moved closer to the bed and leaned over her mother. \u201cHappy anniversary, Mom.\u201d She reached out a shaking hand and brushed a lock of hair from Mikaela\u2019s face. \u201cCan you believe it has been ten years since we married Liam?\u201d</p><p>She turned and smiled at him, and in that instant, she was six years old again, a gap-toothed first grader who\u2019d fallen off the jungle gym and sprained her finger. He ached to make everything better for her, but no amount of colored Band-Aids or knock-knock jokes would make her smile now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow is she today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same.\u201d</p><p>Jacey swiped a finger along the side of the cake, drawing up a big glob of pink frosting. She held it beneath Mikaela\u2019s nose. \u201cCan you smell the cake, Mom? It\u2019s Suzie\u2019s best vanilla cream, with real Grand Marnier in the frosting. Just the way you liked ... like it.\u201d</p><p>The tiny fissure in her voice was almost more than Liam could bear. \u201cHere, pull up a chair. How was school today?\u201d</p> <p>Jacey tucked a long strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cGood. I aced the math test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, then turned away. He noticed the quick, nervous way she bit down on her lip\u2014a trait she\u2019d inherited from her mother.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Jace?\u201d</p><p>It was a minute before she answered. \u201cThe winter dance is coming up. Mark asked me if I wanted to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s okay. Whatever you want to do is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but ...\u201d</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze. \u201cMom and I talked a lot about this dance. We were going to go into Bellingham to get a dress. She ...\u201d Her voice snagged on emotion and fell to a whisper. \u201cShe said she\u2019d never been to a prom, and she wanted me to look like a princess.\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t imagine his beautiful wife sitting at home on prom night. How come he didn\u2019t know that about her? It was another of his wife\u2019s many secrets. \u201cCome on, Jace. It\u2019ll break her heart if she finds out you didn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fair, Dad.\u201d She looked away, then, very softly, she said, \u201cIf she wakes up.\u201d</p> <p>Liam wanted, just once, to hold Jacey and say, I\u2019m scared, too. What if this is it ... or what if she wakes up and doesn\u2019t know us ... or if she never wakes up at all? But those were his fears, and it was his job to keep the lights on for his family.</p><p>\u201cJacey, your mother is going to wake up. We have to keep believing that. She needs us to keep believing. This is no time to go soft on her. We\u2019re a family of warriors, and we don\u2019t run from a fight. Do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting ... harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be called a test of faith if it were easy.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cI heard you last night. You were talking to Grandma about Mom. You said no one knew why she didn\u2019t wake up. After Grandma left, I saw you go to the piano. I was going to say something, then I heard you crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He sagged forward in his chair. There was no point in lying to her. It had been a bad night, the kind where his armor felt as if it were crafted of cellophane. Remembering their anniversary had done him in. He\u2019d sat at the elegant Steinway in the living room, aching to play again, needing to recapture the music that had once lived inside him. But ever since the accident, he\u2019d been empty; the music that had sustained him through so much of his life had simply vanished. Though he\u2019d never said so to Jacey, she knew; perhaps she\u2019d noticed even before he had. The house that once had been filled with Bach and Beethoven and Mozart was as silent these days as a hospital room.</p><p>Music had always been his release. In the Bronx, when he\u2019d felt as if he was losing his soul, he\u2019d played angry, pounding music that screamed that the world was unfair, and in the bleak days while his father was fading into a stranger, he\u2019d played quiet, elegiac melodies that reminded him of the sweetness of life, of the fullness of promises made. But now, when he needed that solace most of all, there was only this aching emptiness inside him.</p><p>He gave Jacey the only truth he could. \u201cSometimes it catches up with me and grabs so hard I can\u2019t remember how to breathe. I sort of ... fall through the floorboards of my fear, but I always land here, at her bedside, holding her hand and loving her.\u201d</p> <p>Jacey looked at Liam with a sadness that wouldn\u2019t have been possible just a few short weeks ago. \u201cI want to tell her I\u2019m sorry for all the times she looked sad and I didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you and Bret with all her heart and soul, Jacey. You know that. And when she wakes up, she\u2019s going to want to see those dance photos. If you don\u2019t go, we\u2019ll be eating macaroni and cheese out of a box for months. No one can hold a grudge like your mother.\u201d He smiled gently. \u201cNow, I may not know much about shopping for girl stuff in Bellingham, but I know about style because Mike has bucketloads. Remember the dress your mom wore to the Policemen\u2019s Ball last year? She went all the way to Seattle for that dress, and to be honest, it cost more than my first car. You\u2019d look perfect in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Richard Tyler. I forgot all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wore it with that pretty sparkly clip in her hair. You could do that. Grandma could help you. Or maybe Gertrude at the Sunny and Shear salon could help. I know I\u2019m not as good at this as your mom, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jacey threw her arms around him. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have done any better, Daddy. Honest.\u201d</p><p>He turned to his wife, forced a smile. \u201cYou see what\u2019s happening, Mike? You\u2019re forcing me to give fashion advice to our sixteen-year-old. Hell, the last time I picked out my own clothes, bell-bottoms were in fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, they\u2019re in fashion again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? If you don\u2019t wake up soon, honey, I might authorize that eyebrow piercing she\u2019s been asking for.\u201d</p><p>They sat together, talking to each other and to the woman lying motionless in the bed before them. They talked as if it were a normal day, hoping all the while that some snippet of their conversation, some word or sound or touch, would sneak through Mike\u2019s darkness and remind her that she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>At three o\u2019clock, the bedside phone rang, jangling through one of Jacey\u2019s stories.</p><p>Liam reached for the phone and answered, \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Liam. Sorry to bother you. It\u2019s Dawn at the school.\u201d</p><p>He listened for a minute, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right down,\u201d and hung up. He turned to Jacey. \u201cIt\u2019s Bret. He\u2019s in trouble again. I\u2019ve got to go down to the school. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Grandma\u2019s going to pick me up here after her errands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Liam scooted back in his chair, hating the fingernail-on-chalkboard sound of the metal legs scraping across linoleum. As he stood up, he leaned over his wife. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go, Mike, but I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can. I love you, honey.\u201d He leaned closer and kissed her slack lips, whispering, \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Life sucks.</p><p>That\u2019s what Bret Campbell was thinking as he sat on the hard bench in the nurse\u2019s room. His right eye, where Billy McAllister had punched him, hurt like crazy. He was doing his very best not to cry. Everyone knew that crying was for girls and for babies, and he wasn\u2019t either one.</p><p>Mrs. DeNormandie tapped Bret on the hand. \u201cHey, bruiser, why don\u2019t you lie down? I\u2019ll give you an ice pack for that eye. Mrs. Town just called your daddy at the hospital. He\u2019ll be right down.\u201d She turned to the small white fridge beneath the window and took out an ice pack. It was all floppy like a bag of peas and was the same color as the fluoride Dr. Edwards put on Bret\u2019s teeth at checkup time. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>Bret leaned cautiously against the bumpy wall. He wasn\u2019t about to lie down. What if Miranda or Katie saw him? They\u2019d be laughing at him forever, and they already made fun of him for eating ham sandwiches and carrying a Goosebumps lunchbox to school. This morning, he\u2019d decided that the next time Katie said something about his sandwich, he was gonna pinch her right in the fat part of her arm. Of course, he\u2019d decided that before the fight with Billy. Now Bret figured he was going to get such a talking-to from Daddy that he didn\u2019t dare add a girl-pinch on top of everything else.</p><p>He closed his eyes and pressed the ice pack to his throbbing eye. He could hear Mrs. D. moving around the small room, reorganizing stuff and shutting and opening doors. It sounded just like when Mommy was getting ready for dinner.</p><p>DON\u2019T THINK ABOUT THAT.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like Bret wanted to think about his mommy. When he did ... when he accidentally remembered things like the way she used to scratch his back while they were watching TV or the way she yelled too loud when he caught a ball during Little League or how she cuddled with him every night for ten minutes before it was really bedtime ... if he thought about those things too much, it was bad. He didn\u2019t cry so much anymore\u2014not until night, anyway. He just sorta ... froze. Sometimes whole minutes would go by and he wouldn\u2019t notice a thing until somebody smacked him on the back or yelled at him or something. Then he\u2019d blink awake and feel totally stupid for spacing out.</p><p>That\u2019s what had happened at recess today.</p><p>He\u2019d stepped out into the snowy yard, and that was all it took. It happened like that sometimes, the remembering.</p><p>All he could think about was his mom and how much she loved the snow. The next thing he knew, Billy McAllister was standing in front of him, yelling, \u201cWhat\u2019s your damned problem, Brat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Billy,\u201d he\u2019d mumbled, not sure what it was he\u2019d done that made Billy mad.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Billy,\u201d Sharie Lindley had said, \u201che didn\u2019t do anything. Besides, Mrs. Kurek told us to be nice to Bret. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Billy\u2019s frown hadn\u2019t faded. \u201cOh, yeah. I forgot. His mom\u2019s a vegetable. Sorry, Brat.\u201d</p><p>All Bret remembered was the way he screamed, My mom\u2019s no carrot, and launched himself at Billy. The next thing he knew, Mr. Monie, the principal, was there, breaking up the fight, blowing his whistle. And now Bret was here, in the nurse\u2019s room, feeling like a geekozoid and wondering how he\u2019d face his friends again.</p><p>\u201cBretster?\u201d</p><p>Bret flinched at the familiar voice and slowly turned. \u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Dad stood in the doorway. He was so tall, he had to kind of duck his head forward, and because of that he looked ... bent. His silvery blond hair was too long now\u2014Mommy used to cut it\u2014and it fell across his wire-rimmed glasses a little. But Bret wasn\u2019t fooled by those bits of glass. He\u2019d learned long ago that his daddy\u2019s green eyes saw everything.</p><p>Mrs. DeNormandie looked up from her work. She was organizing tongue depressors in a glass jar. \u201cOh. Hello, Dr. Campbell.\u201d</p><p>In the old days, Dad would have smiled at Mrs. DeNormandie and she would have smiled back, but now neither one of them smiled. \u201cHey, Barb,\u201d Dad said quietly, \u201ccould you give us a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She put the tongue depressors away and quickly left the room, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>Quiet fell, the icky kind that spelled big trouble.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the eye?\u201d Dad said finally.</p><p>Bret turned to him, letting Daddy see for himself. He dropped the ice pack onto the floor. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Dad sat down beside Bret. \u201cReally?\u201d he said in that we-don\u2019t-lie-in-this-family voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. It hurts worse than when Jacey\u2019s cow stepped on my foot at the fair.\u201d At his dad\u2019s soft look, Bret almost started to cry again. If Mommy were here\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>DON\u2019T THINK ABOUT THAT.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ve learned the first rule of fighting. It hurts. The second rule is: It doesn\u2019t change anything. Who started it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Dad looked surprised. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was mad.\u201d Bret braced himself for the horrible words: I\u2019m disappointed in you, son.</p><p>He felt like crying already, and Dad hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he put his arm around Bret\u2019s shoulder and pulled him close. Bret climbed onto his dad\u2019s big, comfortable lap. For once, he didn\u2019t care if he looked like a baby.</p><p>Dad brushed the hair away from Bret\u2019s face. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be quite a shiner. Worse than the one Ian Allen got last Fourth of July. Why did you punch Billy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bully.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Bret knew his dad would find out. Sharie\u2019s aunt Georgia was best friends with Ida Mae at the diner, who served lunch every day to Carol, who worked in Dad\u2019s office. In a town like Last Bend, it would be big news that Bret Campbell punched out Billy McAllister and broke his front tooth. The only question would be why. \u201cBilly said Mom was a vegetable.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to take Daddy a long time to answer. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked and talked about this, Bret. Your mom is in a coma. She\u2019s sleeping. If you\u2019d come down and see her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna see her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Dad sighed. \u201cWell, come on, sport, let\u2019s go. They might need this bench for kids with serious injuries.\u201d He helped Bret into his puffy winter coat, then lifted him up. Bret hung on, burying his face in the warm crook of his dad\u2019s neck, as they headed out of the school and into the softly falling snow. At the car, Dad let Bret slide down to the icy sidewalk.</p><p>He stood next to the car, waiting for his daddy to get the car unlocked. His hands were cold, so he reached into his pockets for his gloves\u2014but they weren\u2019t there.</p> <p>It was Mommy who used to tuck mittens in Bret\u2019s pockets Just In Case, and now they were empty.</p><p>Dad got in his side of the car, then shoved the passenger door open, and Bret got inside. When the engine turned over, the radio came on. It was playing the first Christmas song of the season, \u201cSilent Night.\u201d</p><p>Dad clicked the radio off, fast.</p><p>Snow pattered against the windshield, blurring the outside world. The windshield wipers came on and made two big humps through the snow. Bret stared at them\u2014anything was better than looking at his dad right now. Ka-thump. Ka-thump. Ka-thump. The wipers moved right and left, right and left, making exactly the same sound as a heart beating.</p><p>Dad put the car in gear and drove slowly out of the school parking lot. He turned on Glacier Way, then again on Main Street, then again on Cascade Avenue. In silence they drove past the empty parking lot of the Bean There, Done That coffee shop, past the empty front window of the Sunny &amp; Shear Beauty Salon, and past the crowded entrance to Zeke\u2019s Feed and Seed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet old Zeke is busier than a one-armed paper hanger right now,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>It was one of his dad\u2019s favorite expressions. No one could ever just be busy. They had to be busier than a one-armed paper hanger. Whatever that was. \u201cYep,\u201d Bret said.</p><p>\u201cLots of folks\u2019ll be caught by surprise with this weather. It\u2019s early for snow.\u201d</p> <p>For the next few miles, Dad didn\u2019t say a thing. As they edged out of town, the paved road turned into snow-covered gravel, and there weren\u2019t any other tracks at all. Dad put the Explorer in four-wheel drive and lowered his speed.</p><p>Bret wished Daddy hadn\u2019t mentioned visiting Mommy. Just the thought made Bret feel sick. Usually he pretended that she was out of town, at a horse show in Canada.</p><p>He hated it when he was reminded that she was in the hospital. It was bad enough that he remembered THE DAY. He squeezed his eyes shut, but the memories came anyway, the ones he hated, the ones that lived curled in the wheels of his Corvette bed and came at him every night as soon as Daddy turned off the lights and shut the door.</p><p>Wait, Mommy. The jump is in the wrong place. Someone musta moved it ...</p><p>Bret turned to look at Dad. \u201cDo you swear Mom\u2019s gonna wake up?\u201d</p><p>Dad didn\u2019t answer right away. When he finally did, it was in a quiet voice. \u201cI can\u2019t swear she\u2019ll be fine, son. I can\u2019t even swear that she\u2019ll wake up. But I believe it with all my heart and soul, and she needs you to believe it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it.\u201d</p><p>He said it too fast; his daddy knew he was lying.</p><p>After that, Bret leaned his head against the window and closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to see his mom lying in that hospital bed. He liked it better when he pretended she was still alive. Sometimes he could close his eyes and imagine her standing beside his bed, with her hair short and spiky around her face and her arms crossed. She\u2019d be smiling at him, and she looked like she used to\u2014no bruises or cuts at all. And she always said the same thing: How\u2019s my favorite boy in the whole world?</p><p>But it was just a silly old dream, and it didn\u2019t mean a thing. Bret might be little, and maybe sometimes he didn\u2019t know what to do with the remainder at the end of a long-division problem, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew that fairy tales and cartoons weren\u2019t real. Everybody knew that Wile E. Coyote couldn\u2019t really fall from an airplane and live or that princesses who ate poisoned apples and slept in glass cases for years couldn\u2019t wake up.</p><p>And mommies who fell off horses and cracked their heads against the wooden post at the end of the arena were really dead.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Liam stared at the mail in his lap. Almost all of it was addressed to Mikaela. Bills from the Country Corner General Store and the feed store, stabling and lessons checks from the twelve families who paid to board their horses at the barn, postcards and leaflets and flyers. A postcard announcing Nordstrom\u2019s latest sale.</p><p>In ordinary times, he would have gone into the kitchen and tossed the postcard on the kitchen table and said, \u201cOh, no, the Christmas sale is starting....\u201d She would have laughed easily, turning away from the stove or the refrigerator or the washing machine as she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll just sell a few shares of Microsoft to get me through....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, why are we sitting at the mailbox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry about that, Bretster. I was just thinking about something.\u201d Tossing the pile of mail into the well between them, he eased his foot off the brake pedal and pressed cautiously on the gas. The Explorer\u2019s tires spun on the mushy rim of the road, then grabbed on to the gravel and lurched forward. Ahead of them, the deserted road was a twisted river of fallen snow. Towering Douglas firs and cedar trees, their downslung branches dusted white, hemmed the thin strip of road that Ian Campbell had carved from the forest almost fifty years ago. There were a few other farmhouses along the way, their slanted, rock-dented mailboxes stuck at haphazard angles on spindly wooden legs.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could build a snowman after dinner,\u201d Liam said awkwardly, wondering where Mikaela kept the mittens and the extra woolen socks. He knew there was a box somewhere, probably marked Winter clothes, but he couldn\u2019t remember where they\u2019d stashed it last year. Maybe behind the stack of Christmas decorations in the attic.</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe we could drive down to Turnagain Hill and go sledding. Mr. Robbin told us to come on down anytime for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say. They both knew there would be no sledding, no ice-skating, no snowmen, and no hot cocoa. Not now. They would think of such things, perhaps even talk about doing them, but in the end, as they\u2019d done for the past four weeks, they would come together in that big house in the middle of the snowy field and go their separate ways.</p><p>They would eat dinner together, each one in turn tossing out some inane, pointless bit of conversation. After dinner they would do the dishes, the four of them. Then they would try to watch television together, Wild Discovery or maybe a sitcom, but gradually they would drift apart. Jacey would burrow into her room and talk on the phone. Bret would settle in front of his computer and play loud, fast-paced games that required his full attention, and Rosa would knit.</p><p>Liam would float from room to room, doing nothing, trying to keep his mind blank. More often than not, he ended up in front of the grand piano in the living room, staring down at the keyboard, wishing the music was still in his heart and in his fingers, but knowing that it was gone.</p><p>He downshifted and turned left, passing beneath the rough-hewn arch his dad had constructed years ago, onto the driveway that was lined with snow-dusted four-rail fencing. In some distant part of his mind, he heard the gentle clanking of the iron sign that hung suspended from the cross-beam of the cedar arch, the one that read ANGEL FALLS RANCH. Or maybe it was his imagination, that sound, and all he really heard was the tinny silence between himself and his son.</p><p>He pulled into the garage and turned off the engine. Bret immediately unbuckled his seat belt, grabbed his backpack, and hurried into the house.</p><p>Liam sat there, hands planted on the wheel. He didn\u2019t look at the album and present he\u2019d tossed in the backseat, but he knew they were there.</p><p>Finally he got out of the car and headed into the house, passing through the cluttered mudroom. At the end of the hallway, a light glowed faintly orange.</p><p>Thank God for Rosa.</p><p>He was still a little awkward around her, uncomfortable. She was so damned quiet, like one of those Cold War spies who\u2019d learned to walk without making a sound. Sometimes he caught her staring at him, and in her dark eyes he saw a sadness that went clear to the bone. Sometimes he wished he were the kind of man who could go to her, smiling, and say, So, Rosa, what happened to you? But that\u2019s not how they were with each other. If Liam had asked the personal question, Rosa wouldn\u2019t have answered. And so, they moved around each other, close but not too close.</p><p>Now, as he moved through the house, he flicked on the lights. No matter how often he told Rosa that electricity was cheap, she turned on only the lights she needed.</p><p>Not like Mike, who hated a dark house.</p><p>When he reached the great room, he stood in the shadows, watching Rosa and Bret set up for Yahtzee. Within minutes they had a game going. He wished he didn\u2019t notice how quietly Bret played. There was none of the clapping or whistling or \u201cAll rights!\u201d that used to be his son\u2019s natural soundtrack.</p><p>They were quite a pair, the silent little boy with the blackening eye and his equally solemn grandmother.</p><p>She was such a small woman, Rosa, only a hand\u2019s width taller than her grandson, and the way she moved\u2014head down, shoulders hunched\u2014made her appear even smaller. Tonight, as usual, she was dressed all in black. The somber fabric emphasized the snowy whiteness of her hair and skin. She was a woman of sharp contrasts. Black and white, cold and warm, spiritual and down-to-earth.</p><p>Rosa looked up and saw him. \u201cHola, Dr. Liam.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d told her a dozen times to please, please call him Liam, but she wouldn\u2019t do it. Smiling, he moved toward them. \u201cWho\u2019s winning?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy grandson, of course.

Maybe later.\u201d</p><p>Bret sighed. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>Liam headed toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDr. Liam, wait.\u201d Rosa stood up in a single, fluid motion and followed him into the dining room.</p> <p>There, in the dark, quiet room, she stared up at him. Her eyes were as black as pools of ink, and as readable. \u201cThe children ... they are much quiet today. I think something is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our tenth wedding anniversary.\u201d He blurted the whole sentence out at once, then he slowed down. \u201cThe kids ... knew I\u2019d bought Mike tickets to Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Lo siento.\u201d Something close to a smile breezed across her mouth and disappeared. \u201cShe is lucky to have you, Dr. Liam. I do not know if I have ever told you this.\u201d</p><p>It touched him deeply, that simple sentiment from this woman who spoke so rarely. \u201cThanks, Rosa, I\u2014\u201d He started to say something else\u2014what, he didn\u2019t know\u2014but all at once his voice dried up.</p><p>\u201cDr. Liam.\u201d Her soft voice elongated the vowels in his name and turned it into music. \u201cCome play a game of Yahtzee with us. It will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need ...\u201d A bad start. There were so many things he needed. \u201cI have something to do upstairs. Jacey needs to borrow one of Mike\u2019s dresses for the winter dance.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned closer. He had an odd sense that she wanted to say something more, but she turned away and headed back to the game.</p><p>Liam went into the kitchen and poured himself a drink. The Crown Royal burned down his throat and set his stomach on fire. Holding the drink tightly, he moved up the wide staircase to the second floor. He could hear music seeping from beneath Jacey\u2019s closed door. At least it was considered music by Jacey, some jarring, pounding batter of drums and electric guitars.</p><p>With a glance down the hallway, he turned into his bedroom and flicked on the light. The room, even in its current state of disarray\u2014unmade bed, shoes and clothes and bath towels scattered across the floor\u2014welcomed him as it always did. The creamy walls, stenciled with stars and moons, the gauzy drapery of the canopy, the creamy Berber carpet. If he closed his eyes, he could imagine Mike standing there at the French doors, looking out at the falling snow. She would be wearing the peach silk nightgown that fell in graceful folds down her lithe body.</p><p>He refused to close his eyes, but it was tempting, so tempting. Instead he stared straight ahead.</p><p>The door to Mike\u2019s walk-in closet seemed to magnify before his eyes. He hadn\u2019t ventured into it since the day of the accident, when he\u2019d naively packed her a suitcase full of things she might need at the hospital.</p><p>He crossed the room and paused at the closet, then he reached for the knob and twisted. The oak door creaked and swung inward easily, as if it had been waiting for this moment for weeks.</p><p>A floor-length mirror along the end wall caught his image and threw it back, a tall, lanky man with unkempt hair and baggy clothes parenthesized by colorful fabrics. On either side of him, clothes were hung on specially ordered plastic hangers, the colors organized as precisely as an artist\u2019s wheel. The ivory plastic of Nordstrom\u2019s designer departments hung clustered in one area. Her evening clothes.</p><p>It took him a minute to get his feet to move. He began unzipping the bags, one at a time, looking for the dress Mike had worn to the Policemen\u2019s Ball. At about the sixth bag, he reached inside, and instead of finding a gown of silk or velvet as he\u2019d expected, he found a pillowcase, carefully hung on a pants hanger.</p> <p>Frowning, he eased it from the bag. It was an elegant white silk affair, not the kind of pillowcase they used at all. On one end was a monogram: MLT.</p><p>Mikaela Luna ... Something.</p><p>His heart skipped a beat. This was from her life before.</p><p>He should turn away, zip up this bag, and forget its existence. He knew this because his hands had started to sweat and a tickling unease was working its way down his spine.</p><p>Over the years, he\u2019d collected so many questions, stroked them in his mind every time she\u2019d said, Let\u2019s not go there, Liam. The past isn\u2019t something that matters now. Every time he\u2019d seen sadness darken her eyes or known that something had smoothed the edges of her laugh to a quiet mournful sound, he\u2019d wondered why.</p><p>The past mattered, of course. Liam had been willing to pretend otherwise because he loved his wife, and because he was afraid of who or what had caused the deep well of her sorrow, but the moment he touched the pillowcase, made of a fabric so expensive he didn\u2019t know anyone who would know where to buy such a thing\u2014certainly Mike wouldn\u2019t\u2014and saw the tantalizing mystery of the MLT monogram, he was lost. The past they\u2019d all ignored was here; it had lived with them all these years, hidden inside a Nordstrom bag in his wife\u2019s closet. And like Pandora, he simply had to look.</p><p>Once he had the pillowcase in his hand, he could see plainly that it was stuffed full of something. He felt strangely detached as he walked back into his bedroom and sat down on his big, king-sized four-poster bed, dragging the pillowcase up beside him. He stared down at it for a long time, weighing the danger, knowing that sometimes there was no way to undo what had been done, and that some secrets were composed of acid that, once spilled, could burn through the fragile layers of a relationship.</p><p>Still, the lure of finally knowing was too powerful to resist. For years he had longed to tear the lid off her jar of secrets. He\u2019d always thought that if he knew her pain, he would understand. He would be able to help.</p><p>These were the lies he told himself as he turned the pillowcase upside down and watched as photographs, newspaper clippings, and official-looking documents, all bent and yellowed, fluttered onto the comforter. The last thing to fall out was a wedding ring with a diamond as big as a dime. Liam stared at it so long his vision blurred, and then he was seeing another ring, a thin gold band. No diamonds, Liam, she\u2019d said softly, and though he\u2019d heard the catch in her voice, he\u2019d paid it no mind. He\u2019d thought how nice it was that she didn\u2019t care about such things.</p><p>The truth was she\u2019d already had diamonds.</p><p>Turning away from the diamond ring, he saw a photograph, an eight-by-ten full-color glossy print. It was half covered; all he could see was Mikaela in a wedding dress. The groom was hidden behind a carefully cut-out newspaper article. He wanted to pick it up, but his hands were shaking too badly. He thought, crazily, that if he didn\u2019t touch it, didn\u2019t brush away the newsprint, the man in the other half of the photo wouldn\u2019t exist.</p><p>He hardly recognized Mikaela. Her wavy black hair was drawn up in a sleek, elaborate twist that glittered with diamonds, and makeup accentuated the catlike tilt of her brown eyes, turned her pale, puffy lips into the kind of mouth that fueled a thousand male fantasies. The sleeveless gown she wore was a soft, opalescent white\u2014completely unlike the conservative cream-colored suit she\u2019d worn for her second wedding. There were oceans of pearls and beads sewn into the silky sheath, so many that the dress appeared to be made of crushed diamonds and clouds. Not a thing of this earth at all.</p><p>She, his wife, was a woman he\u2019d never seen before, and that hurt, but the pain of it was nothing compared to the way he felt when he looked at her smile. God help him; she\u2019d never smiled at Liam like that, as if the world were a shining jewel that had just been placed in the palm of her hand.</p><p>Slowly he reached for the picture and picked it up. The newspaper clipping fell away and he saw at last the groom\u2019s face.</p><p>Julian True.</p><p>For a dizzying moment, Liam couldn\u2019t breathe. He could actually feel the breaking of his heart.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he whispered, not knowing if the words were a curse or a prayer.</p><p>She\u2019d been married to Julian True, one of the most famous movie stars in the world.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cDaaaaad! Dinner\u2019s ready!\u201d</p><p>Liam rose unsteadily to his feet and walked away from the pictures on the bed. Closing the door behind him, he moved forward only when he heard the muffled click of the lock. There was no point in staying up here. The things he\u2019d seen wouldn\u2019t change; he\u2019d carry those burning images in his heart forever.</p><p>He clung to the slick oak banister and went down the stairs, drawing a heavy breath before he turned into the dining room.</p><p>Bret was already at the trestle table, looking dwarfed in the big oak chair that his grandfather had crafted by hand. Jacey sat beside him, just now putting the checkered red-and-blue napkin in her lap. \u201cHi, Dad,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>She looked so much like Mike that he almost stumbled.</p><p>Rosa came around the corner, carrying a glass bowl of salad, with a bottle of dressing tucked under her arm. She paused when she saw him, then she smiled softly. \u201cGood, good, you are here. Have a seat, Dr. Liam,\u201d she said as she plunked the bowl onto the table and took her own place.</p><p>As usual, no one looked at the empty chair at the opposite end of the table.</p><p>Liam made it through dinner like one of those Disney robots. He forced his dry mouth to smile. He could feel the way Jacey and Rosa were staring at him. He tried to act as if this were a normal dinner\u2014at least as normal as their meals had become in the past month\u2014but he was weary and the veneer had worn thin.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from the chicken enchiladas, realizing that he\u2019d managed to push them around on his plate into an unappetizing pile of orange mush. \u201cYeah, Jace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find that dress for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, honey. I found it. I\u2019ll give it to you after dinner. Maybe you and Grandma can practice fixing up your hair.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Dad.</p><p>The word had a hook that drew blood.</p><p>Jacey had called him that almost from the start. She\u2019d been a little bit of a thing back then, a baby-toothed four-year-old with jet-black pigtails and ears that seemed so big she\u2019d never grow into them.</p><p>He could still remember the day Mike had shown up in the clinic, carrying Jacey. It was only a few months after Liam\u2019s father had died, and he\u2019d been trying to find an excuse to talk to Mikaela again.</p><p>Jacey had had a dangerously high fever; convulsions racked her body. One minute she was stretched taut and shaking, and the next, she was as limp as a rag doll, her brown eyes drowsy and unfocused.</p><p>\u201cHelp us,\u201d Mikaela had said softly.</p><p>Liam had canceled his nonemergency appointments for the day and rushed to the ER with them. He\u2019d stood in the OR, watching as the surgeon gently sliced through Jacey\u2019s abdomen and removed her burst appendix. His was the last face she saw before the anesthesia took her, and the first one she saw when she woke up in Recovery. He transferred his patients to Dr. Granato and spent the next three days in the hospital with Mikaela and Jacey; together they watched the Fourth of July fireworks through the rectangular window of Room 320. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d sat in the hospital cafeteria for endless hours with Mike, listening to her ramble from topic to topic. At some point she\u2019d looked up at the wall clock and started to cry. He\u2019d reached across the table, past the remains of her uneaten meal, and taken hold of her hand. She\u2019ll be all right, he\u2019d said. Trust me ...</p><p>She\u2019d looked up at him then, his Mike, with her brown eyes floating in tears and her mouth trembling. I do trust you.</p><p>That had been the beginning.</p><p>Jacey had called him Dad for so long, he\u2019d forgotten that there was another father out there, another man who could lay claim to both his wife\u2019s and daughter\u2019s hearts.</p> <p>\u201cDad. DAD.\u201d</p><p>Bret stared at him. His little face looked unbalanced with the one black eye. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna take me to basketball tryouts aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Bretster.\u201d</p><p>Bret nodded and started talking to Jacey about something. Liam tried to pay attention, but he couldn\u2019t do it. A single sentence kept running through his mind. She was married to Julian True.</p><p>When he looked up again, he saw that Rosa was staring at him, her dark eyes narrowed and assessing.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have something you want to say to me, Rosa?\u201d</p><p>She flinched, obviously surprised by his tone of voice. He knew he should have softened his tone, pretended that everything was okay, but he didn\u2019t have the strength.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Dr. Liam. I would like to speak to you ... privately.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Perfect. \u201cSure. After the kids are in bed.\u201d</p><p>Liam knew that Rosa was waiting for their \u201ctalk,\u201d but he wasn\u2019t ready yet. He\u2019d spent almost an hour reading to Bret, then kissed Jacey good night and taken a long, hot shower.</p><p>Jacey was bunkered in her room now, probably talking on the telephone to one of her many friends and trying on her mother\u2019s dress. Liam hadn\u2019t gone to her, afraid that if he saw her wearing that beautiful gown, looking like her mother, he\u2019d lose it.</p> <p>Right now he wanted to hole up in his own quiet space. Christ, he\u2019d give almost anything to be able to go downstairs, sit at the piano, and play the hell out of some sad bit of music.</p><p>He wanted to be angry, to scream and rail and feel honest-to-God outrage. But he wasn\u2019t that kind of man. His love for Mikaela was more than just an emotion; it was the sum total of who he was.</p><p>This one thing he knew above everything else. He loved Mikaela too much. Which in its way was as bad as loving someone not enough.</p><p>Slowly he went downstairs.</p><p>The piano stood in the empty living room like a forgotten lover.</p><p>Liam closed his eyes and remembered a time when music swirled through this room every night ... He could almost hear the squeaky joint of the bench as Mike sat down beside him.</p><p>Tips are welcome, he\u2019d say, just as he\u2019d said a thousand times on a thousand nights.</p><p>Here\u2019s a tip for you, piano man: Get your wife to bed or miss your chance.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes, the room was empty and silent.</p><p>He\u2019d never thought much about silence, but now he knew its every shape and contour. It was a cheap glass jar that trapped old voices and kept them fresh.</p><p>He went to the piano and sat on the antique bench with its needlepoint seat. With one finger, he plunked at a single key. It made a dull, thudding sound.</p><p>Mrs. Julian True.</p><p>\u201cDr. Liam?\u201d</p><p>He jumped, and his hand crashed on the keys in a blast of discordant sound.</p><p>Rosa stood in the archway that separated the great room from the dining room.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t want to talk to his mother-in-law right now. If she opened the door to intimacy, he might ask the question that was killing him: Did she ever love me, Rosa?</p><p>And God help him, he wasn\u2019t ready for the answer.</p><p>\u201cLo siento, I do not mean to bother you.\u201d</p><p>He studied her, saw the nervous trembling in her hands, the almost invisible tapping of her right foot, and he was seized by a sudden fear that she knew what he\u2019d found, that she\u2019d talk about Mikaela\u2019s past now, tell him more than he wanted to know. He got slowly to his feet and moved toward her. In the pale, overhead light, she looked incredibly fragile, her wrinkled skin almost translucent. A tiny network of blue blood vessels crisscrossed her smooth cheeks. \u201cYes, Rosa?\u201d</p><p>She gazed up at him, her dark eyes steeped in sorrow, and he knew that she understood the pain of a broken heart. \u201cThe anniversary ... it must be very hard on you. I thought ... maybe, if you do not think I am sticking my old woman\u2019s nose where it does not belong, that we could watch a movie together. Bret has loaned me his favorite: Dumb and Dumber. He says it will make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>The idea of Rosa watching Dumb and Dumber brought a smile. \u201cThank you, Rosa,\u201d he answered, touched by her thoughtfulness. \u201cBut not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something else wrong,\u201d she said slowly, eyeing him.</p><p>He tried to smile again. \u201cWhat else could be wrong? Love will reach my wife, won\u2019t it, Rosa? Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re always telling me, that love will wake her up? But it\u2019s been four weeks and still she\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not give up, please.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her for a long, desperate minute, then he said softly, \u201cI\u2019m falling apart.\u201d</p><p>It was true. His wife was hanging on to life by a strand as thin as a spider\u2019s web, and now suddenly it felt as if his whole life was hanging alongside her.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dr. Liam. You are the strongest man I have ever known.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel strong. In fact, he\u2019d never felt so close to breaking. He knew that if he stood here a moment longer, feeling Rosa\u2019s sympathy like a warm fire on a cold, cold night, he\u2019d ask the question: Did she ever love me, Rosa?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this now.\u201d He shoved past a chair, heard it squeaking and crashing across the floor. When he spun around, he found himself staring into the silvered plane of an antique mirror. The network of lines around his eyes had the ridged, shadowy look of felt-tipped etchings.</p><p>Laugh lines.</p><p>That\u2019s what Mike had called them. Only Liam couldn\u2019t now recall the last time he\u2019d laughed.</p><p>The image blurred and twisted before his eyes, until for a flashing second, it wasn\u2019t himself he saw. It was a younger man, blindingly handsome, with a smile that could sell a million movie tickets. \u201cI need to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pushed past her. \u201cNow,\u201d he said again, grabbing his coat off the hook on the wall. \u201cI need to see to my wife.\u201d</p><p>The emergency room was bustling with people tonight; the bright hallways echoed with voices and footsteps. Liam hurried to Mike\u2019s room.</p><p>She lay there like a broken princess in someone else\u2019s bed, her chest steadily rising and falling.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mike,\u201d he murmured, moving toward her. It was beyond him now, the simple routine he\u2019d constructed so carefully\u2014the potpourri, the pillows, the music.</p><p>He stared down at her.</p><p>She was still beautiful. Some days he could pretend that she was simply sleeping, that it was an ordinary morning, and any moment she\u2019d wake up and reach for him. Not tonight, however.</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with you the first second I saw you,\u201d he said, curling his hand around hers, feeling the warmth of her flesh. Even then, he\u2019d known she was running from something ... or someone. It was obvious. But what did he care? He knew what he wanted: Mikaela and Jacey and a new life in Last Bend. A love that would last forever. He hadn\u2019t known who she was\u2014who she\u2019d once been. How could he? He\u2019d never been one to read celebrity magazines, and even if he had, he would have read about Kayla True, a woman who meant nothing to him.</p><p>After Jacey had recovered from her surgery, Mike had begun to pull away from Liam. He\u2019d seen how tired she was, how frightened and worn out, and he\u2019d slipped in to stand beside her. Let me be your buffer against the wind, he\u2019d whispered. Let me keep you warm.</p><p>He\u2019d known why she reached for him, why she\u2019d crawled into his bed and let him kiss her. She\u2019d been a fragile, lonely little bird, and he\u2019d built her a nest. Over time she\u2019d learned to smile again. And every day that she stayed with him was a blessing.</p><p>He closed his eyes and culled memories, brushing some aside and savoring others. The first time he\u2019d kissed her, on a bright and sunny day at Angel Falls ... the way she snorted when she laughed really hard and cried at a good Hallmark commercial ... the day Bret had been born and they\u2019d put him in Liam\u2019s arms, and Mike had whispered softly that life was good. The day he\u2019d asked her to marry him ...</p><p>That was the one that hurt.</p><p>It had been the year Batman exploded across theater multiplexes and the Exxon Valdez crashed in Prince William Sound.</p><p>They\u2019d been at Angel Falls, stretched out on a blanket beside a still, green pool of water. There had been tears in her eyes when she told him she was pregnant.</p><p>He had known to tread carefully. It had been difficult, when all he wanted to do was throw back his head and laugh with joy, but he\u2019d touched her cheek and asked her quietly to marry him.</p><p>I\u2019ve been married before, she\u2019d answered, a single tear sliding down her pink cheek.</p><p>Okay. That\u2019s what he\u2019d said, all he\u2019d said.</p><p>It\u2019s important.</p><p>He\u2019d known that, of course.</p><p>I loved him with all my heart and soul, she\u2019d said. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll love him until I die.</p><p>I see.</p><p>But he\u2019d known that she was the one who could see. She\u2019d known she was breaking his heart. She turned and knelt beside him. There are things I can\u2019t tell you ... ever. Things I won\u2019t talk about.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t care about all that, did I, Mike? I was forty years old and I\u2019d seen things no human being should ever see.</p><p>\u201cUntil I met you, I had given up on love, did you know that? I had grown up in a great man\u2019s shadow; I knew that everyone I met compared me to the famous Ian Campbell, and beside him, I was an agate pushed up alongside a diamond.</p><p>\u201cThen I met you, and you\u2019d never really known my father. I thought at last I\u2019d found someone who wouldn\u2019t compare me all the time ... but you\u2019d already had a diamond, hadn\u2019t you, Mike? And I was still just an ordinary agate ...\u201d</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t told her any of this when he asked her to marry him, when she told him she\u2019d already found\u2014and lost\u2014the love of her life. All he\u2019d said was that he loved her, and that if she could return even a piece of his love, they\u2019d be happy.</p><p>He\u2019d known that she wanted it to be true, just as he\u2019d known she didn\u2019t completely believe it. I will never lie to you, Liam, and I\u2019ll never be unfaithful. I will be as good a wife as I can be.</p><p>I love you, Mike, he\u2019d said, watching her cry.</p><p>And I love you.</p><p>He\u2019d thought that over the years, she\u2019d learned to love him, but now he was seized by doubt. Maybe she cared for him. Only that.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me, Mike,\u201d he said, but even as he said the words, he heard the lie echoing within them. She couldn\u2019t have told him. She was right in that, at least. The knowing was unbearable.</p><p>She had loved him that much, anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI found the pillowcase, Mike,\u201d he said, leaning close. \u201cThe pictures ... the clippings. I know about ... him.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cI guess I know why you didn\u2019t tell me. But it hurts, Mike. Jesus, it hurts and I don\u2019t know what to do with all of it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cDid you ever love me, Mike? How can I go on without knowing the answer to that question?</p><p>\u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t even ask,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have seen it in your eyes, should have known somehow that you were always comparing me to someone else. God knows I had the experience to see it, so why didn\u2019t I? And how could I ever measure up to Julian True?\u201d</p> <p>She blinked.</p><p>Liam gasped, squeezing her hand so hard it should have crushed the fragile bones. \u201cMike ... can you hear me? Blink if you can hear me.\u201d With his other hand, he hit the nurses\u2019 button.</p><p>Within seconds, Sarah came bustling into the room, already out of breath. \u201cDr. Campbell, is she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe blinked.\u201d</p><p>Sarah came closer to the bed, studying Mike first, and then Liam.</p> <p>Mike lay perfectly still, her eyes sealed shut.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mike. Blink if you can hear me.\u201d</p><p>Sarah checked each machine, one by one, then she moved to stand by Liam. \u201cI think it was a reflex. Or maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my imagination, damn it. She blinked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should call for Dr. Penn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he said, without looking up.</p> <p>He let go of Mike\u2019s hand for just long enough to hit the play button on the tape recorder. Music swept into the room, songs from the Tapestry album by Carole King.</p><p>Liam held her hands again, both of them this time, talking to her, saying the same thing over and over again. He was still talking, begging, when Stephen came into the room, examined Mike, and then quietly left.</p><p>Liam talked until his throat was dry and there were no more pleas left inside of him. Then he slumped back down into the chair and bowed his head. Please God, help her.</p><p>But deep inside he knew. It hadn\u2019t been God who\u2019d helped Mikaela blink. It was a name, just that after all these weeks, just a simple name. When she heard it, she responded.</p><p>Julian True.</p><p>She is floating in a sea of gray and black ... there is the smell of something ... flowers ... a music she can almost recognize.</p><p>She longs to touch the music, but she has no arms ... no legs ... no eyes. All she can feel is the thudding beat of her heart. Fast, like a baby bird\u2019s, and she can taste the metallic edge of fear.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me.\u201d</p> <p>It is the voice she\u2019s come to know, soft and soothing, and she knows that somewhere, sometime, she knew it, but here there is no before, there is no now. There is just the dark, the fear, the helpless longing for something....</p><p>\u201cJulian.\u201d</p><p>Julian. The word seems to sink deep, deep inside her; it makes her heart beat faster, and she wants to reach for it, hold it against her chest.</p><p>Julian. In the black rubble of her life it is connected to another word, one she remembers.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>The next morning, Rosa was finishing the last of the breakfast dishes when the phone rang ... and rang ... and rang. Frowning, she went to the bottom of the stairs and yelled up for Dr. Liam to answer it.</p><p>In the other room, the answering machine clicked on, and Rosa was momentarily stunned to hear her daughter\u2019s voice. For a split second, she felt hope ... then she realized it was only the recorded message.</p><p>\u201cRosa? Are you there? Pick up the phone, damn it. It\u2019s me, Liam.\u201d</p><p>She threw the damp dishrag over her shoulder and raced back into the kitchen to answer. \u201cHola,\u201d she said, a little out of breath.</p><p>\u201cHave the kids left for school?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. Bret\u2019s bus just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Come to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Mikaela\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same. Just hurry.\u201d He paused, then said, \u201cPlease, Rosa. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am leaving.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even say good-bye before she heard the dial tone buzzing in her ear.</p><p>Rosa snagged her car keys from the hook near the phone and grabbed her purse.</p><p>Outside it was snowing lightly; not much, but enough to make an old woman like her drive slowly. All the way through town and out to the hospital, she tried to be hopeful. But Dr. Liam had sounded upset. He was such a strong, silent man that such emotion from him was frightening. He had remained steady through much bad news already.</p><p>She parked in one of the vacant visitor spots and reached for her coat. It was then that she realized she was still wearing the wet dishrag across her shoulder ... and that she hadn\u2019t braided her hair yet this morning. She would look like a demented scarecrow with all that snow-white hair flowing everywhere. A woman like her, old and unmarried, could not afford to look so bad.</p><p>As she crossed the parking lot, she braided her hair. Without a rubber band, it wouldn\u2019t stay, but it was better than nothing.</p><p>She hurried through the hospital. At the closed door to Mikaela\u2019s room, she paused and drew in a deep breath, offering a quick prayer to the Virgin, then she opened the door.</p><p>Everything looked the same. Mikaela lay in the bed, on her back this morning. A shaft of sunlight sneaked through the partially opened curtains and left a yellow streak on the linoleum floor.</p><p>Liam was sitting in the chair by the bed. He was wearing the same clothes from yesterday\u2014khaki pants and a black sweater. Only now the clothes were so wrinkled it looked like they\u2019d been stomped on. Shadows rimmed his tired eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou slept here last night,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cWhy\u2014\u201d The look in his eyes was so cold and unfamiliar that she bit her sentence in half. \u201cDr. Liam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian True.\u201d</p><p>Rosa gasped. She grabbed hold of the metal bed rail. If she hadn\u2019t held on to something, she would surely have fallen. Her legs felt like warming butter. \u201cPerd\u00f3n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I said his name.\u201d</p><p>She brought a trembling hand to her chest. \u201cWhy ...\u201d Her throat was dry as ashes; she couldn\u2019t force out another word. She let go of the bed rail and reached for the pitcher on the bedside table, pouring herself a glass of water. She drank it in three huge, unladylike gulps, then set the glass back down. At no time did she look at Liam. \u201cWhy do you say this name to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night, when I was looking for Mike\u2019s dress, I found a pillowcase hidden in the closet. It was filled with pictures and newspaper clippings ... and a huge diamond ring.\u201d He rose from the chair and moved toward her. \u201cI knew his name, of course, everyone does, but I didn\u2019t know he meant anything to me.\u201d</p><p>She forced a smile. \u201cY-You must have loved a woman before Mikaela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Sharon Stone.\u201d</p><p>At last she looked at him. \u201cForget this, Dr. Liam. It is old news. You knew she had been married before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatergate is old news, Rosa. This is something else\u2014and you know how I know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said his name to Mikaela. That\u2019s all, just his name, and she blinked. Now, it could mean nothing, but after all these weeks, it\u2019d be pretty damned coincidental, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe blinked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And just that quickly, she saw the anger leave her son-in-law\u2019s eyes. Without it, he looked old and tired and afraid.</p><p>\u201cAll this time,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to her, holding her hand, brushing her hair, and singing her love songs. Why? Because you made me believe that love would reach her. But it wasn\u2019t my love that reached her, Rosa. Or yours, either. It was just a man\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadre de Dios.\u201d She clutched the bed rail again and stared down at her sleeping daughter. \u201cMikita, are you hearing us, querida? Blink if you can.\u201d</p><p>Liam sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s hearing us. We\u2019ve just been saying the wrong things.\u201d</p><p>Rosa wanted to cover her ears. She didn\u2019t want to hear what Liam was going to say next, and yet she couldn\u2019t stop herself from asking the question. \u201cWhat is it you think we should be telling her?\u201d</p><p>Liam sidled in close beside her, so close she could feel the heat from his body. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not about our love for her. Maybe it\u2019s about her love ... for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to talk to her about Julian. Tell her everything you know about them. Remind her how much she loved him. Maybe that will help her come back to us.\u201d</p><p>She turned and gazed up at him. She could feel the way her mouth was trembling; it matched the shaking in her fingers, but she couldn\u2019t stop it. \u201cThat is very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, if she wakes up because of Julian ...\u201d He ran a hand through his shaggy hair and closed his eyes.</p><p>Rosa could only imagine how much this was hurting him, this good, good man who loved so deeply. She thought that if she listened closely enough, she would hear the sound of his heart breaking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her life,\u201d he said at last. \u201cWe have to do everything to reach her.\u201d</p><p>Rosa wished she could disagree. \u201cI will try this, to tell her who she used to be and who she used to love, but only if you remember always that she married you.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he was going to say something; in the end, he turned and walked to the window.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cY-You are not going to stay in the room for this, Dr. Liam? It will be most hurtful.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn around. His voice, when he found it, was low and scratchy, not his sound at all. \u201cI\u2019m staying. I think it\u2019s time I got to know the woman I love.\u201d</p><p>Rosa stood beside the bed, clasping the silver St. Christopher\u2019s medallion at her throat.</p><p>Slowly she closed her eyes.</p><p>For fifteen years, she had not allowed herself to remember those days. That\u2019s how she thought of them\u2014those days\u2014when he had breezed into their airless life and changed everything.</p><p>It was only now that she realized how close the memories had always been. Some things could never be forgotten, some people were the same.</p><p>She pulled up an image of Mikaela\u2014twenty-one years old, bright brown eyes, flowing black hair, a vibrant flower in a hot, desolate farming town where migrant workers lived eight to a room in shacks without indoor plumbing. A town where the line between the \u201cgood\u201d folks and the Mexicans was drawn in cement. And Mikaela\u2014a bastard half Mexican\u2014wasn\u2019t fully welcomed in either world.</p><p>It had been the full heat of summer, that day he came into their lives. Mikaela had just finished her second and final year at the local junior college. She\u2019d received an academic scholarship to Western Washington University in Bellingham, but Rosa had known that her daughter wanted something bigger.</p><p>Cambridge. Harvard. The Sorbonne. These were the schools that called to Mikaela, but they both knew that girls like her didn\u2019t make it to schools like that.</p><p>It was Rosa\u2019s fault that Mikaela had felt so alone as a young girl. For years, Mikaela waited for her father to acknowledge her in public. Then had come the dark, angry years when she hated him and his perfect, white-bread children. The years when she wrote trash about him in girls\u2019 bathrooms all over town, when she prayed to God that just once his blue-eyed, blond-haired cheerleader daughter would know how it felt to want. In time that phase had passed, too, and left Mikaela with a deeper loneliness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She dreamed of going someplace where she wouldn\u2019t be the Mexican waitress\u2019s bastard kid anymore. She used to say to Rosa that she was tired of staring through dirty windows at other people\u2019s lives.</p><p>They had been working in the diner, she and Mikaela, on the tail end of a slow, hot afternoon shift ...</p><p>\u201cMikita, if you wash that table any more, it will disappear.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela tossed the rag down. It landed with a squishy thwack on the speckled yellow Formica. \u201cYou know how Mr. Gruber likes his table clean, Mama, and he should be here any second for lunch. I\u2019ll get Joe to start his meatloaf sandwich\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Mikaela\u2019s words were drowned out by a loud, thundering noise, like the first rumble in an earthquake. Behind the counter, in the diner\u2019s small kitchen, Joe looked up from the grill. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d he growled, wiping the back of his hand across his mouth.</p><p>Mikaela raced to the picture window that looked out on Brownlow Street. It was high noon in the first week of July, and the storefronts all wore the crackled, faded look of exhaustion. It was too hot for anyone to be outside.</p><p>The sound came closer, grew louder. Out in the deserted street, dust swirled up in a thick brown cloud that grabbed hold of black-tipped leaves and swept them into eddies in the air.</p><p>Three silver helicopters hurtled above the rooflines like bullets against the blue sky, then dropped out of sight behind Bennet\u2019s Drug Store. An eerie silence fell, the windows stilled.</p><p>A limousine pushed through the dust storm like something out of a dream, sleek and black and impossibly shiny in this dirty heat. No car could get to Sunville that clean, not if it drove on the back roads from Yakima. The blackened windows captured the town\u2019s tired reflection and threw it back.</p> <p>Mikaela leaned forward, pressing closer to the glass. The orange polyester of her uniform stuck to her skin. Overhead, the wooden fan swirled slowly with a thwop-thwop-thwop that did little more than distribute the smell of burning bacon.</p><p>Three limousines pulled up in front of City Hall and parked. No one got out of the cars, and the engines kept running. Gray smoke seeped lazily from the tailpipes.</p><p>One by one, people came out of the stores and stood on the sidewalks, drawing together, speculating among themselves, pointing at the cars that in this town were as foreign and unexpected as spaceships.</p><p>Rosa and Mikaela crowded into the diner\u2019s narrow doorway.</p><p>The click of a lock silenced the crowd, then the doors opened, all of them at once, like huge, enameled beetles unfurling their wings. Strangers in black suits and sunglasses emerged from the cars, one after another. And then he appeared.</p><p>A shiver of recognition moved through the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s Julian True,\u201d someone whispered.</p><p>He stood with the casual, unaffected elegance of one who is used to the stares of strangers. Tall and lean, with long, sunstreaked hair that covered half his face, he looked like a rebellious angel cast down from the heavens. He wore a loose black pocket T-shirt and a pair of ragged Levi\u2019s that were tattered and ripped out at the knees. Whatever blue dye had once been woven into the denim had long ago bleached to a foamy white.</p><p>The crowd surged toward him, crying out. One sound, one name rose from the confusion.</p><p>Julian True ... It\u2019s him ... Julian True in Sunville.</p><p>Then came the requests: Here! Sign my shirt ... my notebook ... my napkin.</p><p>Rosa turned to whisper something to Mikaela, but the words caught in her throat. Her daughter looked ... mesmerized. Mikaela stepped back into the diner and glanced around. Rosa knew that her daughter was noticing the cracked floor, the broken light fixtures, the ever-present film of grease that coated everything. She was seeing the diner through this stranger\u2019s eyes, and she was ashamed.</p><p>Rosa moved away from the door and went back to work. Mikaela headed for the lunch counter and began refilling the sugar jars.</p><p>Suddenly the bell above the front door jingled, and he was standing there, in Joe\u2019s Get-It-While-It\u2019s-Hot diner, beneath the lazily whirring overhead fan.</p> <p>Mikaela dropped the half-empty sugar jars on the table. Her cheeks turned bright pink.</p><p>He gave Mikaela a smile the likes of which Rosa had never seen. It was the old clich\u00e9, sun erupting through the clouds. Eyes the color of shaved turquoise looked at Mikaela as if she were the only woman in the world.</p><p>\u201cC-Can I help you?\u201d</p><p>His smile held the tattered edge of exhaustion. \u201cWell, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said in that world-famous Texas drawl, as thick and sweet as corn syrup, \u201cwe\u2019ve been travelin\u2019 for hours over the shittiest patch of road I\u2019ve seen since I left Lubbock, and any minute that doorway\u2019s gonna fill up with every thirteen-year-old girl between here and Spokane. I was hopin\u2019 a pretty little thing like you could round me up a beer and a sandwich and show me where I could eat it in peace.\u201d</p><p>That had been the beginning.</p><p>Rosa opened her eyes. She could feel Liam behind her, hear his measured breathing, and she knew she\u2019d been quiet too long.</p><p>\u201cHola, Mikita,\u201d she said softly. \u201cMama estoy aqui.\u201d She took a deep breath and began. \u201cYou remember the first day you met him, querida, your Julian True?\u201d</p><p>Mikaela sucked in a sharp breath; her eyelids fluttered.</p><p>Rosa felt a rush of hope, as pure and clean and cold as springwater. \u201cWe were at the diner, both of us working the lunch shift. There was a noise, one like I had never heard before. Helicopters, in our little town. And then he appeared. Ah, the way he looked at you, as if you were the only woman in the world. Even I could feel the lure of him. He was like no one we had ever seen before ... like no one we would ever see again.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was too old to understand what you were thinking, my Mikaela, but I could see it in your eyes. You thought you were Cinderella, all covered with soot and dirt, and here ... here was a prince.</p><p>\u201cHe called you a pretty little thing, remember? Dios, I have never seen you smile so brightly. He started calling you Kayla almost from the start. Kayla of the midnight hair, that was his nickname for you, recuerdes? I hated that he would give you a gringa name and that you would take it ... but it did not matter what I thought, not once you had met him.</p><p>\u201cWhen he first kissed you, you told me it felt like you\u2019d jumped off a skyscraper. I said that such a fall could kill a girl. Remember your answer? You said, \u2018Ah, Mama, but sometimes it is worth it to fly.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Rosa leaned down and touched Mikaela\u2019s still, white face. \u201cI watched you fall in love with him, this man with the face of an angel. I knew there would be fireworks at the start of it\u2014how could it be otherwise? I knew, too, that there would be pain at the end of it. Enough to last a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cI told you that he was no good for you, but you laughed and told me not to worry. As if a mama could stop worrying so easily.\u201d</p><p>She let her fingertips linger on her daughter\u2019s cool, sunken cheek. \u201cYou thought I did not understand, but I was the only one who could.\u201d</p><p>Rosa gave her daughter a small, sad smile. \u201cYou promised that you would not make my mistake. But I knew, querida, I saw it in your eyes. You already had.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The pain of each new sentence was sharp and sudden, a rock thrown through a high glass window. Liam sat very still in his chair, trying to draw meaning out of every pause, trying to hear the story that wasn\u2019t being told as well.</p><p>It was no ordinary love that Mikaela had felt for Julian True. That came as no surprise. How could anything about that man be ordinary?</p><p>Diamonds and agates, once again.</p><p>He wondered why he had let Mikaela hold such secrets. It wasn\u2019t only Julian\u2019s identity; it was a hundred smaller things. The prom she hadn\u2019t gone to, the memories she hadn\u2019t shared. It was her. He\u2019d been content with so damned little. He\u2019d thought what mattered was that he loved her, that he made her smile and laugh again. Why had he never asked himself what fueled her dreams?</p><p>Probably, deep down, he\u2019d been afraid of her answer. And so, afraid of the truth, he\u2019d powered along in silence, comforted by the dull softness of words unspoken, questions unasked.</p><p>But what about now that he knew? He didn\u2019t know if he could believe in her love. Not now that he\u2019d seen what she was hiding. He didn\u2019t know if the feel of her body next to his would generate any heat.</p><p>Rosa turned around suddenly, and Liam realized that she had stopped talking. The room was deathly quiet now; the only noise was the steady drone of the monitors. \u201cShe has not blinked again, Dr. Liam.\u201d</p><p>He stood and crossed the short distance to the bed. This time, when he looked down at his wife, he saw a stranger. Kayla. He picked up her hand, held it gently. \u201cShe never told me any of this, Rosa. Why did I let her keep such secrets?\u201d</p><p>Rosa stood beside him, the snow-white cap of her head angled close to his shoulder. \u201cYou come from money,\u201d she said simply. \u201cYou are a doctor\u2014from Harvard. You cannot understand what life is like for people like us. Mikaela had such big dreams, but no way to make them come true. Even her own papa, he did not show her any love at all.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cI first came to Sunville to pick apples when I was a little girl. Mi padre, he died when I was eleven. Of a cold sore. There was no money to buy medicines, and no doctor to help him. I can still remember the pickers\u2019 camps\u2014especially when the air smells of ripe fruit. I can smell the tin-roofed shack with no indoor plumbing, where we lived, ten people in a room this size. I remember the feel of old mattresses, and the heat. This I remember most of all, the heat.</p><p>\u201cI found my way out with a man. He wasn\u2019t my man\u2014that was my great sin\u2014but I didn\u2019t care. I loved him. Madre de Dios, I loved him in the desperate way that women like me always love another woman\u2019s husband.\u201d She leaned over the bed rail and gazed down at Mikaela. \u201cI am afraid I taught my daughter that a woman will wait forever for the man she loves.\u201d</p><p>Liam could tell by the sad end note of Rosa\u2019s sentence that she was finished. She turned slightly and looked up at him again.</p><p>\u201cLo siento,\u201d she said awkwardly, smoothing the hair away from her face. \u201cI am sure this is more than you wish to know. Perhaps now you will think badly of me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Rosa, don\u2019t you think I know how it feels to love someone who belongs to another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe married you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and she stayed with me, and we built something. Over time I forgot ... things that I should have remembered. But I always knew, deep down, I knew. There was a part of Mike\u2019s heart that was off-limits to me. But I loved her so damned much, and Jacey, and then Bret. And she seemed happy. Maybe she even was, in a I-lost-it-all-and-this-is-what-I-have-left sort of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was more to her happiness than that. This I know.\u201d</p><p>Liam gazed down at his beautiful wife. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know her.\u201d</p><p>Rosa didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d He said her name without the usual tenderness. This time he spoke to her as if she were a stranger. \u201cEnough of this. Come back to us. You and I have a lot to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNada,\u201d Rosa said, wringing her hands together. \u201cMaybe we were wrong about the blinking. Maybe it was wishful thinking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBelieve me, I wish she\u2019d blinked when she heard my name.\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cJulian True. Julian True. Julian True.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking to her, Rosa. You left off when she fell in love with him.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThe rest of the story, it is filled with much pain for her. Maybe it will make the coma worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPain is a powerful stimulus. Maybe even stronger than love. We can\u2019t give up yet. Talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Rosa drew in a deep breath. It went against her every instinct to talk about these things\u2014especially in front of Dr. Liam. But then she thought about the blinking of her daughter\u2019s eyes. Such a little thing, maybe it meant nothing at all, but maybe ...</p><p>\u201cYou loved him so much, my Mikita. Loved him in the way that only young girls can. He swept you off your feet\u2014it wasn\u2019t hard, not when you ached so badly to fly. He took your heart and your virginity ... and then he left you.\u201d</p><p>Rosa brushed the hair from her daughter\u2019s forehead, letting her fingertips linger on the pale, cool flesh. \u201cI watched you wait for him, day after day, night after night. You stood at the diner\u2019s cloudy window, waiting for a car to drive up.\u201d</p><p>Rosa remembered those days in brutal detail. Every time she\u2019d looked in her daughter\u2019s eyes, she\u2019d seen the sallow reflection of her own past. She had known what would happen; slowly, before Mikaela knew to guard against it, she would begin to shrink. Already her daughter had begun to keep her head down when she walked, already she moved silently aside when someone came too close. Rose knew it would go on, the slow chipping away of self-confidence, until only a shadow of Mikaela was left. Rosa had seen all this too clearly, but she hadn\u2019t known how to stop it.</p> <p>She had tried to tell her. This pain, she\u2019d said, it will go away if you let it.</p><p>Mikaela had turned to her, letting her gaze travel slowly over Rosa\u2019s tightly braided hair, across the wrinkles at her mouth that were anything but laugh lines, down the stained polyester of her waitress uniform. Will it, Mama? Really?</p><p>\u201cWhen you asked me, I told you that it would go away, this love of yours, but we both knew it was a lie. I watched you fade into me, a little bit at a time. And then it happened. A milagro. He came back for you.\u201d</p><p>In later years, when Rosa looked back on it, she wondered how it was that there\u2019d been no warning of such a thing, no salt thrown in Mikaela\u2019s path for good luck, no sun breaking through the clouds. Rosa had been in the diner, loading dishes into the dishwasher\u2014Joe had already gone home and the place was closed for the night. Rosa was trying to keep her eyes open long enough to finish. She couldn\u2019t see Mikaela, but she could hear her in the dining room, pushing chairs into their places and stacking ashtrays.</p><p>Then she\u2019d heard something completely out of place. The clink-ka-ching of money falling into the jukebox. It was such an odd sound; no one much played the music at Joe\u2019s. There came the buzzing blur of the machine skimming through forty-fives, then the music started. The love theme from An Officer and a Gentleman.</p><p>Rosa had put her soggy rag aside and closed the dishwasher with her hip. She edged past the big gas stove. At the closed door, she stopped again, head tilted, listening. Slowly she pushed the door open a crack. At first all she saw was darkness. The lights were turned off. There was only the electric blue haze from the outdoor neon sign.</p> <p>Then she saw Julian, standing in the farthest corner of the room. Mikaela stood motionless in front of him.</p><p>Rosa knew then, as sure as she was standing there, in the diner that smelled of dreams left on a hot burner, that Mikaela would mortgage her soul for another day with him.</p><p>\u201cI could not believe it when he asked you to marry him, mi hija. I knew you had hitched your heart to a star\u2014or worse, the sun, and if you looked at it too long, you would be blinded. He took you out of Sunville and gave you the world. From that moment, you were someone who mattered.</p><p>\u201cYou were in every newspaper, on the television all the time; they turned you into a woman I\u2019d never seen before, this Kayla of the midnight hair. When I went to California for your wedding, it was like being on the moon\u2014people followed you everywhere. I wanted so badly to make your dress\u2014we had dreamed of it for many years. But, of course, that could not be ... not for Kayla.\u201d</p><p>Rosa\u2019s voice fell away. She turned to Liam. \u201cAfter that come the years I do not know about. She kept secrets from me, too. I read in the tabloid newspapers about Julian\u2019s drinking, about his other women, but Mikaela told me none of this. All I remember is when she called me\u2014it was the day after Jacey\u2019s first birthday party. She sounded tired and broken, my little girl, when she told me that it was over.\u201d Rosa sighed. \u201cMikaela was only twenty-three, but I heard in her voice that she was not young anymore. Loving Julian had broken something in her, and it was more than just her heart.\u201d</p><p>Liam made a sound, part sigh, part moan, and there was such a sadness in it ...</p><p>Rosa wished she were the kind of woman who could go to him, hold him in this moment that was tearing at his heart. \u201cI am sorry, Liam ...\u201d she said, curling her fingers around the bed rail so tightly her skin turned white.</p><p>He rose from the chair and went to the bed. \u201cHelp us, Mike,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us know you\u2019re still there. We all miss you\u2014me, Rosa, Jacey, Bret ... Julian.\u201d</p> <p>She sees something floating in the murky water. It\u2019s small and round and white. It bobs on the surface, peaking and sliding with the waves. The sound of the sea slapping against her body is so loud she can\u2019t hear anything else. Somewhere in the back of her mind drifts the thought that she should hear birds, seagulls or ducks, but the silence is endless and unbroken.</p><p>She knows that if she can relax, she can float on top of the water, and it can be peaceful. This she has learned in her months at sea.</p><p>Today she can smell cinnamon and pine trees\u2014familiar, comforting\u2014and now there is something else. She breathes deeply, and instead of the sea, she smells a woman\u2019s fragrance, one she can almost remember. She tries to concentrate on that, the concrete image of before, but the memory is unattached to anything.</p><p>\u201cHelpus,Mike. Letusknow you\u2019re stillthere.\u201d</p><p>The voice, familiar and unfamiliar at the same time, keeps asking questions she can\u2019t answer, in words she doesn\u2019t truly understand.</p><p>But then there is that one sound again.</p><p>\u201cJulian.\u201d</p><p>She tries desperately to extract a single perfect memory, just one, but the shallow, rocky soil of her mind gives up nothing.</p><p>If only she could open her eyes ...</p><p>\u201c... Miss you ...\u201d</p><p>These are words she understands, and they hurt. Miss. It is about being alone and afraid ... yes, she understands.</p><p>Please God, she prays, help me ...</p><p>She can\u2019t remember if there is supposed to be an answer to these words, but when there is none, she feels as if she is sinking into the turbulent water. She is too tired to keep herself up, and she is missing ... missing so much ...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crying. Jesus Christ.\u201d Liam reached for a tissue and gently wiped her eyes. \u201cMike, honey, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, but those terrible silver tears kept falling. A tiny gray patch appeared on the pillow. Liam punched the nurses\u2019 button and ran for the door. When he saw Sarah, he yelled for her to go get Dr. Penn.</p><p>Then he went back into the room and bent over his wife, stroking her damp cheeks, whispering the same words to her over and over again. \u201cCome on, baby, come on back to us.\u201d</p><p>Stephen Penn appeared in the doorway, out of breath. \u201cWhat is it, Liam?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at his friend. \u201cShe\u2019s crying, Steve.\u201d</p><p>Stephen went to the side of the bed and stared down at Mikaela. She was as still as death, her cheeks pale, but the trail of moisture glittered promiselike in the dim lighting. He produced a straight pin from his pocket. Gently lifting her bare foot in his palm, Stephen stuck the sharp tip in the tender flesh.</p><p>Mikaela jerked her foot back. A broken moan escaped her lips.</p><p>Stephen laid her foot down again and covered it back up with the blanket. Then he looked at Liam. \u201cThe coma\u2019s lightening. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean ...\u201d He paused. \u201cYou know what it does and doesn\u2019t mean. But maybe ... maybe something reached her. Whatever you\u2019re doing\u2014keep doing it.\u201d</p><p>It was way past bedtime when Bret heard the knock on his door. He was sitting on the floor of his bedroom, playing Diddy Kong racing on his Nintendo 64.</p><p>He thought he said, \u201cCome in,\u201d but he couldn\u2019t be sure, because he was concentrating on keeping Diddy on the track.</p><p>The door opened, and Dad poked his head in. \u201cHeya, Bretster.\u201d</p><p>Bret looked up, just long enough. His guy hit the wall and started a free-form tumble across the multicolored screen. \u201cHi, Dad. You wanna play?\u201d</p><p>Dad sat down beside him, picking up the second set of controls. \u201cYou know I\u2019m terrible at this. I like the Star Wars one better.\u201d</p><p>Bret giggled. He loved watching his dad play Diddy Kong, because he couldn\u2019t ever keep his guy on the track, and Bret always kicked his butt. He started up another game, and for the next half hour they raced.</p><p>Finally Dad tossed the controls down. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Mario. You win. I give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMario\u2019s a different game, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Dad climbed awkwardly to his feet, hanging on to the fender of Bret\u2019s bed, as if he was going to fall at any minute. \u201cCome on, kiddo. It\u2019s bedtime. Close up the game and get your fangs washed.\u201d</p><p>Bret turned off the television and hurried down the hall. In his bathroom, he brushed his teeth really good (Dad was famous for sending him back to do it again if he didn\u2019t do a good job) and peed. Then he went back into his room.</p><p>Dad was already in bed, stretched out under the covers, with a book open in his lap. The bedside lamp was on now.</p><p>Bret loved it when Daddy was in his bed. Then nothing seemed scary. He bounded over to the bed and started to get in.</p><p>\u201cHold it, pal. Put on your pajamas.\u201d</p><p>Bret made a face. \u201cAw, Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI know you. You\u2019ll sleep in those clothes and then get up and wear them to school again tomorrow. And hey, when was the last time you took a shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma made me take one yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But no jeans in bed.\u201d</p><p>Bret pulled off his dirty jeans and tossed them in a heap in the corner\u2014where he knew he\u2019d just pick \u2019em up tomorrow and put \u2019em back on for school. Then he crawled over his dad and got into bed, snuggling up close. \u201cIs that the lion book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>Bret curled up next to his dad and listened to the story. It calmed him down, listening to his dad\u2019s deep, steady voice.</p><p>It felt like only a few minutes later that Dad shut the book and set it on the table by the lamp.</p><p>Dad took him in his big, strong arms and held Bret tightly. \u201cI think you should visit Mommy. It\u2019s ... important now.\u201d</p><p>Dad had never said that before\u2014that it was important that Bret see her. All along, he\u2019d thought he didn\u2019t matter ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dad said quietly, \u201cIt\u2019s not a scary place. Just a plain old room with a plain old bed. I wouldn\u2019t lie to you, Bret. Your mom looks just like she used to ... only she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you let me see her in the beginning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth? Because of the bruises on her face. She didn\u2019t look very good, and the machines were scary. Now everything is fine. It won\u2019t scare you to see her, Bret. I promise. It might make you sad, might even make you cry, but sometimes when little boys are becoming big boys, they have to let themselves cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou swear she\u2019s alive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>Bret wanted to believe his dad.</p><p>\u201cShe needs to hear your voice, Bretster. I know she has been missing her favorite boy in the whole world.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Bret wondered if maybe he could wake her up. After all, he was her favorite boy and she loved him more than the whole world. She always told him that. Maybe all this time she\u2019d been waiting to hear him. \u201cI could sing to her,\u201d he said softly. \u201cMaybe that song from Annie ... Remember when she took me to see the show? That song, \u2018Tomorrow,\u2019 she always sang it to me when I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>His dad started to sing, very softly, \u201cThe sun\u2019ll come up ... tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBet your bottom dollar that tomorrow ...\u201d</p><p>Bret joined in and they sang the whole song together, and when it was over, he didn\u2019t feel so much like crying anymore. \u201cI could go see her tomorrow\u2014before school.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s voice was quiet now, a little shaky. \u201cThat\u2019d be great. Hey, you want to sleep in my bed tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>Together, hand in hand, they got out of bed and headed out of the room. All the time they were walking, Bret kept thinking about that song; it kept spinning through his head until he was smiling.</p> <p>The next morning, Bret got up early and took a shower\u2014without anyone even asking him to. He dressed carefully in his best clothes, a pair of black Levi\u2019s jeans and a plaid flannel shirt. Then he raced back into his dad\u2019s bedroom and stood by the bed.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d he said, poking him in the arm. \u201cDaddy, wake up.\u201d</p><p>Dad rolled onto his side and opened one eye. \u201cHey, Bretster,\u201d he said in a scratchy voice, \u201cwhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Dad gave him a smile. \u201cOkay, kiddo. Give me five minutes to get ready.\u201d</p><p>Bret moved nervously from one foot to the other. He hurried downstairs and turned on all the lights. He snagged his backpack from the mudroom floor and slung it over his back.</p><p>True to his word, Dad was down in five minutes, ready to go. They jumped into the Explorer and headed for town.</p><p>Bret bounced in his seat all the way to the hospital. Last night he\u2019d dreamed of his mommy for the first time. In his dream, she woke up when he gave her the Mommy Kiss. That\u2019s what she\u2019d been waiting for, all this time. The Mommy Kiss.</p> <p>At the hospital, he held Daddy\u2019s hand and dragged him down the hallway to her room. But at the closed door, Bret felt all of his confidence disappear. Suddenly he was afraid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bretster. Remember, it\u2019s okay to be sad. She\u2019ll understand that. Just talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Bret pushed through the door. The first thing he saw was the baby bed, with the silver side rails. Not a grown-up bed at all. There were no lights on; the room was painted in dull gray shadows.</p><p>And there was Mommy, lying in the bed. Slowly he moved toward her.</p><p>She looked pretty, not broken at all. He could imagine her waking up ... Just like that, she\u2019d sit up in bed, open her eyes, and see Bret.</p><p>How\u2019s my favorite boy in the world? she\u2019d say, opening her arms for a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to her, Bret.\u201d</p><p>He let go of his dad\u2019s hand and moved closer to the bed, climbing up the silver rails until he was leaning over his mom. Then, very slowly, he gave her the Mommy Kiss, exactly the way she always gave it to him. A kiss on the forehead, one on each cheek, then a butterfly kiss on the chin. At last he whispered, \u201cNo bad dreams,\u201d as he kissed the side of her nose.</p><p>She lay there, unmoving.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mommy, open your eyes. It\u2019s me. Bret.\u201d He took a deep breath and forced himself to sing, just like he\u2019d promised himself he\u2019d do. He sang \u201cTomorrow\u201d three times.</p><p>Still, nothing.</p><p>He slid off the bed and turned, looking up at his dad through a blur of tears. \u201cShe didn\u2019t wake up, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>His dad looked like he was going to cry. It scared Bret. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have to keep trying.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The measure of a man comes down to moments, spread out like dots of paint on the canvas of a life. Everything you were, everything you\u2019ll someday be, resides in the small, seemingly ordinary choices of everyday life. It starts early, this random procession of decisions. Should I try out for Little League, should I study for this test, should I wear this seat belt, should I take this drink?</p><p>Each decision seems as insignificant as a left turn on an unfamiliar road when you have no destination in mind. But the decisions accumulate until you realize one day that they\u2019ve made you the man that you are.</p><p>Liam had let himself be overshadowed by his father.</p><p>Decision.</p><p>He had gone all the way to Harvard, learned how many roads fanned out from where he stood ... and he\u2019d come home to Last Bend, where it was safe.</p><p>Decision.</p><p>He had fallen in love with Mikaela and settled his whole world on the creaky foundation of that emotion. He\u2019d known that their love was measured in unequal parts, but day by day, hour by hour, as their life together unfolded in a series of moments big and small\u2014birthdays, anniversaries, family vacations, nights spent huddled on the sofa, watching television\u2014he\u2019d let himself fall into the sweet narcotic pool of forgetfulness.</p><p>Decision.</p><p>Today he faced another crucial choice. He had been grappling with it ever since Mike first blinked. He had no doubt that the decision he made would lay the groundwork for the rest of his life.</p><p>He pushed back from his desk. There was a pile of charts and messages, all needing his immediate attention. He didn\u2019t care. Not now. Instead, he grabbed his down jacket, put it on, and walked out of his office. Just before the reception desk, Carol popped out of the X-ray room and bumped into him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Doctor!\u201d she said, giggling.</p><p>He smiled. It was the first normal moment they\u2019d had in weeks. \u201cI guess I should be glad you weren\u2019t carrying urine samples.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s giggle graduated to a laugh. \u201cOr scalpels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sneak out early,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Your mother-in-law called a few minutes ago. The elementary school lost electricity today, so they canceled classes. She said they\u2019d be up at the pond, skating, if you wanted to join them.\u201d Carol pushed the glasses higher up on her nose and squinted up at him.</p><p>Liam tensed, knowing too well what was coming.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>Liam hoped he didn\u2019t look as irritated as he felt. \u201cThe same.\u201d God, he hated those words. When this was all over, he\u2019d never say them again. Or I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>\u201cGive her my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Carol. Thanks.\u201d He did his best to smile as he strode through the empty waiting room. He had a flashing memory of Mikaela redecorating this small space. You can\u2019t expect your patients to sit on plastic ... and what\u2019s that wall color\u2014baby diarrhea brown?</p><p>Now the waiting room was a cheerful blend of primary colors\u2014yellow walls, complete with a sunflower mural painted by Mrs. Dreiling\u2019s second-grade class, bright cobalt blue overstuffed chairs, and a bold red Berber carpet.</p><p>He remembered Mike up on a ladder, her face and hair streaked with yellow paint, yelling down at him. Hey, piano man, are your hands too precious to hold a paintbrush? He\u2019d gone to her then, pulled her off of the ladder, and held her in his arms, kissing her soft lips ...</p><p>He strode out of the room.</p><p>Outside, the sudden plunge in temperature was exactly what Liam needed to clear his mind. He glanced down at his wristwatch: 1:38.</p><p>Suddenly he didn\u2019t want to go to the hospital and sit by his wife\u2019s bed. For three long days, he\u2019d been beside her, holding her hand, saying Julian\u2019s name over and over again. Not once had she responded in any way.</p><p>He flicked his wool-lined collar up and headed down the street. It was one of those moist winter days when the bloated, gray sky seemed to snag the rooftops and tangle in your hair. The mountains peaked above the mist, their snow-covered tips barely distinguishable from the clouds.</p><p>He ducked into the Bean There, Done That coffee shop and ordered a decaf latte. Irma made small talk as the milk whipped into a white froth, then didn\u2019t charge him for the drink. No amount of cajoling would get her to take his money. Finally he said thank you and went back outside.</p><p>Someone exited the Lazy Susan Bake Shop, and the scent of cinnamon wafted from the open doorway. He was tempted to get something for tomorrow\u2019s breakfast, but the thought of hearing \u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d and answering \u201cThe same\u201d was more than he could bear.</p><p>The sound of children\u2019s laughter rode high in the still, clean mountain air. He followed it to Mr. Robbin\u2019s llama farm. His frog pond, settled comfortably in a flat patch of the pasture, had been turned by Mother Nature into a beautiful silver skating rink. There were already several cars parked around the perimeter of the pond, so that when it turned dark, they could use their headlights to cast tubes of light across the ice. A boom box was on. Garth Brooks was belting out \u201cI\u2019ve got friends in low places.\u201d Suzie Sanman was stationed at the picnic table, heating pots of milk on a camp stove, and Mayor Comfort was roasting hot dogs over an open fire pit.</p><p>Liam could see Bret. He was skating with a bunch of his friends. Rosa was sitting on one of the benches near the pond, alone.</p><p>He greeted his friends and neighbors as he made his way through the crowd, pretending not to notice their surprise at seeing him here. Beside Rosa, he sat down. Wordlessly, she scooted sideways to make more room for him.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Daddy, look at me!\u201d Bret waved his arms. When Liam looked up, Bret began furiously skating backward\u2014until he ran smack into Sharie Lindley and they both fell down in a laughing heap.</p><p>\u201cLife goes on, eh, Rosa?\u201d Liam said softly, watching his son trying to master the skill of skating backward. Last winter that same boy had barely been able to skate forward.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>He curled his hands around the paper coffee cup; the moist heat felt good against his lips. He hadn\u2019t even realized how cold he was until he started to warm up. But then, maybe that pretty much summed up all of his life experiences. \u201cShe is not doing well, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. Yo s\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking to her for days now. I\u2019ve said Julian\u2019s name to her so many times, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll accidentally say it at dinner. I thought maybe Bret would be the key, but he\u2019s visited every day after school, and ... nothing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe needs a little more time, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime isn\u2019t her friend right now.

I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>His pager went off, bleating from its place on his belt. He threw a quick, worried glance at Rosa, then reached down and pulled out the small black unit.</p><p>It was an emergency message from Stephen Penn. Nine-one-one. The code for call immediately.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Mike.\u201d</p><p>Rosa shoved her keys at him. \u201cTake my car. It is right there.\u201d</p><p>He snatched the keys. \u201cMy car\u2019s in the office lot. The keys are in the visor. Get Bret and Jacey and get to the hospital. This could be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCardiac arrest.\u201d</p> <p>Liam slumped in his chair. He barely had the strength to lift his chin.</p><p>Stephen didn\u2019t look away. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, Liam. Her heart just stopped. We got it going again in no time, but it could be an indicator. Her body may be giving out. I think ... I think it might be time to prepare yourself and the kids for the end.\u201d</p><p>The End. He wished he\u2019d never said that to a patient of his, but he knew that he had.</p><p>Stephen sighed. \u201cIt looked like she was getting better there for a few days.\u201d</p><p>Liam knew that Stephen was thinking of his own wife, Margaret, who was probably at home right now making snowmen with the kids. He could see it in his friend\u2019s eyes, the terrible understanding of what it would mean to lose the woman you loved. \u201cHow do you tell a nine-year-old that it\u2019s time to say good-bye to Mommy? And what if you don\u2019t tell him\u2014how in God\u2019s name do you tell him tomorrow that it\u2019s too late to say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lee.\u201d Stephen leaned forward, planted his forearms on the desk.</p> <p>Liam could see that Stephen was searching for words that would honestly give comfort, rather than the standard platitudes. He saw, too, when Steve came up empty. Of course he would. This was a time for faith, for God and religion; science was hopelessly inadequate.</p><p>Before Stephen could say anything, Liam got to his feet and made his way out of the office.</p><p>The corridor was too bright; light stung his glazed eyes. In the waiting room, Jacey stood at the window with Mark beside her. Rosa sat perched on the very edge of the sofa. Bret\u2014still in his skating coat and Gore-Tex bib overalls\u2014stood pressed against the wall by the television. His little cheeks were candy-apple red. Water dripped from the frozen shelf of his bangs, plopping onto his upturned nose.</p><p>When Jacey saw Liam, she let go of Mark\u2019s hand and took a cautious step toward him. \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell them. Not here at least, not beneath these cold strips of fluorescent lighting. He\u2019d tell the kids the truth tomorrow. Maybe he would find a miracle between now and then. And if Mikaela didn\u2019t make it through the night ... he\u2019d live with his decision. It would become another of the many choices that formed the boundary of his soul.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at Rosa as he spoke. \u201cShe\u2019s okay. Mom\u2019s okay. She had a little trouble with her heart, is all. It skipped a few beats, but everything is okay now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d Jacey asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, but only for a minute or two. Ironically, she needs her rest.\u201d</p> <p>Jacey nodded and headed for the door. As she passed Liam, he reached out and grabbed her wrist. She stopped and turned to him.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look too good, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>Jacey paled. \u201cOkay, Dad. I-I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He forced a smile and let her go. What else could he do? She was old enough to find her own way along this desperate path.</p><p>Bret looked up at him. A drop of water snaked down his cheek and landed on his navy ski coat. His mouth trembled uncertainly and tears puddled in his eyes. \u201cIs she awake?\u201d</p><p>Liam touched his son\u2019s cold, cold cheek. \u201cNo, honey, she\u2019s not.\u201d He fought the urge to say not yet; he couldn\u2019t throw out hope as if it were penny candy. Not anymore.</p><p>Bret backed into the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna see her right now. Not ... like that.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bretster,\u201d Mark said, moving toward them. \u201cI promised to get you an orange soda and some Gummi Bears. How about now?\u201d</p><p>Bret\u2019s face broke into a relieved smile. \u201cThat\u2019d be great. Can I, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Liam felt like a coward for taking the easy road, but he nodded. There was no use pretending he wasn\u2019t relieved. He got to his feet, reached into his pocket, and pulled out a couple of dollar bills. \u201cHere you go, but don\u2019t be too long. We\u2019ve got to get home.\u201d</p><p>Bret snagged the money and fisted it. \u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d Then he followed Mark out of the room.</p><p>At last Liam turned to Rosa. He could tell by the wary look in her dark eyes that she had been waiting for this moment.</p><p>She sat stiff as a fence post, her knees pressed together, her hands coiled in a ball in her lap. \u201cIt is bad, s\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>He sat down beside her on the hard vinyl sofa. His bent knees cracked into the Formica coffee table. An old, dog-earred issue of People magazine slithered fanlike to the floor. Liam took a moment, trying to formulate his thoughts into words. In the end he said simply, \u201cHer heart stopped.\u201d</p><p>Rosa drew in a sharp breath and crossed herself. \u201cDios mio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey revived her easily\u2014and quickly, which is important\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be something you can do. Some medicine\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sad smile. \u201cFaith in medicine, Rosa?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t smile back. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known they\u2019d circle around to this question, which was, after all, the beginning. \u201cThe only moment of hope in this whole damned mess came when we said Julian\u2019s name.\u201d He was surprised that his voice sounded so ordinary.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. Perhaps it is coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, maybe. Twice\u2014no way. The crying was a response. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we have said his name many times. I have told her the story of her marriage to that man so often I could say it in my sleep. Still, there is nada.\u201d</p><p>Liam sighed. These were the issues that had kept him up all last night, tossing and turning sleeplessly in his lonely bed. They had followed him into the light, plaguing him all day.</p><p>The measure of a man. That was what it came down to. At least that was the cul-de-sac at the end of his thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to try something else, Rosa. Something a little more extreme. She\u2019s not responding to our voices. And I don\u2019t think we have a lot of time.\u201d</p><p>He felt Rosa turn toward him, but he didn\u2019t look at her. He stared instead at the hands in his lap, at the small gold wedding band he\u2019d worn for ten years.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He heard the worry in her voice, the tiny, halting hitch in the middle of the sentence, and he knew that she knew what he was going to say. \u201cI\u2019m going to call Julian True and ask him to come see her. Talk to her.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou cannot!\u201d</p><p>He turned to her finally. Her cheeks were paper white; her dark eyes looked like burn holes in a sheet. \u201cYou know I have no choice.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. It was a brittle sound like the breaking of an antique glass Christmas ornament. \u201cHe is ... dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he was physically violent to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Of course not. The danger is in how much she loves\u2014loved him.\u201d</p><p>Liam pretended not to be wounded by her mistake. \u201cDo you think he still loves her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never did, I think.\u201d She twisted around so they were face-to-face. \u201cYou do not have to do this. God will waken Mikaela if that is His plan. You need to take care of su familia. That man, he could ruin everything. Mikaela made her choice a long time ago. You do not have to do this, Liam.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if she realized that she\u2019d used his name. Strangely, that little intimacy comforted him as no touch ever could. \u201cYou and I, Rosa, we\u2019re not kids. We know how easy it is to do the wrong thing. This is probably the clearest moment I\u2019ve had in all my fifty years. I can call Julian and give my wife a chance at life. Or I can not call Julian and know that I was so afraid of losing Mikaela\u2019s love that I let her die.\u201d</p><p>Rosa\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to look myself\u2014or my children\u2014in the eye if I let fear keep me from doing what\u2019s right. I am going to call Julian True. There\u2019s a phone number for his agent in the pillowcase.\u201d</p><p>Rosa reached out, placed her hands on top of his. \u201cDoes she know, I wonder?\u201d she said softly, gazing at him through watery eyes. \u201cDoes my Mikita know how lucky she is to have you?\u201d</p><p>Liam knew he shouldn\u2019t ask it, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cDid she love me, Rosa?\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hands. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she loved him?\u201d</p><p>Rosa paused, and in that heartbeat\u2019s hesitation, Liam saw the harrowing truth. \u201cS\u00ed,\u201d she answered with a smile that was too bright, too fast.</p><p>Liam sighed. \u201cThen I guess we have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Part Three</p><p>The fate of love is that it always seems too little or too much.\u2014AMELIA BARR, \u201cTHE BELLE OF BOWLING GREEN\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Beverly Hills. Two words, each unremarkable enough on its own, but like champagne and caviar, they combined to form the ultimate expression of the good life. In this pastel pocket of Los Angeles, everything was about fantasy; stardust from nearby Hollywood gilded even the mundane. Images of Beverly Hills were famous around the world: pink hotels with poolside phones, valet parking at the post offices, restaurant tables that couldn\u2019t be bought for any amount of money\u2014ah, but a whisper of fame could get you seated in an instant. It was a city where last names were unnecessary among the chosen few. Harrison. Goldie. Brad. Julian.</p><p>Even in the rarefied perfection of this most trimmed and tucked and glamorized of cities, Julian True was special. Not just a star, but a superstar, a nova who showed no sign of burning out.</p><p>He\u2019d come to Hollywood like thousands of young men before him, with nothing more than a handsome face and a dream. He\u2019d wanted to be someone who mattered, and he knew it would happen. Things had always come easily to him\u2014attention, women, invitations, everything\u2014and he took what came easily.</p><p>Today he was flying high. That was the thing he loved most about fame: It gave a man wings. He eased off the accelerator. The Ferrari responded instantly, slowing down. He pulled up in front of a notoriously trendy new restaurant. Before he\u2019d even reached for the door handle, a valet was there.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. True,\u201d said the boy\u2014no doubt an actor.</p><p>Julian flashed him a smile. \u201cThanks, kid.\u201d Without a backward glance, he headed for the front door, which also opened automatically at his arrival. \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. True.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 was already there, smiling broadly. \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. True. She is already at your table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jean Paul. When the bill comes, add fifty bucks apiece for the valet and doorman, and a hundred for yourself. People magazine can afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerci.\u201d</p><p>Julian followed Jean Paul to the table. He knew he was late, not that it mattered. People\u2014especially reporters\u2014were used to waiting for him.</p> <p>He paused, looking around, searching for famous faces, power brokers, studio heads.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was that damn hinterland of time, after lunch but well before dinner. The place was almost deserted.</p><p>Too bad.</p><p>He was in the mood for a little schmoozing. Hell, he deserved it. Today\u2019s screening of his new film, The Bad Boys of C Company, had gone better than he\u2019d hoped. Better than anyone had hoped. Julian had earned his twenty million. He\u2019d given the studio a surefire hit.</p><p>A hit. Two of the sweetest words possible.</p> <p>He saw the reporter from People magazine\u2014a woman (good), sitting at the restaurant\u2019s best table. Clearly she\u2019d told the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 that she was here to meet Julian.</p><p>He moved easily through the restaurant, hearing the few scattered whispers of recognition. At the table, he stopped, \u201cHeya, Sara Sandler.\u201d</p><p>She stopped breathing, then started again, all at once, like a newborn baby. Color fanned up her cheeks. \u201cHi, Mr. True,\u201d she answered, making a clear attempt to compose herself. She tucked in a few flyaway hairs, resettled her eyeglasses. \u201cThanks for meeting me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her The Smile. \u201cCall me Julian,\u201d he said, settling down into the seat across from her. He stretched out one leg, plunking his booted foot on the settee beside her hip. He ran a hand through his shoulder-length hair and lit up a cigarette, watching her through a haze of smoke. \u201cSo, Sara, what is America dying to know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-Do you remind ... mind if I record this?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201c\u2019Course not, darlin\u2019. But I\u2019d appreciate it if you wouldn\u2019t mention the smoking. It used to be smokers were sexy and dangerous, but in the puritanical nineties, we just look stupid. Like we don\u2019t have the self-control to quit a habit that has killed millions.\u201d The smile he gave her was slow and intimate, designed to disarm. He\u2019d learned a long time ago how to hook a woman and reel her in. It came as easily now as breathing. \u201cDid you get a chance to see Boys?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was wonderful.\u201d She leaned forward, all schoolgirl earnestness.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thanks. That really means something to me.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to tamp down a smile and reached into her briefcase, pulling out some papers and a notebook and pen. Then she took a deep breath and glanced up at him. \u201cSo, when did you know you wanted to be an actor?\u201d</p><p>He laughed easily. It was a familiar question, one he answered all the time. This interview would be a breeze. He leaned toward her, gave her a conspiratorial look. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret, Sara. I never wanted to be an actor. Acting\u2014that\u2019s a verb. It implies work. Actors spend the better part of their lives skulking around Broadway, learning their craft, and eating macaroni-and-cheese out of a box. But a movie star ...\u201d He settled back into the settee, gazing at her as if she were the most beautiful woman in the world. \u201cAh, now that\u2019s a different thing entirely. Lightning in a jar. Fame is the greatest drug in the world. Everybody wants to be your friend. That\u2019s what I wanted to be. I knew it the first time I saw how a star was treated.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to like that answer. \u201cBut you\u2019re a great actor. All the reviewers say so.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, took a long drag off his cigarette, exhaled slowly. \u201cI know what I am, darlin\u2019, and it ain\u2019t an actor. But you\u2019re sweet as hell to say so.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her notes. \u201cIs Julian True your real name?\u201d</p><p>Another familiar question. He gave her another Hollywood smile. \u201cNothing up on that movie screen is real, Sara,\u201d he said softly, using her name again to seduce her. \u201cAnd at the same time it\u2019s as real as life. Everything I am, everything I\u2019ve ever been is up there in Technicolor, forty feet wide. Nothing that came before matters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice way of saying \u2018No comment.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>She wrote something down, then looked back up at him. \u201cWhat about love\u2014does that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been married four times. I\u2019d say it matters to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd divorced four times,\u201d she responded, maintaining a steady gaze.</p><p>The question rolled off him like warm water. \u201cI\u2019m an incurable romantic, I guess. Just haven\u2019t found the right woman. Maybe she\u2019ll be reading this article. Now, what do you say we talk about my movie? We can get back to all this personal stuff later on ... maybe over drinks?\u201d He smiled, knowing there would be no later, no cozy pair of cocktails. The truth was, he didn\u2019t have much to say about real life. It wasn\u2019t the world he lived in.</p><p>Julian sped down a residential street, going much too fast. As he approached the imposing entrance to Bel Air, he saw a couple standing on the side of the street.</p><p>The woman gasped, pointed. \u201cOh, my God, Sidney, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Julian flashed the lady his trademark grin, then hit the gas, following the winding, stop-and-go traffic into Century City. There, he pulled up in front of a grand high-rise building and parked at a metered spot.</p><p>A doorman rushed out, held the door open. \u201cGood evening, Mr. True.\u201d</p><p>Julian patted his pocket, found it empty. Damn. He was so used to other people picking up the tab, he regularly left his wallet at home. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money with me, kid. I\u2019ll tell Val to tip you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-Sure, Mr. True ... and thank you.\u201d</p><p>Julian followed the doorman through the ornate marble-paneled lobby and into the elevator.</p><p>At the penthouse, the doors opened. Julian\u2019s agent, Val Lightner, lounged in the open doorway of his condo.</p><p>No doubt he was waiting for his most famous client, waiting to pop the champagne.</p><p>\u201cHey, Juli,\u201d Val said, lifting his martini glass in a salute that upset his precarious balance. He staggered against the door frame. \u201cHow\u2019d the interview go? I heard they sent you a baby reporter who couldn\u2019t talk for an hour after she got back to the office.\u201d</p><p>Julian grinned. \u201cI think she wants to bear my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phones have been ringing off the hook since the screening. If you were any hotter, you\u2019d need asbestos underwear.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been friends forever, Julian and Val; they were cut from the same cloth. Val had made his bones in this business a long time ago, with the world-famous Angel DeMarco, an actor who, for years, had been called the young Robert De Niro, and who\u2014at the peak of his game\u2014had walked away from it all, creating in absentia a legend greater than anything he could have accomplished on screen. Val had wielded the power of Angel DeMarco to create a world-class career for Julian True.</p><p>Val grinned lazily and pushed a long, cornsilk-blond lock of hair away from his face. \u201cCome on in, superstar. There\u2019s a babe with your name on her.\u201d</p><p>Julian followed Val into the condo, where a raucous party was in full swing. Movie stars mingled with wanna-bes; you could tell them apart by the eyes. The stars looked confident; the wanna-bes looked desperate, starvelings standing at a banquet table where they\u2019d never be fed.</p><p>The place had the tasteful decor of a fraternity house. No paintings, no knickknacks, no rugs. Val had bought the unit, picked a few things to sit on, and called it home. But then, Val didn\u2019t need to decorate. In this town, failure to do what you could easily afford had a cachet all its own.</p><p>\u201cI need a drink,\u201d Julian said to no one in particular, and within seconds someone handed him a drink. It didn\u2019t matter what was in the glass, as long as it had a kick. He downed it and glided into the room. He knew that every pair of eyes was on him. The men wanted to be him and the women wanted to sleep with him. And why not? He was on top of the world. There was no perfume like success. He moved through the crowd, laughing and talking, his gaze constantly searching the room.</p><p>He saw her on the sofa in the living room, a stunning blonde in a barely-there white dress. Perfect. He strode over and sat down beside her.</p><p>His hand slid familiarly along her thigh, and damn, she felt good. \u201cHiya, darlin\u2019. You\u2019re the most beautiful woman in the room, but I guess you know that.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, and at the movement, her grapefruit breasts\u2014the best that money could buy\u2014threatened to pop out of her plunging neckline.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Margot,\u201d she purred. \u201cMargot LaMere. You like that name? Val made it up for me.\u201d She sniffed and rubbed her runny, pink-tipped nose, then she leaned forward and grabbed her drink so fast that amber liquid sloshed over the rim and splashed on her dress. \u201cI got great reviews in my high-school production of Our Town.\u201d</p><p>Julian felt an unexpected\u2014and unwelcome\u2014flash of pity for the girl. There were so many women like her in Los Angeles.</p><p>When he looked closely, he saw that she wasn\u2019t that pretty. Her hair had been bleached so many times it looked like straw, and she was dangerously thin. Her collarbone stood out in mountainous relief against her tanned, sunken flesh. And beneath a dozen layers of mascara, her brown eyes held a lifetime\u2019s desperation. Girls like her landed in Hollyweird every day, butterflies in search of fame\u2019s golden flower. In a few years\u2019 time, she\u2019d probably be broke and alone and strung out on designer drugs.</p><p>It was not the sort of reality Julian liked to consider. He yanked his hand back and lurched to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, babe.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, and in the heaviness of her breath, he heard that she\u2019d understood. He wouldn\u2019t be coming back.</p><p>He turned away from her and made his way through the crowd, past a couple having sex in the hallway.</p><p>He found Val in the bedroom, snorting a line of coke off the table by the bed. There was a woman beside him, wearing nothing but a pair of lacy red panties.</p><p>Val turned, grinning sleepily. \u201cHey, Jules, say hi to May Sharona. She wanted to talk to you about a part in\u2014\u201d He cupped the woman\u2019s perfect right breast in his hand. \u201cWhat movie were you interested in, doll?\u201d</p><p>The woman was talking now. Julian could see her painted lips moving, but he didn\u2019t listen. He\u2019d heard it all before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to another party. This one\u2019s dead.\u201d Julian realized a second too late that he\u2019d just stomped all over the woman\u2019s litany of dreams.</p><p>Val didn\u2019t seem to notice that May Sharona\u2014what a name\u2014had turned beet red and seemed to be gasping for air. He angled up to a swaying sit. \u201cWhassa matter? I have more coke in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? No?\u201d Val untangled himself from the woman and grabbed his martini glass from the end table. He sauntered unsteadily across the room. Looping an arm around Julian, he kind of hung there, swaying, smiling up through a fringe of blond hair. \u201cHey, before you go, I gotta message for you. Someone called the office, looking for you. A doctor. He said he needed to talk to you about Mikaela Luna. How\u2019s that for a blast from the past?\u201d He lifted the martini glass to his lips and took a long, dribbling swallow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Val frowned, as if he\u2019d already forgotten what they were talking about.</p><p>\u201cA doctor. Jesus, is she hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. He just wanted you to call him.\u201d</p> <p>Julian felt a strange fluttering in his chest. Kayla. Of all the women he\u2019d known, he\u2019d loved her the most. \u201cWhere\u2019s the number?\u201d</p><p>Val waved a hand and almost fell over. \u201cI told Susan to leave it on your answering machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Julian answered, distracted by a sudden onslaught of memories. His first love. Kayla. He hadn\u2019t heard from her in so long he\u2019d almost forgotten her. Almost.</p><p>Val slid away from Julian and headed for the bed, collapsing in a heap on the edge. \u201cIt\u2019d sure be something to find her. The missing Mrs. True. The press loved her.\u201d He paused, looked blearily at Julian. \u201cAnd so did you.\u201d</p><p>At the gates to his home, Julian spoke into a small black intercom. Immediately the intricately wrought gates parted, revealing a short driveway that led to a sprawling Spanish bungalow. At least that\u2019s what the designer had called it. Five families could live here, and still, in this neck of the woods, it was a bungalow.</p> <p>Julian had lived here for ten years, two of those with Priscilla-of-the-dessert, four with Dorothea-the-bitch, and one with Anastasia. None with Kayla.</p><p>Not one of his wives had added anything to the interior of the house, not a photograph or a lamp or a painting. They had each come here with nothing, added nothing, and left with a few million dollars of Julian\u2019s money. He supposed it was indicative of his problem. He cared more about this home than about the women he\u2019d married and brought here to live.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t quite right. It wasn\u2019t a home. It was a house that wanted to be a home. He had never had time for a home.</p><p>Julian walked up the flagstone path. Bushy green trees in huge terra-cotta pots flanked the way, releasing\u2014even at this dozing season of the year\u2014a soft, citrusy scent. Spotlights cast golden, latticed shadows along the path. A riot of late-blooming pink bougainvillea arched above the front entrance. A dozen Japanese-style ceramic lanterns lit the path.</p><p>The door opened and Julian\u2019s housekeeper, Teresa, stood in the doorway. As always, her uniform was as starched and white as a brand-new sail, and not a single gray hair was out of place. \u201cBuenos noches, Se\u00f1or True. How did the movie go?\u201d</p><p>Julian was too distracted to smile. \u201cAnother hit.\u201d Frowning, he moved past Teresa into the cool, airy house. It was a place of sharp contrasts\u2014white stucco walls and dark walnut trim, white denim-covered, oversized chairs and dark, heavily carved wooden tables. The floor throughout was tile, huge terra-cotta squares and rectangles that forgave any spill.</p> <p>In the spotless kitchen, he poured two shots of tequila into a Waterford tumbler and downed it, without bothering to reach for salt or a lime. Tucking the bottle under his arm, he began his search. Somewhere in this house there had to be a picture of Kayla. He went from room to room, lifting every photograph, until he found what he was looking for. There, tucked in the back of the music room, on a bookshelf too high to reach, he found a framed picture of her.</p><p>He dropped slowly to his knees on the thick Aubusson carpet, staring at the photograph. It was their wedding picture.</p><p>There had not been a photograph like this taken of Julian in many years. Now, he knew he looked handsome\u2014better looking at forty than he\u2019d been at twenty-four\u2014but there was something more in this shot. He realized with a shock what it was: honesty. Here, in this picture, was the last true glimmer of the man Julian had once wanted to be.</p><p>He closed his eyes, remembering her. They had been on their honeymoon, on that yacht in the Caribbean ...</p><p>\u201cTell me your real name,\u201d she\u2019d whispered, smiling.</p><p>He\u2019d grinned, but it was the Hollywood smile, and he\u2019d known that it hurt her. \u201cNope, I don\u2019t tell anyone that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. Someday ... when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d touched her face, brushed the flyaway hair from her eyes. \u201cThat boy is dead, Kay. He isn\u2019t coming back. I like being Julian True. It\u2019s who I want to be for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see, Jules? You could be anyone, anywhere, and I\u2019d love you till I die.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d opened his eyes and stared down at the photograph.</p><p>She had loved him like no one else ever had, before or since. Loved him, not the one-dimensional celluloid image of a man that was Julian True. She had said often that when Julian cut himself, she bled. Even in the blurred afterglow of a life half lived and fifteen years gone by, he knew that he was right in that one belief. She had loved him.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Liam sat at his desk. He didn\u2019t bother to turn on any of the lights, or to leaven the silence by playing one of the CDs stacked by the stereo.</p><p>The intercom buzzed. Carol\u2019s staticky voice came through the small black box. \u201cDoctor? Are you in there?\u201d</p><p>He pressed the button. \u201cI\u2019m here, Carol. You can go ahead and go home. We\u2019re done for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe this, Doctor. There\u2019s a man on the phone who says he\u2019s Julian True.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s the real\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatch him through, Carol, and go on home. We\u2019re done for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>The red light on line one started flashing. Liam took a deep breath, stabbed the button, and picked up the phone. \u201cThis is Dr. Campbell.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause at the other end, then: \u201cDr. Liam Campbell?\u201d</p><p>Even through the impersonal medium of the phone lines, Liam would have recognized the voice. \u201cThis is he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Julian True. You left a message with my agent, Val Lightner, regarding Mikaela Luna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. How bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a coma.\u201d</p><p>Another pause crackled through the lines, and Liam realized that Julian was on a car phone. \u201cA coma. Jesus ... What can I do? I\u2019ll pay for her hospital bills, and for the best doctors in the country\u2014not to say that you\u2019re not great, Dr. Campbell, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need your money, Mr. True. I called you because ... well, she shows some response to your name. I ... we thought that maybe if she heard your voice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019ll wake up for me?\u201d</p><p>Liam was unprepared for the pain that came with that simple question. \u201cWe think there\u2019s a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an interview this afternoon, but I can be there tomorrow. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the Ian Campbell Medical Center in Last Bend, Washington. About sixty miles east of Bellingham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get Antoinette to set me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you get to the medical center, ask for me. I\u2019ll be in my office there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Liam waited for Julian to end the conversation, but he just hung on the line, breathing, not saying anything. Finally Liam said, \u201cIs there something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Uh ... how does she look? I mean, I need to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>It was a perfectly human question, nothing wrong with it, so why did Liam feel suddenly angry? His answer was barely audible along the crackling line. \u201cShe looks as beautiful as you probably remember.\u201d</p><p>Val\u2019s office was a huge, open space tucked into the northeastern corner of a high-rise on Wilshire Boulevard. Huge glass windows paneled the corner, capturing a vista of other tall buildings. Behind them lay a filmy layer of brown smog.</p><p>A few sleek chairs were gathered around a glass coffee table. Movie posters and theater announcements graced the walls, each one representing a client. A huge television, flanked by fifteen smaller screens, dominated one corner. Currently a music video pulsed on every screen.</p><p>Val\u2019s desk was an immense, rectangular sheet of green glass. He was slouched over in his chair, holding his head in his hands.</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t need to be told to keep his voice down. He\u2019d partied with Val enough over the years to know when his best friend was nursing an ugly hangover. He crossed the room and sat down in the cushiony black leather chair opposite the desk.</p><p>\u201cQuieter,\u201d Val moaned.</p><p>\u201cLook, Val, I know you feel like four kinds of shit, but I really need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhisper, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called that doctor in Podunk, Washington. It was about Kayla. She\u2019s had an accident. She\u2019s in a coma.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Val lifted his head. His eyes were puffy and bloodshot. \u201cSo, what, they need money for her hospital bills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The doc said she responded to my name. They seem to think it would help if I talked to her.\u201d</p><p>Val ran a hand through his hair. The greasy blond locks fell right back in front of his ashen face. A slow-growing smile plucked one corner of Val\u2019s mouth. Julian recognized the look: It was Val\u2019s we-can-make-money-here look. \u201cIt\u2019s like one of those chick fairy tales. A kiss of true love to wake her up\u2014get it? True love wakes her up. Now, there\u2019s a hell of a headline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious, Val. She\u2019s pretty bad off. She could die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Val\u2019s smile faded.</p><p>Julian stared at his friend. Val was so goddamn transparent. Now he was thinking that it wouldn\u2019t do much good if the headline was TRUE LOVE KILLS.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201d Val said at last.</p><p>Julian leaned back. The chair squeaked, rolled an inch backward. Images and memories drifted through his mind like clouds on a summer\u2019s day. \u201cShe was the one, Val. She really loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all love you, Julian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKay was different. I loved her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen movies that run longer than your love.\u201d</p><p>That stung. \u201cI\u2019m going up there. Right after the Rolling Stone interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? This fucking movie\u2019s gonna be big, Juli. Big. We\u2019ve got a shitload of press scheduled\u2014\u201d</p><p>Julian smiled. There was nothing he liked better than surprising Val; it was damned hard to do. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m vanishing. I\u2019m just going out of town for a day or two. I pay you two and a half million a year. Make it work.\u201d</p><p>Val shook his head. \u201cOkay, Jules. Go play Prince Charming. But be back in two days. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no press. I want to do this alone.\u201d</p><p>Val looked at him hard. \u201cJesus, Juli, you never do anything alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a first time.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen lights were off, but Liam could see two blue spots of flame on the stove. The mouth-watering aroma of Rosa\u2019s arroz con pollo wafted up from the pots. In the dining room, the table was set for dinner. A vase of fern fronds and pine boughs made a graceful centerpiece.</p><p>In the great room, there were candles on every windowsill and tabletop. The candelabra on the grand piano was a blaze of flickering golden light.</p><p>He heard the soft, even patter of Rosa\u2019s slippered feet on the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBuenos noches, Rosa,\u201d he said.</p><p>She reached the bottom of the stairs and turned toward him. \u201cBuenos noches, Dr. Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the candles, Rosa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does not bother you, I hope? I know it is not my place ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMi casa es su casa,\u201d he answered. \u201cI just wondered why ... all of a sudden ...\u201d</p><p>She ducked into the great room, moving hurriedly toward the grand piano. The ebony surface captured her reflection, dotted it with candlelight.</p><p>He followed, came to a stand behind her. \u201cIs this all for Mike?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. The tip of her white braid brushed against her hip. Slowly she turned around and looked up at him.</p><p>He could see the worry carved into her face. \u201cIt is for you also that I light these candles, Dr. Liam. For you and the children. I spoke to Carol today. She told me that Julian True called you. It is quite the fiery gossip in town.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHot,\u201d he said distractedly. \u201cHot gossip. And Julian will be here tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth puckered with disapproval, but she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cYou think I shouldn\u2019t have called him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does not matter what one old woman thinks.\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cFollow me,\u201d and led her to the sofa.</p><p>She sat stiffly, her knees and ankles clamped together, her gaze riveted on her lap.</p> <p>He sat beside her, leaning forward in the hopes that it would make her look at him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of him, too, Rosa. More afraid than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. But I love her. I can\u2019t let her go without trying everything possible.\u201d</p><p>Rosa sighed heavily. \u201cYou cannot understand bad love. My poor Mikita, she grew up watching this kind of love ... and I think I\u2014what is the word?\u2014infected her with my sorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian True married her, Rosa. He must have loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is love ... and love. The good love, like what you have for my Mikaela, it does not let a young girl run off alone with a tiny baby. It does not stay hidden for years and years. It does not leave you cold in the winter in bed all by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked away. Candlelight reflected all around the room, a thousand tiny golden drops hovering against the night-tarnished windowpanes. \u201cWhen I asked Mike to marry me,\u201d he said quietly without looking at Rosa, \u201cshe told me she\u2019d been married before ... and that she was afraid she could never love anyone that way again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she was afraid. Love for a woman like her is a terrifying thing. She knew only one kind of love then\u2014the fiery kind that burns everything around it. And she had seen me, alone for so long, waiting for a man who would never come. How could my Mikita be anything but afraid when you said you loved her? But I remember when she first told me about you. \u2018A doctor, Mama,\u2019 she said. \u2018And he loves me something awful.\u2019 I tell her, \u2018You be smart, you love him back.\u2019 And she said to me that a broken heart doesn\u2019t love so good. I will always remember this, because it made me want to cry.\u201d She touched his face gently with her work-calloused hand. \u201cI talked to her many, many times as the years went by. When Bret was born ... I have never seen my Mikita so full of joy. I think she stopped thinking about the things that were gone. She loves you, Dr. Liam. I know this in my mother\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Rosa\u2019s gaze slid away from his. She made a soft, sighing sound, something like air leaking from an old, worn tire. \u201cYou have heard many of the words of Mikaela\u2019s story, but maybe they do not create the right picture. She was a young girl when she met Julian\u2014only a few years older than Jacey. But she was nothing like Jacey. She had a mother who was weak and poor, and a father who would never speak to her in public. She lived in a bad part of town, in a house no one was supposed to see. One day she saw a god. She fell in love with him, in the way that only young girls can fall in love. They married ... but he was not a god. He was just a young, selfish man who wanted nothing from life but to have fun. He wanted everything to be given to him, but love, it is not an easy road, s\u00ed? And the very heart that he once filled with love, he broke.\u201d She leaned over and touched Liam\u2019s hands. \u201cWhen he comes here, you cannot tell Jacey who he is. This is muy importante. We cannot let him hurt our precious girl.\u201d</p> <p>Liam knew it was the easy road, not telling Jacey the truth, but he told himself that Mikaela should be the one to reveal her secrets to Jacey. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Rosa. We won\u2019t say anything yet.\u201d</p><p>Yet even as he said the words, he knew it was the wrong thing to do.</p><p>Liam walked slowly up the stairs. He knew he shouldn\u2019t talk to Jacey right now. He figured his chance of saying the right thing to her was about equal to his chances of climbing Mt. Everest in a Speedo. But he had to sit with her, hold her hand, and look into her eyes. It was guilt, of course, but there was so much more. For the first time in his life, he was afraid of losing his daughter\u2019s love.</p><p>He paused at her bedroom door, then quietly knocked.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and found her exactly as he\u2019d expected: on the telephone. She said good-bye and hung up. \u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Dad.</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same.\u201d He sat down beside her and gently took hold of her hand. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She bravely hoisted a smile onto her pale face. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say. All he could think about was what would happen to all of them when Julian True came into their lives. Jacey, like Liam, had been told only that Mike had been married too young, to a man who wasn\u2019t ready to settle down. Two kids ... a marriage that didn\u2019t work out. It was an ordinary story Mike had devised. There was no room in it for the possibility of Julian True.</p><p>Liam knew that in all the days and weeks and years that lay ahead, he would divide his life into two neat pieces. Before the coma, and after.</p><p>Tragedy was like that, a razor that sliced through time, severing the now from the before, incising the what-might-have-been from reality as cleanly as any surgeon\u2019s blade. Even if Mikaela recovered, their lives would be changed. He was afraid that the secrets she\u2019d kept would always be here, inside him, an ugly malignant thing lodged near enough to his heart to upset its rhythm, and though it could be removed, cut out, there would always be scars; bits and pieces of it would remain in his blood, making it wrong somehow, so that if he accidentally sliced his skin open, his blood would\u2014for one heartbeat\u2014flow as black as India ink before it remembered that it should be red.</p><p>Now, as he looked into Jacey\u2019s sad brown eyes, he knew he should tell her the truth about Julian. He knew, too, that he wouldn\u2019t do it. He would lay down his life before causing her such pain.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Dad?\u201d</p><p>A smile was beyond him. \u201cRight as Seattle rain.\u201d He leaned toward her and pulled her into his arms. She clung to him, and for a brief and shining moment, everything was forgotten except that he loved her ... and she loved him back.</p><p>When he pulled back, he could see it in her eyes, this mixture of grief and fear that had changed them all. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>He felt fragile suddenly; one touch and he could shatter into a dozen pieces. \u201cI love you, Jacey. That\u2019s all I came up here to say.\u201d</p><p>She smiled easily, relieved. \u201cI love you, too, Dad. Remember when I had appendicitis?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me a sucker and told me you\u2019d take the pain away ... and you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it were that simple now.\u201d</p><p>She lost her smile. \u201cI wish I were little again.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms again.</p><p>If she wondered why he held her a bit too tightly, she never said a word.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The town looked like a damned movie set. Pleasantville at night.</p><p>Julian stared through the limousine\u2019s smoked-glass windows. He couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing a place this ... cute. Any minute he expected to see Disney characters skipping along the sidewalks.</p><p>He lowered the privacy screen so he could talk to the driver. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the Country Haus Bed and Breakfast. It\u2019s probably right next door to the Drift On Inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the address, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. In a town this size, we could miss it by what, a block? Two?\u201d</p><p>The driver turned off Main Street onto Glacier. Halfway down the road, they came to a barricade. Several cars were parked in the center of the road, behind the orange dividers. The driver stopped and started to turn the car around.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Julian hit the window control. The glass descended silently. He poked his head out to see what the hell the barricade was for. The cold stung his eyes and nose.</p><p>Off to the right, there was a huge field, coated in white. In the middle of it was a large frozen pond. Cars ringed the perimeter of a makeshift skating rink; their golden headlights turned the place into an outdoor Madison Square Garden. There were people everywhere, kids and adults, all skating in the same direction.</p><p>He noticed a small concession stand set up just a few feet from the car. Some men were roasting hot dogs over an open pit fire.</p><p>\u201cJesus, the only thing missing is Jimmy Stewart.\u201d He drew his head back in and raised the window. \u201cGo on, take me to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>The limousine turned around and reentered Main Street. \u201cYou don\u2019t see towns like this much anymore,\u201d the driver said, casting a nervous glance into the rearview mirror.</p><p>They pulled up alongside a huge Victorian house that sat on a corner lot, its roof covered in drifts of snow. A white picket fence cut the large lot into a pretty, bite-sized piece. Next to the open gate was an etched wooden sign that read WELCOME TO OUR COUNTRY HAUS.</p><p>Julian stepped out of the car. His breath clouded in front of his face. Christ, it was cold. He sure hoped Teresa had packed him a coat. He pulled his Ray-Bans out of his shirt pocket and put them on. \u201cBring the bags in,\u201d he said, already moving, his tennis shoes crunching through the hard crust of snow.</p><p>The door swung open before he even reached the porch. A gray-haired, heavyset woman in a floral dress and plaid apron stood in the doorway. \u201cIt is you! The girls and I didn\u2019t dare hope. In a town like this ...\u201d She dissolved into giggles.</p><p>At mention of \u201cthe girls,\u201d he pictured a herd of wildebeests, all dressed in flowered cotton. Even though he was tired, he flashed her The Smile. It never hurt to schmooze the fans. \u201cHello, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She clapped her hands together; a little cloud of flour wafted upward. \u201cDarling\u2014ooh eee. Wait till I tell Gertrude. I made you shortbread, just in case. I read in the Enquirer that it\u2019s your favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel straight from heaven,\u201d he said, though in truth, he couldn\u2019t remember what in the hell shortbread was. \u201cNow, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, I\u2019ve had a long trip and I\u2019m tired as hell. I\u2019d sure appreciate it if you\u2019d show me to my room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She scuttled around like a dung beetle and hopped up the narrow staircase. Julian could hear the driver, banging up behind them with his garment bag.</p><p>On the second floor, the woman waddled to the end of the hallway and opened a door, revealing a big, airy bedroom that exceeded the weight limit on ruffles. Laura Ashley on LSD couldn\u2019t find use for that many ruffles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the honeymoon suite,\u201d she said, beaming. She offered her pudgy hand. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth, by the way, but you can call me Lizbet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz ... bet. What a charming name.\u201d He poked his head into the room and frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lizbet, but where\u2019s my bathroom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDown the hall. Third door on the left.\u201d</p><p>He turned slowly to face her. \u201cYou\u2019re saying I have to share a bathroom with other people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrdinarily that would be true, but ski season hasn\u2019t started yet. You\u2019re our only guest. So, really, it\u2019s like a private bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that I need to pack a lunch to get to it.\u201d</p><p>She puffed up. \u201cWell, really\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was just a joke. The room is fine. Give my driver a room, too, would you? Preferably on another floor. Then I\u2019ll buy up all the rest. I\u2019d like to have the place to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She flushed prettily and bobbed her head. Backing away from him, she smiled until the last possible moment, when she turned and disappeared.</p><p>He sat down on the end of the bed. The springs squeaked and moaned beneath his weight. \u201cUnpack my bags, will you?\u201d he said to the driver, flopping back on the bed.</p><p>A minor emergency kept Liam in the office until almost five o\u2019clock. By the time he closed up the building and headed for the hospital, it was completely dark. As he stepped out into the night, he heard the high-pitched, faraway sounds of children laughing. They were skating tonight.</p><p>He got into his car and drove through the deserted town. In the hospital, he went to the small corner office that he shared with Tom Granato, a general practitioner from Deming.</p><p>He knew the instant that Julian True arrived. A flurry of sounds came through the door, footsteps sped up, whispers turned up in volume. He waited for his intercom to buzz.</p> <p>Instead, Sarah appeared at the door, opening it without even a knock. Her face was flushed a bright pink, and she was grinning. \u201cDr. Campbell, there\u2019s a man here to see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian True.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a surprised breath. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he\u2019s here to see Mikaela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him in.\u201d</p><p>Sarah bobbed a quick nod and disappeared.</p><p>And so it began. Liam tried to steady his nerves. He had taken such care with himself this morning. Put on his best black pants and the blue flannel shirt Mike had given him for Christmas last year, but now he saw the pointlessness in it all. The white coat he wore would deflect only the measliest blow.</p> <p>The door opened.</p><p>Liam turned.</p><p>The man standing in the open doorway smiled\u2014just that\u2014and Liam felt ill. The photographs didn\u2019t do Julian justice; no lens could capture the magnetic power of that face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Julian True,\u201d he said unnecessarily, and Liam could tell that he enjoyed acting as if there were people on this planet who didn\u2019t know who he was.</p><p>Liam rose slowly to his feet. He pulled the glasses from his face\u2014as if that would help\u2014and tucked them in the pocket of his lab coat. \u201cHello, Julian. I\u2019m glad you could come. I\u2019m Liam Campbell. I wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see her now?\u201d</p><p>Liam sighed. He didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d wanted to put it off; it wasn\u2019t as if Julian was going to leave. Still, the thought of bringing them together made him feel sick. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>He led Julian down the hallway toward Mikaela\u2019s room. Slowly he opened the door.</p><p>Julian pushed past him and went to the bed. He stared down at Mikaela for a long time. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fell off a horse and hit her head on a fence post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has she been like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little more than a month.\u201d</p><p>Julian brushed a strand of hair from her eyes. \u201cHeya, Kayla. It\u2019s Jules.\u201d Then he looked up. \u201cCan she hear me?\u201d</p><p>Liam stared down at Mikaela. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>Liam felt like Grandpa Walton giving advice to Robert Redford about how to talk to a woman. \u201cJust talk to her, Julian.\u201d His voice fell to a whisper. \u201cShe sometimes responds to ... memories ... stories from the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my name. She responded to my name, right?\u201d</p><p>It took an incredible effort to answer. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Julian dragged a chair over to the bed and sat down. \u201cLeave us alone for a while, will you, Doc? Heya, Kayla. It\u2019s me. Jules.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Liam let out a shaky breath. He realized he\u2019d been afraid she would simply wake up, just like that, when she heard Julian\u2019s voice.</p><p>Julian took her hand in his. \u201cKayla, honey?\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t stand the sight of Julian touching her, so he turned and walked out of the room. In the hall, he leaned back against the wall.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until almost a full minute had passed that he realized what he\u2019d done ... or hadn\u2019t done.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told Julian that he was Mike\u2019s husband.</p><p>Julian had never been any good at writing his own lines.</p><p>He thought about ringing the nurse to bring him something decent to sit on, and bagged the idea. He wasn\u2019t a complete idiot; he knew he was just fishing for something to think about, something except the woman lying before him.</p><p>She looked beautiful, like a sleeping princess. He half expected her to sit up, smiling, and say, Hey, Jules, what took you so long?</p><p>At the imagined sound of her voice, the years fell away. Julian hadn\u2019t thought about her in ages, but now, looking at her, he could recall clearly how it had felt to love her ... and to be loved by her. Of all the women he\u2019d known in his life, she alone had given him a safe harbor, a place that felt like home.</p><p>He closed his eyes; memories floated to the surface. \u201cRemember the beginning, Kay? The first time I kissed you, I thought I\u2019d die. Not in the \u2018I thought I\u2019d die\u2019 way of teenagers, but in a truly frightening way. My heart was beating so fast, I couldn\u2019t breathe, and I thought, This is it, I\u2019m going to die.</p><p>\u201cYou tasted like rainwater\u2014did you know that?</p><p>\u201cI fell so far in love with you it felt like I was drowning. Remember the first time we made love? We were out in some orchard, lying on a wool blanket. I had sent my assistant all the way to Yakima for a bottle of Dom Perignon. I wanted to be the first man to show you what starlight tasted like. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be your first lover, too.</p><p>\u201cWhen you tasted the champagne, you laughed. You tucked your hands beneath your head and stared up at the sky and asked me to tell you about myself.</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell you the prefab story that Val had invented, but you said, \u2018The time we have is precious. I don\u2019t want to end up knowing nothing about you except what\u2019s in the Enquirer. I want to know that I touched you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He tried to remember how they\u2019d fallen out of love. It had been so deep, that well of their shared emotion, how had they drifted to the surface? Yet even as he wondered, he knew.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted him to grow up. It sounded absurdly simple, but if he looked hard at the truth, that was the core of it. She had wanted him to make sacrifices for their family. But he\u2019d been twenty-three years old. Barely ready to be a husband, completely unprepared to be a father. All he\u2019d wanted was fun ... and so he\u2019d drawn back, taken the careless path he knew so well, the road lined with women whose names could never be remembered and parties that never died.</p><p>It felt as if a door had opened. Beyond it, he saw a glimpse into himself, past the golden boy, past the star, all the way back to the lonely boy he\u2019d once been. In all the years between then and now, he\u2019d never really loved anyone. This woman, Kayla, had been the closest. His love for her had been the best of him, and he\u2019d turned his back on it.</p><p>He stared down at her face, studying the lovely half-moon curl of her black eyelashes, the pale puffiness of her lips. What could he say that would matter to this woman whom he knew so well and yet didn\u2019t really know at all, this woman whose heart he\u2019d broken with the ease of a child smashing an out-of-favor toy?</p><p>Tears seared his eyes. He couldn\u2019t believe it. He hadn\u2019t cried in years. Except when they paid him to, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d love this, Kay. Me, crying.\u201d He leaned toward her, resting his chin on the cold silver bed rail. \u201cRemember our first fight? It was at one of Val\u2019s parties, after some screening. He told me he had a part for me\u2014a little picture called Platoon. I said, \u2018Who the hell cares about that war?\u2019 and you hit me\u2014right in front of everyone. You told me to quit being such a damned star and try acting.\u201d</p><p>It had started there\u2014the end that was all wrapped up in the beginning\u2014and he\u2019d been too selfish to notice. \u201cYou always asked so much of me, Kayla,\u201d he said softly, shaking his head. \u201cI never had that kind of talent ... Why didn\u2019t you realize that?\u201d</p><p>He gazed down at her, noticing for the first time the plain gold band on the ring finger on her left hand.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Liam drove through Last Bend. The town glittered like a diamond tiara set on white velvet. Behind it, a background of jagged blue peaks leaned toward the starlit sky.</p><p>He parked in front of the Country Haus Bed and Breakfast. In a silence broken only by the hushed moan of the car\u2019s heater, he took a minute to collect his thoughts.</p><p>The last thing in the world he wanted to do right now was talk to Julian True, but he had no choice. When he looked up again, Julian was standing beside the car. The idiot was wearing a black T-shirt and jeans. He had to be freezing.</p><p>Liam reached over and unlocked the door. Julian slid into the seat and leaned back. \u201cJesus H. Christ, it\u2019s cold out there.\u201d Smiling, he turned to Liam. \u201cI\u2019m glad you called. The thought of spending the evening in that bathroom-less room, watching one of three speckled television channels, was more than I could bear. What do you say we get a drink?\u201d</p><p>Offhand, Liam could think of at least thirty-two hundred things he\u2019d rather do. \u201cSure.\u201d He started the car again and drove through town. Liam couldn\u2019t think of anything to say and Julian didn\u2019t bother to speak.</p><p>Liam parked in front of Lou\u2019s Bowl-O-Rama and got out of the car. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Lou\u2019s Bowl-O-Rama was pre-dinner-hour quiet. No one was using any of the four bowling lanes. As always, the place smelled of burnt grease and cigarette smoke. The owner, Lou Padinsky, stood behind the counter, wiping it down with a soggy gray rag. When he saw Liam, he flashed a grin that made the cigarette in his mouth droop. Ashes fluttered to the countertop and were quickly wiped away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHowdy, Doc.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cGet us a couple o\u2019 beers, willya, Lou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Doc.\u201d Lou slapped the rag across his shoulder and turned toward the beer taps.</p><p>Liam led Julian to a red Naugahyde settee at the back of the bowling alley.</p> <p>As they sat down across from each other, Liam was glad they\u2019d come here. First off, the lighting was poor, and God knew he didn\u2019t need to see the younger man\u2019s face in good light. Second, there wouldn\u2019t be a bunch of look-e-loos wandering through the place and getting all hot and bothered about a genuine movie star in Last Bend. He hoped that Julian felt out of place in a joint like this, but truthfully, Liam figured that a man like Julian never felt out of place.</p><p>Liam knew it was childish, but he needed an edge, even one as feeble as poor lighting.</p><p>Liam stared at the younger man, remembering all the things he\u2019d learned about him. The Internet was great for that sort of thing. He knew, for example, that Kayla True had \u201cdisappeared\u201d one day. He\u2019d learned, too, that Julian and Mike had been blessed in the beginning, a genuine Hollywood superstar couple, but something\u2014some reports said drugs, some said other women, some said aliens\u2014had tarnished their star. And that the four-times-married Julian True was one of the highest-paid actors in the world.</p><p>Lou waddled toward the table and set down two schooners. Beer sloshed over the glass rims.</p><p>Julian flashed the man a bright smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>Lou started to answer, then stopped. \u201cHey, you look like that guy ...\u201d</p><p>Julian\u2019s smile was so bright, Liam wanted to reach for a pair of sunglasses. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian True. You hear that a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>Lou elbowed the actor. \u201cShould help with the chicks, huh?\u201d Then he turned to Liam. \u201cAnd how\u2019s that beautiful wife of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay. Thanks, Lou.\u201d</p> <p>Lou nodded and headed back toward the lunch counter, humming Up against the wall, you rednecked mother, as he went.</p><p>Liam took a sip of beer.</p><p>Julian leaned back, sliding his arms across the top of the settee. Liam had the impression of a golden lion stretching in the sun. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect ... her to be so ...\u201d He didn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s better than she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Julian\u2019s eyes narrowed. He was looking at Liam for the first time.</p><p>\u201cEarlier this week, she blinked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blink, that\u2019s good, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it was awful damned good of you to call me. We sure as hell don\u2019t have doctors like you at Cedars-Sinai\u2014well, maybe Liz and Michael do, but not the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Liam refused to let the tone upset him. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married for ten years. I\u2019m sure you noticed the wedding ring ...\u201d</p><p>Julian rolled his eyes. \u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>Liam wouldn\u2019t touch that line with a ten-foot pole.</p><p>Julian\u2019s hand shot in the air. \u201cHey, Lou. Bring me a pack of Marlboros, willya?\u201d</p><p>Lou grinned and grabbed a pack. Hurrying over to the table, he dropped them in front of Julian, with a book of matches. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see a smoker in Last Bend. We\u2019re dying out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice imagery, Lou. Thanks.\u201d Julian opened the pack, extracted a cigarette, and lit it up. Smoke swirled across his face, but through the cloud, Liam could see those blue eyes studying him. Julian reached for his beer and took a long drink, then set it back down between them. \u201cYou must really love her. To call me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Liam said quietly.</p><p>Julian leaned back again. \u201cThis place reminds me of that dump of a diner where Kayla used to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cGod, she was beautiful. And those good Christian folks in Sunville treated her like trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she never fit in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell would want to? That town was a case of pinkeye on God\u2019s eyeball. But it hurt her, you know. She was so scared of ending up like her mom. Kay would have done anything to belong somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, like marry you?\u201d</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t smile this time. \u201cOr you. I can see why she came to this town. She probably needed someone like you, after ... me.\u201d</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t stop the question; it burned on his tongue, left a bitter taste. \u201cWhat happened between you two?\u201d</p><p>Julian sighed. \u201cYou know how it is. We were in love ... and then we weren\u2019t. Hell, I was twenty-three years old. I didn\u2019t know who I wanted to be, but I knew it wasn\u2019t Mr. Cleaver.\u201d He looked away, took another long drag on the cigarette, then exhaled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even try. When she left, she said she\u2019d wait for me to come get her. Forever\u2014that\u2019s how long she said she\u2019d wait.\u201d</p><p>Liam wished he couldn\u2019t see it so clearly. He sipped on his beer, studying Julian over the frosted rim. \u201cWhat about your daughter? Why didn\u2019t you ever contact her?\u201d</p><p>Julian flinched, and Liam thought, My God, he never even thought about Jacey. He got on a plane, rushed up here, and never once remembered that he had a child here.</p><p>\u201cShe was so little when I last saw her. To be honest, I don\u2019t know what I feel about her. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll work it all out when I meet her.\u201d</p><p>Liam knew the rich were different and that the rich and famous were more so, but he couldn\u2019t fathom the kind of man who could be so careless with a young girl\u2019s heart. He didn\u2019t look away from Julian. At least the man could look ashamed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Kay never told her? I would have thought she\u2019d be proud of it ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt her, Julian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell her yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? No.\u201d</p><p>God help him, Liam was relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s a small town. I don\u2019t want her to find out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything. If word gets around, I\u2019ll say I\u2019m here for the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Please, Liam, let\u2019s ... wait and see what happens with Kayla, okay? I mean, if she doesn\u2019t wake up ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Liam said, watching Julian closely. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>Rosa was waiting up for Liam when he got home. She set her knitting aside and got to her feet, moving across the living room toward him. She started to say something.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Rosa, not now,\u201d he said, walking past her. Whatever she was going to say, he didn\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>Instead, he went up the stairs and quietly entered Jacey\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>She was fast asleep, one arm flung out to the left, as if even in sleep she were reaching for the bedside phone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be my daughter,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The next morning, Liam woke up early and rolled quietly out of bed, being careful not to waken Bret, who was sleeping peacefully beside him. He showered quickly, grabbed some clothes from his closet, jammed them in a duffel bag, and headed downstairs. On the empty kitchen table, he left a Have a good day note for Rosa and the kids.</p><p>Dawn crept through Last Bend like a slow reckoning. Thin bands of pink light crested the trees. The storefronts were all black.</p><p>He drove to the hospital, parked in his stall, and went to Mikaela\u2019s room. He flicked on the lights and went immediately to draw open the curtains.</p><p>Then, very slowly, he turned around.</p><p>She was as still as always, her pale face slack, her arms tucked gently along her sides. There wasn\u2019t a wrinkle in the blanket drawn up against her chest.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized until he exhaled a wobbling breath that he hadn\u2019t been breathing. He\u2019d been afraid Julian had already wakened her.</p><p>Now, for the first time, it felt important\u2014essential even\u2014that Liam be the one to reach her.</p><p>\u201cHeya, Mike,\u201d he whispered, starting the music. Today he chose something by Andrea Bocelli, to remind her of the sad, aching sweetness of life.</p><p>At her bedside, he set down the duffel bag and unzipped it, extracting a navy cashmere sweater, the one she\u2019d bought for him on their last trip to Vancouver. Very gently, he placed it on her chest.</p><p>\u201cCan you smell me, Mike? Me?\u201d He knew that if he closed his eyes, he would remember that last day of their trip. They\u2019d driven across the Canadian border to see a road show performance of Rent, and in that darkened theater, amid a crowd of strangers, they\u2019d held hands like a couple of school kids.</p><p>\u201cYou bought me the sweater the next day, remember? I tried to tell you that it was too expensive, that a cotton sweater from Eddie Bauer was good enough for me.\u201d His voice broke. \u201cAnd you said nothing was too good for me.\u201d</p><p>He took hold of her hand. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I came here to say, is it?\u201d</p><p>He lowered the bed rail. Slowly he climbed into bed beside her. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I never thought to bring one of my own sweaters before. Last night I woke up in a cold sweat, thinking that very question. I thought of everyone but me ... everyone you loved except me. You always said that was my greatest strength\u2014that I thought of everyone before I thought of myself. But it\u2019s my weakness, too, and we both know that.\u201d</p><p>He brought her arm up, hating the lack of resistance in her limb, and kissed the back of her hand. \u201cI let everyone else feed you memories because I was afraid of the power they held. I was afraid of ... breaking. I still am, I guess, but I can\u2019t let another day pass without going through that fear. It seems that all I can think about is you and Julian. He fell in love with a young girl who had big dreams and seemed at home in the fast lane, a girl who charmed the whole country. I can\u2019t imagine that woman at all. I fell in love with a nurse with haunted eyes and a heart that was tender to the touch.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole part of you I never knew, and knowing that makes me feel ... lost. Like our life together wasn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cWhen I think of us, I think of little things. Like last Christmas, when we all went skiing at Schweitzer Mountain, and you said the only thing to look forward to in a sport that froze your nose hairs was quitting it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at the memory. For the first time, his words had brought her to him. Not the wife who was frozen in sleep, but the laughing, vibrant woman he\u2019d married.</p><p>\u201cWhen we got home, it was just in time for Glacier Days. As usual, you were the big kahuna, organizing everyone.\u201d</p><p>An unexpected memory hit him hard and he laughed out loud. \u201cRemember what happened in the gym? I was the last one in there, trying to figure out how to get into that damn hairy suit. Everyone else was outside, gearing up for the sled race.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou came looking for me. You were wearing that ridiculous ice princess costume for the horse rescue float, and you said, \u2018I\u2019ve always loved a man in a Bigfoot costume.\u2019 I grabbed your hand and dragged you into the boys\u2019 locker room. You locked the door.\u201d</p><p>She had laughed along with him. Liam, not here ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d swept her into his arms, lifting her up until her feet didn\u2019t even touch the floor. The kiss she gave him was deep and sexy, and seemed to draw every bit of air from his lungs.</p><p>He\u2019d torn off her gauzy white polyester dress and the white silk long johns she wore underneath ...</p><p>\u201cYou were as crazy as I was. You unzipped my costume and pulled it off of me ...\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed, a deep throaty sound that he hadn\u2019t heard in weeks. \u201cJesus, I feel like one of those 1-900 operators. Remember what happened next, Mike? Remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe made love right there\u2014us, a married couple with two kids and a whole town waiting for us outside, and we went at it like a couple of horny teenagers. In the middle of it all, Myrtle knocked on the locker room door.</p><p>\u201cThere we were, lying on the floor of the boys\u2019 locker room, all naked and sweaty, our bodies twisted together like a licorice whip. I had to put a hand over your mouth to keep you quiet. But you were laughing so hard, your shoulders were shaking and there were tears in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cJesus, you were beautiful. I\u2019ll never forget how beautiful you were right then and how it felt to have you in my arms, with nothing between us.</p><p>\u201cWhen Myrtle left, you laughed so loud, I thought the whole damn town would hear you. You said, \u2018There goes our reputation.\u2019 And I laughed along with you. \u2018Speak for yourself,\u2019 I said. \u2018This is going to do my reputation a world of good.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair, noticing the trembling in his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s who we were, Mike. Who we can be again if you\u2019ll just open your eyes and look at me. I love you. Always. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>Very slowly he leaned down and kissed her forehead, murmuring, \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Julian woke up with a deadly hangover. It was inevitable, of course. There was nothing to do in this Norman Rockwell town except sit in your room, watch one of three channels, and drink. Last night he\u2019d spent at least two hours trying to get Val on the phone. At every busy signal, he\u2019d taken a swig of Scotch.</p><p>Groggily, he turned onto his side and reached for the phone, punching in Val\u2019s office number. Susan answered on the second ring: \u201cLightner and Associates.\u201d</p><p>At last. Julian angled to a sit. \u201cIs Val in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Julian. Just a second.\u201d</p> <p>Val came on the line. \u201cJuli, how goes it in the great white north?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been? I tried calling you all last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, big guy. If I wanted to hear talk like that, I\u2019d have gotten married.\u201d He laughed at his own joke. \u201cWe screened On Mystic Lake last night\u2014the new Annette Bening, Richard Gere tearjerker. Afterward we all ... well, you know how those things go. I didn\u2019t make it home until about four. So, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Kayla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sorta figured that. How is she?\u201d</p><p>He tried to put into words how he\u2019d felt yesterday, but as always, this kind of honesty was difficult. \u201cIt was weird, Val. There she was, unconscious. I didn\u2019t know what to do. They said she\u2019d responded to memories, and so I started talking about us.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou know me, I can\u2019t remember yesterday, and there I was remembering the first time I kissed her. I felt ... something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuli, I feel honorbound to point out the disturbingly necrophilic overtones here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the deal? You want to stay longer, is that it?\u201d</p><p>Julian was vaguely disappointed. He wished they could talk, just this once, about something that mattered. \u201cShe really loved me, Val. I guess that\u2019s what I remembered most. How it felt to be loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery woman you meet adores you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing, is it?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Val was quiet, and Julian wondered if his agent had really listened this time. \u201cNo, I guess it\u2019s not. So, what are you going to do with all this rampant emotion?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t something Julian had thought about. He\u2019d been so busy feeling, he hadn\u2019t bothered to think much. \u201cWell, nothing, I guess. She\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>Julian jerked the phone away from his ear. Val\u2019s tone of voice was so high that dogs were probably barking all over town. \u201cYou heard me. She\u2019s married ... to the doctor who called me.\u201d</p><p>Through the lines came the unmistakable sound of a cigarette firing up, then a whoosh of smoke exhaled into the receiver. \u201cDoes he love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Her hospital room is a shrine to their life together, and the nurse told me yesterday that he sits by her side for hours\u2014every day since the accident. Sometimes he even sleeps with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s the real deal, cape and all. A goddamn superhero who loves his wife enough to call you\u2014her first husband\u2014to help wake her up. Jesus, the press\u2019d have a field day.\u201d Val fell quiet for a minute, an uncharacteristic display of thoughtfulness. \u201cYou\u2019d better be very careful here, Jules.\u201d</p><p>Julian knew Val was right. Kayla was a part of his past. She had a new life now, one that didn\u2019t include him, but when he\u2019d touched her, he\u2019d remembered their love, and the remembering had made him feel ... lonely.</p><p>\u201cJulian? You\u2019re coming back now, right? I mean, tomorrow you\u2019re scheduled for Leno\u2014\u201d</p><p>Julian hung up. Hollywood and his career felt far away suddenly, a sepia-toned photograph next to the Technicolor memories of his first love.</p><p>He closed his eyes. Though it was the last thing he wanted to do, he found himself trolling through the pain of his youth ...</p><p>His mother, Margaret Jameson Atwood Coddington, had said from the beginning that he was cursed, and it had appeared to be true. Eight months after Julian\u2019s birth, his father had died. Margaret had wasted no time reminding her son that she had never wanted a child. She\u2019d taught him to call her ma\u2019am and to be seen but not heard. As soon as he was old enough, she\u2019d shipped him away to boarding school in Switzerland, where he stayed while she worked her way through husbands and plastic surgeons and dinner parties. She sent him checks, but never letters.</p><p>At sixteen, he\u2019d packed up what he needed in a backpack and headed to America, following a string of pointless jobs to Lubbock, Texas.</p><p>He had just turned nineteen when he glimpsed his future. Of course, it came in the form of a woman. He could still remember her stunning beauty. She picked him out as if he were a handbag she couldn\u2019t pass up. I\u2019ll take him, she said. He\u2019d found out later that she was a famous actress in town to shoot a movie. Before he knew it, he was in the movie and then in Hollywood. He became an overnight sensation. He changed his name and changed his life. Val took him on as a client and constructed an elaborate fictional background that included two dead parents. It was Val who\u2019d named him Julian True.</p><p>Julian had waited years for someone to find out the truth about him, but no one had.</p><p>Kayla was the only one who\u2019d insisted on knowing him, the man behind the wrapping paper of fame. He\u2019d told her everything except his real name.</p><p>\u201cJesus, now I\u2019m thinking about my mother. Enough.\u201d He swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood, making his unsteady way down the hallway to the bathroom.</p><p>He showered in the world\u2019s smallest white fiberglass shower stall (it could have doubled as a coffin), then dressed in faded Levi\u2019s and a black T-shirt. He grabbed the coat he\u2019d bought yesterday\u2014at that lightning rod of fashion, Zeke\u2019s Feed and Seed. Shrugging into it, he flipped up the collar and left his room, hurrying downstairs. He pounded on his driver\u2019s door. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>Lizbet popped out of the kitchen and met him in the foyer. She looked like she\u2019d been dipped in flour and was ready for the fryer. \u201cGood-bye, Mr. True. Will we see you for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Bye, Lizbet.\u201d He opened the front door\u2014and saw a dozen teenage girls standing on the sidewalk beyond the white picket fence. The second he appeared, they screamed his name.</p><p>It seemed that gossip spread pretty damned fast in Pleasantville.</p><p>He grinned lazily. \u201cWell, hello, ladies. It\u2019s good to see y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>They crammed together, a centipede in cheerleader outfits and bare legs. Giggling.</p><p>He bounded down the steps. \u201cWhat have we here, the Last Bend welcomin\u2019 committee? Such pretty gals, too. I\u2019m honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you sign my autograph book, Mr. True?\u201d asked one of the girls. Her saucer-round cheeks were bright red.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be my great honor.\u201d He pulled a pen out of his pocket and started signing autographs. The girls talked all at once, giggling, pushing one another toward him.</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s the winter prom, Mr. True ... I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d like to stop by?\u201d one of the girls asked, dissolving into a fit of laughter before she finished the sentence.</p><p>He planted a hand against his heart. God, he loved this. \u201cWhy, I\u2019ll bet a girl as pretty as you already has a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Serena,\u201d someone yelled, \u201cyou\u2019ve already got a date. How about going with me, Mr. True?\u201d</p><p>He was about to answer the silly question when he saw her, off in the back of the group, smiling but not giggling, not asking for his autograph.</p><p>His jaded heart skipped a beat. Maybe two.</p><p>She was beautiful\u2014Hollywood beautiful\u2014this tall, thin, black-haired girl with eyes as soft as melted bittersweet chocolate. Midnight-black hair fell like a waterfall of ink down her back. It had to be her ...</p><p>He spelled his name wrong and handed the piece of paper back to a red-haired girl who was grinning up at him, showing a mouthful of multicolored braces.</p><p>He pushed easily through the crowd and sidled up to the dark-haired girl. His heart was beating hard. \u201cAnd who are you, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jacey.\u201d</p><p>Juliana Celeste. J.C.</p><p>His daughter. He was too stunned to speak. For the first time, she was real; not a faded image of a baby in a crib, but a young girl who\u2019d grown up without him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to close his eyes, but somehow they slid shut. In the darkness, he saw an image from long ago, him and Kayla in bed together, a squawking bundle of baby tucked gently between them.</p><p>Isn\u2019t she perfect? Kayla had said ...</p><p>He opened his eyes and gazed down at his daughter.</p><p>\u201cMr. True?\u201d She blushed prettily. \u201cW-What are you doing in Last Bend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... uh ... here ... for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, visitin\u2019 sick folks at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom is sick. She\u2019s in a coma. Maybe ... maybe you could visit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to. Why, I\u2019ll do it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Mr. True!\u201d The driver\u2019s buoyant voice lifted above the giggling.</p><p>The girls instantly drew back, showing a respect he hadn\u2019t seen in Hollywood in a long time. All except Jacey. She stood there, staring up at him through eyes that were suddenly sad.</p><p>He looked down at her, trying to memorize her face for a moment longer, then he went to the limo. He refused to look back, but when he was in the car, he finally turned, gazing at her through the smoked glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A new and alien emotion unfolded in Julian\u2019s chest, made it difficult to breathe.</p><p>Shame.</p><p>Night fell like sudden blindness, obliterating the last pink rays of the setting sun. Liam turned away from the window and stared at his daughter.</p><p>Jacey stood in front of a full-length mirror, staring at her reflection. Her hair had been swept back from her face and coiled into a thick black mass, accented with four glittering pink crystal butterflies. The sleek, lavender gown fit her perfectly.</p> <p>She looked so grown-up. He couldn\u2019t help feeling a brush of sadness, as if he\u2019d already lost his little girl.</p><p>Tears glazed her dark eyes, and he knew she was thinking of her mother.</p><p>\u201cShe would be so proud of you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I remember? Your first Halloween in Last Bend. You were five years old, and you dressed as the tooth fairy. Mike went all the way to Bellingham for the perfect pink satin. She sewed a thousand pink sequins on your gown.\u201d He moved toward her; for a second, he saw her as she\u2019d once been, a little princess in a glittering dime-store tiara. \u201cMike and I weren\u2019t married then, but that was the night ...\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cYou asked if you could call me Daddy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your mom were here right now ...\u201d</p><p>She took his hand, squeezed it. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He forced a smile. \u201cWell, m\u2019lady, it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Holding hands, they went downstairs. A few minutes later, Rosa ushered Mark into the living room. He was wearing a navy blue tuxedo with a ruffled white shirt and a lavender bow tie. His jet-black hair was slicked back from his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jacey,\u201d Mark said, moving toward her, \u201cyou look great.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cThanks, Mark.\u201d</p><p>Upstairs, Bret poked his head over the railing and started singing at the top of his lungs, \u201cHere comes the bride, all fat and wide\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBret!\u201d Liam yelled, biting back a laugh. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>Bret dissolved into laughter and scampered down the stairs, skidding into place beside his sister. She elbowed him in the shoulder. \u201cThanks a lot, rugrat.\u201d</p><p>Bret looked up at her. Rosa had scrubbed his little face to a mop-and-glow shine. \u201cReally, you look pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Mark handed Jacey a clear plastic box. Inside it lay a white orchid wrist corsage with tiny lavender ribbons. \u201cThis is for you. Norma at the nursery said it was the very best kind.\u201d He stumbled around, trying to open it for a minute, then gave up and shoved the box at her.</p><p>Jacey removed the flower and slipped the elastic band on her wrist. \u201cThanks. Grandma\u2014would you get Mark\u2019s boutonniere out of the fridge?\u201d</p> <p>Rosa bobbed her head and scurried into the kitchen. She came back a moment later with a small white carnation, its tips dyed lavender. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>After that an awkward silence fell. Liam wanted to break it, but his throat felt swollen and tight. He kept turning to his wife to say Look at her, honey, but there was no one beside him. He hoped Jacey didn\u2019t hear the serration in his voice when he croaked, \u201cOkay, kiddos, photo op.\u201d</p><p>Mark groaned.</p><p>Jacey shoved his shoulder. \u201cVery funny.\u201d She took Mark\u2019s hand and led him to the piano. He slipped an arm around her waist and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cThink sex!\u201d Bret said, darting behind the sofa. Giggles rose up from his hiding place.</p><p>Liam snapped enough pictures for a Town &amp; Country layout. He knew he was prolonging the moment\u2014as if Mikaela would magically walk through that door if only he could extend this scene a little longer.</p><p>\u201cEnough, Dad,\u201d Jacey said, laughing. \u201cThe band is probably on their second set.\u201d She disentangled herself from Mark\u2019s arm and went to Liam.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly, \u201cshe\u2019ll want to see all the pictures. Every angle, every pose. That\u2019s why I\u2019m bringing my camera in my purse. I\u2019ll take pictures of everything.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and held her close. Then he drew back and smiled down at her. \u201cNow go and have a good time.\u201d</p><p>Jacey kissed Rosa and Bret good-bye, then hurried out the door.</p><p>Liam stood at the kitchen window, watching her drive away. There she goes, Mike. In ordinary times, he would have turned to his wife now and taken her in his arms. She would have been crying. Liam would have gone to the piano, sat down and played something sad and sweet, something that gave her the room she needed to grieve for the little girl who was crossing the bridge to womanhood.</p><p>Only right now he was the one who felt like crying, who had glimpsed the emptier nest of the future and seen how much quieter this house would be when Jacey left.</p><p>And there was no one there to hold him.</p><p>With a sigh, he went into the living room and turned on the television.</p><p>Julian knew it was the wrong thing to do. Dangerous, even, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. In truth he didn\u2019t even try. Self-control had never been his strong suit. He couldn\u2019t have said exactly why he wanted to go to the prom, but he\u2019d never been one to get caught up in reasons. He wanted to go. That\u2019s all that mattered. He had spent a long, depressingly quiet day at the hospital, sitting by Kayla\u2019s bedside, and he needed some action.</p><p>In his overdecorated bedroom, he dressed carefully, as if he were headed to the Oscars, instead of some backwoods high-school dance. A black silk T-shirt and black pleated Armani pants. Instead of bothering his driver, he walked the three blocks to Angel Falls High School. When he got there, his cheeks were numb from the cold, his eyes were watering, and he desperately needed a smoke.</p><p>He walked through the empty hallways, stopping now and then to look at the trophies displayed in glass cases between rows of gray metal lockers.</p><p>At the auditorium, he paused, took a deep breath, and opened the double doors. It took his eyes a second to adjust to the darkness, but gradually he saw that the gym had been turned into a cheesy tropical paradise. False palm trees clustered around a patch of gold shag carpeting; beside it, a dozen tuxedoed boys and ball-gowned girls formed a line for pictures. Against the far wall, a band played some hard-edged song that was almost familiar.</p><p>He knew the moment he\u2019d been recognized. A hush fell across the room. Dancing stopped. The kids eased away from him, forming a whispering, pointing funnel toward the dance floor.</p><p>He looked around, smiling his big, overpracticed smile until he saw her. She was on the dance floor with her date. Even from this distance, Julian could see that they were staring at him.</p><p>He moved through the crowd in the way he\u2019d learned long ago: head up, smile planted, making eye contact with no one.</p><p>The song ended and another began. The love theme from Titanic, the movie. That damned heart was still going on.</p><p>He stopped beside Juliana\u2014J.C., he reminded himself\u2014and held out his hand. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>The crowd gasped. Her date\u2014a big, good-looking kid in a ridiculously cheap tux\u2014looked confused.</p><p>Jacey turned to the boy. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ... no.\u201d</p><p>Julian swept her into his arms and began dancing. The crowd closed in on them, whispering and talking so loudly, it was hard to hear the music.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWhy not? So, J.C. of the midnight hair, tell me about yourself. Do you get good grades? Have lots of friends? Practice safe sex?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a throaty, barroom sound that was exactly like Kayla\u2019s. \u201cYou sound like my dad\u2014not that he\u2019d ask about my sex life.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way she said it\u2014dad\u2014while she was smiling up at him ... well, it pinched his heart.</p><p>It seemed odd, but he\u2019d never thought about that word until today. Dad. Such a solid, dependable, grown-up word. Even now, with his daughter in his arms, Julian couldn\u2019t really imagine being someone\u2019s dad.</p><p>\u201cMr. True? Did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He laughed easily. \u201cSorry, I was thinking about something. So, what do kids in this town do for fun?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThe usual stuff. Skiing, ice-skating, bowling, horseback riding. In the summer we hang out at Angel Lake. There\u2019s a cool rope swing off a big madrona tree at Currigan Point.\u201d</p><p>It sure as hell wasn\u2019t \u201cthe usual\u201d in Los Angeles, not for a celebrity\u2019s kid, anyway. If J.C. had grown up with Julian, she\u2019d have spent her life behind iron gates and sheltered by bodyguards. She wouldn\u2019t have known what it was like to ride her bike to town for a drugstore soda.</p><p>For the first time, he understood what Kayla had asked of him all those years ago. She\u2019d used words like rehab and safety, but that wasn\u2019t right. What she\u2019d wanted was a normal life for their daughter.</p><p>Just that. A normal life.</p><p>It was something Julian had never wanted. But now, as he held this daughter who was and wasn\u2019t his, he wondered about the price he\u2019d paid for his fame.</p><p>It struck him hard, left him breathless, the sudden realization of how deeply he\u2019d failed his daughter. As if he\u2019d just walked into a room as familiar as his own bedroom and suddenly found it empty.</p><p>He should have known it all along, of course, but he hadn\u2019t thought about it until now.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t J.C.\u2019s father. She had a man at home who\u2019d loved her, who knew if she\u2019d worn braces or snored in her sleep, who\u2019d been there to pick her up when she fell down.</p><p>Julian had planted the seed of her, but he hadn\u2019t chosen to nurture it; he could never have helped her grow into the vibrant, beautiful flower he now held in his arms. How could he help another person grow when he needed so much sunlight for himself?</p><p>Even though he was smart enough to know the truth\u2014that he wasn\u2019t this girl\u2019s father and never would be\u2014he couldn\u2019t help wishing, dreaming, that things could be different.</p><p>The song came to an end. Sadly he leaned down and kissed her cheek. Then he did what he did best: He walked away.</p><p>Liam was in the living room, nursing a watered-down Scotch, when he heard the car drive up.</p><p>Immediately he tensed. He\u2019d been sitting here for hours, by the light of a single lamp, thinking about the decision he and Julian had made. The more he considered it, the more he saw how reckless and dangerous it was to withhold the truth from Jacey. This was a small town; gossip moved like bees from one backyard flower to the next, over picket fences and through telephone lines. The Make-a-Wish ruse would work for a while, but Liam didn\u2019t really trust Julian to understand the stakes. Anyone who said, \u201cYou know how it is\u2014we were in love and then we weren\u2019t,\u201d had a pretty hazy understanding of love and heartache.</p><p>The bottom line was this: Liam hated deceiving Jacey. He couldn\u2019t quite believe that deceit was ever really in a person\u2019s best interest. Now, every time he looked at her, he felt the heavy, ugly curtain of this lie between them.</p><p>The front door swung open suddenly, and she breezed into the room. Her cheeks were flushed a deep, rosy pink and her espresso-dark eyes were shining.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell her now, not on this night that should hold only magical memories. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d she said dreamily, twirling around, her arms poised like a ballerina\u2019s.</p><p>He grabbed the camera beside him and snapped a few shots\u2014for Mike. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>She swept over to the couch and dipped down like a hummingbird, planting a feather-light kiss on his cheek. \u201cTotally awesome. Perfect. I took tons of pictures for Mom.\u201d She stifled a yawn.</p><p>He gazed up at her, loving her so much, it was an ache in his heart. \u201cShe\u2019ll want to see each one.\u201d</p> <p>Smiling, she spun around and floated toward the stairs. He followed along behind her, turning off lights as he went.</p><p>At her bedroom door, she stopped and grinned up at him. \u201cGuess what happened.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a lock of hair from her eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian True showed up at the prom. He asked me to dance. Me. He called me Jacey of the midnight hair. I\u2019ll remember this night forever.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s hand froze against her cheek. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood night, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer, she kissed his cheek and went into her room, closing the door.</p><p>He stood there a long, long time. Then, slowly, he knocked on her door. When she answered, he tried to find a smile. \u201cI ... uh ... just got an emergency call\u2014don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not about Mom\u2014but I have to run to the hospital. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She smiled dreamily; he could tell that she was barely listening. \u201cOkay. Drive safely.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and closed the door. Anger seeped through him, rising steadily. It fit uncomfortably on him, this dark and stinging emotion, like a cheap wool sweater that was a size too small. He raced down to the garage and jumped into his car.</p><p>He found Julian on the front steps of the bed-and-breakfast, smoking a cigarette. He was wearing a T-shirt and jeans\u2014the fool\u2014and his whole body was shaking.</p> <p>Liam skidded to a stop and jumped out of the car. \u201cWhat in the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Julian looked up. The cold was cruel to his face, leeched the color from his cheeks. \u201cI had to see her.\u201d</p><p>Liam lost his hold on anger. Without it, he felt drained. There was a wealth of sadness in Julian\u2019s blue eyes, a look of pure defeat. Of course he\u2019d had to see her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, Liam. The spitting image of Kayla, and when I looked at her ... I couldn\u2019t see anything of me.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t know what to say. He could tell that Julian had never really considered his daughter before, what it meant to have fathered a child. A young girl.</p><p>Julian took a last drag on his cigarette, then stabbed it out in a cushion of new snow. It hissed and sent up a thread of smoke. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her. I can\u2019t imagine I ever could.\u201d</p><p>Liam took a step forward. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I make a man like you understand?\u201d He sighed; a cloud of breath puddled in front of his face. \u201cI break everything I touch.\u201d He tried to smile. \u201cI think I\u2019ve only just realized that. I don\u2019t want to hurt J.C.\u201d</p> <p>Liam felt as if he\u2019d finally glimpsed something real in Julian, and he couldn\u2019t help pitying the younger man.</p><p>Julian got slowly to his feet. \u201cDon\u2019t tell her, Liam. Please, don\u2019t ...\u201d</p><p>Later Liam would wonder what had gotten to him, the sad regret in Julian\u2019s eyes or his own fear of wounding Jacey\u2019s tender heart. Whatever it was, he found himself saying, \u201cOkay, Julian.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Julian sat by Kayla\u2019s bedside, spoon-feeding her the stories of their life together. Finally he understood how momentous a blink would be\u2014right now, he\u2019d take any sign of life.</p><p>Her skin seemed to have gotten paler in the past twenty-four hours.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kay,\u201d he said softly, scooting toward her. The chair legs made a horrific squeaking sound on the linoleum, and he was glad for the noise. Anything was better than this godawful silence.</p><p>He closed his eyes. It made it easier to slide into the past. In darkness he could remember the girl he\u2019d fallen in love with. \u201cI was thinking about the day I asked you to marry me. Do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>It had been late in the autumn. The air in Sunville had been crisp and cold, and with every indrawn breath came the pungent scent of ripening apples. He hadn\u2019t really meant to return to Kayla. When he had left her, after the movie finished shooting, he\u2019d thought she was simply another notch in his bedpost, not unlike the French gymnast he\u2019d slept with while he was in Paris shooting Bone Deep. But every hour away from Kayla had felt like a day, every day a month. To his shock, he\u2019d found that he missed her.</p><p>And so he\u2019d returned to that flea-bitten spot on God\u2019s ass. He\u2019d waited until it was closing time at the diner, until she was alone, and then, very quietly, he\u2019d gone inside and stood by the jukebox ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always remember the look of you, standing by the lunch counter, the way that ugly orange uniform clung to your body. The way my name sounded wrapped up in your voice ...</p><p>\u201cI could tell you were afraid to hope that I\u2019d come back for you. I knew you were thinking about the price tag that came with a man like me. You said, \u2018I\u2019m not pregnant, if that\u2019s what you came to find out.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled. \u201cI remember wishing I was the kind of guy who would have come back to ask that question. I knew I should turn around and walk away, but I could feel it sparking between us again, that passion. I\u2019d never been so scared, and somehow you knew that.</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell you the truth about me. I told you I was no good for you, that I\u2019d never been faithful to a woman in my life, but all you did was smile. So I told you everything, that I\u2019d gone back to Hollywood and started reading scripts and doing interviews and talking to people ... but I woke up in the morning and I thought of you. I went to bed at night, and I thought of you. I screwed other women, and I thought of you.</p><p>\u201cI knew it would hurt you, but I told you anyway. I thought maybe it would keep me from saying the rest of it, that maybe you would throw me out and I\u2019d have to leave you again. But you just stood there, smiling up at me, waiting.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what I said next?</p><p>\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want to love you, Kayla.\u2019</p><p>\u201cI knew you heard the word that mattered\u2014don\u2019t\u2014but next to love, it seemed to have no power at all. I pulled the small velvet box out of my pocket and handed it to you. When you saw the diamond ring, you started to cry.</p><p>\u201cI knelt down on one knee\u2014remember that? It was the only time I\u2019ve ever done that in my life. I knelt down and begged you to marry me. You took the ring and slipped it on your finger.</p><p>\u201cI meant to say something romantic, but what I said was \u2018If you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll say no.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He touched her hand. \u201cI knew I would hurt you, Kay. Sooner or later. And I\u2019m so damned sorry ...\u201d</p><p>The door creaked open.</p><p>He heard the familiar cadence of Liam\u2019s footsteps. \u201cHow is she today?\u201d</p><p>Julian shrugged. \u201cThe same.\u201d</p><p>Liam popped a tape into the player\u2014Air Supply\u2019s \u201cLost in Love\u201d\u2014then took his usual place on Kayla\u2019s other side, standing close to the bed. \u201cHeya, Mike.\u201d</p><p>Julian envied Liam, who was able to sit here for hours, talking to his wife, holding her hand, believing in a happy ending, even as they saw how she was fading into the sheets.</p><p>Julian gazed down at Kayla, his thoughts turning again to the day he\u2019d asked her to marry him. \u201cI hurt her,\u201d he said softly, realizing a second too late that he\u2019d spoken aloud.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>After last night, Julian felt a strange kinship with Kayla\u2019s husband. Liam was the only one in the world who knew how it felt to sit here, hour after hour, praying for a miracle. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me. I don\u2019t love for long. I wanted Kayla, wanted her like I\u2019ve never wanted a woman before or since. I was so goddamned in love with her ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think maybe \u2018in love\u2019 has the shelf life of whipping cream. No matter how you handle it, it goes sour. But if you\u2019re lucky, you get past \u2018in love\u2019 and end up just loving someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Julian knew his next question would wound Liam, but he had to ask it. \u201cDid she love you that way?\u201d</p><p>Julian saw that Liam wanted to lie to him, to say certainly, absolutely, with all her heart; he saw, too, the moment Liam lost that battle.</p><p>He gave a lopsided, half smile. \u201cIronically, I think she loves me ... but I don\u2019t know now if she was ever in love with me.\u201d Liam paused, then asked, \u201cHave you ever had a family, Julian? I mean, a real family that lasts through good times and bad ... the kind that keeps you out of the deep end?\u201d</p><p>The question stung. He\u2019d always wanted a family, but a family was give-and-take. He had always specialized in take-and-take. His only chance had been Kayla; if he\u2019d held on to her, he might have known what it felt like to belong to a group of people who loved you no matter what, who cried when you failed and cheered when you won.</p><p>Julian patted his pocket, looking for a pack of cigarettes, then remembered he was in the hospital. Liam was staring at him now, seeing him. Julian felt as if his insides were splayed out on an operating table for Liam to see, and like a smoker\u2019s lungs, they were black and ruined.</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t answer. Finally, Liam pulled up a chair and sat down. For the next hour, they took turns talking quietly to Kayla.</p><p>After a while, Liam looked up at the clock. \u201cWell, I have to get going. The kids\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d He stood up and stroked Kayla\u2019s cheek. \u201cHeya, babe. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d Then he leaned down and kissed her forehead, murmuring a word that Julian couldn\u2019t make out.</p><p>Liam was almost to the door when Julian asked, \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d</p><p>Liam glanced back at him, his hand on the door handle. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you keep believing she\u2019ll wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>Julian frowned. \u201cI know. But how do you do it?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze flicked over to his wife. \u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>Julian watched Liam leave the room. Without Liam there, the silence felt awkward. He moved closer to the bed, picked up Kayla\u2019s limp hand, and squeezed it hard. \u201cHow is it I can remember falling in love with you, and have so little memory of the end? Our love affair is clear as glass, but our marriage, our life is ... gone. All I remember is the day you left. I don\u2019t even remember trying to stop you. Did I? Did I ever say, \u2018Don\u2019t leave me\u2019? Did I know what I would become without you?\u201d He sighed. \u201cJesus, Kayla, did I even care?\u201d</p><p>She hears him call her name.</p><p>She tries to reach for him, but there is nothing beside her. She feels the panic building again, swirling around her.</p><p>Pictures twirl through her mind like images in a child\u2019s viewfinder, and when they stop, she is somewhere else. A house.</p><p>She tries to say something, to call out, but there is something wrong with her throat. In the distance she can hear a moan. It is her ... or maybe not ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She is in Hollywood now, in their home, waiting for Julian.

She hesitates, afraid to intrude on the older, sour-faced woman who seems to know everything about taking care of baby girls.</p><p>She is tired of this life filled with laughter and drugs and sex that happens in other people\u2019s beds. Tired of thin, beautiful women with vacant eyes who never carry photos of children in their wallets. She is lonely, more now than ever. Since Jacey\u2019s birth, Julian is distant. He never holds his daughter or talks to her. Instead he hires other women to do the chores that Kayla longs to do herself.</p><p>How can it not have changed him, this bringing of a child into their lives? It has transformed her every cell.</p> <p>She stands in the shadows of the living room, beside the ornate gas fireplace that holds the sounds and color of fire, but none of the heat.</p><p>When Julian gets home\u2014late, as usual, and smelling of another woman\u2019s perfume\u2014she sees how old and tired he looks, and she wonders how long he has looked this way, how long she has overlooked his deterioration. The drugs and alcohol have left marks on his skin, on everything, even the way he moves, all slow motion.</p><p>\u201cJules?\u201d</p><p>He turns to her, smiling before he even sees her. \u201cHey, baby.\u201d</p><p>As he gets closer, she can see the red cast to his eyes, the way his nose is running from too much cocaine. He moves unsteadily, a marionette with broken strings, and it breaks her heart, seeing this so clearly.</p> <p>She takes his hands in hers, trying not to notice the way his fingers are shaking, the dampness in his palms. \u201cWe have to talk, Jules.\u201d</p><p>She sees the flash of irritation in his eyes. Even though he tries to hide it, she sees. \u201cNot again, Kay. Jesus, not again ... I know I missed the kid\u2019s birthday party. Let\u2019s not rehash it forever.\u201d He pulls free and goes to the bar, making himself a cocktail, drinking it too fast. Then he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a Baggie of cocaine.</p><p>She watches him snort the drug, and there is no word to describe the depth of her sadness. She turns away from him. \u201cWe have to change our lives, Julian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby,\u201d he whispers, kissing her cheeks, her eyelids, cupping her face in his hands. \u201cAnd we will.\u201d</p><p>It is the answer he\u2019s given her a dozen times, but it\u2019s not good enough anymore.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t watch you kill yourself, Jules. I ... love you too much for that. And I can\u2019t let Juliana grow up in this world. I want her to know how it feels to be safe.\u201d</p> <p>He frowns. \u201cYou mean it this time.\u201d</p><p>She turns away from him and goes back to the big picture window. It is funny, she thinks, how fast a life can change. One minute, one set of words that really say nothing at all, and you see what you hadn\u2019t seen before.</p><p>She feels him come up behind her. The window reflects his faded image. \u201cYou meant what you said in Sunville,\u201d she says dully. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really want to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>She wonders if he sees the continent that separates her question from his answer.</p><p>She can\u2019t raise Juliana in this world. No matter how much she loves Julian, she can\u2019t do this to her daughter. If there\u2019s one thing Kayla knows, it\u2019s the pain of a father who can\u2019t be bothered to spend time with his child. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Julian,\u201d she whispers, feeling the tears fall down her cheeks.</p><p>His arms circle her, holding tightly. \u201cI love you, Kayla, but I can\u2019t give all this up. It\u2019s who I am.\u201d</p><p>She touches his face. \u201cI love you, Julian, more than ...\u201d She can\u2019t finish. There is nothing big enough to compare to her love for this man. \u201cI wish we were old and gray and all of this was behind us,\u201d she says at last. \u201cI wish we were sixty years old and we could sit together by the fire with pictures of our grandchildren between us ... and laugh about these times. I wish ...\u201d Her voice gets caught in the ache spreading through her insides, and she can\u2019t say more.</p> <p>It is too much for her, these memories. She closes her eyes and sinks again into the sweet, blessed darkness ...</p><p>At dinner that night, Liam tried to smile and make conversation with his beloved children, but all he could really hear were the tinny silences that collected between his sentences. As he helped himself to another serving of rice, he caught a glimpse of his reflection in the hollowed silver surface of an oversized spoon.</p><p>The fear hit him then; it was like plunging into Angel Lake on winter\u2019s deepest night.</p><p>His hand started shaking. The silver spoon rattled against his pewter plate.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d Bret said, wide-eyed. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Liam dropped his spoon and held his hands out. If anyone was surprised by the suddenness of his action, there was no sign of it. \u201cLet\u2019s hold hands,\u201d he said.</p><p>Around the table, they reached out for one another. Liam felt Bret\u2019s small hand slip into his; then Jacey took hold of his other hand. Rosa reached out at the other end.</p><p>In their gentle, trusting touch, Liam felt it return, the faith he needed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pray. Rosa, will you do the honors?\u201d</p><p>Across the table, she was watching him. He could tell that she understood. She nodded briefly and closed her eyes, bowing her head. Her lovely, lyrical voice was like music in the silence. \u201cHeavenly Father, we thank You for the four of us at this table, for the love we share and the strength we find in each other. We thank You for Mikaela\u2019s continued life, still as it may be. We know You are watching out for her and protecting her and blessing her with Your presence in the darkness of her sleep. Once again, we offer You our humble prayers that she will soon come back into the loving arms of her family. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen.\u201d</p><p>Liam opened his eyes and looked at his children. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>It was like that these days. The best of times were quiet moments like this one, tucked into the corners of what passed for everyday life. They were learning, each of them, to notice the things they\u2019d once taken for granted.</p><p>And to be thankful for the life that was left.</p><p>Part Four</p><p>Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forward.\u2014S\u00d8REN KIERKEGAARD</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The water is now a beautiful aqua blue. She is at the bottom of a swimming pool, staring up. Her limbs feel heavy; the water resists her movements, but she has learned that if she really concentrates, focuses all of her will, she can lift her fingers and wiggle her toes. She knows that at some time, long ago, this would have been next to nothing, something the tiniest newborn can do, but to her, in this pool of endless clear blue water, it is everything.</p><p>She is floating up through the water, rising, rising, her body weightless. The water moves easily aside for her and buoys her.</p><p>As she reaches the surface, the water slides away from her face. She gasps, breathing in the sweet, pine-scented air, then sucking greedily. Her fingers twitch, and she is reaching for something ... the shadow in front of her.</p><p>She opens her eyes and immediately cries out. The light is so bright, she cannot stand the brightness.</p><p>\u201cShe opened her eyes. Jesus Christ, Mike ... we\u2019re here ...\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep, calming breath and opens her eyes again. At first the world is a confusing, jarring mixture of white-hot light and black, slanting shadows. She can feel something warm against her palm. She tries to grasp hold, but her fingers are weighted down again, unresponsive.</p><p>She blinks; it takes all her concentration to turn her head. Something stops the movement, a swell of cottony fabric.</p><p>The shadows spin in front of her, waving like mirages on a desert highway, then, slowly, slowly, they begin to take shape.</p><p>There are three people around her, men.</p><p>Julian. She sees him, sees those beloved blue eyes staring down at her. She reaches out for him, meaning to touch his face in the gentlest caress, but her control is shot, and she slaps him hard across the cheek. She means to laugh at the surprise on his face, but instead she bursts into tears. More water, sliding down her cheeks now, tasting salty, like the black sea that held her captive, and she is afraid. She can\u2019t stop crying.</p><p>She tries to talk. It hurts, burns. Still, she pushes a sound up her cracked, broken throat, and when the word comes out, mangled and unfamiliar, she weeps even harder. \u201cJu ... li ... an.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby,\u201d he says in the voice she remembers so well, the voice that seems connected to the tender cords in her heart.</p><p>\u201cKayla, baby, are you there? Squeeze my hand.\u201d</p><p>She opens her eyes again, blinking slowly.</p><p>It seemed to take her hours to focus, but when she did, she saw him standing beside her, staring down at her, and she felt a rush of joy. \u201cYou came ... back.\u201d</p><p>Another man leaned toward her. On the front of his white coat, it read Dr. Liam Campbell. \u201cHi, Mike.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and tried to turn her head to look for Mike. It tired her and she gave up. She tried to remember how she got here, but there was nothing. She remembered every moment of her life up to when she said good-bye to Julian. After that, there was a complete and utter blankness. It terrified her. \u201cI ... don\u2019t ... where ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital,\u201d someone says.</p><p>\u201cJuliana,\u201d she croaked. \u201cWhere\u2019s my baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d Julian turned to the other man. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Something was wrong. She\u2019d been hurt, she realized suddenly. Hurt. And they wouldn\u2019t answer her question about Juliana. Oh, God ...</p><p>The other man touched her face, and there was a gentleness in him that calmed her. She blinked up at his watery, out-of-focus face. He blotted her tears with a tissue. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Mike. Your daughter is fine. She\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She trusted him. Juliana\u2019s okay. \u201cWho ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush it, sweetheart. Take it slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho ... are you?\u201d she asked at last.</p><p>Before he answered, she lost interest. Her head felt so heavy, so ... broken. All that mattered was that her baby was okay.</p><p>She closed her eyes and sank back into the cool, blue water, back to the place where it was calm and warm and she was unafraid.</p><p>\u201cRetrograde amnesia.\u201d</p><p>Liam and Julian were seated in front of Stephen Penn\u2019s massive oak desk. Stephen looked worn and tired.</p><p>Liam leaned forward, rested his arms on his thighs. \u201cIn posttraumatic\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, wait a sec.\u201d Julian shot to his feet. He prowled the small office like a caged lion, repeatedly running his hand through his hair. \u201cI haven\u2019t had twenty years of college and I don\u2019t know what you two are talking about. What in the hell is retrograde amnesia?\u201d</p><p>Stephen removed the small, circular spectacles from his face, carefully setting them down on the cluttered surface of the desk. He didn\u2019t look at Liam as he spoke. \u201cAt the moment of serious trauma, the brain stops accumulating memories. That\u2019s why a victim of serious brain injury rarely remembers the actual incident itself. More often than not, the last clear memory is one that happened days or weeks ... or even years before. These are often powerful, significant memories\u2014weddings, births, that sort of thing. It appears that Mikaela\u2019s mind is ... trapped, if you will, some years ago. She seems to believe that Jacey is still a baby.\u201d He paused. \u201cClearly she doesn\u2019t remember her life with Liam at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long do you think the amnesia will last?\u201d Liam asked, even though he knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cThere is no way of knowing,\u201d Stephen said slowly. \u201cAlthough chances are that she will remember. Long-term retrograde amnesia is rare.\u201d His voice softened. \u201cBut it does happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can we help her?\u201d Liam asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cRight now she\u2019s afraid and confused. We want to tread very, very carefully. The mind is a fragile thing, much more delicate than the brain. We don\u2019t want to overwhelm her with frightening information.\u201d At last he looked at Liam. \u201cI think it\u2019s best if we let it come back naturally.\u201d</p> <p>Liam sighed tiredly. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that the kids and I should stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Liam. I can only imagine how hard this is for you. But I think she needs some time to let her mind heal. Can you imagine realizing that you\u2019d lost fifteen years of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Liam said, \u201cI can imagine it.\u201d He leaned forward and hung his head, staring down at the Oriental carpet so long, the colors smeared into one big bruise.</p><p>What in God\u2019s name was he going to tell his children?</p><p>Julian went to a pay phone and called Val. \u201cShe woke up today,\u201d he said when Val answered.</p> <p>\u201cNo shit. How is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got amnesia. She doesn\u2019t remember anything of the last fifteen years. She thinks we\u2019re still married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still in love with me, Val. With none of the bad memories of our breakup.\u201d</p><p>Val made a low, whistling sound. \u201cJesus Christ, what did you do\u2014script this? It\u2019s a goddamn fairy tale and you\u2019re the prince. The press\u2019ll love this.\u201d</p><p>Julian sagged against the wall. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. How am I going to tell her that I never came back for her. Val? Val?\u201d</p> <p>His answer was a dial tone.</p><p>With a curse, Julian hung up the phone. For the first time since he\u2019d gotten here, he was afraid.</p><p>She was alive. That was the miracle Liam needed to focus on. Over the past weeks, he had asked God to heal her, to help her open her eyes. All the while, he\u2019d prepared himself for the physical impairments that could come with an extended coma. Paralysis, brain damage, even death\u2014these he\u2019d readied himself to handle. He\u2019d never asked God to return her memories.</p><p>Now, as he drove home, he reminded himself that retrograde amnesia was a common short-term side effect of severe brain injury.</p><p>Short term. Those words were the ledge he tried to hold on to, but they kept crumbling beneath the weight of his fear.</p><p>What if she never remembered him or the kids?</p><p>He concentrated on breathing; it didn\u2019t seem like much, but if he didn\u2019t think about it, he stumbled into a place where panic was inches from his face, where he had to draw in great, sucking breaths just to survive.</p><p>Who are you?</p> <p>Would he ever forget those words? Forget the pain that knifed through him in that single, horrifying moment when she\u2019d said Julian\u2019s name ... and then asked Liam who he was.</p><p>He knew that her condition was purely medical in nature, a lapse in the function of her traumatized brain. But he was a man as well as a doctor, and the man in him felt like any man would feel. As if in twelve years of life together, of moments big and small, of a love that was enacted in errands and dinners and bedtime conversations, Liam had left no mark on her at all.</p><p>As if his love were like the waves that shifted and shaped, but never really changed the shore.</p><p>He was being foolish. She loved her children with every strand of her soul, and she had forgotten them, too\u2014</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t right. She\u2019d only forgotten Bret; Liam\u2019s son. She remembered Jacey. And Julian.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t shake a terrible, rising panic that in the end, his love would count for nothing. And what would he tell his children? They\u2019d been through so much pain already, so much fear. Poor Bret had courageously visited her day after day, singing her favorite songs to her, waiting for a smile. It would crush him to discover that his mom didn\u2019t remember him. One blank look and Bret would crumble.</p><p>Jacey would try to handle this like an adult, but inside, where it mattered, she would break like a little girl. She would understand that everything she and Mike had shared was gone. Every talk, every memory that entwined their lives would be Jacey\u2019s alone now.</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t even think about his own fear right now; it was too overwhelming. \u201cPlease, God,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwe can\u2019t take this, too. It\u2019s too much ...\u201d</p><p>The windshield wipers thumped in front of him, punctuating the silence in the car. A light snow began to fall, patterning the glass, piling up on the edges of the wiper\u2019s sweep.</p><p>He flipped on the radio. \u201cMemories\u201d by Barbra Streisand blared from the speakers.</p><p>He snapped it off. Christ, what was next\u2014\u201cAs Time Goes By\u201d?</p><p>The snow was coming faster now. He didn\u2019t see his own driveway until he was practically on top of it.</p><p>He put the car in four-wheel drive and lowered his speed, maneuvering carefully over the bumpy gravel road and into his own garage.</p><p>At the mudroom door, he paused, taking a moment to collect himself, then he pushed into the house. \u201cHello,\u201d he called out. \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>He heard the scurrying sound of slippered feet on the hardwood floor. Rosa appeared, wearing one of Mike\u2019s old saddle club aprons over a black house-dress. \u201cBuenos noches,\u201d she said, wiping a hand across her brow, leaving a snowy trail of flour across her skin. \u201cI am making the ... biscuits for dinner. You would like a cup of coffee, s\u00ed? Or a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacey will be home any momento. Bret is upstairs in the shower. Would you like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike woke up today.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. Her hand flew to her mouth. \u201cDios mio, it is a miracle. How is she?\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t know how to take all the information of this day and mold it into an ordinary sentence. In the end he simply said it: \u201cShe didn\u2019t recognize me, Rosa.\u201d He could hear the terrible ache at the edge of his voice; it didn\u2019t sound like him at all. \u201cJulian ... she recognized Julian.\u201d</p><p>Rosa\u2019s hand fell slowly, slowly to her side, where her fingers curled into a tight fist. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give you a bunch of technical explanations, but the bottom line is that her memory has failed. She seems to think she\u2019s twenty-four and still married to Julian. She thinks Jacey is still a baby.\u201d</p><p>Rosa was staring at him with a familiar look; it was the look of a patient who\u2019d just received devastating news. She desperately wanted him to grant her hope. \u201cThis will get better, though. \u00bfS\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope it\u2019s temporary.\u201d He put the tiniest emphasis on the word hope. \u201cUsually people get their memories back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she does not remember you or the children or all the years she\u2019s been away from him.\u201d</p><p>Each word was a brick, and when they piled one on top of the other, he broke. It was as simple as that, as anticlimactic. He\u2019d been afraid of this moment for weeks\u2014this time when his heart and his mind said simply no more\u2014and yet now that it was here, it was nothing. No screaming agony, no crying jag that couldn\u2019t be stopped. Just a narcotic weariness, an emptiness that ate through his bones. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Rosa closed her eyes and let her head drop forward. It was almost as if she were praying. \u201cThis pain for you ... I can barely imagine it.\u201d</p><p>His throat felt tight. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Finally she looked up, and her brown eyes\u2014so like Mike\u2019s\u2014were glazed with tears. \u201cWhat will you tell the children?\u201d</p><p>There it was. Liam sighed. \u201cI can hardly think of it, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. They have been praying for this for so long. It will break their hearts to learn that she does not remember them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But it\u2019s a small town. Not a place where secrets keep.\u201d</p><p>Secrets. Like a famous father a girl knew nothing about.</p><p>Rosa took a step toward him. \u201cDo not tell them yet. At least for this night. Give Mikita until tomorrow. Maybe then we will never have to tell the ni\u00f1os this terrible thing, s\u00ed?\u201d She gazed at him. \u201cYou had faith in Mikaela, Dr. Liam, from the start of this, you believed in God and in her. Don\u2019t you stop. She will need you still ... maybe even more now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has always needed me, Rosa. That\u2019s why she married me. But before this thing is over, it will be about something else.\u201d</p><p>Rosa flinched.</p><p>He knew that she understood what he was going to say before he spoke. \u201cIt will be about love.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>That night, after dinner, Liam tried to think of something that would take his mind off Mikaela. They were all in the living room now, ostensibly watching a TV movie, but no one seemed to be paying much attention.</p><p>At a commercial, Jacey hit the remote control and muted the television. \u201cSo,\u201d she said suddenly, \u201chow\u2019s Mom?\u201d</p><p>Liam dropped his medical journal. \u201cUh ... the same,\u201d he said into the awkward, sudden silence. \u201cHey, I have an idea. How about if we have one of our camp-out nights?\u201d</p><p>Jacey frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing outside.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s laugh had a forced, brittle edge. \u201cI know, I know. I meant a pretend one. Like we used to when Bret was little. We\u2019ll unplug the phones and bring our sleeping bags into the living room. Roast marshmallows and make s\u2019mores. And I\u2019ll tell you the story of Sam McGee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great!\u201d Bret said.</p><p>Jacey looked scared. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done that in years. And we need the phone. If Mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my pager. If something ... happens, we\u2019ll plug the phones back in.\u201d</p><p>Jacey looked unconvinced. \u201cI told Mark I\u2019d call him tonight.\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled at her. \u201cYou can live a few hours without talking to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she can\u2019t,\u201d Bret piped up. He planted a hand on his chest and rolled his eyes dramatically. \u201cShe\u2019ll die if she doesn\u2019t talk to her boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Jacey smacked her brother playfully on the head. \u201cVery funny. Just wait till you stop thinking that girls have cooties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Liam said, smiling, \u201cit\u2019ll be fun. Your grandma\u2019s never done it.\u201d</p><p>Bret twisted around to face Rosa. \u201cIt\u2019s totally rad, Grandma. Dad\u2019s the best poem-teller.\u201d</p><p>Rosa was smiling. \u201cHe is good at telling stories, s\u00ed?\u201d</p><p>Liam clapped his hands together. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>An hour later they were ready.</p><p>Night turned the living room into a huge, rectangular cave. A fire crackled in the stone fireplace, casting a dancing, golden glow across the room. They\u2019d thrown green and brown afghans over all the furniture, a disguise as fine as any. A navy blue king-sized sheet draped the piano, turning it into the mysterious Piano Lake, where swimmers were often lost even in the dog days of summer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacey\u2019s voice was quiet as she spun out the legend their family had created long ago: \u201cAnd the townspeople swear that on a night like this\u2014in the snowiest, blackest winter, when a full moon rises into the cloudless sky\u2014that they hear the screams of souls drowned long ago.\u201d</p><p>Bret made a face. \u201cShe\u2019s not saying it right\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jacey gave a spooky laugh and turned on a flashlight, holding it beneath her chin. \u201cAh, but there\u2019s more ... about the little boy who wandered away from his campsite and ended up on the banks of Piano Lake ...\u201d</p><p>Bret leaned forward. This was a new and interesting detail. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p> <p>Liam closed his eyes. The room smelled of popcorn and wood smoke, of melting chocolate and oozing marshmallows. He imagined Mike beside him, her head resting on his shoulder, her arm looped around his waist.</p><p>The sadness was like that. Sometimes he went whole minutes in blissful ignorance\u2014a dad enjoying the sound of his children\u2019s voices\u2014then he\u2019d remember Who are you? and the pain would hit so hard he couldn\u2019t breathe. In those moments, he\u2019d see his whole life stretching before him, an endless, lonely highway. At the end of it was the fear, however irrational, that he would lose her to Julian.</p><p>It was a buoyant fear; there was no way to drown it.</p><p>\u201cDaddy. Daddy!\u201d Bret was yelling now.</p><p>Liam pushed the thoughts aside and looked up\u2014right into Rosa\u2019s frowning, watchful brown eyes.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy, do the shooting of Dan McGrew. That\u2019s my favorite.\u201d</p><p>Liam scooted back and leaned against the sofa (now the dormant volcano, Mt. Mikaela), then opened his arms. Bret crawled through the broken graham cracker crumbs, spilled popcorn, and bunched-up goose-down sleeping bags, and cuddled beside Liam. Jacey and Rosa moved in closer, sitting side by side in front of the warm fire.</p><p>The poem, though he hadn\u2019t recited it in years, came back to him with a surprising ease. It was the tale of men in the Yukon gold fields who\u2019d\u2014</p><p>Fought over a woman.</p><p>Liam bit back a curse. \u201cHey, Bretster, how about I do Sam McGee instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Dan McGrew.\u201d</p> <p>Liam sighed. He closed his eyes and began quietly, \u201cA bunch of the boys were whooping it up at the Malamute Saloon ...\u201d</p><p>It took concentration to keep going. When he finished the last sentence, he managed a smile.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a good story,\u201d Rosa said, frowning.</p><p>Liam ignored her. \u201cCome on, kids, go brush your teeth. It\u2019s midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a camp-out? No way I\u2019m brushing my teeth,\u201d Bret whined.</p><p>\u201cCome on, foot-breath,\u201d Jacey said, taking her brother\u2019s hand.</p><p>Within minutes, the kids were back, crawling into their sleeping bags. Liam gave them each a kiss good night, then he got to his feet.</p><p>Bret jackknifed upright. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to walk Grandma back to the cottage. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna sleep down here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Bret grinned. \u201c\u2019Night, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Grandma,\u201d Jacey added.</p><p>Rosa kissed them both, then followed Liam out of the room. At the mudroom, they put on their coats and boots. Liam hit the garage door opener and together they headed outside.</p><p>A beautiful moon glazed the snowy pastures and backlit the black trees. The whole farm held an ethereal glow, all blues and blacks and glistening whites.</p><p>\u201cMike would love this night,\u201d Liam said. \u201cIf she were here right now, she\u2019d be racing ahead of us, scooping snow up in her mittens to make snowballs ... or she\u2019d fall backward without warning to make an angel. I hope the snow is still here when she gets out of the hospital.\u201d</p><p>They came to the cottage\u2019s two-rail gate. Through the sparkling layer of new snow, you could just make out the knobby brown rose vines that, in the summer, were a wall of bright green and shocking pink.</p><p>The gate made a high-squeaking sound in the silence. Rosa went ahead and opened the front door, flicking on the kitchen light. She took off her coat and hung it up in the antique armoire by the door. Liam laid his over the back of a chair at the kitchen table.</p><p>Rosa turned to him. \u201cWhat did she say, my Mikita, when you told her about your marriage?\u201d</p><p>He was caught off guard. \u201cWe didn\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? This is madness not to tell her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve thinks the truth might frighten her. We don\u2019t want her to suffer a relapse.\u201d</p><p>Rosa seemed to think about that for a minute, then she shook her head. \u201cYou men\u2014you doctors\u2014you do what you think is best. But I am her mama, no? I have always taken care of my Mikaela. I will not stop now. I will need the fotograf\u00edas you found.\u201d</p><p>Liam tried to imagine what it must be like to have a mother like this. What a power it must grant a person in life to have a place where you could always land softly, even after the hardest hit. \u201cRosa,\u201d he said quietly, touching her hand. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I don\u2019t know how I would have made it through this without you.\u201d</p><p>Rosa grabbed his hands and held them tightly. \u201cYou are stronger than you think, Liam. This I have seen in you over these past weeks. Now you are thinking that Mikaela does not need you, that she has forgotten you because she does not love you, but you are wrong. Her eyes may be open, but mi hija is still asleep. Give her time.\u201d</p><p>She woke easily this time. No floating at the bottom of a swimming pool, no black and angry sea slapping around her. She just ... opened her eyes.</p><p>Strangers surrounded her bed. Some she\u2019d seen before, some she hadn\u2019t. They were talking to her and to one another. She could see their mouths opening and closing, opening and closing, but nothing made any sense.</p><p>Do you know where you are ... who you are ... what happened ...</p><p>She wished they would shut up. One by one, their faces came into focus, and the questions they were asking began to make sense. Dr. Penn\u2014the nice-looking man with the gray hair and white coat\u2014smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mikaela. Do you remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenn,\u201d she answered, her voice as cracked as old porcelain and nearly as fragile. Her throat still hurt. \u201cWhat ... happened me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell off your horse and hit your head. You suffered quite a head injury. You\u2019ve been in a coma.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to ask questions, but she couldn\u2019t remember any of the words she needed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mikaela. It\u2019ll all come back to you.\u201d Stephen turned to the strangers. \u201cLet\u2019s go. She needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>Wait. She tried to sit up. It was hard; her right side felt weighted down, too weak to move easily. Her heart started beating too fast, her breathing broke into gasping bits. Before she could remember the right words to make them stay, they were gone.</p><p>The door to her room squeaked open, and a new stranger appeared. She was a heavyset woman in a blue polyester pantsuit. Her fleshy face was creased into a bright smile. \u201cGood morning, Mikaela. How are we feeling today?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Her name was Kayla now. Everyone knew that. Everyone. So why did they all keep calling her Mikaela? She hadn\u2019t used that name in years\u2014not since Sunville.</p><p>She tried to push a question past her disobedient tongue. The word she was searching for\u2014hello\u2014was bouncing around in her mind, but it disappeared before reaching her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe removed the catheter last night\u2014do you remember that? I thought you might like to try going to the bathroom by yourself. Doctor will be here in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Kayla gazed up at the woman, trying to make her mouth work. \u201cWho ... where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sarah Fielding, honey,\u201d she answered the unasked question. The nurse bustled around the bed and pulled the sheets back.</p><p>Kayla stared down at her skinny, hairy legs. They looked okay. So why wouldn\u2019t they work right?</p><p>Sarah eased a plump arm behind Kayla\u2019s head and gently tilted her upright. In spare, economical movements, she maneuvered Kayla to a sit, then helped her to a shaky stand. She clung to Sarah and tried to walk. She had to kind of drag her heavy right leg as they made their slow, shuffling way to the door across the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can use the toilet by yourself, honey?\u201d</p><p>Toilet. The word fluttered around for a second, then landed on the white porcelain seat beside her. Toilet. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered, gripping the counter unsteadily. She was shaking and breathing hard, but she could stand on her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be just outside if you need me.\u201d Sarah backed away and half-closed the door behind her.</p><p>Kayla sank onto the cold seat. It burned when she urinated, so badly that she had to clamp a hand over her mouth to keep from crying out. When she was finished, she leaned forward and grabbed the counter again, dragging her reluctant body to an awkward stand.</p><p>That\u2019s when she saw herself in the mirror. Her face was chalky pale. And her hair was short; it looked as if it had been cut with children\u2019s scissors.</p><p>But her hair was long\u2014down to her waist. Julian wouldn\u2019t let her cut it.</p><p>Shaking, she leaned closer to the mirror, pressed her damp palms to the cold glass. There were tiny lines around her eyes and mouth. Lines she\u2019d never seen before ... the kind of lines that Mama had, and there were more than a few gray hairs threaded through all that black ...</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>The door burst open and Sarah was there. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Kayla tottered around, her hands on her face. \u201cI\u2019m ... old. Oh, God ... what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Kayla grabbed the woman\u2019s sleeve. \u201cI\u2019m old ... what happened?\u201d</p><p>Sarah wrenched away. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She ran from the room. The door slammed shut behind her.</p><p>Kayla grabbed a handful of her hair\u2014so short now\u2014and stared at the gray strands. She couldn\u2019t breathe; her knees felt weak. \u201cOh ... God ...\u201d</p><p>How long had she been lying in that bed? How long\u2014</p><p>Dr. Penn rushed into the room. A breathless, flushed Sarah waddled along behind him.</p><p>Kayla looked at him and started to cry. \u201cHow old am I?\u201d In her mind, she screamed the question, but in truth it came out as a hacked-up whisper.</p><p>Dr. Penn took her hand and held it. \u201cCalm down, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kayla.\u201d This time she did scream.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a sedative, Doctor?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t put me back to sleep. I\u2019ll ... be quiet.\u201d Kayla gulped in a great, wheezing breath of air. She clung to the doctor\u2019s hand, staring at him through a stinging veil of tears. \u201cI\u2019m ... scared ...\u201d</p><p>He touched her face gently, as if he were a friend, and she wondered how it was possible to sleep so long that you woke up old. \u201cRemember what I told you? You\u2019ve been in a coma, Mike. I thought with your nursing background you\u2019d remember. I forgot that ... oh, never mind.\u201d</p><p>This time she remembered the word\u2014coma. It came with a picture of that girl, Karen Ann Quinlan, curled into a ball, weighing nothing ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dr. Penn was still talking. He didn\u2019t know that there was a roaring white noise in her head. \u201cIt\u2019ll come back to you ... Kayla. If you just relax.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth trembled. Tears found their way into the corners of her mouth, leaving a wet, salty taste on her tongue. \u201cHow long ... asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little more than a month.\u201d</p><p>The relief she felt at that was so stunning she laughed out loud. She meant to wipe her eyes, but she had no control. She smacked herself in the nose and laughed harder.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dr. Penn said in a nice, even voice. \u201cYour emotions are off track right now, along with your motor skills. But there\u2019s no permanent damage. It\u2019ll all come back.\u201d</p><p>She was still grinning as tears rolled down her cheeks and plopped onto her bare arm. She felt like an idiot, laughing and crying at the same time. She didn\u2019t care about her motor skills; she cared about her life. \u201cHow old ... am I?\u201d</p><p>He paused, glanced at Sarah, and then sighed as he looked back at Kayla.</p><p>They wanted to lie to her; she could see it in their eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t ... please ... don\u2019t lie,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Dr. Penn sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re thirty-nine.\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. Focusing on his gray eyes, she shook her head. \u201cNo ... no ... I\u2019m almost twenty-four. I got married two and a half years ago. Juliana just had her first birthday. I remember all this perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other things\u2014other times\u2014you can\u2019t remember yet. But it\u2019ll come back. It\u2019s best if you let it come back naturally. Just give yourself a little time.\u201d</p><p>It took all her strength of will to formulate one little sentence. \u201cI want ... to see my husband now.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Penn looked at Sarah again, then he nodded. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d</p><p>Kayla tried to keep breathing evenly as they left the room. She climbed back into bed, where she felt safe. Julian would tell her the truth. He would tell her\u2014</p><p>The door opened again. Only it wasn\u2019t Julian; it was another stranger. She shook her head. \u201cNo ... more ...\u201d</p> <p>Slowly he came up to the bed.</p><p>She frowned. She couldn\u2019t marshal her scattered thoughts into a sentence. She wanted to tell him to go away.</p><p>He touched her, grabbed her shoulders, and pulled her gently toward him. She felt like a rag doll, sagging in his arms.</p><p>He stared at her, and his eyes were so green. She\u2019d never seen eyes so filled with comfort. It calmed her, the way he looked at her. \u201cForever,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The word struck a chord deep, deep inside her. She felt her body go still, her heartbeat even out. Even the air in her lungs seemed to refill itself. The word\u2014forever\u2014drifted through her, swirling, meaning something that she couldn\u2019t grasp on to; it found no perch and fluttered away.</p><p>\u201cRemember me,\u201d he said, gently shaking her.</p><p>And all at once, she did. \u201cI do ... remember you,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re the other doctor.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her; it was so unexpected that she fell back into the mound of pillows. She had the strangest thought that she had wounded him. Those green eyes looked so sad ...</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry ...\u201d she whispered, though she had no idea what she\u2019d done to wound this man. \u201cI just ... want to see my husband.\u201d</p><p>As he turned away, she almost called out for him. She wanted him to look at her again, to touch her and make her feel safe, but she knew it was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019ll go get Julian.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Julian sat in the waiting room. He tried to remain calm but couldn\u2019t stop his foot from tapping. There were only two people in the room\u2014him and Stephen\u2014but still it felt airless and crowded. Liam had left a few minutes ago to see Kayla.</p><p>He\u2019d spent most of last night trying to figure out how and when to tell her the truth of their past. Now, here it was, nearly noon, and he was no closer to an answer.</p><p>Liam walked into the room. He looked ... beaten. He pushed a hand through his hair and sighed heavily. Even from this distance, Julian could see that Liam\u2019s hand was shaking.</p><p>He looked at Julian. \u201cShe wants to see her husband.\u201d</p><p>Julian turned to Dr. Penn. \u201cWhat now? You told her she was thirty-nine years old, and then you bolted. What am I supposed to tell her when she asks where she\u2019s been for fifteen years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her where you\u2019ve been.\u201d It was Liam\u2019s voice.</p><p>Julian spun to face him. \u201cYeah, you\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that? I don\u2019t like you even being in the same room with her.\u201d He moved toward Julian. \u201cIf she asks you a direct question, I want you to answer truthfully. You can evade\u2014but don\u2019t lie. Steve said that she left him no room to weasel out of her questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t go see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could they let such a coward play Lizard Man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the Green Menace,\u201d he answered automatically, \u201cand a stand-in did all the dangerous stuff.\u201d Julian\u2019s voice fell to a whisper that only Liam could hear. \u201cI\u2019m ... afraid of hurting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve heard today.\u201d</p><p>Julian waited, but Liam didn\u2019t say anything else. \u201cWell,\u201d he said at last, \u201cI\u2019ll go see her.\u201d</p><p>He ducked out of the room and walked slowly down the hallway. Really slowly.</p><p>At her door he paused. Forcing a bright smile, he opened the door.</p><p>She was asleep.</p><p>He shut the door quietly and went to her bedside. She looked so peaceful, so beautiful ...</p><p>Slowly she blinked awake. \u201cJules? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her. It took an act of pure will to force a smile. \u201cHeya, Kay.\u201d</p><p>She worked herself up to a sit, and by the time she was finished, she was breathing heavily. There was a fine sheen of perspiration on her forehead. \u201cWhere\u2019s Juliana? I want to see my baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here soon, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d She smiled, reaching for him in a jerky, uncontrolled movement. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come back for us.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand and held it tightly. \u201cI missed you, too.\u201d It surprised him, the truth of that simple statement. He had missed Kayla; he\u2019d missed the man he\u2019d once been\u2014the man he could have been with her at his side.</p><p>Her gaze focused on his face, caressing it with equal measures of wonder and confusion. \u201cYou\u2019re older, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice of you to notice. Hey, do you remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we old?\u201d</p><p>He smiled uneasily. \u201cYou\u2019re not even forty yet. Young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian, no one will tell me the truth. But I know you wouldn\u2019t lie to me. Please ... I need to understand.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to lie to her, wanted it with a fierce desperation, but there was no way out.</p><p>\u201cYou have a few gaps in your memory, that\u2019s all. The docs say it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen years is hardly nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll all come back. Don\u2019t rush it.\u201d He leaned down and kissed her. She tasted just like he remembered, all sweet compliance and homecoming. When he kissed her, he felt ... complete.</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget fifteen years of loving you and Juliana? Tell me about us, Jules. Help me remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, baby ...\u201d He would have done anything to erase the sorrow in her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, Kay. The spitting image of you.\u201d</p><p>She gazed up at him, her pale face as serious as he\u2019d ever seen it. \u201cI remember when I left. Do you remember that, Jules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember packing my bags, buying a car\u2014that green station wagon with the wood-grain side panels\u2014and loading it up. I hardly took anything from our life together, not even your money. I was so sure you\u2019d come for us quickly ... I can remember waiting and waiting, but I can\u2019t remember ever seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>He actually thought he might cry; that\u2019s how fucking awful he felt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. Jesus, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long, Jules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-How long what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>He touched her soft, soft cheek. He was cornered; there was no way out of this except to lie\u2014and that was pointless. She might remember it all in ten seconds. \u201cNow,\u201d he answered in a tired, broken voice. \u201cJust now.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cJust now what? I\u2019m thirty-nine years old, that means my\u2014our baby is sixteen. You don\u2019t mean ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now,\u201d he repeated quietly.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes, magnified her pain until it seemed to suck the air from the room. \u201cYou mean ... you never came back for me? In all those years, never?\u201d</p><p>He felt the sting of tears in his own eyes. \u201cI was young and stupid. I didn\u2019t know how special it was between us. It took me a long time to grow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d The single word slipped from her mouth, toneless and dead. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKayla, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike ... I\u2019ve broken your heart.\u201d</p><p>She tried to wipe her eyes, but her effort was a failure; she slapped her own cheek. \u201cI guess you did that a long time ago\u2014and lucky me, I get to experience it twice. Oh, Jules.\u201d She sagged into the pillows. \u201cI love you so much. But it\u2019s not enough, is it?\u201d She turned her head and closed her eyes. \u201cI wish I\u2019d forgotten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Please ...\u201d He wanted to kiss her tears away, but he had no right. He had hurt her again, as he\u2019d known he would, and he regretted it more deeply than he would have thought possible. Suddenly he saw all the chances he\u2019d lost. For the first time, he wanted the years back, wanted to have become the kind of man who knew how to love.</p><p>She rolled awkwardly onto her side. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKayla, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, Julian. Please.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d had Liam\u2019s courage, he would have known what to say, but as it was, he was empty. He turned away from her and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cI want to see my daughter,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, saying nothing, not knowing if she even knew he\u2019d answered. Then he left.</p><p>She wanted to curl into a small, safe ball and close out the world again.</p><p>He never came back.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to grasp that. It broke her, pure and simple. For a long, long time, she lay in her lonely bed, trying to wrap her arms around a truth that was too big to hold.</p><p>What had she been doing all these years? If things were normal, if she were normal, would she have laughed at him and told him to run along, that her love for him had died a long time ago?</p><p>That was the hell of it. She didn\u2019t know who she\u2019d become in the years after their parting. Everything she\u2019d learned or touched or believed in was gone, along with all the memories that, when sewn together, scrap by scrap, made up a life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And what about her daughter, her baby girl who hadn\u2019t been a baby in years? She remembered a pudgy, brown-eyed toddler with a halo of jet-black curls, a little girl who could go from hysterical sobbing to laughter in a heartbeat. She remembered the feel of that baby in her arms, but after that, nothing. No images came to her of frilly Easter bonnets or lunch boxes or loose teeth. Fifteen blank years, as unknown as tomorrow.</p><p>She wished she could be angry; it was so much better than this aching, overwhelming sorrow.</p><p>In her heart, she was twenty-four years old and deeply in love with her husband. Only he wasn\u2019t her husband and she\u2019d had fifteen long years to heal the wounds he\u2019d inflicted.</p><p>Fifteen years that had been wiped out.</p> <p>Without memories, there was no passage of time, no change, no growth. There was just this love for Julian, this runaway train of emotion that she could do nothing but ride.</p><p>He must have nearly killed her with his betrayal. She knew that because when she\u2019d said the word never, she\u2019d felt it in her heart and soul. She\u2019d loved him too much\u2014and it would destroy her, that bad and dangerous love. But knowing a thing didn\u2019t change it.</p><p>The door opened. \u201cMikita, you are awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>Rosa stood in the doorway, smiling brightly.</p> <p>Mikaela gasped, brought a shaking hand to her mouth. \u201cOh, Mama ...\u201d</p><p>The years had been hard on Rosa. Her hair was snow-white now, her dark skin creased heavily around the eyes and mouth. Mikaela wanted to ask \u201cWhat happened?\u201d but before the question was even formed, she knew the answer. Bad love.</p><p>Rosa came up to her bedside. She touched Mikaela\u2019s cheek, said softly, \u201cA milagro.\u201d Then she bent down and scooped Mikaela into a hug. \u201cI never think to see you smile again, hija.\u201d She drew back.</p><p>Mikaela\u2019s throat constricted. \u201cHola, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have missed you very much.\u201d Rosa held on to Mikaela\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to me, Mama? No one will tell me.\u201d</p> <p>Rosa picked up a brush from the bedside table and began brushing Mikaela\u2019s short hair. \u201cYou fell from a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they tell me. What in the hell was I doing on a horse?\u201d</p><p>Rosa smiled. \u201cYou remember the bad language, I am not happy to say. In the past years, you have become the good horse rider. It is something you love.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela grabbed her mother\u2019s thin wrist. \u201cTell me about Juliana, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Rosa carefully set down the brush. Her bony fingers curled around the bed rail. \u201cWe call her Jacey now, and she is everything you would wish for in a daughter.\u201d She gazed down at Mikaela, her eyes glistening. \u201cShe is beautiful and gifted and loving and muy intelligente. And popular\u2014I have never heard the phone ring so much. Look around this room, Mikita, and tell me what you see.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Mikaela looked around the room. There were flowers and balloons everywhere; cards lined the tables and the windowsill. \u201cAre they all from Julian?\u201d</p><p>Rosa made a sweeping gesture with her hand. \u201cNot from that one. They are from your friends. This is your home now, Mikaela. It is a wonderful place, not like Sunville at all. Every shop I go in, someone asks about you. The women, they bring food to the house every day. Here, mi hija, you are much loved.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela couldn\u2019t imagine that she\u2019d found a real home, a place to belong, and not to remember that, it wasn\u2019t fair ...</p> <p>She looked up at her mother. \u201cHe never came for me, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. This was hard on you before. Maybe it is even harder now. Then, you remembered why you left him. Now, I think maybe you forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Rosa didn\u2019t answer for a moment. Then, softly, she said, \u201cIt will ... wound her heart ... this forgetfulness. Dr. Liam wishes for you to have another day to remember, s\u00ed? You do not want to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela didn\u2019t know how she could survive the heartache seeping through her. \u201cI remember how it feels when a parent doesn\u2019t know you. I remember this from ... my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have never called him this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sighed tiredly. \u201cBut calling him something else doesn\u2019t make him someone else, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rosa reached into her pocket, pulling out a photograph. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela\u2019s fingers didn\u2019t work right. It took her several tries to grasp the picture, and even then, Rosa had to gently guide her daughter\u2019s fingers. She stared down at the picture\u2014it was of Mikaela and Rosa and a beautiful young girl. They were standing in an unfamiliar room, beside a gorgeous, wonderfully decorated Christmas tree.</p><p>Mikaela\u2019s hungry gaze took in every detail about the girl\u2014the brown eyes, the easy smile, the waist-length black hair. \u201cThis is my Juliana ... No, my Jacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. The memories, they are in you, Mikaela. Place this fotograf\u00eda next to your heart and sleep well. Your heart will remember what your mind forgets.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela stared down into the eyes so like her own. Try as she might, she couldn\u2019t remember holding this little girl, or stroking her hair, or kissing her cheek. \u201cOh, Mama,\u201d she whispered, and at last she cried.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Not long after lunch, Mikaela fell asleep.</p><p>She knew she was dreaming now. It was the first dream she\u2019d had since waking up, and there was a comforting familiarity in the sensation. In her dream, the world was a hazy smear of blues and greens. A gentle summer breeze fluttered through the towering evergreen trees.</p><p>She was walking along a deserted road. Her body was working perfectly, no right leg dragging along behind her, no fingers that wouldn\u2019t close. She came around a bend in the gravel road and saw an imposing wooden barn set on the crest of a hill. In the fields around it, there were horses standing in a group, munching contentedly on sweet green grass that came up to their hocks.</p><p>She kept moving, floating almost, past the barn, toward a beautiful log house.</p><p>A bank of gray clouds moved in suddenly, obliterating the lemon sunshine, casting the log house in shadow. It began to rain, spits of cold water that landed on her upturned cheeks like God\u2019s own teardrops.</p><p>The front door opened for her.</p><p>She stumbled on the porch steps. Crying out, she grasped the railing and a splinter drove deep into the tender flesh of her palm. When she lifted her hand, she saw the bright, ruby-red trail of blood snaking down her wrist.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she tried to say, but the wind snatched her words away, and she was still walking, across the porch, into the house.</p><p>The door slammed shut behind her. She felt her way down the smooth wooden wall toward a staircase she somehow knew was there.</p><p>At the bottom, she paused, listening. Somewhere in this cold, dark house, a child was crying.</p><p>I\u2019m coming. The words played across Mikaela\u2019s mind but didn\u2019t quite reach her mouth. She was moving again, running this time.</p><p>The cries became louder, more insistent. Mikaela had a fleeting, heartbreaking image of a little boy, red-haired, sucking his thumb. He was tucked back in a corner, waiting for his mommy to come for him.</p><p>But there were a hundred doors in front of her, and the hallway stretched for miles, fading out of focus at its end. She ran down the corridor, yanking open doors. Behind those doors lay nothing, yawning black rectangles spangled with starlight, breathing a cold winter wind.</p><p>All at once, the crying stopped. The silence terrified her. She was too late ... too late ...</p><p>She woke with a start. The ceiling above her was made of white acoustical tiles, their pattern sharp and bright after the hazy quality of her dream.</p><p>The hospital.</p><p>There was a man standing by her window. Her first thought was Julian\u2014but then she noticed that he was wearing a white coat.</p><p>He turned toward her, and she saw that it wasn\u2019t Dr. Penn. It was the other one\u2014what was his name? He was a tall man, with longish blond hair and a nice face. He reminded her of an aged version of that actor from Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. Jeff Bridges, that was his name. It disgusted her that she could remember an actor\u2019s name, and practically none of her own life.</p><p>\u201cYou need a haircut.\u201d The words just popped out of her mouth, and she winced. What on earth had made her say that to this man?</p><p>He ran a hand through his shaggy hair and smiled, but it was a sad smile, and she wondered why he looked so ... forlorn. \u201cYeah, I suppose I do. My ... wife cuts my hair.\u201d</p><p>When he spoke, it sent a shiver through her. \u201cYou\u2019re the voice,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He pulled up a chair and sat down beside her bed. He stared at her boldly, without apology, and there was something in his eyes\u2014a yearning, maybe\u2014that made her want to touch him. But that was crazy; she didn\u2019t even know him.</p><p>\u201cWhat voice?\u201d he said at last.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was asleep, I heard you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d be able to. It seemed like I talked forever.\u201d</p><p>Forever. That word again. It teased her, tickled some forgotten chord. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He studied her for a minute. \u201cDr. Liam Campbell.\u201d</p><p>Somehow she knew that wasn\u2019t right. She looked around the room, at the photographs along the window that she hadn\u2019t bothered to look at, and the bottles of fragrant spices, at the lovely pond filled with slick black rocks. She knew without knowing that this was the man who\u2019d played the endless stream of her favorite songs. He was the one who\u2019d given her something to hang on to through all that darkness.</p><p>And it was this man\u2014this stranger with the sad, familiar eyes\u2014who\u2019d been here at her bedside for all those days, talking, touching, waiting. She could remember the feel of his hand stroking her hair while she slept, and the sound of his laugh. Somehow she knew that, too. She knew that he had a booming, throaty laugh that filled a room and begged you to join in.</p><p>\u201cI remember how you laugh,\u201d she said, amazed.</p><p>That seemed to please him. He smiled. \u201cThe memories will come like that, in bits and pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Li\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Who are you to me?\u201d</p><p>His whole body seemed to deflate, to sink into that ugly chair. Slowly he stood up and reached for her left hand. He caressed her fingers, so tenderly that her breath caught in her throat. She couldn\u2019t remember ever being touched in just such a way, and then something came to her, some half-formed memory that couldn\u2019t quite be reached. \u201cThis ring,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI put it on your finger ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the ring. A wedding ring. \u201cYou\u2019re ...\u201d She couldn\u2019t seem to form the word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your husband.\u201d</p><p>It was incomprehensible. \u201cBut ... Julian ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian was your first husband.\u201d</p><p>She panicked. First a child, now a husband. How much had she forgotten? How much more was out there?</p><p>She stared at him, shaking her head in denial. She wanted to say It can\u2019t be, but in the last few days, she knew that anything could be. \u201cHow could I forget such a thing? How could I have ... no feeling for you at all?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He flinched, and in that tiny expression of pain, she knew it was true. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay not to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what to say to you ... Liam.\u201d She tried out the name on her tongue, but nothing came with it. It was just a collection of vowels and consonants that had no meaning.</p><p>He touched her face. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t okay. It was a long, long way from okay. This man was her husband, her husband, and she had no feelings for him whatsoever. He was her family now, what she\u2019d done for the past ten years. At some point she must have stopped loving Julian and started loving this gentle, quiet man. But what would happen now that she only remembered the love for Julian?</p> <p>She tried to smile at him, but it was a trembling failure. \u201cTell me about our life together.\u201d These were the words that slipped from her lips, but what she meant was Make me love you again ...</p><p>He smiled, and she knew he was recalling a memory that was now his alone. \u201cYou were a nurse then. I first met you when you cared for my father ...\u201d He looked at her. \u201cDo you mind if I hold your hand?\u201d</p><p>It surprised her, that request. There was something so ... gentle and old-fashioned about it. She couldn\u2019t help thinking how different he was from Julian. Jules would never ask; it would never occur to him that his touch might not be welcomed. \u201cOkay, sure,\u201d she said.</p><p>Their gazes met and held. She felt awkward suddenly, confused by this man who was both a stranger and her husband.</p><p>Husband.</p> <p>\u201cKinda weird, huh?\u201d he said with a crooked, nervous grin.</p><p>She smiled in return and leaned toward him, studying his face, searching for something, some vagrant memory. But there was nothing. Still, he had the kindest eyes she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cThis must be hard on you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThe coma was harder.\u201d</p><p>Somehow she didn\u2019t think so. \u201cAre you the one ... did you call Julian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. If you and I are married now, why would you do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t ... wake you up. I sat here every day, holding your hand, talking to you, playing your favorite music. I did everything I could think of to reach you, but ... day after day, you just lay there.\u201d His voice fell to a throaty whisper. \u201cI knew I was losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Julian?\u201d</p><p>He let out a long, sighing breath. \u201cBecause, Mikaela, I knew.\u201d</p><p>She felt her heart skip a beat. \u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you never completely stopped ... loving him.\u201d</p><p>For a heartbeat, she forgot to breathe. \u201cYou loved me very much.\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the wonder from her voice. She could never remember feeling this way before, this awesome mixture of joy and sadness, this feeling of being ... loved deeply and completely. Julian\u2019s love wasn\u2019t like that. It was a blast of red-hot fireworks that exploded in Technicolor around you, but when it died, it left a cold, black sky behind.</p><p>\u201cI still do,\u201d he said, smiling down at her with a sadness that wrenched her heart.</p><p>\u201cI must have loved you, too.\u201d</p> <p>He paused a moment too long before answering. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And she knew. \u201cI stayed in love with Julian, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Somehow it hurt, that realization. \u201cI hurt you,\u201d she said softly, sadly. \u201cDid I know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d</p><p>She gazed up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>There was more to say, and no way she could think of to say it all. How could you apologize for what you couldn\u2019t remember?</p><p>Or worse, for what you were afraid you were going to do all over again?</p><p>It began simply enough, with the whooshing sound of the electronic doors opening. Julian sat in the lobby, staring at the wall clock. The slim black hands seemed to be stuck at 2:45. Liam was in with Kayla now, and he\u2019d asked Julian to wait for him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Juli.\u201d</p><p>Julian looked up and saw Val sauntering toward him. Instead of his usual faded jeans and movie T-shirt, his agent was wearing a black Hilfiger suit with a dyed-to-match silk shirt and tie. His blond hair had been recently styled and cut; only a fringe of curls lay against his shoulders. He hadn\u2019t bothered to remove the Ray-Bans that shielded his eyes.</p><p>Julian would have smiled if he hadn\u2019t felt so damned bad. \u201cThis is Last Bend, you idiot, not Cannes. The only designer they know around here is L.L. Bean.\u201d He got to his feet and turned.</p><p>That\u2019s when he saw them. Outside, beyond the wall of windows that flanked the front doors, the vans and rental cars were already lining up. People in rumpled black clothes streamed out of those cars like locusts, gathering in a semicircle.</p><p>He\u2019d seen it enough times to know the sequence by heart. The media circus coming to town. \u201cJesus, Val, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>Val lifted his hands, Christ-like. \u201cYou\u2019re white-hot, Juli. A few words whispered in a few ears and the story spread like wildfire. I have to admit, I didn\u2019t expect this kind of turnout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Val, I told you not to\u2014\u201d He stopped. It was too late. They\u2019d seen him.</p><p>Reporters swarmed through the doorway, microphones at the ready, cameras stationed on their shoulders. Within seconds, Julian and Val were engulfed. Val winked at him. \u201cToo late to hide now, Juli.\u201d</p><p>Julian had to get them out of here. He pushed through the crowd and headed outside, into the freezing cold. The locusts followed, firing questions.</p><p>\u201cJulian? Is it true? Have you found your Cinderella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow badly is she hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come there\u2019s no Kayla True registered in this hospital? Is this a hoax?\u201d</p><p>Julian held up his hands, forcing his trademark smile. Flashbulbs popped like gum in a whore\u2019s mouth, cords slithered across his feet. \u201cThere\u2019s no story here, boys and girls. I\u2019m here for the Make-a-Wish Foundation. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Val thumped him on the back. Hard. \u201cHe\u2019s too shy to tell you the truth. You all know that Juli\u2019s first wife, Kayla, was the love of his life. Unfortunately, they were too young ...\u201d He paused and glanced around.</p><p>Val had them\u2014hook, line, and sinker. Julian could see it in the reporters\u2019 feverish eyes, hear it in the sudden, indrawn silence.</p><p>Julian\u2019s best intentions cracked under the strain. God help him, he couldn\u2019t let Val hog the spotlight. \u201cYou can imagine how I felt when I heard that she\u2019d had an accident. I rushed up here to be at her bedside\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did they call you?\u201d someone shouted out.</p><p>\u201cI was told that Kayla had suffered a serious head injury\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she brain damaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why she asked for Julian!\u201d</p><p>Val touched Julian\u2019s shoulder lightly, taking the reins of the story again. \u201cShe was in a coma for a month. For a while it looked hopeless ...\u201d He hesitated, shaking his head sadly. \u201cThen the doctors discovered that Kayla responded to only one thing\u2014the sound of Julian\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>A gasp rippled through the crowd; they recognized the taste and feel of it, the story that had just been handed to them. Several reporters glanced at their watches, trying to figure out how to get to their editors before the rest of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, Julian raced up here,\u201d Val said. \u201cHe sat with her, day after day, talking to her, holding her hand, reminding her that there was a man who loved her and was waiting for her to waken.\u201d He gave them a brilliant, here-comes-the-good-part smile. \u201cYesterday she woke up. Julian was beside her. The first person she saw.\u201d</p><p>One of the female reporters sighed. \u201cWhat were her first words?\u201d</p><p>Julian started to answer; no one was listening. \u201cShe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she brain damaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still in love with you, Julian?\u201d</p><p>Julian sighed. They didn\u2019t care about the miracle of Kayla\u2019s awakening. All they wanted was \u201cthe story,\u201d the gilt-edged fairy tale\u2014or, better yet, a scandal. A death. Anything sensational.</p><p>He looked around, at the faces. A few he recognized. They came and went, these low-rent reporters from the tabloids. It wasn\u2019t a job that any normal human being could stomach for long.</p><p>They were a reflection of his life. Funny, but he\u2019d never realized that before. He\u2019d always dismissed the media as a necessary evil; you couldn\u2019t get famous without them. But now he saw the empty black space that ringed the spotlight. Nothing captured in a glass lens was real.</p><p>But Julian had no life except that which was filmed, and that made him the blankest spot of all. He\u2019d traded everything real for the split-second brightness of a camera\u2019s flash.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough for today,\u201d he said, wishing he\u2019d never talked to them.</p><p>Val grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your headline, kids. The kiss of True love wakes up Sleeping Beauty.\u201d</p><p>As Liam walked out of Stephen\u2019s office, he heard his name paged over the hospital\u2019s system. He grabbed the nearest phone and punched in his code. The message was from Rosa. She was waiting for him in the lobby. It was an emergency.</p><p>He saw Rosa before she saw him. She was standing in the center of the room\u2014unusual for a woman who always sat in a corner with her head down\u2014with her arms crossed. Even from this distance, he could see the way her mouth was drawn into an angry line.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>Up close, he could see the worry lines etched around her eyes and mouth. \u201cRosa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see what he has done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI am muy upset. I am listening to the radio at home while I make the tortillas for tonight\u2019s supper, s\u00ed? And I hear the local news.\u201d She cocked her head toward the hospital\u2019s front doors, where a crowd was gathered around Julian. \u201cIt is the big story, Dr. Liam. They are saying that Julian brought his true love out of a coma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Liam ran down the hall and into the lobby. He saw the crowd gathered outside, and headed for the doors.</p><p>Reporters circled Julian, angled toward him like supplicants, microphones instead of prayer books in their outstretched hands. They all talked at once, their questions climbing over each other in a frenzied outburst.</p><p>\u201cWhen will we get to interview Kayla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will we get a shot of the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has she been doing all of these years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two going to get married again?\u201d</p><p>Liam grabbed Julian by the arm and spun him around. Trying not to look at the reporters, he said in a quiet voice, \u201cI need to speak to you. Now.\u201d</p><p>Julian had the grace to look embarrassed. \u201cSure thing, Doc.\u201d He threw the crowd a false smile. \u201cThis here is Liam Campbell. He\u2019s Kayla\u2019s ... doctor.\u201d</p><p>The crowd had a dozen simultaneous questions. Liam ignored them. Hanging on to Julian\u2019s arm, he dragged him into the lobby, past Rosa, and into an empty examining room.</p><p>An instant later, the door opened and Rosa walked in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Rosa,\u201d Julian said, then turned to Liam. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Liam. I told my agent to keep the press away, but he ignored me. Really, I\u2019m sorry. And believe me, they\u2019re like termites\u2014once they infest your house, you have to deal with them. If I didn\u2019t talk to them, God knows what story they\u2019d come up with. At least this way it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked at him. \u201cYour truth, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spoon-fed them a romance, haven\u2019t you, with you as the hero of the piece, the white knight who arrived in a black limousine and pulled her back from the brink of death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have not heard the worst of it, Dr. Liam,\u201d Rosa said, shuffling toward the two men. \u201cWhen I was walking into the hospital, I heard the questions. The reporters were asking about his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d Liam grabbed Julian by the shoulders and shook him. \u201cTell me you protected her. Tell me you didn\u2019t say a goddamn word about your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Julian winced. \u201cI protected her\u2014honestly, but</p><p>Val ... he told them that she was a cheerleader at the high school.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in his life, Liam punched a man. He drew back his fist and slammed it into Julian\u2019s pretty-boy jaw. Pain radiated all the way up his arm. \u201cThere are only eight cheerleaders at the high school.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to his mother-in-law. \u201cYou stay here with Mike. Keep the press away from her. I\u2019ll get the kids and be back as soon as I can. We\u2019ll come in through the back way.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Please let me get to her in time.</p><p>Liam glanced at the clock on the Explorer\u2019s dashboard: 3:05. Cheerleader practice ended five minutes ago ...</p><p>He pressed harder on the gas. At the entrance to the high school, he knew he was going too fast. When he turned the wheel, the tires skidded sideways. For a split second, he lost control of the car. Then the tires grabbed hold. The car hurtled down the driveway and into the parking lot.</p><p>He was too late. Already there was a crowd of reporters outside the school\u2019s front doors. Klieg lights stood on their perimeter like black insects. They were all talking at once; their combined voices sounded like the start-up of a buzz saw.</p> <p>Liam lurched out of the car and ran toward them. The ground was slick and mushy with old snow, and twice he almost fell. By the time he reached the sidewalk, his heart was hammering.</p><p>\u201cJacey!\u201d His voice was lost in the din.</p><p>Reporters circled the small group of cheerleaders like a pack of wolves, jockeying for position, making it impossible for Liam to get through. They were shouting out questions, one after another.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you is Juliana?\u201d</p><p>He heard Mrs. Kurek, the cheerleader adviser, answer, \u201cThere\u2019s no Juliana here, now go away.\u201d</p><p>Liam tried to see above the crowd, but there were lights and cameras everywhere, and the reporters knew how to close access.</p><p>He screamed his daughter\u2019s name, trying to push through the sardine-packed bodies. It was impossible.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you has a mother in a coma?\u201d</p> <p>He knew that all it would take is a look at Jacey ...</p><p>\u201cThere she is!\u201d</p><p>The mob shifted, separated, and came back together around Jacey, cutting her off from everyone else with practiced ease. Wolves separating a baby lamb from the herd.</p><p>\u201cAre you Kayla\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you Juliana?\u201d</p><p>He could see that Jacey was breathing heavily. She was afraid. \u201cI\u2019m Jacey,\u201d she answered softly. \u201cMy mom\u2019s in a coma....\u201d</p><p>A microphone flew at her face, almost hit her in the nose. \u201cHow does it feel to be his daughter?\u201d</p><p>Liam screamed her name. He grabbed hold of the cameraman in front of him and shoved. The camera fell to the ground, the man stumbled sideways.</p><p>Liam surged through the opening. \u201cJace\u2014come here!\u201d</p><p>Above the crowd, their gazes met. Liam saw the fear in his daughter\u2019s eyes. He saw when she gave way to panic; not all at once, but in little breaths. He plowed through the crush of bodies. She held out her hands toward him.</p><p>He pushed and shoved his way forward, his hands outstretched, fingertips straining to touch hers.</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel to be Julian True\u2019s daughter?\u201d someone yelled out.</p><p>A hush fell. Jacey looked at Liam, her mouth open, her eyes widening in shock.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, she doesn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove in, Bert, get a shot of her face\u2014now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGET AWAY FROM HER!\u201d Liam screamed the words. He threw himself forward, knocking people aside, ramming them with his elbows.</p><p>At last he was at her side. He slipped an arm around Jacey and pulled her close. He could feel her trembling. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey,\u201d he whispered in her ear, even though he knew it wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d someone shouted at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the doctor,\u201d someone else said. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has no comment.\u201d Liam heard the snarl in his voice; it was an unfamiliar sound that came from a dark place deep inside him. He dragged a dazed Jacey through the crowd and helped her into the Explorer.</p><p>The reporters followed them all the way, still shouting out questions and popping photographs. The last thing Liam heard as he slammed the car door was \u201cGet the license plate number.\u201d</p><p>He started the engine and hit the gas. The car surged forward, tires spinning on the slushy snow, and spun out of the parking lot.</p><p>His heart was hammering, and there was a coppery fear taste in his mouth. He\u2019d never felt so ashamed and defeated in his life. He had failed to protect her. It was his fault. The daughter he loved more than his own life had been hurt.</p><p>Jacey twisted around in her seat, watching the road behind them. \u201cThey\u2019re not following us,\u201d she said in a watered-down version of her ordinary voice.</p><p>Liam veered left onto the snowy, unmaintained forest service road that led to Angel Falls State Park. He chose this road because it only appeared on the most detailed maps of the area. No one would follow them here.</p><p>When they reached the end of the road, they found the empty parking lot as pristine as a new sheet of paper. In the late afternoon it was dark in these deep woods.</p><p>He parked near the information board, a rough-hewn wooden pyramid that told the story of these falls, discovered and named by Ian Campbell in honor of his beloved wife.</p><p>Liam took a deep breath and turned at last to his daughter. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get to you fast enough.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, her dark eyes confused and afraid. \u201cIs it true, Dad?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to be angry with Mike right now, but as it was, all he felt was cold and hollow. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Your mom was married to Julian True.\u201d</p><p>The color faded from her cheeks. She looked impossibly young and vulnerable. \u201cHe\u2019s my father?\u201d</p><p>Father. The word hit Liam like a blow to the larynx. For a moment he couldn\u2019t speak, and when he did find his voice, it was dull and flat. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rounded. \u201cOh, my God ...\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to say more, but she remained silent. It felt to Liam as if seawater were rising between them, rising, becoming a rippling wall that distorted their images. He tried to think of what it was that he should say, but that emptiness was inside him again, bleeding into the silence. Finally he told her the only truth that mattered. \u201cI should have told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why he\u2019s really in town? To see Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know he was my father?\u201d</p><p>He understood the question. She didn\u2019t want to believe that he had lied to her all these years, and as much as he wanted to protect Mike, he wouldn\u2019t deceive Jacey. That\u2019s why she was so hurt now. \u201cI heard the same stories you did. Mike told me that she\u2019d been married too young, to a man who only wanted to party and have fun. I didn\u2019t know it was Julian. I found out the truth when I went looking for that dress you wore to the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way she wouldn\u2019t ever talk about my other dad ... I figured he was a bum or a bad guy. Some loser she met in college.\u201d She paused, looking at him. \u201cWhen I was little, she used to cry every time I asked about him, so I stopped asking. Jeez ... Julian True.\u201d</p><p>Liam tried not to be hurt by the tiny, hitching smile that tugged at her mouth. What teenager wouldn\u2019t be thrilled to find out that a famous movie star was her father? It didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d turn away from the father who\u2019d always been there for her, holding her hand, kissing away her little girl\u2019s tears. At least that\u2019s what he told himself as the silence between them stretched on and on.</p><p>\u201cWhen was she going to tell me? When we colonize Mars?\u201d</p><p>It had come faster than he\u2019d expected, the anger, and he didn\u2019t know how to assuage it. There was no way to excuse what Mike had done to her. It was selfish and hurtful, and now, these many years later, they would all pay for the lie that had lain between them, curled silently in a silk pillowcase.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know when she was going to tell you,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>He could see that she was close to crying. She seemed to be holding the tears back one shallow breath at a time. \u201cThat\u2019s why he came to the prom\u2014to dance with me\u2014but he didn\u2019t say anything that mattered. How did he know Mom was hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called him. I ... discovered that your mom responded to his name. I thought that if he talked to her, she might wake up, and it worked. She woke up yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian woke her up\u2014after all the hours we all spent talking to her?\u201d</p><p>Liam winced. He felt hemmed in by all the times he\u2019d told Jacey that love would reach Mikaela in her darkness. \u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, what if ...\u201d This time she couldn\u2019t hold back the tears. She launched herself at Liam, landing in his arms as if she were a child again. She cried on his shoulder. The warm moisture of her tears seeped through his flannel shirt. When she drew back, she looked different somehow, changed, as if the tears had washed away the last, sticky traces of the little girl she\u2019d been and made room for a young woman.</p><p>\u201cI hate her.\u201d At the confession, she started crying again.</p><p>He touched her face. \u201cNo. You\u2019re hurt and angry\u2014and you have every right to be. But you could never hate your mom. She loves you, Jace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? She lied to you all these years, too.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cSometimes people lie to protect their loved ones. Maybe she thought ... we couldn\u2019t handle the truth.\u201d</p><p>Jacey sniffed, wiped her nose with the back of her hand. Her eyes were glazed with tears as she looked at him, her mouth quavered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want me, did he? That\u2019s why he never called or wrote.\u201d</p><p>Liam wanted to lie to her, but it was lies that had brought them to this sorry, painful place in their lives. \u201cI don\u2019t know Julian well enough to answer that.\u201d</p><p>He could see that she was shocked and confused and angry. The truth had pushed her out on a twisting, narrow road, and only she could find her way. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jace. For all of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gazed at him, tears sliding down her cheeks. \u201cI love you ... Dad.\u201d</p><p>He heard the tiny hesitation, the way her voice snagged on the hook of new information, before she called him Dad. \u201cI love you, too, Jace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still a family,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou remember that. Your mom loves you and Bret\u2014oh, shit, Bret.\u201d He jerked back so hard his head hit the window.</p><p>\u201cThe reporters.\u201d Jacey slid back into her seat and clamped the seat belt in place. \u201cIt\u2019s three-thirty. He\u2019s in music class.\u201d</p> <p>Bret was getting cranky. They\u2019d been practicing for the Christmas assembly for more than an hour, and he, like most of the boys, hated standing still. They were all in rows, all the fourth and fifth graders, standing side by side on three risers. The music teacher, Mrs. Barnett, had organized them by height, which meant that the girls were next to the boys, and that was always a problem.</p><p>Mrs. B. rapped her wooden pointer on the metal music stand. \u201cCome on, children, pay attention. Now, let\u2019s try the last verse again.\u201d Mrs. B. raised her poker and nodded at Mr. Adam, who was sitting at the piano in the corner. At the cue, he started playing \u201cSilent Night.\u201d</p><p>Bret couldn\u2019t remember a single word.</p><p>Katie elbowed him, hard. \u201cSing.\u201d</p><p>He hit her back. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p> <p>She pinched him, right in the fat part of his upper arm. \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>Katie slammed her arms down and stomped one foot so hard the whole riser shuddered. \u201cMrs. Barnett,\u201d she yelled in a shrill, gloating voice, \u201cBret Campbell isn\u2019t singing.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Adam\u2019s fingers stumbled on the keys. There was a confused jangle of notes, and then silence.</p><p>Katie flashed Bret a satisfied smile.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. Like he cared.</p> <p>Slowly Mrs. B. lowered her pointer. \u201cNow, Katherine, that\u2019s not really your concern, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks everything is her concern,\u201d someone said, laughing.</p><p>Katie blushed. It was totally cool the way her whole face turned red. \u201cB-But you said we all\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mrs. B. smiled at Bret, but it was a weird smile, sorta wiggly and sad. \u201cLet\u2019s not pick on Bret. We all know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bret stuck his tongue out at Katie.</p><p>\u201c\u2014that his mom just woke up, and that it\u2019s been a hard time for the family.\u201d</p><p>We all know his mom woke up.</p><p>Bret couldn\u2019t breathe. It couldn\u2019t be true. Dad would have told him if Mommy woke up. But Mrs. B. said it ...</p> <p>He clutched Katie\u2019s arm to steady himself.</p><p>She let out a little squeal, then opened her mouth to tell on him again. Only nothing came out. Instead, she frowned at Bret. \u201cYou look gross. Are you gonna puke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daddy wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>Suddenly the door to the music room banged open and Jacey stood in the opening. Her face was all red and streaked, as if she\u2019d been crying. \u201cMrs. Barnett,\u201d she said, \u201cI need to take Bret home now.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. B. nodded. \u201cGo along, Bret.\u201d</p><p>Bret wrenched away from Katie so hard that four kids fell backward off the risers. He could hear everyone whispering, and he knew they were talking about him. Something else he didn\u2019t care about.</p><p>He walked around the curious circle of his friends. Now he didn\u2019t care if everyone saw that he was almost crying. He just wanted Mrs. B. to say that it was a mistake. Daddy would definitely have told Bret if Mom was awake.</p><p>He went to his sister. He felt very small all of a sudden, like a broken-legged action figure staring up at G.I. Joe, and his heart was beating so fast he felt dizzy. \u201cIs Mommy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Bretster.\u201d She grabbed his arm and dragged him out of the music room and down the hall. Outside, the Explorer was parked in the bus loading zone\u2014a complete and total no-no at this time of day. The buses would be pulling up any minute. He saw that his dad was in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>This is bad.</p><p>Bret allowed himself to be loaded into the backseat like a bag of grain. Jacey strapped him into his seat, then jumped into the front seat. Before Bret could even think of what to say, they were speeding through town. People were all over the streets, putting up decorations for the Glacier Days Festival this weekend, but Dad didn\u2019t wave to a single person. And he was driving way too fast.</p><p>Bret wanted to ask something, to scream something, but it felt like Superman was squeezing his throat.</p><p>Dad pulled the car up to the back door of the hospital. He didn\u2019t even look at Bret, just at Jacey. \u201cStay with your brother. Stay away from the lobby. I have to talk to Sam in Administration. I\u2019ll meet you in the cafeteria in ten minutes, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jacey nodded.</p><p>Then Daddy was gone, running off ahead of them, and Jacey and Bret were walking down the empty hallway in the back of the hospital. Their footsteps echoed, and it was creepy. At every noise, Bret flinched.</p><p>She was dead. He was sure of it this time. When he got to his mommy\u2019s room, the bed would be empty, and it would be too late for him to see her ...</p><p>He yanked away from his sister and ran toward his mother\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cBret\u2014come back!\u201d</p><p>He ignored her and kept running. At his mom\u2019s room, he skidded to a stop and pulled the door open.</p><p>There was Mommy, lying in that old bed just like always. Asleep.</p><p>He stumbled. It was only because he was clutching the doorknob that he didn\u2019t fall.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know which emotion was stronger: relief that Dad hadn\u2019t lied, or disappointment that she wasn\u2019t awake.</p><p>He shut the door quietly and went to Mommy\u2019s bed.</p><p>It still scared him, to see her like this. Even though she was still pretty, and Daddy had shown Bret the important things\u2014like the rosy pink on her cheeks and the way her chest rose and fell with every breath\u2014</p><p>All good signs, Daddy always said.</p><p>But to Bret, she looked like she was dead. He had to keep telling himself that she was alive.</p><p>It\u2019s still her, Bretster. You remember that.</p><p>He tried to take strength from Dad\u2019s words. His dad, who wouldn\u2019t lie, said Mommy was alive ... somewhere.</p><p>Bret moved in closer and climbed up the bed rail, leaning over her. He was so close, he could feel the softness of her breath against his eyelashes. Then he closed his eyes and tried to think of a happy memory of her.</p><p>Well, I guess any boy big enough to saddle his own horse is old enough to go on an overnight ride ... I\u2019m proud of you, Bretster.</p><p>He knew the memory would make him cry, and it did. All he could think about was the way she\u2019d dropped to her knees on the cold cement floor and hugged him. He missed her hugs most of all ... maybe even more than her kisses.</p><p>He heard the door open behind him, then the soft sound of his sister\u2019s footsteps. \u201cCome on, Bret. Dad told us to meet him in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a sec.\u201d He leaned a little closer and gave her the Mommy Kiss, just exactly how she always did it to him: a quick kiss on the forehead, one on each cheek and a butterfly kiss on the chin, then a longer kiss on the right side of the nose. While his lips were brushed against her nose, he whispered the magic words: \u201cNo bad dreams.\u201d</p><p>When he drew back, his heart was hurting. A tear leaked down his cheek and splashed on Mommy\u2019s lip.</p><p>And, very slowly, she opened her eyes.</p><p>Bret almost fell off the bed.</p><p>She eased up to a sit and stared at him. He waited and waited, but she didn\u2019t smile. \u201cWell, hello, little boy.\u201d</p><p>At last she smiled, but it was all wrong.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t his mommy.</p><p>Bret opened his mouth; nothing came out. All this time, he\u2019d waited and prayed, and in every dream he had, his mom said the same thing when she woke up. How\u2019s my favorite boy in the whole world? And then she\u2019d sweep him into her arms and hold him like she always did ...</p><p>Tears burned his eyes.</p><p>The lady who wore his mommy\u2019s face frowned. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>They were the wrong words. His real mommy would have said, Those can\u2019t be tears in my big boy\u2019s eyes ...</p><p>No, he meant to say, even if it was a lie, but when he opened his mouth, nothing came out except his own breath.</p><p>The fake mommy looked around the room. Her gaze caught on Jacey, who was standing by the door, hugging herself and crying. \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite girl in the world?\u201d</p><p>A tiny sound escaped Bret then. He couldn\u2019t hold it all in. Those were his words, his, but she\u2019d given them to Jacey.</p><p>RUN.</p><p>That was all he could think. He tore out of the building and plunged into the darkening afternoon.</p><p>By the time he got to the highway, he was freezing, but he didn\u2019t care. He kept running.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>We call her Jacey now.</p><p>It was like looking in a mirror that reflected the past. Instinctively she wanted to reach out. She thought of all the things she\u2019d forgotten. Her daughter\u2019s first word\u2014what had it been? What had she done on the first day of kindergarten\u2014had Jacey climbed onto that big yellow bus all by herself and waved good-bye, or had she clung to her mother\u2019s arm, crying, begging to stay home just one more day?</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>The sweet fullness of that word made the memory loss almost unendurable. That she could be a stranger to this child of hers ...</p><p>\u201cJacey,\u201d she whispered, holding out her arms.</p><p>Jacey moved slowly toward her. Mikaela felt an odd reluctance in her daughter, but at last Jacey leaned over the bed rail. Mikaela wrapped her arms around Jacey, pulling her close. She breathed in the sweet, forgotten scent of her little girl\u2014not the baby powder she remembered, but something citrusy and adolescent.</p><p>When she drew back, Jacey was crying.</p><p>Mikaela touched her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>A tear slid down Jacey\u2019s cheek. \u201cHow? How will it be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my memory back. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s eyes rounded. \u201cYou lost your memory? That\u2019s why ...\u201d She glanced at the open door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have some gaps is all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Dad tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they asked Julian to hold off on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuli\u2014You don\u2019t remember Dad?\u201d Jacey\u2019s voice was barely audible.</p><p>\u201cOh, I remember Julian ... up to a point, anyway. Everything after I left him is kind of a blank. I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, perfect!\u201d Jacey stared at Mikaela as if she\u2019d grown horns. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad is Liam Campbell.\u201d Jacey clutched Mikaela\u2019s flimsy hospital gown. \u201cWe fell in love with him a long time ago, when I was only four years old. He\u2019s been your husband for ten years. And you don\u2019t remember him. You only remember Julian, who never, ever called me or sent a birthday card or wanted to see me.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela was confused. \u201cBut Julian is your father ...\u201d</p><p>Jacey backed away. She seemed to be hanging on to composure by the thinnest thread. \u201cOh, he\u2019s my father, all right. And thanks to your lies, I didn\u2019t know that until today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mikaela felt like she\u2019d been punched in the stomach. \u201cI never told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jacey ...\u201d Mikaela didn\u2019t know what to say. What kind of woman had she become that she would do this to her daughter? \u201cJacey, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door swung open. Sarah bustled into the room, rosy-cheeked and out of breath. \u201cJacey, I was hoping to find you here. The receptionist just called. She saw Bret run out of the hospital. He wouldn\u2019t stop\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBret! Oh, my God. It\u2019s my fault!\u201d Jacey spun around the heavyset nurse and ran out of the room.</p><p>Mikaela looked helplessly at Sarah. \u201cWho\u2019s Bret?\u201d</p><p>Sarah gave her a sad, knowing look. \u201cGet your rest, honey.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela\u2019s heart beat too fast. Any second, she expected one of the machines to sound an alarm. The room spun around her, making her sick and dizzy. She grabbed Sarah\u2019s arm, yanked her so hard the nurse hit the bed rail. \u201cSarah ... did you know me ... before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I hired you right out of nursing school.\u201d</p> <p>Mikaela released Sarah and sank into the mound of pillows. These facts of her life were meaningless; she wanted the truth of it. \u201cWas I a good person?\u201d</p><p>Sarah gazed down at her, smiling softly. \u201cYou have the pure heart of an angel, Mikaela. You were\u2014and are\u2014a good person. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to believe it, but she couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d lied to her daughter for all these years, and obviously she\u2019d broken Liam\u2019s heart. For the first time, she wondered if this amnesia was a gift from God. A momentary respite that allowed a sinner to feel like a saint.</p><p>Julian sat in the familiar cocoon of the limousine, staring at the reporters clustered beyond the smoked glass.</p><p>He\u2019d really screwed up today. There was no way around that fact. He\u2019d set the hounds on his own daughter. It hadn\u2019t been broadcast yet, that footage from outside the high school, but he\u2019d heard about it in excruciating detail, the way they\u2019d caught her off guard and thrown questions at her.</p><p>How does it feel to be Julian True\u2019s daughter? And the way they\u2019d sniffed out the ugly truth: She doesn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Outside, he saw Liam push through the crowd of reporters.</p><p>Julian couldn\u2019t help himself; he sank deeper into the seat, rubbing his tender jaw. The last person he wanted to talk to right now was Liam Campbell.</p><p>Julian was deeply ashamed of what he\u2019d done. Usually when he screwed up, he paid for it. Literally. People who worked for him ran along in his wake, throwing money at anyone whose life or property had been damaged in a brush with Julian True.</p><p>Now, for once, he wanted to be a better man than that. He wanted to do the right thing.</p><p>He pulled his Ray Bans out of his pocket and slid them onto his face. Then, after running a comb through his tangled hair, he got out of the limo.</p><p>It was snowing. Again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out!\u201d</p><p>Reporters surged toward him, microphones at the ready. They looked as bad as he felt. This weather was too damned cold. He knew that if they were going to stand outside for a story, they\u2019d rather be in Los Angeles, where the elements gave you cancer instead of frostbite.</p> <p>He barely heard the questions hurled at him. Wordlessly, unsmiling, he pushed through the crowd, knowing they wouldn\u2019t follow him into the hospital. They were like vampires\u2014they had to be invited in.</p><p>He was halfway to Kayla\u2019s room when he saw his daughter. She was in the waiting room, standing still as stone, with her back to him.</p><p>\u201cJuliana.\u201d He remembered a second too late that it was the wrong name. \u201cJ.C.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she turned around. For a disorienting moment, the past slammed into the present. Her eyes were red and puffy, and her mouth was trembling. She looked exactly like Kayla on the day she left him. \u201cHi,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cI ... was hoping we could talk. I know ... you know the truth about me ... about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d She took a step toward him, hugging herself. \u201cMy brother ran away.\u201d</p><p>Julian frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean? I don\u2019t have any other children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, my half brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNo one told me there was another one. He\u2019s Kayla\u2019s ... and Liam\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHis name is Bret. We saw Mom today for the first time since she woke up. She didn\u2019t recognize us. It was bad. Bret ... ran away.\u201d</p><p>Julian wanted to help her, say something that would ease her sadness, but he didn\u2019t even know her, couldn\u2019t possibly understand what she needed. No, that wasn\u2019t true. He knew she needed her father.</p><p>Liam would know what to do. This moment, and a thousand others like it, had made Liam this girl\u2019s father. There was no way now to turn Julian into that which he was not. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Your dad will find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah ...\u201d She gazed up at him, saying nothing else.</p><p>Julian wished he could look into J.C.\u2019s sad eyes and see his own future, but all he saw was a screwed-up past. \u201cYour dad\u2019s the real thing. He\u2019ll find your brother. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you?\u201d Slowly she moved toward him. \u201cDid you ever think about me?\u201d</p><p>He knew when a lie was called for, and though he knew a better man would take the high road, he lied. \u201cAll the time.\u201d He flashed her a nervous smile. \u201cYou look exactly like your mom when I first met her. You are the two most beautiful women I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>He could see that she didn\u2019t believe him, and worse, that the lie had hurt her, and so he gave her the only gift he could. For once he told the truth: \u201cNo, not really. When your mom left me, I ... moved on. I loved her\u2014and I could have loved you\u2014but I moved on instead. I\u2019m sorry, but your mom ... and your dad love you. And boy, when Kayla loves, it\u2019s one of those out-of-the-ballpark kind of things.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him and went to stand at the window.</p><p>He followed her. He wanted to touch her shoulders, but he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he stared at their reflections, side by side in the tarnished windowpanes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. For all of it. The reporters, the years I stayed away, the letters I didn\u2019t write. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Then, with his daughter\u2019s silent tears glittering in the windowpane between them, Julian caught a glimpse of his own empty soul. It happened fast, came and went as quickly as a breath taken and released, but he knew he\u2019d never forget.</p><p>Liam tried not to think of everything that could go wrong on this dark, December night when God had seen fit to drop the temperature four degrees in the last thirty minutes. Or that Bret was alone out there, his precious nine-year-old son, still more baby than young man, out there all alone, on this coldest of evenings. Did Bret know how dangerous it was to walk along the side of the road when the streets were icy ... when visibility was cut in half by the falling snow?</p><p>These were lessons Liam didn\u2019t remember passing down to his son, and now his not having done so preyed on his fraying nerves.</p><p>He kept glancing at the outside temperature gauge he\u2019d had installed on the dashboard. It was thirty degrees outside, as cold as it got in this part of the world. And he was out there\u2014</p><p>Stop it.</p><p>He\u2019s all right. He\u2019s just hiding somewhere, sitting someplace where it\u2019s warm and dry\u2014</p><p>Thinking about why his mom didn\u2019t recognize him, wondering why his daddy hadn\u2019t told him the truth.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Bretster,\u201d Liam whispered aloud. His hands were curled so tightly around the steering wheel, he wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to see ten indentations when he let go. He leaned forward, peering through the obscured windshield. It was snowing so hard now, the wipers were having trouble keeping up.</p><p>The highway was empty, just as the medical building parking lot had been. Liam had wasted precious minutes searching the hospital\u2014he\u2019d been unable to believe that Bret would leave\u2014but eventually he\u2019d been forced to accept the fact that his son had been so hurt and afraid that he\u2019d run. Without thinking, probably without even feeling the stinging bite of cold as he pushed through the double doors.</p><p>At first, anyway.</p><p>By now Bret would be freezing. He\u2019d run off without his coat.</p><p>The car phone rang.</p><p>Liam\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he punched the \u201cSend\u201d button. \u201cDid you find him?\u201d he asked whoever was calling.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was Jacey\u2019s soft, quavering voice. \u201cEveryone is looking, though. Grandma\u2019s at home, waiting for a call. I\u2019m waiting at the hospital, in case he comes back here. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey, but we\u2019d better stay off the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d She paused, and he knew everything she was feeling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s mine. I should have told you guys the truth. We\u2019ll talk about it later, okay? When ... we\u2019ve got him home safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. When he\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>Disconnecting the line, he focused on the road again. He had to do that, focus on ordinary things\u2014the road, the streetlights, the hiding places along the way\u2014because when he did that, he kept himself together.</p><p>He cut the enormity of his fear into little pieces. Details. These he could handle.</p><p>He slowed the car speed, from eight miles per hour to five. He had gone less than a quarter of a mile from the hospital. The distance to town stretched out before him, an endless, twisting path of darkness.</p><p>Details.</p><p>He forced his gaze to the right, into the black fields along the side of the highway. Bret wouldn\u2019t have crossed the road; he knew better than that. Liam was certain. His son wouldn\u2019t cross the road at night alone ... but would he take a ride with a stranger?</p><p>Liam suppressed a horrified shudder. Please tell me he learned that rule.</p><p>The temperature gauge indicated that, outside, it had dropped another degree.</p><p>Liam concentrated on the little things\u2014his foot on the gas, his hands on the wheel, his gaze on the side of the road, where there were no footprints. Just a layer of newfallen snow.</p><p>Up ahead, on the right side of the road, the county fairgrounds were a cluster of big metal buildings, barns, arenas, and pavilions. The barn was awash in light; it stood out like a beacon against the blackness all around it.</p><p>The lights were on ... in the middle of a winter\u2019s night.</p><p>Liam felt an electrifying strand of hope. It was one of Mike\u2019s favorite places, that barn. She and Jacey had spent countless summer days there for horse shows and county fairs and riding clinics. Only a few months ago, Bret had earned his first 4-H ribbon there.</p><p>At the turnoff, he slowed. Perspiration itched across his brow, turned his hands cold and slick.</p><p>Any wrong choice would hurt. He glanced at the temperature gauge again; it was holding steady at twenty-nine. He turned onto the road and floored the accelerator. The wheels screeched for a second before grabbing hold. He sped down the bumpy road, his face pressed so close to the windshield that his nose was almost touching glass. In the parking lot, he slammed on the brakes. The car fishtailed, then came to a shuddering stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He left the engine running and jumped out of the car, racing through the downy, ankle-deep snow. \u201cBret?\u201d he yelled. His cry echoed off the unseen mountains and bounced back at him, thin as a sheet of ice.</p><p>He flung the metal doors open. The well-lit barn was cavernous, a row of empty stalls. \u201cBret?\u201d he yelled.</p><p>He ran from stall to stall, peering in each one.</p><p>He found Bret in the very last stall\u2014the one Mike had used at last summer\u2019s Last Bend Classic horse show. Shivering and curled into a tiny ball, Bret was sucking his thumb.</p> <p>Liam had never known a relief this big; it made it hard to move, to speak, to do anything except sweep down and pull his son into his arms. \u201cOh, Bret,\u201d he whispered brokenly, \u201cyou scared me.\u201d</p><p>Bret drew back. His cheeks were bright red and streaked with tears, his eyes were bloodshot. \u201cI knew you\u2019d find me, Daddy. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d He burst into chattering, shivering tears again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d he said, stroking his son\u2019s hair.</p><p>Bret blinked up at him. \u201cD-D-Daddy, she didn\u2019t even h-hug me.\u201d</p><p>He touched Bret\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bret. I should have told you the truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSh-She\u2019s n-not my mommy, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered softly. \u201cShe\u2019s your mom, but the accident ... it broke something in her brain and she can\u2019t remember some really important things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-Like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr me. Or Jacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe remembered Jacey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019d heard about Jacey, and so she was able to figure out who she was. But she doesn\u2019t really remember.\u201d</p> <p>Bret wiped his eyes. \u201cSo how come no one tole her about me? I\u2019m as important as Jace.\u201d</p><p>Liam sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re everything to her, Bret. You and Jacey are her whole world, and it hurt her so much to hear about Jacey. She cried and cried. I just ... couldn\u2019t tell her about you, too. I was hoping she\u2019d remember on her own and then ... everything would be fine.\u201d</p><p>Bret drew in a great, shuddering breath. Liam could tell he was trying to be a big boy. \u201cWill her memory get unbroken?\u201d</p><p>Liam wanted to say Of course, but in the last weeks, he\u2019d learned a thing or two about his children and himself. They were all strong enough to handle the truth. The only wound that festered was a lie. \u201cThe doctors think she\u2019ll remember most things. Not every little thing, but the big things\u2014like us\u2014we think she\u2019ll get those back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know for sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We don\u2019t know. But you know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe love ... I believe she\u2019ll remember all of that.\u201d</p> <p>Bret seemed to think about that for a long time. \u201cOkay, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. Thank God for the resilience of a little boy\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cDaddy? I love you.\u201d</p><p>The simple words sifted through Liam, soft as a summer rain. \u201cI love you, too, Bret.\u201d He held him tightly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of you. This is a hard thing for a little boy to understand.\u201d</p><p>Slowly they got to their feet. Liam picked Bret up and carried him out of the barn. When he flicked off the lights, a crashing darkness descended, and he followed the Explorer\u2019s headlights through the falling snow. As soon as they were in the car, Liam called Rosa and Jacey and gave them the good news. Rosa offered to pick Jacey up from the hospital and meet Liam and Bret at home.</p><p>Bret leaned back in his seat. Even with the heat roaring through the vents, he was shivering. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Sometimes a man has to get away to think.\u201d He glanced at Bret. \u201cBut next time, how about if you go into a room and slam the door shut?\u201d</p><p>Bret almost smiled. \u201cOkay. But I\u2019m gonna slam it really hard.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Liam couldn\u2019t let go of Bret\u2019s hand. All the way home in the car, he held on to those cold little fingers.</p><p>When they pulled into the garage, Liam clicked the engine off and turned to his son. He would have given anything in that moment to say the perfect thing.</p><p>If wishes were horses, all beggars would ride.</p><p>It was one of Mike\u2019s favorite expressions, and it brought her back to him. He knew what she would say if she were here right now: Come on, piano man, face the music.</p><p>It gave him the shot of strength he needed.</p><p>\u201cBret, there\u2019s something else we need to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Bret turned to him, his face still red from the biting cold. \u201cDo we hafta?\u201d</p><p>Already his son had learned to expect the worst. He\u2019d learned to be afraid. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll make us some hot chocolate and we\u2019ll sit by the fire and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate and sugar. This is gonna be good.\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cMove it, Jim Carrey.\u201d</p><p>Bret blinked up at him, owl-like. \u201cThat\u2019s what Mommy said to me ... on the day ... you know ... just before she fell.\u201d</p><p>Liam tousled his son\u2019s still-damp hair. \u201cThe memories will be like that, pal-o-mine. They\u2019ll come out of nowhere\u2014for you, and for Mommy. And Bretster, it\u2019s easier if you let them come, along with any emotion they happen to bring with \u2019em. You can\u2019t be afraid of what you feel. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Daddy.\u201d Bret got out of the car and went into the house, flipping on every light switch along the way. Liam followed along behind him, turning off the ones they didn\u2019t need. In the great room, he knelt in front of the fireplace and arranged the wood and paper. When the fire was cracking and popping, he went into the kitchen and made two cups of instant cocoa. He added a generous amount of milk to Bret\u2019s, then carefully carried the two mugs into the living room, where his son was already playing with an action figure, sound effects and all.</p><p>Liam stopped, took a deep breath ... and went on. That\u2019s what parents did. This was a conversation that had to happen. Tomorrow Bret would go to school and some kid in some class would ask about Julian True. Bret deserved to learn the truth from his dad.</p><p>\u201cHey, pal,\u201d he said, handing Bret a cup.</p><p>Bret peered into the mug and scrunched his face. \u201cYou put milk in it. It looks like a bunch of floating toilet paper in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom doesn\u2019t add milk\u2014to cool it down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce cubes when it\u2019s instant; milk when its the real thing. It\u2019s okay, Dad.\u201d He bravely took a sip. \u201cYum.\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cI love you, Bret.\u201d</p><p>Bret set down the mug. Liam knew that was it for the cocoa. \u201cI love you, too, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Liam sat down in the huge, overstuffed chair by the sofa, the one they\u2019d picked up at a garage sale outside of LaConner. Mike had spent more money refinishing and re-upholstering it than it would have cost to buy a new one, but as she always said, this chair was as comfortable as fifty years together. It easily held a man and his nine-year-old son.</p><p>Bret climbed up onto his lap.</p><p>Liam touched his son\u2019s face. Come this summer, there would be a dusting of freckles across this little nose.</p><p>\u201cIs this more about Mommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember we told you a long time ago that Mommy had been married before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s Jacey\u2019s other daddy.\u201d</p><p>Liam swallowed hard. \u201cAnd did you know that Julian True was in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizard Man? Hel-lo, Dad, everyone knows that.\u201d</p><p>Liam held back a smile. \u201cActually, he prefers to be remembered as the Green Menace, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. The point is, he\u2019s in town to visit Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizard Man knows Mommy?\u201d</p><p>Liam took a deep breath and jumped into the deep end. \u201cMore than that. Mommy used to be married to him.\u201d</p><p>Bret made a disbelieving sound\u2014half snort, half giggle. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, Bretster.\u201d</p><p>Bret frowned. It was a long minute before he asked, \u201cBut you\u2019re my daddy\u2014and she\u2019s my mommy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Bret seemed to turn it all over in his mind, this way and that. Sometimes he was frowning; sometimes he wasn\u2019t. At last he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Liam had expected tears, anger, something more ... traumatic than this quiet okay. Maybe Bret didn\u2019t understand\u2014</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Sally Kramer\u2019s mom used to be married to Lonnie Harris down at the feed store, and Billy McAllister\u2019s dad used to be married to Gertrude at Sunny and Shear. My mom\u2019s ex-husband is way cooler than that. Hey, do you think he could get me a Lizard Man poster for my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou amaze me, Bret,\u201d he answered softly.</p><p>The mudroom door crashed open. Jacey and Rosa rushed into the house. Jacey was screaming her brother\u2019s name. She raced over to them and dropped to her knees beside the chair.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bret ...\u201d Crying, she ran her hands across Bret\u2019s face like a blind person hoping to memorize every shape. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>Bret shoved his sister\u2019s hand away. \u201cNo kisses. Gross. Hey, Jace, did you know that Mommy used to be married to Julian True\u2014and he\u2019s your other dad?\u201d</p><p>Jacey wiped her eyes and dropped her mouth open. \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>Bret grinned from ear to ear. He leaned toward Liam and whispered in his ear, \u201cYou told me first?\u201d</p><p>Liam clamped down on a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a big boy now.\u201d</p><p>Bret giggled. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said to his sister, puffing up his narrow chest, \u201cbut we\u2019re still a family.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s arms embraced both of them. She pressed her tear-stained cheek against her brother\u2019s back. \u201cA family,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAll we need now is Mom.\u201d</p><p>That evening the story broke. Pictures of \u201cKayla\u201d and Julian were splashed across television, each one scrutinized and commented upon, their life together cut up into bite-sized pieces for mass consumption. At eight o\u2019clock\u2014right after Entertainment Tonight\u2014the phone rang for the first time. Liam made the mistake of answering it. Some woman from the saddle club was screeching about how it couldn\u2019t be true.</p><p>After that, the phone began ringing nonstop. Liam yanked the plug out of the wall.</p><p>He went through the motions of ordinary life\u2014he ate dinner, washed the dishes, watched a little television with the kids, then he tucked Bret into bed and read him a bedtime story.</p><p>When Bret was finally asleep, Liam carefully crawled out of the bed and padded out of the room. He was about to head downstairs when he noticed the slat of light beneath Jacey\u2019s bedroom door. With a sigh, he headed down the hallway toward her room.</p><p>After a long pause, he knocked. \u201cHey, honey, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Come in.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and found her exactly as he\u2019d expected: sitting on her bed, wearing headphones, and crying. The television was on.</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>She pulled off the headphones and tossed them on the pile of sheets and blankets beside her.</p><p>He grabbed her pink beanbag chair and dragged it closer to the bed, then plopped down into its cushy center. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI yelled at her,\u201d Jacey said. \u201cMom wakes up after a month in a coma and I yelled at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, honey. You just go back tomorrow and tell her you love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love her, but I\u2019m mad at her, and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll never remember us. That she\u2019ll only remember ... him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you were still a little girl right now,\u201d he answered in a quiet voice. \u201cIf you were, I\u2019d make up a story or tickle you or offer you an ice-cream cone.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cSomething to change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. But you\u2019re almost grown up, and I can\u2019t protect you from all the hurts in life anymore. The truth is, love comes in a million colors and shades. Some are so clear they\u2019re almost see-through; others are black as pencil lead.\u201d He stopped, unable to think of anything to say that didn\u2019t sound lame or pathetic. So he took a deep breath and told her what he believed. \u201cJacey, I don\u2019t know what your mom\u2019s past means to this family, but I know this: We will always be a family, the four of us. Somehow we\u2019ll get each other through it. That\u2019s what families do best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>His heart constricted. A little girl\u2019s word: Daddy. It reminded him of all they\u2019d been through together. They would get each other through this, one way or the other, and when it was all over, they would know how and where the love came to rest among them. \u201cI love you, too, Jace. Now, come here, give your old man a hug.\u201d</p><p>She slid off the bed and dropped onto his lap, twining her arms around his neck.</p> <p>The beanbag chair was too little, and together they slid off its slick surface and landed in a heap on the floor. Laughing, they separated and crawled awkwardly to their feet.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Jace.\u201d</p><p>He left her room and closed the door behind him, then went downstairs. He drifted from room to room aimlessly. It wasn\u2019t until he found himself in the living room, standing beside the grand piano, that he realized he must have been coming here all along.</p><p>He sat down. The piano keys were dark. Not that he needed light to play; he didn\u2019t need anything\u2014not sheet music, not light, not an audience. All he needed was Mikaela ...</p><p>He plunked a single key with his forefinger. The note\u2014B flat\u2014reverberated in the room, reminded him of the times he\u2019d sat here, his family clustered around him, his wife seated close beside, and played his heart out. The lone note died.</p> <p>He drew his hands back from the keys. He couldn\u2019t play yet.</p><p>Julian sat in one of the back booths at Lou\u2019s Bowl-O-Rama, staring down into his fourth schooner of beer. It was almost ten o\u2019clock\u2014apparently prime bowling time in Pleasantville.</p><p>He could hear the commotion going on behind him\u2014people clustering together, pointing at him and whispering. The word that most often rose above the static hum was Mikaela.</p><p>They were easy to ignore. Part of being a star was learning to be alone in a mob of people, all of whom were looking at you. You learned to look without seeing, peruse a crowd without making eye contact. Celebrity 101. Unfortunately, at some point you realized that being alone in a crowd was hardly a skill you wanted to perfect.</p><p>He took another sip of beer.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t forget the emptiness he\u2019d seen in himself today. He should have known it was there all along, of course, but he\u2019d never been the kind of man who really thought about things like that.</p><p>Love was a word he\u2019d used carelessly over the years. So often, he\u2019d told people\u2014reporters, friends, other women\u2014that Kayla had been his one true love.</p><p>He could never say that now that he\u2019d seen Liam, glimpsed into the heart of a man who truly loved.</p> <p>Julian realized he liked the idea of love. That\u2019s why he\u2019d married so often. But what he really wanted was something else\u2014like that movie (or had it been a book first?) The Bridges of Madison County.</p><p>The perfect male fantasy: a few days of passionate, reckless sex that didn\u2019t change your life, then ripened into a bittersweet regret. Sure, you\u2019d lost that one true love, but there was something inestimably romantic in loss. And why not? That love hadn\u2019t been tested by time or boredom or infidelity. It remained caught in a shining web of timelessness, and as the years went on, it grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>Regret, Julian now understood, was the only true emotion he\u2019d retained from his marriage to Kayla. It tasted like fine port, that regret; over time, it had mellowed into a sweet, full-bodied wine that could intoxicate.</p><p>It was better than the truth: that he\u2019d loved her, married her, watched her leave him, and moved on. That his love for her had been a fleeting emotion.</p><p>Or worse, that there was a hole in his soul that could never be filled, that real love was beyond him.</p><p>Someone clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cHey, Juli, I\u2019ve been looking all over town for you. Are you bowling?\u201d</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t smile. \u201cYou know me, Val. I love a sport where you wear other people\u2019s shoes.\u201d</p><p>Val grinned and sat down. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, steer roping?\u201d</p><p>Julian turned to him. \u201cVal, do you ever think about what happens to guys like us when we get old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy personal role model is Sean Connery. Sixty-eight years old and the babes still go for me. You can be Jack or Warren, but the God\u2014Connery\u2014he\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Julian stared into his beer. \u201cI think we end up alone, sitting in some expensive chair in an expensive house, looking through photo albums of who we used to be, what we used to have. I think we lose our hair and our looks and no one comes to visit us.\u201d</p><p>Val raised his hand. \u201cBring me a Scotch, will you?\u201d he yelled to Lou, then he turned back to Julian. \u201cYou\u2019re as much fun as detox.\u201d</p><p>How could he make Val understand? Julian had always craved the glitz and glamour of Hollywood; he\u2019d thought he\u2019d die if he didn\u2019t become someone who mattered, and he\u2019d gotten his wish. But the years had strung together like broken Christmas lights, and not until now\u2014in Last Bend\u2014had he realized what he\u2019d given up for fame. He could see clearly how he would end up\u2014an aging, arrogant movie star who showed up at every party, drinking too much, smoking too much, screwing any woman who got close enough. Looking, he\u2019d always be looking ...</p><p>Until one day he\u2019d realize that he\u2019d given up on finding what he was looking for, and that the ache in his heart was permanent.</p><p>Kayla had loved him, and in loving him so deeply, she\u2019d seen the empty place in his heart. She had known that a true and lasting love couldn\u2019t grow in such shallow, rocky soil. No doubt, she\u2019d hoped that he would come for her, a changed and better man, but deep down, she must have known. That\u2019s why she\u2019d never told Jacey the truth about him. Why spin romantic tales about a man you\u2019d never see again?</p><p>Lou set a glass of Scotch in front of Val. \u201cThere ye\u2019 be. Anything for you, Julian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, Lou,\u201d Julian answered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thanking someone? Jesus, Juli, what the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Julian turned to his friend. \u201cKayla\u2019s made me ... see my life, Val, and it isn\u2019t much.\u201d</p><p>Val looked thoughtful. \u201cYou\u2019re like one of those teenage girls who see the supermodels in the magazines and think they really look like that. You and me, we know about the airbrushing and the bingeing and the drug use and the Auschwitz rib cages. You\u2019re thinking that maybe you want a different life, filled with lawn mowers and block parties and Little League. But that\u2019s not who you are. Don\u2019t you know that all those real guys out there working seven-to-seven to support their snot-nosed kids and heavy-duty wives would kill to have your life for one day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can have it.\u201d</p><p>Val\u2019s eyes held an abiding sadness. \u201cJulian, she\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut what if I love her?\u201d</p><p>The falling apart of a man\u2019s life should make noise. It should startle passersby with its Sturm und Drang. It ought to sound like the Parthenon crashing down. Not this ordinary, everyday kind of quiet.</p><p>His wife was in love with another man. There was simply no way around that; no matter how often he tried to push the thought away, it came creeping back.</p><p>Liam lay back in bed, staring up at the gauzy mosquito netting that canopied their bed. It was almost midnight, but he couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t forget the images he\u2019d seen on television tonight, or the quippy headlines that accompanied them.</p><p>True Love, after all these years.</p><p>Sleeping Beauty awakens to Prince Charming\u2019s kiss.</p><p>Every program had had photographs of Kayla, all of them showing a young, vibrant woman who was clearly in love.</p><p>It was a woman he\u2019d never seen. Until today\u2014this second\u2014he\u2019d had this hope that he would catch a glimpse, however fleeting, of his wife. But all he\u2019d seen was image after image of Kayla.</p><p>Now she was neither Kayla nor Mikaela. Without memories, she was a leaf, caught up in the swirling current of a dream, but soon she would land on earth. She would remember the fifteen years they\u2019d spent together. He had to believe that.</p><p>But what then?</p><p>She would reach out for something solid, and the thing that would steady her, her anchor, would be her love for her children. That love was the cornerstone of her soul, and nothing\u2014not even Julian\u2014could separate her from Jacey and Bret.</p><p>When she came back to herself, Mike would put her kids\u2019 needs first. She always had. She\u2019d left Julian because of Jacey and she\u2019d married Liam because of Bret.</p><p>In the end, she would stay married to Liam. Of this, he was certain. When push came to shove, she would again sacrifice her passion for her children\u2019s welfare.</p><p>The realization brought no solace; instead it weighed him down.</p><p>Julian wasn\u2019t a threat to their marriage; Liam knew that. It was Mikaela\u2019s love for Julian that threatened everything. Before, Liam had been able to tell himself that she loved him enough. But now that he\u2019d seen the way she looked at Julian ...</p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p>And still it was quiet, this falling apart of his life, as silent as the last beat of an old man\u2019s heart. A quiet, echoing thud, and then ... nothing.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>Mikaela dreamt she was in the big log house.</p><p>She could hear the child crying again, and this time she was more afraid. She climbed the stairs and crossed the empty porch. Beside her, a rocking chair squeaked and moved, pushed by unseen hands.</p><p>She grabbed the doorknob and twisted, swinging the door open so hard, it cracked against the interior wall.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Her voice was a reedy whisper, beaten by the heaviness of her breathing.</p><p>The crying came again, louder this time.</p><p>She felt along the wall; this time she knew there was a light switch there, and when her fingers brushed it, she cried out in relief. The lights came on\u2014an overhead chandelier crafted of deer antlers that threw a soft, golden net across a deserted dining room table. She had a quick, flashing image of herself sitting at that table, at a certain chair; she heard a voice saying, So, kids, tell me about your day ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there was no one there, just a trio of ghostly images, the sound of forks on china, the thump of a glass hitting the planked table.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she called out.</p><p>The crying came again. She felt her way past the table, up the long, wide staircase made of split logs. It felt as if there were people behind her, a crowd whispering among themselves, pushing her deeper and deeper into the darkness above, but every time she spun around, she was alone. Only her own shadow snaked out behind her as she reached the second floor.</p><p>\u201cMo ... mmmy ... Mo ... mmmy ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she screamed.</p><p>Only silence.</p><p>She started to run, but this time there were no doors, no windows ... just the child\u2019s cry.</p><p>She ran and ran, until the hallway ended in a blank wall.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p> <p>She spun around. There was no hallway behind her anymore. When she looked down, she saw that she was standing on a tiny patch of carpet.</p><p>A door appeared in front of her.</p><p>Her hand was shaking as she reached for the brass knob. It turned easily. Inch by inch, she pushed the door open. Behind it lay a box of perfect blackness.</p><p>And the quiet sound of a child crying.</p><p>She touched the rough-hewn wall and a light came on.</p><p>The child was tucked in the corner, his skinny white legs bent at an awkward angle. He was wearing flannel boxers\u2014like Daddy\u2019s\u2014and a Seattle Super-Sonics T-shirt.</p> <p>He looked up at her, his pale face streaked with tears, his blue eyes magnified into pools of watery pain.</p><p>The boy from the hospital.</p><p>\u201cMommy?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBret,\u201d she cried out, falling to her knees and taking him into her arms.</p><p>Then she woke up. Memories washed over and through and around her.</p><p>She said that one simple name over and over again.</p><p>Bret. Bret. Bret. The child she\u2019d turned away from, said nothing to when he leaned down and kissed her forehead with all the gentleness of a butterfly\u2019s landing.</p><p>Her baby boy.</p> <p>She reached for the phone, but before she dialed a number, she noticed the wall clock. It was three o\u2019clock in the morning.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t call yet. She closed her eyes and leaned back into the pillows, letting the memories come again.</p><p>Mikaela woke with a start. She glanced at the clock. Nine-thirty.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d The kids were already at school.</p><p>She saw the tray of food by her bed. It looked disgusting. She couldn\u2019t imagine how anyone was supposed to actually recuperate if they ate this garbage.</p><p>With a sigh, she pushed the tray away.</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought of all the things she\u2019d remembered last night.</p><p>Bret. Jacey. Her precious children. She couldn\u2019t remember every single thing, but she remembered most of it.</p><p>Julian. She remembered all the days and nights she\u2019d waited by the phone for his call, the countless times she\u2019d cried herself to sleep, waiting. Waiting ...</p><p>And Liam. She remembered the hows and whys of her love for him ... and how it had never been enough for her.</p><p>She\u2019d spent years waiting for Julian to come back to her, but at some point, she\u2019d had to go on with her life. She\u2019d enrolled in school and become a nurse, and taken a job in this very building.</p><p>She\u2019d first met Liam in his father\u2019s hospital room. She\u2019d been so lonely then, so lost. She\u2019d read about Julian\u2019s new marriage and it had broken her spirit. When Liam finally asked her out, she\u2019d said yes.</p><p>She\u2019d known that Liam fell in love with her almost instantly, and though she hadn\u2019t felt the same, she\u2019d needed someone to love her, someone to care about her. Day by day, Liam had shown her how it felt to be truly wanted.</p><p>Still, when she found out she was pregnant, she\u2019d felt trapped. She could remember every nuance of the day she\u2019d told him.</p><p>They\u2019d been out at Angel Falls, their favorite spot, stretched out on a blanket. When she told him about the baby, he stifled a laugh of joy, and then, quietly, asked her to marry him.</p><p>She\u2019d told him some of her past. She\u2019d said, I\u2019ve been married before. I loved him with all my heart and soul. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll love him until I die.</p><p>I see, he\u2019d said. But she was the one who could see. She was breaking his heart, this gentle, caring man who loved her the way she loved Julian. She\u2019d wanted to believe that they could be happy. And in many ways they had been. She had grown to love Liam, but never had she fallen head over heels in love. In truth, she\u2019d never allowed herself to; she saw that now.</p><p>She\u2019d always been secretly waiting for Julian. Down deep, in that place reserved for true love, she\u2019d kept a single candle burning for his return. Because of that, her love for Liam had been thin and brittle, a layer of ice on a bottomless blue lake. How could it be more when Julian was already there, taking up too much space in her heart?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d regretted it then\u2014that was something she couldn\u2019t seem to remember\u2014or if she\u2019d ever let herself look closely enough to see it. But she regretted it now, regretted it with a ferocity that was nearly desperation.</p><p>Her past felt like a huge and tangled fishing net, filled with debris, and she wondered if she could ever untangle it enough to find the pearls that had to be hidden in the mess.</p><p>Now, whenever she closed her eyes\u2014and sometimes even when she didn\u2019t\u2014she saw the flickering reel of her whole life. It was everywhere, in the dozens of floral arrangements and green plants that filled this tiny room, in the accordion of get-well cards that lined her windowsill, in the pad of phone messages that the nurses brought in to her each day.</p><p>In Last Bend, she\u2019d found a place where she belonged. And the saddest part was, she was certain that she hadn\u2019t recognized that. For years, she\u2019d thought that she was an outsider here. Even as she\u2019d volunteered for a dozen different charitable events and organized the Bits-n-Spurs 4-H club, as she\u2019d sat down to dinner at friends\u2019 houses and sipped punch with people after church, she\u2019d always believed that she didn\u2019t belong. It was, she realized, an ugly bit of baggage that she\u2019d carried here from her youth, and she\u2019d been so damned busy hanging on to it that she\u2019d failed to notice that the bags were empty.</p><p>She was so deep in thought, she didn\u2019t hear the knock at the door.</p><p>Rosa stood in the doorway. She looked old and tired, and for once, her white hair wasn\u2019t held hostage in a tight braid. She wore a pair of crisply creased black pants and a red turtleneck sweater. In her arms, she held a big, square book.</p><p>Mikaela maneuvered herself to a sit. \u201cRecuerdo mi vida, Mama,\u201d she said softly, not even bothering with hello.</p><p>Rosa stumbled, then went still, her wide brown eyes focused on Mikaela\u2019s face. \u201cYou remember? All of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Bret ... after yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA milagro.\u201d Rosa moved again, taking shuffling steps toward the bed. Her smile was gentle. \u201cHe is fine. This boy of yours, he has a hardy heart. And, of course, Dr. Liam was there.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela swallowed hard. \u201cCan I see the kids now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBret is on a field trip today. His class went eagle watching at Rockport\u2014it is the migration time. Jacey has a social studies presentation to give at noon. It is half of her grade.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela sagged back, disappointed. \u201cOh. I guess life goes on, eh, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for a short time, only. I will bring them to your room this afternoon, s\u00ed?\u201d Rosa handed Mikaela the big leather book she was holding. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela touched the fine leather. \u201cMuy caro, eh, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes it is good to spend the money. Myrtle\u2014your friend at the drugstore\u2014she told me that you have wanted this for a long time.\u201d</p><p>That was something Mikaela couldn\u2019t remember, but she did know that she\u2019d been meaning to put together a family scrapbook for years. Another entry in her endless stack of somedays. \u201cGracias, Mama. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you did not used to be so stupido. Open it.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cStupido? Stupido?\u201d Her mother never talked like that. \u201cA little respect for the recently brain damaged, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Rosa shrugged. \u201cLo siento. Lately I have spent much time with a little boy, and he has changed me. Yesterday I actually said that a cartoon was rad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my Bretster. Last year everything was either awesome or puke-o-rama. Now it\u2019s rad.\u201d Mikaela opened the book. The first page was a sheer piece of crinkled tissue, inset with dried violets. On a panel in the middle, in Rosa\u2019s careful hand, were the words Mikaela Conchita Luna True Campbell.</p><p>It made her sound like she belonged on a throne. Slowly she turned the page, and there, alone against a sea of white paper, was a dog-earred old black-and-white Kodak print.</p><p>It was a picture of her and her mother. In the background was the shack they\u2019d lived in during apple harvest, twelve to a room with no working bathroom.</p><p>The memories of that time were still buried in Mikaela\u2019s heart, as jagged and sharp as bits of glass. Those were the days that had shaped Mikaela\u2019s spirit, snipped the edges off her dreams.</p><p>For all of her life, Mikaela had been running away from these memories, as if with enough speed she could distance herself from the truth. Now, she was standing still at last and she saw the past for what it had been. She saw these photographs not as a child, rather as a mother. Rosa had had no choices. Without an education, a poor Hispanic woman who barely spoke the language had no way out, except\u2014</p><p>She looked up at her mother. \u201cI would have done it, too, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam ... the house ... If Jacey had crawled into my arms and looked at me with sad, hungry eyes, I would have done it, too.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time Mikaela had ever seen her mother cry. \u201cI would give anything to have loved him less and myself more, but I cannot regret that my sin gave you a chance for something better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long to say.\u201d</p><p>Impatiently, Rosa wiped her eyes. \u201cKeep looking.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela turned the next page, then the next, and saw the few photographs of her childhood.</p><p>Then came the wedding picture. Julian and Kayla.</p><p>Mikaela gasped. This she had hidden. She remembered that; this photograph had been in a pillowcase in her\u2014</p><p>\u201cLiam found these while I was in the coma,\u201d she said in a dull voice.</p><p>Softly, sadly, \u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>She could hardly imagine the pain it must have caused Liam to see her life in such vivid shots. She\u2019d kept Julian hidden, both because no man could live up to such competition, and\u2014if she was honest\u2014because she couldn\u2019t give up this secret obsession she called true love. She\u2019d wanted the piece of herself that loved Julian to be hers alone. Not even Jacey was allowed to share him.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d been afraid that if she exposed her true feelings, if she talked about him as if he were someone ordinary, just a first husband, she\u2019d fall out of love with him. And the thought of not loving Julian was more than she could bear. It had defined her for so long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mikaela turned the pages slowly, mesmerized by the images of the life she\u2019d led.</p><p>She had forgotten how young she was when she married Julian.</p><p>At first, in the pictures, she was bright and beautiful and always smiling, but as the photos accumulated, she saw how thin she\u2019d grown, how jaded her look had become.</p><p>In all the photographs of Mike with Jacey, it was just the two of them, alone. No smiling father. And later, as they waited for Julian, the pictures of them had been taken by strangers.</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cOh, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Rosa flipped through a few pages, until she found the first pictures with Liam. \u201cYou see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour smile. It is coming back here. I notice this the first time you send me pictures of you and Liam.\u201d</p><p>An aching sadness spread through Mikaela. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I love him, Mama? What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know the answer to this question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a mess of my life.\u201d</p><p>Rosa laughed. \u201cYou are young. It takes many years to truly make a mess of your life. This I know about.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela turned to her. \u201cHow will I fix it?\u201d</p><p>Rosa\u2019s smile faded. \u201cLet me tell you something else I know. When you hide things away, and keep them secret, they have a ... power. Take your life apart, Mikita, look at it for once ... and maybe you will be surprised at what you see.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p> <p>Mikaela counted the moments until she could see her children. After Rosa left, Mike had spent an hour with the physical therapist, trying to relearn how to gracefully use a spoon. Who would have thought it would be so damned complicated to stick a spoon in a bowl of oatmeal and get the gruel to your own mouth? At one point, she\u2019d wanted to hurl the whole breakfast at the wall. Then she\u2019d remember why it was that men had temper tantrums and women didn\u2019t: cleanup.</p><p>Now it was nearly noon. She stood at the small window of her room, staring out at the parking lot below. The outdoor Christmas decorations were in place. Multicolored bulbs twined around the street-lamps. At night, she knew, the sparkly lights transformed even this ordinary parking lot into a winter wonderland.</p><p>It saddened her, this evidence of the coming holidays. Usually she was a Christmas addict, a whirling dervish who maniacally put up decorations and gathered her children around her on the sofa for the yearly viewings of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street. This year all she felt was a yawning, aching sense of loss. She couldn\u2019t get a true sense of where she belonged anymore, and somehow, at Christmas, that sense of being lost was even worse.</p><p>There was a knock at the door.</p><p>Mikaela turned so fast she stumbled. Her right leg was still weak, and it couldn\u2019t keep up with such quick movements. She clutched the windowsill and hung on to avoid falling onto that ugly speckled linoleum floor.</p><p>Liam stood in the doorway. He looked awkward and uncertain, his tall, lanky body tilted to one side, his too-long hair falling across one eye. Quietly he closed the door behind him. He moved into the room but stopped short of her.</p><p>She could see the uncertainty in his eyes; he didn\u2019t know where he stood with her. And how could he, now that he knew everything she\u2019d hidden from him? She felt an overwhelming shame. She\u2019d hurt him so much ...</p><p>\u201cHello, Liam.\u201d She wanted to say more, but she didn\u2019t know where to start; she didn\u2019t know if there even was a beginning that could take them where they needed to go.</p> <p>He looked at her, still unsmiling. \u201cRosa tells me that you\u2019ve regained a huge chunk of your memories.\u201d</p><p>She let go of the windowsill and limped toward him, holding her weakened right arm against her suddenly upset stomach. \u201cYes. There are still a few blank spots, but a lot of it\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d There was no enthusiasm in his voice, just a dull flatness that didn\u2019t sound like him at all.</p><p>She gazed up at him, noticing the network of lines that had gathered around his eyes. They were new lines, etched on by the trauma of her injury.</p><p>I love you, Liam. Those were the words he needed to hear. She could have said it, easily in fact. She did love him; she always had. But it was a watery version that had more to do with comfort and friendship than passion.</p><p>If only Julian were simply the first man she\u2019d loved. That would have left room in her heart for falling in love with Liam. Hardly anyone stayed with their first lover anymore.</p><p>But Julian was more than that. She\u2019d always called it love, what she felt for him; now, standing here with her husband, she saw what it truly was: obsession.</p><p>First love was like a sweet song that turned you weepy and nostalgic. Obsession, she knew, was different; a dark and secret need that never mellowed into something pretty. A first love could someday let you go. An obsession, she was afraid, held on to your throat until you died.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, Liam,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He smiled. It was sad and tired, that smile, worn as thin as ancient blacktop. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to you anymore, Mike. It\u2019s like ... treading water in the deep end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand. \u201cLet me finish. I\u2019ve got some things that have to be said. You could have told me more of the truth, you know. We might have had a chance if you had.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela turned away from him and limped toward her bed, climbing in, pulling the sheets up to her chin\u2014as if a little layer of cotton and acrylic could shield her from the emotional punch of his words. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>A flash of anger darkened his green eyes, but was gone almost before it began, replaced by a resignation that tore at her heart. \u201cDon\u2019t you know what it was like for me ... loving you all those years, knowing it wasn\u2019t enough for you, and needing so goddamn badly for you to love me back?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI love you, Mike. I\u2019ve loved you from the moment I first saw you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only did it because I knew you,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew what it had been like for you, growing up in Ian\u2019s shade. I didn\u2019t want you to always wonder about Julian. I thought ... if you didn\u2019t know who he was, you\u2019d be able to forget I\u2019d been married. Same with Jacey\u2014I thought Julian would be too ... big for a child to ever forget, and she needed you as a father so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all that, Mike.\u201d He said her name softly, on a sigh. \u201cI just want to say this: no more lies. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. While you were sleeping, I woke up. Before, I could hold on to the illusion that someday it would change. I kept thinking I could love enough for both of us, but I couldn\u2019t, could I?\u201d He touched her face with a gentleness that made her want to weep. \u201cMaybe you were right to hide the past from me. When I didn\u2019t know, I could pretend not to see the little things. I let you have your secrets and your silences and your sadnesses. Can you imagine what those silences would do to me now? I\u2019d constantly be wondering, Is she thinking of him?\u201d</p><p>She could feel the tearing of her heart, and the pain of it was worse than anything she\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>She\u2019d planted the seeds of that pain herself and fertilized them over the years with her own obsession.</p><p>He leaned toward her and held her face in his strong, steady hands, and very slowly, he kissed her. In that one, tender touching of lips was all the heartache and desperation and joy of a deep and lasting love.</p><p>While she was still gasping for an even breath, he turned and left the room.</p><p>It was three o\u2019clock. An hour until the kids would be here.</p><p>Mikaela lay in bed, staring dully at the television tucked up into the corner of the ceiling. In beautiful black-and-white images, It\u2019s a Wonderful Life unfolded.</p><p>It was nearing the end now. George Bailey\u2014Jimmy Stewart\u2014had just realized what the world was without him, and everything he\u2019d always wanted and longed for had changed. He was tearing into that drafty old house now, breaking off the banister ...</p><p>As always, Mikaela was crying, but this time she wasn\u2019t crying for George Bailey; she was crying for herself. When the townspeople started showing up with their money to save the savings and loan, she automatically looked for Liam, to tell him that his favorite scene was on.</p><p>But there was no Liam beside her, no Christmas tree in the corner, no children rattling packages under the tree and whining that they\u2019d seen this movie a billion times.</p><p>She threw the covers back, got up, and walked to the closet. There, sitting forlornly beneath a row of empty hangers, was a small brown leather suitcase. She reached down and picked it up with her left hand\u2014the right one was still too weak to use\u2014and dragged it to the bed, flipping it onto the mattress. Then she unlatched the small brass closures; the suitcase twanged open.</p><p>She ran her fingers across the clothing. It had to be Liam\u2019s doing, this artful arrangement of her favorite things. A black broomstick skirt and white turtleneck, with a matching tapestry vest. The silver concho belt she always wore with the skirt. A pair of black riding boots. Bra and panties. He\u2019d even remembered her favorite gold hoop earrings\u2014the ones that dangled a pair of cherub angels. And all of her makeup, even her hairbrush and perfume.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help thinking how it must have been for him as he\u2019d stood in her huge, walk-in closet, choosing clothing to go in a suitcase that might never be opened ...</p><p>She would have grabbed anything to get out of that closet, stuffed mismatched clothing in a brown paper bag.</p><p>But not Liam. No matter how much it hurt, he would have stood there, thinking, choosing, touching. She imagined that if she looked closely enough, there would be tiny gray tear spots on the white cotton of the turtleneck.</p><p>She stripped out of the flimsy hospital gown and tossed it onto the molded pink chair. It was difficult to dress herself\u2014her right hand was barely any help at all\u2014but she kept at it, pulling and tugging and strapping and buttoning until it was done.</p><p>Then she went into the bathroom and wet down her hair, combing it back from her face. There was no way she could put on makeup with her left hand, so she settled for pinching her cheeks.</p><p>She walked down the hall, with no idea where she was going. When she ended up at the hospital chapel, she realized she must have been heading there all along.</p><p>Kneeling in front of the utilitarian Formica altar, she stared up at the brass cross, then closed her eyes and imagined the altar at St. Michael\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cPlease, God, help me. Show me the way home.\u201d</p><p>At first there was only darkness. Then a small, yellow ray of piercing sunlight. She heard voices as if from far away, a child\u2019s high-pitched giggle, a man speaking to her softly.</p><p>She saw herself at a funeral, standing back, away from the group of mourners at the grave site. Ian\u2019s funeral. The melancholy strains of a lone bagpipe filled the cold winter\u2019s air. Liam turned and saw her. She barely knew him, and yet she was moving toward him. She took his hand and walked him back to the car. They didn\u2019t say a word. He got into the limousine, and she watched him drive away ...</p><p>The image shifted, went in and out of focus. After that, the memories came one after another, unconnected by time or space, just the random moments of life. She and Liam dancing at last year\u2019s Tex-Mex hoedown ... him drying the dishes while she washed them ... him driving her to the feed store in that rickety red truck they called \u201cthe heapster.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d remembered her marriage to Liam, but this was the first time she\u2019d felt it.</p><p>She was afraid to open her eyes. \u201cMore,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cshow me more ...\u201d</p><p>Midnight Mass. Last year. They were in the front row, all four of them wearing their Sunday best. Bret\u2019s hair was still wet, and all through the service, he kept wiping droplets away from his cheeks. It made her smile, remembering that even then, on Christmas Eve, they\u2019d fought about him taking a shower. He\u2019d put it off until the last minute, and so he\u2019d gone to church with wet hair.</p><p>She saw the four of them clearly, like strands of a rope, twisted together; they strengthened one another.</p> <p>Slowly she opened her eyes. The cross blurred in front of her; the silk flowers on the altar became a smear of faded colors. She stared down at the wedding ring on her left hand.</p><p>\u201cI hurt Liam,\u201d she whispered, whether to herself or to God, she didn\u2019t know. All she knew was that it was almost unbearable, this knowledge of how much she had hurt him over the years. How much she was hurting him at this very moment.</p><p>She closed her eyes again and bowed her head. This time she didn\u2019t want a memory\u2014each one seemed to cut clear through to her bones\u2014but it came anyway. She and Liam were in this hospital, in the waiting room. Bret was in surgery. The doctors had spoken of screws and plates and a hand that might never be able to make a fist again.</p><p>She and Liam had stood apart from each other, he at the window, she by the sofa. The fear between them was so dense, it made the walls and furniture look black. She was desperate to find a way to comfort her husband, this quiet, loving man who asked for so little. Slowly she got up from her chair and went to him. When she touched his shoulder, he seemed to crumble. He turned and said, I shouldn\u2019t have let him go. She took him in her arms and held him. All she said to him was, It\u2019s not your fault. At those simple words, the strongest man she\u2019d ever met buried his face in the crook of her neck and cried like a little boy.</p><p>She felt as if she were looking at the moment from far, far away, through another woman\u2019s eyes. From a distance, she knew exactly what she was seeing. Love. Pure and simple.</p> <p>See? You know what love is, Mikaela.</p><p>She heard the words as clearly as the ringing of a church bell. She opened her eyes and looked around. There was no one there.</p><p>Slowly she smiled. The Virgin had spoken to her at last, after all these years of prayer.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Blessed Mother sounded exactly like Rosa.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Mikaela was back in her room, pacing, when the knock came.</p> <p>Suddenly she was nervous. She had hurt them all so badly ... what if her family didn\u2019t forgive her?</p><p>She shuffled away from the window and went to stand by the bed. She gripped the bed rail with her right hand; in her anxiety, she barely noticed that her fingers were working better.</p><p>The door opened and Jacey stood in the doorway, looking as nervous as Mikaela felt.</p><p>Mikaela limped toward her daughter. With her weakened right hand, she reached out and touched Jacey\u2019s cheek. \u201cHello, Jace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... sorry, Mom. I shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby ...\u201d Mikaela swallowed hard. \u201cDon\u2019t ever apologize for your feelings.\u201d She moved closer. \u201cThere are still a lot of gaps in my memory. I don\u2019t remember your first day of school, or how old you were when you lost your first tooth. I\u2019ve driven myself crazy trying to find these moments in my messed-up brain, but I can\u2019t. But I remember that I love you. I love you more than my own life, and I can\u2019t believe how I\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I do remember? Our last girls\u2019 day out, when we drove down to the Guild 45th theater in Seattle and watched Gone With the Wind. I remember sitting in all that darkness, holding your hand.\u201d She took a deep breath. She knew she was stalling; this was not what Jacey had come to hear, and it wasn\u2019t what Mikaela needed to say. \u201cThat night we had dinner at Canlis, remember? The Christmas ships were on Lake Washington. That was one of a dozen times in the last few years when I tried to tell you about Julian.\u201d</p> <p>Jacey looked unconvinced, a little afraid, a little angry, a little sad. Mikaela had watched her daughter\u2019s face for so many years that no nuance of emotion was missed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Jacey asked.</p><p>Mikaela had answered this question in her head so many times. Still, she was uncertain. Even now, after all that had happened, she didn\u2019t want to tell Jacey the whole truth.</p><p>\u201cNo more lies, Mom,\u201d Jacey said.</p><p>\u201cI know, querida. But I don\u2019t want to hurt you. All the lies were for that reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved Julian too much. When I married him and moved to California, I became someone else, a gringa named Kayla True who had no past at all. It was what I\u2019d always wanted. Your abuela tried to tell me that he was no good for me, but I wouldn\u2019t listen. I loved him so ...</p><p>\u201cIn Hollywood I ... lost myself. Not just the poor Hispanic girl I\u2019d been, but more. Me. I did many things of which I am ashamed.\u201d She tried to smile and failed. \u201cBut then I got pregnant. You brought me back to me. I knew what I wanted for you, even if I\u2019d lost track of what I wanted for me. I knew the life I wanted to give you. And Julian ... well, he wasn\u2019t ready to be a father.\u201d</p><p>Tears beaded Jacey\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela took a deep breath. There was nowhere to go now except forward. \u201cNo.\u201d She took Jacey\u2019s hands, held them tightly. \u201cBut I wanted you and I wanted to give you the kind of childhood I hadn\u2019t known. So I left Julian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A tear streaked down Jacey\u2019s cheek and Mikaela forced herself not to wipe it away. Some tears were meant to fall, had to fall. This was one of the many truths she\u2019d failed to see in her life.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I remember?\u201d Jacey said in a soft, fluttery voice. \u201cWhen I was little, I used to ask you about my daddy. Every time I did, you cried, until I stopped asking. I ruined it for you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t ever say that.\u201d Mikaela squeezed her daughter\u2019s hand so tightly, she felt the thin bones shift. \u201cI ruined it for me ... for a while. Then I met Liam ... and I found myself again. I know I\u2019ve been dishonest with you and Liam, and I\u2019ll have to find a way to make that right. Together we are a family, and that\u2019s what we need to remember. We\u2019ll get through this hard time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming home?\u201d</p><p>Home. The word elicited a memory so clear, Mikaela could have pressed it under glass and framed it.</p><p>Liam is sitting at the piano, wearing cut-off shorts and that ridiculous T-shirt he got at last year\u2019s doctors\u2019 convention. It reads: VIAGRA\u2014KEEP YOUR SUPPLY UP. There are two wineglasses on the shining ebony surface of the piano. He is playing her favorite song: \u201cA Time for Us.\u201d</p><p>She comes up behind him, touches his shoulder. \u201cHey, piano man, get your wife to bed or lose your chance.\u201d</p><p>He turns, smiles up at her, and it is there, in his eyes, the love, the welcome, the need she\u2019s seen so many times and\u2014until now\u2014always taken for granted.</p><p>Mikaela laughed. She knew it was an inappropriate response, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. The joy inside her was so big, so dizzyingly unexpected, that she wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to look down and see that she was floating. \u201cCome here, Jacey.\u201d She opened her arms for a hug.</p><p>Mikaela clung to her daughter. God, it felt so good.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom ... I missed you. I was afraid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. I know.\u201d She stroked Jacey\u2019s hair. \u201cI know, baby ...\u201d</p><p>It came to her then, wrapped in the scent of her daughter\u2019s hair, caught in the sticky dampness of tears, and Mikaela laughed and cried at the same time. \u201cOh ... there it is! I remember your first day of school. You wore a black corduroy jumper and carried a Fraggle Rock lunch box. You wouldn\u2019t get on the bus without me, so I went with you. I was the only mom there.\u201d</p><p>Jacey drew back and smiled up at her. \u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jace, I love you, too, and I\u2019m so sorry for ev\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door burst open. Bret and Rosa stood in the doorway. Rosa shrugged. \u201cHe thought that Jacey had enough time.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela kissed Jacey\u2019s damp cheek and drew back.</p><p>Bret stood motionless, his arms belted to his sides, his little hands curled into fists. His mouth was trembling and there was a look of fear in his eyes. This fear and uncertainty, he\u2019d learned recently. The boy she\u2019d raised was fearless ... not this hesitant child.</p><p>The smile she gave him was weak and watery, and she could see that it scared him more. It wasn\u2019t her smile at all.</p><p>She started to cry; there was no way to stop it. She knelt in front of him and opened her arms. \u201cSo, how\u2019s my favorite boy in the whole world?\u201d</p><p>He screamed \u201cMommy!\u201d and flung himself into her waiting arms so hard that they toppled backward.</p><p>She lay there on the ugly linoleum floor, squeezing her son until neither one of them could breathe.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Bretster,\u201d she whispered against his small, pink ear. He buried his face in the crook of her neck. She felt, more than heard, his broken voice when he whispered back, \u201cI love you, too, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>At last they drew apart and climbed awkwardly to their knees. Mikaela\u2019s weak right leg was trembling so badly, she couldn\u2019t get to her feet. She stayed kneeling, unable to let go of Bret\u2019s hand.</p><p>Over his head, she looked at Rosa, who was crying now, too.</p><p>Mikaela sniffled. \u201cToo bad we can\u2019t sell all this water to the Californians.\u201d</p><p>Bret giggled. It was what Liam always said when Mikaela cried over a stupid movie.</p><p>She smiled at her son. \u201cSo, kiddo, what\u2019s new with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally May Randle has a crush on me. She smells bad, but she\u2019s sorta pretty.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela laughed, mesmerized by the ordinariness of it, seized by a sudden hope. Maybe, with time, they could all find their way out of the woods and back onto the main road. \u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy?\u201d she asked Bret.</p><p>Bret bit his lip and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Rosa looked down at Mikaela. \u201cHe did not come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at home,\u201d Bret said. \u201cI think he\u2019s sad \u2019cause you didn\u2019t remember him.\u201d</p><p>Mikaela grabbed the bed rail and dragged herself to a stand. She looked at Rosa. \u201cTake the kids home, Mama. I\u2019m going to check out of the hospital and meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Rosa frowned. \u201cThe doctors say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She started to say more, then changed her mind. \u201cPlease, Mama, take them home. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Rosa swallowed hard. \u201cWhat are you going to do, Mikita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Rosa sighed. \u201cS\u00ed. But, Mikaela, stay away from the front doors. The reporters, they are waiting for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacey moved toward Mikaela. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of anymore, honey. I\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>Mikaela smiled. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p> <p>After they left, Mikaela decided not to bother checking out of the hospital right now. There would be time enough for technicalities tomorrow. She called for a cab, then carefully packed up all the photographs from the bedside tables and windowsills. At the last minute, she folded up her hospital gown and placed it gently on top of the things in the suitcase\u2014to remind her always of this time. She didn\u2019t ever want to forget any part of it. It was the coma that had saved her life. She prayed only that she had not awakened too late. That was one thing she knew now. Some chances came and went, and if you missed them, you could spend the rest of your life standing alone, waiting for an opportunity that had already passed you by.</p><p>She\u2019d been unconscious for over a month. In reality, she had slept through the last fifteen years of her life.</p><p>Someone knocked at her door.</p><p>She froze, her heart thumping in her chest. Her gaze darted to the packed suitcase and empty table. Please don\u2019t let it be a nurse\u2014</p><p>Julian strode into the room as if he belonged there. \u201cI started sneezing this morning. I think I\u2019m developing an allergy to this Podunk town.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou should see the hoopla goin\u2019 on on Main Street. Grown men are walking around in Sasquatch costumes.\u201d</p> <p>Glacier Days. She\u2019d forgotten all about it.</p><p>In ordinary times, Liam would have been dressed in one of the Bigfoot costumes Mikaela spent hours putting together. Every year he grumbled about his dignity, and every year he ran in the race for charity.</p><p>\u201cKayla?\u201d</p><p>She limped toward Julian. When she was close enough to touch him, she stopped. Finally she saw him, the man and not the myth. He was still devastatingly handsome, still a shooting star in a dark sky that wasn\u2019t quite big enough to contain his magic. But when she looked past that, she saw what had been there all along, what had swept her up and then broken her to bits. She didn\u2019t need to see Julian and Liam side by side to recognize the difference between tinfoil and sterling silver.</p><p>\u201cOh, Julian.\u201d She said his name in a soft and tender voice that held a lifetime\u2019s regret.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the way you\u2019re looking at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t. You want to be watched, not seen.\u201d It was true, she realized. His was the magician\u2019s life, full of illusion and sleight of hand, where only one man saw what was behind the curtain.</p><p>\u201cKayla, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking lately. I realized how much I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jules.\u201d She sighed. It saddened her that she\u2019d given up so much of her life waiting for this cubic zirconia moment. As if they could simply ride off into the sunset together. She\u2019d forgotten that they\u2019d already gone that direction once. It had taken them to a place so bright and hot that everything they were burned down to ash.</p><p>He flashed her the grin she\u2019d seen a million times, the one that used to curl her toes and make her heart lurch into overdrive. \u201cI know you\u2019ve missed me, too.\u201d</p><p>At her look, his smile faded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, his voice uncharacteristically uncertain.</p><p>How did you tell a man that at last you\u2019d grown up, that you\u2019d learned true love wasn\u2019t a night of passionate sex under a sky lit up by fireworks, but an ordinary Sunday morning when your husband brought you a glass of water, two aspirins, and a heating pad for your cramps?</p><p>\u201cI used to have a dream,\u201d she began, gazing up at him. \u201cIt started right after I left you. It changed a little over the years, but the point of it was always the same. In the dream, I\u2019m an old woman with flowing white hair. My children have grown up and moved on and had children of their own. Liam is gone; he\u2019s been dead for many, many years.</p> <p>\u201cI imagine myself on a pink-sand beach. There is a white cottage behind me, and I know it is my home, where I live alone. I am sitting on the beach in a portable chair, as I do every day, all day. And one day I look up and an old man is coming for me. It\u2019s you, Jules. I realize then that I\u2019ve waited fifty years for you to show up. You tell me that you\u2019ve given it all up for me. You\u2019re not Julian True anymore. You\u2019re the other man, an ordinary man, the one whose name you never gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he answered softly. \u201cMy name is Melvin Atwood Coddington the Third.\u201d He tried to smile, as if anything about this moment were funny. \u201cWho would have guessed that Gibson would do so well with it?\u201d</p><p>She touched his face. \u201cYou should have been Melvin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night I had the dream again\u2014only I wasn\u2019t alone on the beach anymore. I was sitting with Liam, watching our grandchildren play in the water.\u201d She gazed up at him. \u201cI love him more than you can imagine, Jules. I only hope it\u2019s not too late to tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he loves you, Kayla.\u201d</p><p>She felt an aching sadness for all the things that could have been, for all the things she\u2019d lost while waiting for what could never be. \u201cThere is no Kayla, Jules. There never was. And you were never Melvin.\u201d</p><p>His voice was thick. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re saying good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jules, we said good-bye a long, long time ago. I\u2019m only just now getting around to leaving.\u201d She caressed his cheek, let her fingers linger there for a moment, then slowly she drew back her hand and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cWait! You can\u2019t just walk out of here. The press is waiting at the front door. I\u2019ll go make a statement, then I\u2019ll pick you up at the back door and take you ...\u201d He paused, said softly, \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to him. \u201cWhat will you tell them?\u201d</p><p>He looked sad. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them the story\u2019s over. That Sleeping Beauty found her Prince. They might ... follow you for a while.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd cover my glamorous life? After ten minutes, they\u2019ll realize that the ordinary life of a small-town doctor\u2019s wife is hardly front-page news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back with the limo. I\u2019ll meet you around back.\u201d He gave her a last, heavy look, then turned and left.</p><p>Mikaela reached for her suitcase, then decided to leave it in the closet. It was too unwieldy for her to carry, and it would only arouse suspicion. She called and canceled the cab. Empty-handed, she left her room. She kept her head down, and her side brushed against the wall as she made her slow, limping way down the hospital corridors.</p><p>When she opened the door, the first thing she noticed was the evergreen smell of Christmas. Green pine needles and fresh snow. A dark purple sky filled with the first few evening stars made her feel small. She smiled; that was what she expected from the sky. All her life, she\u2019d gone out at night and stood beneath all that blue velvet darkness. It was her temple, the true house of her God, and it never failed to remind her of her place.</p><p>She liked feeling small. It had been the wanting to feel big that had led her to Julian.</p><p>The limousine pulled up, the door opened, and she got inside.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>The limo crawled through town at the posted speed limit of ten miles per hour. Outside, there were people everywhere, moving in gray clouds of exhaled breath, walking beneath banners that read: WELCOME TO GLACIER DAYS.</p><p>Julian couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Mikaela, although she rarely looked at him. She directed the driver out of town, onto a back road where trees outnumbered houses a thousand to one. They turned into a driveway, passed beneath an arch announcing ANGEL FALLS RANCH.</p><p>Acres of white pastures rolled away from the road on either side, bracketed by four-rail fencing. Beneath a huge old tree, a dozen horses stood, their big butts turned into the wind.</p><p>Mikaela touched the smoked-glass windows. \u201cHi, babies,\u201d she murmured to the horses. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>At last the house came into view; it was a beautiful log structure set against the serrated black mountains. White icicle Christmas lights hung from the eaves and made the house look like a princess\u2019s castle.</p><p>The car pulled up in front of the house and stopped. The driver\u2014Julian could never remember his name\u2014hurried around to their door.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said to the young man as she got out.</p><p>Julian realized that not once in all these weeks had he offered the driver those simple words. He got out of the car and stood beside Kayla. She shivered with cold and he put an arm around her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, speaking of the house.</p><p>He looked down at her, only her. \u201cThe most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>The driver got back into the car and shut the door, giving them privacy.</p><p>Kayla turned to him. \u201cCome in with me, Jules. Meet your daughter.\u201d</p><p>He saw the sorrow in her eyes, and he knew that she understood what hadn\u2019t yet been said. Still, as always, she expected the best of him. It was, he knew now, one of the things he loved most about her. In all the world, she was the only one who had ever wanted him to reach for the man he could be.</p><p>He hated to hurt her again, to remind her of the painful truth. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Julian ...\u201d She said his name on a sigh of disappointment, a sound more intimate and knowing than any kiss they ever shared.</p><p>\u201cIf I walked through those doors, it would be a lie. We both know that. I don\u2019t want to do to Jacey what I did to you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and tried to smile.</p><p>It broke his heart, that soft realization in her beautiful eyes. \u201cTell me you\u2019ll always love me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She touched his cheek. In the coldness, her touch was a brand that burned his flesh. \u201cI\u2019ll always love who we were.\u201d</p><p>He felt and heard the continent that lay between his question and her answer. He knew as certainly as he\u2019d ever known anything that this time he would miss her forever. When his fans had died and the women no longer followed him, he would sit in a leather chair in his lonely house and dream of this woman who had once and truly loved him.</p><p>He reached down for her left hand. The plain gold band glittered in the pale glow of the limo\u2019s headlights. \u201cDo you still have the wedding ring I gave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to Jacey. Tell her ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Jules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her that out here, somewhere, is a man who wishes he were different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe different, Jules. Come in with me. You know Liam, he\u2019ll make a place for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam\u2019s not the problem. I wish ...\u201d He couldn\u2019t say it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d</p><p>Somewhere a branch snapped in the breeze, and it sounded dangerously like the breaking of his own brittle heart. \u201cI wish I could love you the way he does.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to answer, so he pulled her into his arms and kissed her for the last time. \u201cGoodbye ... Mikaela.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him and limped through the snow. One last time, she stopped at looked at him. \u201cGood-bye, Julian True.\u201d It was spoken so softly, he wondered later if he\u2019d imagined it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The house smelled of evergreen boughs and baking apple pie, of hollyberry candles and a newly stoked fire. Mikaela paused in the doorway, breathing in the welcoming scent of home. She could see her mother in the kitchen, alone, wiping down the tile countertops. Rose looked up suddenly. Mikaela pressed a finger to her lips and moved silently forward. As she passed the living room, she saw Liam sitting at the piano. Last year\u2019s Sasquatch costume lay heaped on the floor by his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the kids?\u201d Mike whispered to her mother.</p><p>Rosa pointed upstairs. \u201cThey are cleaning their bedrooms for you.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded. She could imagine how their bedrooms must look. No doubt Bret had at least a thousand chewy-bar wrappers strung across his desk. He\u2019d probably talked Rosa into buying him Twinkies and Ding Dongs. \u201cKeep them busy for a few minutes, will you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSi.\u201d Rosa started to turn away.</p><p>Mikaela touched her mother\u2019s arm. \u201cGracias, Mama. For everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDe nada, mi hija.\u201d With a quick smile, Rosa headed out of the kitchen and hurried upstairs.</p><p>Mikaela took a deep breath. It disconcerted her to see Liam at the piano, with his hands in his lap. She\u2019d missed his music. She hadn\u2019t realized until this moment how much a part of her it had become. Every moment and memory in her life seemed to be accompanied by some piece of music drawn from her husband\u2019s heart.</p><p>She tiptoed into the living room. A brightly lit Christmas tree stood in the corner, a thousand sparkling lights reflected in the black picture window. It was the first year ever that she hadn\u2019t chosen the tree and directed the placement of each ornament; it saddened her, this evidence that somehow her family had ... gone on.</p> <p>When she was directly behind Liam, she paused and closed her eyes. Please, God, don\u2019t let it be too late.</p><p>\u201cLiam?\u201d</p><p>He spun around so fast his knees cracked into the piano bench. When he saw her, he frowned, running a hand through his too-long hair. \u201cYou should be at the hospital,\u201d he said, looking awkward and uncertain.</p><p>\u201cTell me it\u2019s not too late.\u201d</p><p>He looked confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She sat down beside him, laid her hand on his forearm. She needed to be touching him, and yet she was afraid to do more. \u201cI wish I were smarter. I know there are words I need right now and I can\u2019t find them. For twelve years, you loved the woman I wanted to be. I used to look at you sometimes, especially when you were with the kids, and the ache in my heart ... I wanted to be the kind of wife you deserved. I just ... couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He stroked her hair, and she knew that the tenderness of his touch was as natural as breathing. \u201cI know that, Mike, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She flung the words at him, wincing at the high, tinny edge of desperation in her voice.</p><p>He yanked his hand back. \u201cMike, please ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, softer this time. \u201cI want to grow old with you, Liam Campbell. I want to sit on our porch and sip lemonade and watch our children grow up and go on and have children of their own. I want to fix holiday dinners for all of us, and watch our grandchildren learn to walk and talk and have them fall asleep in our arms.\u201d She gazed up at him.</p><p>For the first time, she knew it was in her eyes, all the bits and pieces and scraps of love she\u2019d collected over the years. Love, as pure and clean as rainwater, as complex as memories themselves. It was all for him, for this gentle, steady man who\u2019d always been there for her, whose heart she had so carelessly broken in a thousand little ways, in the things she hadn\u2019t said. Hadn\u2019t felt.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Julian?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>For once, the beloved name hit the hard shell of her rib cage and clattered away. No piece of it reached the tender walls of her heart. \u201cHe will always be a part of me ... but now, I can put him where he belongs\u2014in the past. Part of my wayward youth that was lived too hard and too fast and in a world that wasn\u2019t real.\u201d She caressed his cheek; it was a soft, fleeting touch. She hadn\u2019t the courage for more. \u201cIt was real, what I felt for Jules; I\u2019ll never deny that. No more lying to myself or to you or the kids. I loved Julian True. But it was a fragile love that didn\u2019t pass the test of time. When it broke apart, I never let it go. I held the pieces together, thinking\u2014dreaming\u2014that they\u2019d magically fuse again. I was so busy holding them, I never noticed the emptiness in my hands.\u201d Tears stung her eyes. \u201cI was a fool, Liam. And it took a smack upside the head to make me see the truth. You\u2019re the one I love, and if you\u2019ll give me another chance, I\u2019ll love you until the day I die. You\u2019ll never, ever wonder again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved you, Mike,\u201d he said simply.</p> <p>Tears blurred her vision. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he smiled, and now it was in his eyes, too, that love they\u2019d built together over all these years. She could see it, feel it warming her. \u201cI missed you. God, for twelve years, I missed you.\u201d</p><p>How was it that the profound simplicity of those words had the power to rock her world? Never again would she lose sight of what mattered, not for a day or an hour or even a minute. She would treasure every instant of her life from now on, for she knew something now, a deep truth that had eluded her all of her life. Love wasn\u2019t a great, burning brushfire that swept across your soul and charred you beyond recognition. It was being there, simply that. It was a few people, standing together in a living room, trimming a Christmas tree with the decorations that represented the sum total of who they were, where they\u2019d been, what they believed in.</p><p>It was simple, everyday moments that laid like bricks, one atop another, until they formed a foundation so solid that nothing could make them fall. Not wind, not rain ... not even the faded, watercolor memories of a once-brushfire passion.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cPlay me a song.\u201d</p><p>Something passed through his eyes; it almost looked like fear. Then, slowly, he faced the piano and lifted his hands. For a split second, his fingers floated hesitantly above the keys, and absurdly, she thought he doesn\u2019t play anymore\u2014</p><p>Gently, he began to play. He chose their song, \u201cA Time for Us,\u201d and the sweet, familiar music filled the room. She thought she heard him breathe a soft sigh, as if in relief, and when he finished the song, he turned to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, piano man,\u201d she said in a throaty voice, \u201ctake your wife to bed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and stood up, drawing her up alongside him. \u201cI know, I know, or lose my chance.\u201d</p><p>She held onto him, unable to stop touching him, even for a moment. \u201cYou already lost your chance, Liam Campbell. You should have run when I was in a coma. Now you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d She pressed up onto her tiptoes and kissed him with fifteen years of pent-up passion. When she drew back, she whispered the word that had brought her through the darkness: \u201cForever.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
