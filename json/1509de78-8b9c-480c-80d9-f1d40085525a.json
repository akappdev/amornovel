Huge in the sky, a brilliant, iridescent orb that seemed to stare down mockingly at the earth.</p><p>Though his night vision was excellent, it helped him to see.</p><p>From the Campanile, he had chosen to survey the city. He looked out at the dazzle of the evening; at the people milling about, at the clear beauty of the dark sky far above, and he felt his tension and awareness increase.</p> <p>Carnevale.</p><p>Venice.</p><p>The first true night of celebration. The first night of the grand balls . . .</p><p>Fat Tuesday.</p><p>The delirium of it all.</p> <p>Tonight. They would strike tonight.</p><p>For far below, crowding the streets, alleyways, and canals, were all manner of masqueraders.</p><p>Musicians, entertainers, stilt-walkers, rich and poor, all were out for a night of pretense, playacting, charades. The world here now was shadow, despite the lights that spilled forth in the city, despite the lanterns so many of the players carried.</p><p>Fat Tuesday . . .</p><p>The feast before Lent.</p><p>Yes, they would seek to feast tonight. And they would do so. Glut themselves . . .</p> <p>Unless ...</p><p>Silently, with the grace and skill of the natural born predator, he left his perch.</p><p>And entered the city.</p><p>Jordan Riley threw open the shutters at the window in her room at the Hotel Danieli, looking out at the loud and festive world around her. From her vantage point, she could see the waters of the Canale di San Marco, and down toward the Grand Canal; she could see the vaporettos, gondolas, and streams of people coming and going from the docks. Across the water was the magnificent dome of the church of Santa Maria della Salute. And, stretching her body out the open window, she could see, to her right, the beginnings of St. Mark\u2019s Square, the site of unbelievable revelry. The night was wild with the sounds of laugher and music, and everywhere there was camaraderie, joviality. The pre-Lent celebration might be well known and loved in other great cities as well, but Jordan didn\u2019t think that anyone else, anywhere, knew how to celebrate Carnevale quite the way the Venetians did.</p><p>No matter how strange, they were elegant as well.</p><p>\u201cJordan, ready?\u201d</p><p>She turned around. Her cousin Jared was standing in her doorway, though, if she hadn\u2019t known it was Jared, she wouldn\u2019t have had the least idea that it was he. He\u2019d come as the dottore, a popular costume here. Plagues had once consumed Venice, so the dottore wore a mask with a huge nose, usually beaked?reminiscent of the covering doctors had worn to combat the fetid vapors. The masks were elaborate, frightening. Jared wore a voluminous, hooded cloak as well; he hadn\u2019t been inclined to dress in anything as foppish as a Renaissance costume. The cloak and mask were easily donned; maybe that was why the costume was so popular.</p><p>\u201cReady? Yes! I can\u2019t wait. It\u2019s incredible out there!\u201d She\u2019d been to Venice several times before, but never for Carnevale. This year Jared and his wife, Cindy, had talked her into accompanying them to the festival. She felt a little awkward, being with the two of them but on her own at tonight\u2019s costume ball?unescorted. She felt just a bit like a fifth wheel. She spoke enough Italian to order room service and find her way around, but though it was true that many Venetians spoke English, she was afraid she\u2019d find herself seated next to strangers with whom she couldn\u2019t begin to converse. Still, the excitement of the trip had outweighed the fear.</p> <p>\u201cThank God! I thought you were going to try to weasel out tonight!\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cMe? Weasel out? Not on your life!\u201d Of course, she was lying. She\u2019d been thinking of doing exactly that until darkness had fallen, the music had begun, and the sheer vibrance of the evening had awakened a spirit of total devil-may-care adventure in her. Surely, there would be someone with whom she could talk, dance, and while away the hours.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smashing, by the way,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She walked from the window and dipped a curtsy to him. \u201cThanks.\u201d She\u2019d rented her costume at the last minute, but it was spectacular. Renaissance?a popular era here?</p><p>and festooned with sequins, faux jewels, and an overlay of lace. The gown had been available because Jordan happened to be petite?five three, standing very straight?and an even hundred pounds. The dress had been made for a young woman who\u2019d had to cancel about a month ago, and no one the right size had arrived since.</p><p>\u201cSmashing?and you look taller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the shoes,\u201d she told him, showing him the period shoes she wore. She wondered, however, if they\u2019d really worn such wretched heels in times gone by. Surely, this kind of heel was a modern nod to women\u2019s vanity.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope you don\u2019t shrink like Granny Jay. You\u2019ll be down to nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. Be cruel because you got all the \u2018tall\u2019 genes,\u201d she told him. Strange. He was so tall; she was so petite. But they had both inherited very deep green eyes from their Granny Jay. That, and her penchant for new places, people, and cities such as Venice, with its truly unique character.</p><p>\u201cDown to nothing,\u201d he repeated with a teasing sigh. She thought that he was grinning behind his mask.</p><p>\u201cCan you walk in those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. I practice in heels a lot,\u201d she assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to see over counters, and manage to climb up on a bar stool, when necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! You two, let\u2019s get going?it\u2019s late!\u201d</p><p>Cindy, dressed in black Victorian mourning, came to the doorway. Like Jared, she was tall.</p><p>\u201cJordan! Great shoes. Maybe people won\u2019t think you\u2019re my child tonight!\u201d Jordan groaned. \u201cCindy! You\u2019re going to torture me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture you. I\u2019m only five years older?and people ask me if I\u2019m the mother!\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both smashing!\u201d Jared said. \u201cTwo of the greatest beauties. .. there. That\u2019s said and done. Now, shall we go?\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they passed through the centuries-old lobby of the gracious hotel. Even the bellmen carried masks, and everyone greeted everyone. It was a night for compliments, fun, and eternal smiles.</p><p>They left the hotel and came out on the walk before the canal. The pavement was thronged. People jostled people, and apologies were given in dozens of different languages. Jared, tall as he was, craned his neck to see over the people. Water taxis, vaporettos and gondolas all used the docks in front of the Danieli, and the place was simply packed.</p><p>\u201cGirls, wait here just a minute. Our launch might be around the other side,\u201d Jared told them.</p><p>With a sweep of his cape, he walked away.</p><p>Jordan and Cindy moved toward the canal, away from the stream of pedestrian traffic, and waited while Jared went off to find the private launch which was to bring them to the ball. An annual event, the ball was always held in an historical palazzo, and was always one of the most prestigious events of the night.</p><p>Jared\u2019s surname was Riley, just as Jordan\u2019s, but his mother had been a Genovese. Loving all things Italian, he had become the Venetian rep for a major American travel firm. He spent almost as much time in Italy now as he did in the States. His Italian was excellent Jordan wished hers was better. A man jostled her, paused, tipped his hat, and went into a long apology. Having no idea what he was saying, she smiled and nodded and told him, \u201cPrego, prego!\u201d Literally I pray you in English, it was, in Italian, a catchall for almost anything. He smiled, tipped his hat again, and went on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to keep a good eye on you all night!\u201d Cindy told her. \u201cThat rat was trying to pick you up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, that was mean. How do you know he was a rat?\u201d</p><p>Cindy laughed, shaking back her long blond hair? very different tonight from its usual sleek cascade down her back, since she was wearing it in tight little ringlets. \u201cHe was dressed as a rat, Jordan, weren\u2019t you paying attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Jordan murmured. \u201cNo, I saw the tail and the gray felt on his shoulders, but. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRat,\u201d Cindy warned. \u201cRenaissance rat, but a rat just the same. We\u2019d best be careful. I imagine that there are a lot of rats out tonight. And wolves. And you look like prime bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls!\u201d Jared said, hurrying back over to them. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move down by St. Mark\u2019s Square?our fellow is way in back in the launch line, and he thinks he can get us easier ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, we need to move. The rats and wolves and basic slime-buckets are after Little Red, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Red?\u201d Jared demanded. This time, Jordan thought that he was frowning with confusion as he looked at her, but he was still wearing his mask, so she really couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cHer hair is as black as pitch, what\u2019s little \u2018red\u2019 about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind?he\u2019s no sense at all for fantasy,\u201d Cindy told Jordan, shaking her head with rueful affection.</p><p>\u201cWe simply need to take care of your cousin, dear. She\u2019s far too delectable looking this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Jared murmured, and she knew he was staring at her. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. Jordan, are those boobs all yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, how rude!\u201d Cindy protested.</p><p>Jordan laughed, her hands on her hips. \u201cYes, Jared, they are. How about you? What\u2019s behind that codpiece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God we\u2019re in Italy and everyone on the street isn\u2019t understanding the two of you!\u201d Cindy exclaimed. \u201cCan we get going?\u201d</p><p>They made their way through the crowd. Jordan was glad that Jared had such a firm hold on her arm; she could look around, stare, enjoy the sights and sounds.</p><p>The weather was crisp and cool, the city was wonderfully alive. Lights dazzled on the water, and each reflection caught in the shimmering canal was more beautiful, more colorful, and more fantastic.</p><p>Even the absurd was stunningly beautiful. The costumes ranged from elaborate period outfits, to fantasy, to animal. Birds strutted incredible plumage, cats were sleek and bejewelled. Newscasters from around the world interviewed people here and there; cameras whirred, music blared from the Square, voices and laughter rose above it all. They might celebrate in other places, Jordan thought again, but Venice was unique in its love of the sheer sophistication of dress-up; natives and visitors alike vied to be gorgeous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared led them to the landings directly in front of St. Mark\u2019s Square. Jordan turned, feeling as if someone were watching her. She looked up. The lion of Venice sat atop his high marble pillar, staring down at her. She looked around, at St Mark\u2019s Basilica and the Doge\u2019s Palace. By night, shadows seemed to dance, as if they were real entities, hiding behind gargoyles, proud equine statues, and other fantasy creatures set upon splendid architecture by some of the greatest artists who had ever lived.</p><p>A church bell tolled in the evening.</p><p>A dozen church bells tolled. Jared gripped her arm, leading her over the dock to their vaporetto, and soon they were shooting through waters as heavily laden with revelers as the streets of the city.</p> <p>\u201cAh, there, ahead?our palace!\u201d</p><p>She tried to remember everything she had heard about the event tonight. The ball was given by Nari Contessa della Trieste, a woman with a heredity as rich as that of the city itself. She was very wealthy, having married well?several times. Her first love, however, was the arts, and the Palazzo Trieste, far more of a palace than a castle, featuring the archways, architecture, stone and marble work of a building planned as a residence rather than a fortress from the very beginning. Beautiful, wrought iron gates allowed entry from the canals; there were elaborate, semicircular steps at the entry, where costumed footmen came to help the ladies and gentlemen from their conveyances.</p><p>Within the grand foyer, with its white marble staircase, they were greeted by their hostess. Of medium height and surely, a medium age, she was stunningly beautiful, dressed all in white, with huge white feathers sweeping the hem of her gown, an elaborate and very regal collar made of the same, and a mask of even longer feathers. She wielded her mask with experience, comfort and composure, nodding to the guests at her side, smiling, turning to greet the new arrivals. \u201cJared, benvenuto! Cindy, ciao, bella!\u201d She drifted across the floor, greeting them with kisses on both cheeks. Then she took both of Jordan\u2019s hands, stretching away to survey her. \u201cOh, la, the cousin, Jared! Bella, bella, bella, cara mia! You speak Italian, a little? Poco, eh? Grazie, grazie, bella, for coming to my little soiree, eh? Grazie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrazieanche ei,\u201d Jordan told her. \u201cMille grazie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do speak Italian!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jordan replied. \u201cA very, very little, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, still, dance, be merry. Most here speak English, but then, sometimes it\u2019s much, much better when a man cannot be understood, eh?\u201d She grinned, expressive dark eyes sliding over Cindy and Jared.</p><p>Jordan felt the strangest sensation of unease, wondering if their hostess weren\u2019t more familiar with her cousin than he had ever suggested. She quickly dismissed the thought; Jared and Cindy were very much in love, the perfect couple.</p><p>\u201cThe buffet is upstairs, the champagne is here!\u201d the contessa said, reaching out for glasses from a passing waiter. \u201cAnd the dancing, the dancing is everywhere.\u201d</p><p>As they moved on, Jared excused himself to her. \u201cJordan, I won\u2019t leave you alone for dinner, I promise.</p><p>There are a few business associates I have to see ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind deserting me?just you,\u201d Cindy teased.</p><p>\u201cYou know people here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone really know people here?\u201d Cindy queried, as they walked to the buffet table, looking around. The costumes here were even more brilliant than on the street?elegant and extravagant, costing thousands to tens of thousands of dollars, Jordan imagined. She began to feel underdressed in her sequins, faux jewels, and velvet Too many women were wearing real gems. On one medieval gown, Jordan was certain she could see the sparkle of dozens of real emeralds.</p><p>\u201cJordan, sorry, that peacock with the chubby butt and big fan is Mrs. Meroni. I must say hi to her quickly. Come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wander,\u201d Jordan assured her. \u201cGo talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch out for the rats.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I go for any wolves, I\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re very wealthy,\u201d Jordan assured her.</p><p>\u201cAnd young,\u201d Cindy advised. \u201cOr else, old enough to keel off immediately and leave you filthy rich in your own right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Cindy walked away from her.</p><p>He saw her walking idly to the buffet table.</p><p>She was small and perfect. A petite woman with dark, wavy hair curling over her shoulders, and drawn back from her forehead with a pair of slender braids in concession to the Renaissance style of the deep crimson gown she wore. Others might be more richly dressed; none wore a costume with such natural elegance.</p><p>As many here, she carried her mask, a silver and gold creation, on a wand. She pulled it away from her eyes, sipped her champagne, and studied a certain problem in regard to the buffet table?how to hold the drink, the mask and a tiny shrimp.</p><p>He left the balcony, and came down the stairs, studying her all the while. He joined her at the table, addressing her in Italian at first, but when her eyes immediately hit his with a certain confusion, he switched to English. \u201cGood evening. Excuse me for being so impertinent?\u201d he paused, lowering his voice?\u201cI believe one is supposed to have an introduction here, but as you seemed to be in some difficulty, I thought I would be of assistance.\u201d He reached out a hand, offering to rescue the champagne glass, the mask, or both.</p><p>She looked up at him, green eyes that rivaled any gem here, alight with a sparkle, a slow smile of rueful amusement curling her lips.</p><p>She spoke softly, too. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure I can accept your assistance. I\u2019ve just assured my cousin-in-law that I will watch out for rats and wolves and all predators of the night, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, unless they should be filthy rich,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She laughed, the sound a bit guilty as she looked around, the slightest touch of a frown furrowing her brow.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she murmured, looking him up and down once again. \u201cYou are a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wolf?\u201d he said with mock distress.</p><p>She indicated his costume. His mask was leather, with carved nose and teeth. He wore a black cape, but beneath it were worn strips of fur.</p><p>\u201cBut perhaps I\u2019m a young, very wealthy?filthy rich?wolf. Take a chance. Dance with me. Well,\u201d he amended thoughtfully, \u201chave a shrimp, finish your champagne, and then dance with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive recklessly. This is Venice. Carnevale.\u201d</p><p>Her smile deepened. She handed him her mask, quickly finished a shrimp, swallowed her champagne, and nodded. \u201cI will do my best.\u201d</p><p>In a minute, they were out on the dance floor in the rear, a terrace that looked over another section of a canal. The moonlight captured on the water reflected the dancers. They played a waltz; she had warned him she was an American and frightfully behind in the etiquette of dance, but she seemed to waltz as if she had been following his lead for years. She glided, she laughed, she stumbled, and grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit too tall,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bit too small. But we shall manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Italian?\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cA wolf?and not even Italian,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA citizen of the world,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut you are, of course, American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have been English,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but perhaps I\u2019m Canadian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve the clear mark of an American,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cOh, do I?\u201d It was true; everyone always seemed to recognize Americans immediately. Before they spoke. It was as if they wore the word American tattooed on their foreheads. \u201cFrom Charleston, South Carolina,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cItaly is my home away from home. At the moment. There are few in the world as warm and welcoming as the Italians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were born ... where?\u201d she inquired, curious green eyes bright on his.</p><p>He smiled, deciding not to tell her. There was little reason to do so. After tonight...</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have danced with her. He shouldn\u2019t have spoken with her. The mayhem was coming. But she had caught his eye; she had awakened his senses, perhaps his instincts. Then, it seemed, she was capable as well of charming the mind.</p><p>And the soul?</p><p>\u201cSir? Excuse me?Sir Wolf? Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar, far away,\u201d he said lightly, sweeping her in a circle. Then he paused at a tap on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSignore, per piacere ...\u201d</p><p>A Victorian gentleman, clearly English, broke in on him.</p><p>He acquiesced, bowing low. \u201cCare Americana,\u201d he told her. \u201cCiao, bella. Ciao, bella.\u201d She smiled at him, regret in her eyes, he thought. Or was it only that he could not help but hope?</p><p>He watched her dance away.</p><p>Her feet hurt?she had practiced in heels, but these were high. And the night was far from boring. First?</p><p>the wolf. The enigmatic, very tall, oh-so-charming wolf. She hadn\u2019t the faintest idea of what he really looked like. He wore his mask. And yet, his height was hard to hide. Would she recognize him again?</p><p>She would know his scent, she thought. Certainly. Very nice. An aftershave that was clean and woodsy but ... with a very sensual, musky undertone.</p><p>After the wolf?the Englishman.</p><p>Then a harlequin, or joker.</p><p>He complimented her gown, then her eyes and her hair. Then the length of her neck.</p><p>She laughed, kept her distance. \u201cYou are too effusive, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, never. Such lovely white flesh. The way your pulse ... beats.\u201d Just when she was beginning to feel uncomfortable, a Grim Reaper in brown leather and silk broke in on her. He was a Spaniard, tall, attractive. He commented on her wonderful energy, the ray of light that seemed to flow from her.</p><p>She thanked him. His features were colored with gray makeup, but his eyes were very dark and intense.</p><p>Sexy, she thought.</p><p>Cindy, you\u2019re right, there are wolves everywhere. Tempting wolves . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they spoke, a mummer in crimson tights and jacket came up on the terrace, ringing a bell, followed by a midget, clapping paddles together.</p><p>He spoke in Italian, at first, but translated for himself as well, to benefit all the guests at the ball. \u201cHear ye, hear ye, the masque begins! In days long, long gone, Odo, Conte of the Castello, had no son, but brought forth to the earth a daughter so glorious that the greatest of the nobility thought him rich. But Odo decried his lack of an heir, seizing his wife?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a middle-aged woman in a twelfth-century headdress, inquiring softly if she would play. She nodded, laughing, all for the game.</p> <p>\u201cSeizing his wife, he shook the poor wretched creature!\u201d He pretended to shake her. \u201cAnd gave her the kiss of death!\u201d</p><p>It appeared that he whispered to the woman; she went limp, he set her down.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d the crimson-clad mummer went on. \u201cHe married anew! But this wife, also, failed to give him a son!\u201d From the growing crowd around him, he found another matron who eagerly nodded her assent to act out the part of the Conte\u2019s wife. He whispered to her; she went limp. He carefully let her fall to the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnd again, he took a wife!\u201d</p><p>He seized another woman, who was giggling and nodding before he could ask. She went the way of the first two women.</p> <p>\u201cAlas, he went through more wives than Bluebeard!\u201d The mummer waltzed about the room, taking woman after woman.</p><p>Then he paused, dramatically shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cBut still, no woman gave him a son! So! He offered up his glorious, glorious daughter!\u201d The mummer came walking through the crowd. He, too, was tall and powerful, Jordan thought, muscles straining the form-hugging clothing.</p><p>He was walking toward her, she realized. She backed away. \u201cAmerican!\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo matter!\u201d he told her. He reached out a hand to her. She started shaking her head, but he had her already. She was a guest; she didn\u2019t want to be rude.</p><p>\u201cSo he offered his soul to the very devil to find the man who would be his daughter\u2019s husband, and take on the family name! Ah! And where was the devil?\u201d</p> <p>As the mummer walked around the room, looking for the devil, guests laughed and moved about. And then Jordan saw the crimson spill coming from beneath the head of the first woman who had fallen to the floor.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>She gasped, drawing a hand to her mouth, and began to scream.</p><p>The mummer saw her reaction, and snatched her up. She shrieked, trying to fight him off. He was stronger than she had imagined. And then, to her horror, she saw that the room suddenly seemed to be full of ...</p><p>Beasts. Demons. She was seeing things. Surely. Men clad in furs, capes, coats . . . women suddenly let out shrieking cries, displaying ... fangs.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d</p><p>She fought wildly, kicking, screaming. She found herself dragged to the far end of the terrace by the mummer.</p><p>His crimson coloring as dark as the blood that had spilled ...</p> <p>Suddenly, the mummer was wrenched away from her, and she looked into the eyes of the wolf.</p><p>The mummer snarled, hurling out vindictive words in a language she didn\u2019t know. The wolf responded.</p><p>The mummer struck at the wolf; the wolf ducked and fought back.</p><p>Jordan began to scream again and again as the force of the blow sent the mummer\u2019s head dangling to the side of his body, his neck broken.</p><p>All hell seemed to be breaking loose within the elegant palazzo.</p><p>Jordan stepped back, dazed.</p><p>Beasts were spilling from the house. Beasts! Creatures in all manner of costume! Animals, with huge long teeth now, with blood dripping from those . . . fangs.</p><p>Then she started to scream again because the wolf reached for her. She ducked low, but he was incredibly powerful.</p><p>He bounded from the terrace ...</p><p>Into fog! Sheer fog. A mist that had formed in the night, so rich, so thick, they seemed to jump into a black hole, into eternity ...</p><p>His feet thumped down hard upon something. A launch. It rocked wildly with the impact of their weight.</p><p>Jordan screamed with delayed terror; she could have fallen upon stone, upon marble, she could have broken her neck ...</p><p>She could have just fallen forever and ever, into the mist, into hell.</p><p>He set her down in the small launch, then looked up at the startled oarsman.</p><p>\u201cRow!\u201d he thundered. \u201cRow, row, now!\u201d</p><p>The fellow sprang to life.</p><p>Then the wolf sprang from the launch to the pavement.</p><p>And turned.</p><p>And was swallowed into the mist.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Morning.</p><p>Bright light.</p><p>No swirl of fog, no whisper of evil. Only the clear blue of an amazingly beautiful winter\u2019s day and the clink of cutlery, the chatter of many tongues, and the universal sound of laughter.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Jared said, his tone very soft, \u201cthat this is all because of Steven. I am so sorry to bring this up, and I have tried very hard not to, but Jordan, you are going on and on, after everything that has been explained. No matter how kind and patient people have been, you will not understand that it was all part of the party, a good taunting jest, and no more!\u201d</p><p>Jordan stiffened at her cousin\u2019s tone. She looked down at her hands, counting to ten. Steven had been dead for over a year. She had accepted the fact. She was not psychotic. At his death, she had been devastated, and she had grieved, and she had been angry, but she had never been paranoid.</p><p>She stared at Jared icily. \u201cThis has nothing to do with Steven. Nothing at all. It has to do with last night.</p><p>Historically, there have been monsters, human monsters,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd many of them very rich and exceedingly well positioned.\u201d</p><p>Jared let out a snort of aggravation. He leaned toward her.</p><p>\u201cJordan, get it straight. You were tricked, fooled. I understood at first; you were scared, worried sick, but you\u2019ve been told that the whole thing was a masquerade, an entertainment. If you persist with this, you\u2019re going to destroy my relationship with the contessa, and ruin my entire livelihood,\u201d he said, his words beginning with a tone of impatience, and finishing with a ring bordering on anger. \u201cTrust me?the contessa is an important, worldly and responsible woman. She gives huge sums of money to charities, and she enjoys entertainment, even scary entertainment. She is not any kind of a cultist.\u201d The last word stung like a slap, as did the edge in his voice. Jordan chose to ignore his tone.</p><p>To herself, she admitted that this morning, seated in the rooftop restaurant of the Danieli, with their attentive waiters polite and cheerful and very normal in their uniforms, she should have been able to let it go. It had all been explained to her.</p><p>Yet, she had kept on trying to explain what she had seen the night before!</p><p>Even the police had been angry with her at the end of last night. Still, as a book reviewer lucky enough to have earned a large syndicated audience, she\u2019d brought work with her on this vacation. In the pile of advanced reading copies and galleys to be reviewed? including volumes of fiction and nonfiction?she\u2019d happened to have a new book written by a Hollywood producer. The writer had been responsible for some of the most popular horror fiction seen at the movies in the past decade. It was a good book, and it went way beyond the movies, tracing the facts beyond the legends and myths that had sprung up through time throughout the world.</p><p>Jordan had listened to the explanations, the patience, the laughter, the anger. She\u2019d witnessed a show they told her. A show! A damned perverse show, and if that had been the contessa\u2019s idea of entertainment, she hadn\u2019t been in the least amused. Jared, so convinced that his relationship with the contessa was his key to the movers and shakers of Venice, wouldn\u2019t even consider the possibility that something evil might have occurred at the palazzo, even without the contessa\u2019s knowledge or cooperation. Nor would he support Jordan in her anger that the contessa should never have hired such sick entertainment.</p><p>\u201cJared, you\u2019re wrong. Very wrong. I am not letting my imagination get the best of me, I do not believe in ghosts, goblins or spirits, but I do know that bad things happen. And beyond just the bad, there are people out there who believe that they themselves are something supernatural. Listen to this, pay attention, and remember, this is just one of dozens of documented cases involving real people. Antoine Leger, a French mass murderer, was a cannibal?and he drank blood,\u201d she informed him evenly, her finger on the page as she stared at her cousin. \u201cHe went to the guillotine in 1824, a truly horrible man who deserved his fate. His crime? He hid out in the woods, waiting for his prey like a viper. Then he would strike out at young girls, rape them, kill them, drink their blood, and dine on their hearts.\u201d Cindy, who had been sitting quietly with them at the table, looked at Jordan with dismay. With an infinite patience now lacking in her husband, she reached over and gently touched Jordan\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re reading a book. It\u2019s just stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not fiction! \u201dJordan protested. \u201cI explained that this man was real?\u201d Jared set his cup of coffee down with an impatience that threatened to break crockery. \u201cIt\u2019s a book of stories, fiction, a work on vampires in film and legend,\u201d Jared said with exasperation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a book about vampires in films, books and history, \u201dJordan corrected, trying not to raise her voice.</p><p>She and Jared were both only children. They had been raised together, and usually, they were as close as if they had been born brother and sister. She understood that he loved this city, and that it was important for him to befriend people such as the contessa, yet it was still very hard for her to accept what she had seen as entertainment.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, I just can\u2019t believe you won\u2019t even consider the possibility that something did happen last night!\u201d</p><p>She knew that she was pushing it, but despite all the assurances that been given to her after the ball, and despite the beautiful, cool, sunlit Venetian morning, and her cousin\u2019s current discomfort, she couldn\u2019t let it go.</p><p>Near her, people drank their espresso and cafe con latte, laughed, chatted, and read their papers with utter normalcy. The world was light now, bright with sunshine, filled with talk, a multitude of languages, even the very down-to-earth cry of a baby. But no matter what explanations had been given to her, her hours of sleep had been punctuated by vivid, grotesque dreams of the \u2018show\u2019 she had witnessed the previous night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had all happened so fast...</p><p>She had somehow gotten the startled oarsman to understand her desire to get to a police station, despite the fact that in her horror and fear, she had forgotten every single word of Italian she had known. Luckily, police and polizia were close enough for the man to understand, and she had found herself taken to a station of the local carabinieri. There, she had found a kindly officer who spoke English, and he had assured her that the situation would be investigated immediately, even though he seemed doubtful when she told him she had been at the palazzo of the Contessa della Trieste. Babbling and close to hysteria at first?deeply frantic then for Jared and Cindy?she had told him about the story-telling and playacting that had ended in real blood and real death, and that there had been a roomful of costumed people turning into monsters who had attacked the others even as they had stood and watched and laughed. Cafe latte laced strongly with brandy helped calm her. She finally spoke with enough reason and conviction to send the officers off en masse, despite the fact that it was Fat Tuesday and all kinds of charades and masquerades were going on, and she was speaking about the palazzo of a very well-known woman.</p><p>The carabinieri had returned with Jared and Cindy?and the contessa. They had all come in worried, but the contessa had also been amused from the beginning, even though she seemed to be apologizing\u2014she hadn\u2019t expected such gullibility from such a lovely and sophisticated American girl. Actually, she had been damned condescending. At that point, however, Jared had acted like her older brother, showing his deep concern for her panic and fear, holding her, eyes worried as they probed hers, his tone very gentle as he explained she had been caught in a bit of elaborate theater, scary Carnevale fun, and that there had been nothing really violent or gruesome in what she had seen, and certainly, nothing murderous had taken place.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t known about that particular piece of scary fun the contessa had planned, and the contessa hadn\u2019t known about Steven. It was probably even natural that Jordan had been so terrified at what had really been no more than a haunted house display. But now that she knew ...</p><p>Jordan had persisted then. She tried to convince the contessa that some of her guests had been madmen, and that perhaps she\u2019d had no idea of what had been happening at her own party, but murders had taken place. The contessa shook her beautiful head with sorrow and regret. The kindly English-speaking officer cleared his throat, and told Jordan that they had searched the palazzo. All they had found were costumed guests, a few still wearing their fake blood, all contrite that they had frightened her so badly.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m telling you, I saw people die,\u201d she said. \u201cGo back?they\u2019ve cleaned it up. I don\u2019t know much about police procedure, but perhaps if you were to use Luminal?\u201d It was then, Jordan was certain that the contessa got angry, for she began speaking rapidly in Italian to the officers, inhaling deeply for patience, then speaking to Jordan again. \u201cMy dear, as you are Jared\u2019s cousin, I will forgive this terrible affront, but you must simply forget all the silly movies you Americans see and accept the fact that we, too, have a sense of fun and the macabre. And,\u201d she added quietly, \u201cwhat happened to your fianc\u00e9. Jared has explained to me, of course, about your past, and so, dear child, I do understand, and my heart goes out to you. My palazzo remains open to you. You are dear to me, as the cousin of Jared, and you must come anytime and see that the festivities and the amusements are over, and that we did nothing but provide a party and a charade. Dear, dear, Jordan, poor dear. I am so sorry, but please! You must be sane and rational about this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and we must let the contessa go home,\u201d Jared said firmly, and before she could protest longer, the police were apologizing to the contessa and ushering them out to the street. The contessa had kissed Jordan\u2019s cheek with cold lips, urging her again to come by at any time. Despite their growing impatience, the police had remained kind to her throughout, far kinder than Jared when?after the contessa had departed in her private launch?she had kept trying to explain that she had seen real blood, nearly perished herself, and been rescued by a man in wolf\u2019s clothing.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this man?\u201d Jared had demanded.</p> <p>\u201cHe leaped with me from the balcony, then .. . disappeared into the fog.\u201d They stared at her as if she had entirely lost her mind. Yes, poor Jordan. God knew, maybe she needed to be committed to the closest facility for the insane.</p><p>Back at the hotel, Cindy had managed to find a concierge who made Jordan tea, and then offered to sleep in her room. Jared\u2019s sigh of impatience had caused her to decline. But alone in her handsome, antiques-laden room in what she truly considered to be one of the most beautiful hotels in the world, she still had not been able to sleep. It had been the words of the contessa that had caused her to dig into her pile of work, and find the book written by the movie producer. She tried to read before realizing that Cindy had slipped a Valium into her tea. She had fallen asleep with the book in her hand, but the Valium hadn\u2019t stopped her dreams. She had witnessed the events time and time again; she dreamed that she awoke, that a huge silver wolf guarded her window. He was framed in the shutters that opened to the pedestrian walk and canal where just hours before, the last sounds of laughter and revelry had faded into the darkness and shadows of the moonlit night Okay, so the party and the Valium had caused her some serious nightmares. That didn\u2019t stop her belief that maybe ...</p><p>She broke off her own thought painfully, then continued with it.</p><p>Yes, maybe some cultists or some wretched coldblooded murderers had been at work.</p><p>Jared leaned toward her, at the rooftop restaurant of the Danieli, all attempts at patience suddenly lost.</p><p>\u201cJordan, please, I am begging you?you\u2019ve got to stop. These are people I work with. The contessa is incredibly important to my job, my position here in Italy, to my career, my life! If you keep up with this, you will destroy me. Can\u2019t you understand? A party, masks, costumes, a haunted house, special effects, elaborate, yes! The contessa likes to have the best ball, the most talked-about. Leave it?leave it alone.</p> <p>All of Venice will be talking as it is. You will destroy me, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, I\u2019m telling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the police have told you. And the contessa left her party to come to you, because you were so frightened. Everyone has bent over backward to explain what went on to you, and you refuse to accept it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, you weren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>He got up, throwing his napkin on the table. \u201cI have to go. Jordan, get a fucking grip before you ruin my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d Cindy protested, speaking out again at last \u201cJordan is your cousin, your flesh and blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich she seems to have forgotten. You sit here and listen to her make up wild stories and convince herself that monsters exist.\u201d He stared hard at Jordan, placing his hands on the table to look into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, so sorry about what happened to Steve. We\u2019ve tried to be with you. To support you.</p><p>And you\u2019ve been good, Jordan. Sane. But Carnevale has apparently touched off something inside you.</p> <p>Again, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve had it. I\u2019m tired?and guess what? I have a lot of bridges to mend today. I have to see a lot of people and apologize for my cousin behaving so insanely.\u201d He turned and left, striding angrily from the terrace. Cindy, standing awkwardly, stared down at Jordan where she was sitting. \u201cI know he doesn\u2019t mean to be so . ..\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, you don\u2019t need to apologize to me for Jared,\u201d Jordan murmured.</p><p>Wrong thing to say. Cindy instantly became defensive. She sat again and stared at Jordan.</p><p>\u201cJordan, you\u2019ve got to realize that you are risking his job, that he\u2019s friends with these people, that the contessa is very important to his work.\u201d Cindy sighed. \u201cHonestly, Jordan, I know that you were really scared, and we should be there for you, but it\u2019s true, it was all explained to you. With concern, care, and a great deal of empathy. And you have this foolish book with you, making it all the worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSignorina, more coffee?\u201d</p><p>Jordan looked up. Even their kindly waiter was staring at her sympathetically. Had he heard all about the crazy American who had gone bananas last night at the contessa\u2019s macabre party, inviting the police to a bit of sport? Maybe she was being an idiot and she should see it all Jared\u2019s way. Entertainment. Damned bloody entertainment, but then, the contessa had been right about one thing?the gore had been no worse than what she should be accustomed to from American movies. Although, she might have countered, Italian filmmakers, such as Mario Brava, were surely just as gruesome.</p><p>She resolved not to try to convince Cindy anymore that there were monsters loose in Venice. Maybe she was overreacting. Perhaps she had been reading too much, too long. The sun was shining. It was a beautiful morning, especially for a winter\u2019s day.</p><p>She smiled for the waiter. There was no sense in trying to convince any of them?they hadn\u2019t been there, they hadn\u2019t seen. Who had? A group of masked strangers she would never recognize again. Enough coffee. She needed to move.</p><p>To be alone.</p><p>\u201cNo, basta, grazie, signore,\u201d she murmured. She stood, ready to walk away. Cindy looked at her with sudden panic.</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSignora?\u201d the waiter said, questioning Cindy. Surely, someone wanted more coffee.</p><p>\u201cNo, grazie, basta. It conto, per favore,\u201d Cindy said quickly. She started to rise as well. \u201cJordan, wait, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not off to the police again. I\u2019m just going for a walk around the Square.\u201d The waiter had gone to get the check as Cindy had asked. Jordan had tried to sign most of the bills to her room as a thank-you for all that Cindy and Jared had done for her here. This morning, Cindy could sign. Jared had been a horse\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should go out alone?\u201d Cindy said, frowning in protest.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You just told me there are no monsters out there. It\u2019s all in my mind. Entertainment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd apparently, I have to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, wherever you\u2019re going, I\u2019ll go with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just need to walk, Cindy. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, please ...\u201d</p><p>Cindy looked so upset that Jordan forgot some of her fear as well as irritation with Jared. She paused, touching Cindy\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m okay, honestly. I\u2019m going to walk around the Square and look into some of the jewelry store windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can get better deals off the Square. You\u2019ll find nothing but tourist prices. I\u2019ll take you to some more moderate places?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, you\u2019re a sweetheart. I love you, honest to God, and I\u2019m not in the least upset with you. See you later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re going to the artist\u2019s ball tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Jordan said, and determined, she shoved the vampire book into her large carryall bag and started out of the restaurant. She didn\u2019t wait for the elevator, but started down the steps of the hotel, noting none of the beautiful decor which usually held her so enthralled. On the ground floor, she encountered a bevy of activity. The parties in Venice would last the week. A costume shop had been opened behind the concierge desk, and people were milling about, renting costumes, returning them, talking about various parties and events. The registration desk was busy as well, with travelers coming and going, and the bar and salon seemed equally busy. Making her way through the crowd, she suddenly felt as if she was being watched. She turned, irritated with herself, hoping she wouldn\u2019t have this feeling of everyone looking at her all day.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t being absurd?she was being watched. Openly. An attractive young woman was staring straight at her while whispering to a stocky, older man standing by her. She saw Jordan look at her. She didn\u2019t blush, look away or pretend in any way that she hadn\u2019t been talking about her.</p><p>The woman approached Jordan. Frowning, Jordan waited. As the woman neared her, Jordan realized that she wasn\u2019t as young as she had first thought. From a distance, she might have been in her mid-twenties. At closer range, she was closer to forty, extremely trim and shapely, her hair cut stylishly short and highlighted to a silvery blond. Smiling, she extended a slim hand heavy with rings. \u201cHello, Miss Riley. I\u2019m Tiff Henley, a fellow American.\u201d</p><p>Jordan accepted the hand that had been offered her. \u201cHello, how are you? Yes, I\u2019m Jordan Riley, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never met last night, but I was at the ball. I\u2019m so glad that you seem to be doing well. You caused quite a stir last evening.\u201d</p> <p>Jordan felt a flush covering her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you wound up on the second floor during the entertainment, while most of us were dining and dancing on the ground floor. I didn\u2019t see the show, but you know, the contessa is known for her extravagance, so I\u2019m sure it must have been simply wicked. I\u2019m not that familiar with the contessa, but I\u2019ve heard that she never leaves a party with guests still in attendance, so she must care for you very much. You are all right?\u201d</p><p>So this manicured socialite had been at the ball as well. And she had been whispering about Jordan.</p><p>Jordan Riley, the American woman who had called the police in on one of the most notable women in Venetian society. Great. Maybe everyone in the city had heard about her, and was whispering.</p><p>In the bright light of the elegant hotel, with dozens of people near, Jordan did suddenly feel somewhat foolish. Had the entertainment been so excellent and professional, the special effects so good, that she had let her imagination take flight?</p><p>\u201cI suppose I did create quite a stir. I\u2019m afraid it all seemed very real,\u201d Jordan said. The woman was still sizing her up. For Jared\u2019s sake?even if he was being a horse\u2019s ass?she was going to appear sane.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a writer?\u201d Tiff Henley queried.</p><p>Tiff? Was that short for Tiffany? The woman looked like a Tiffany?all decked out in diamonds, hair a mix of champagne and silver, her long wool dress and jacket stylishly cut to the perfection of her figure.</p> <p>\u201cBook critic, \u201dJordan said. \u201cIf I could write, I would. I\u2019m afraid my talent is in finding treasures put out by others. And you ... ?\u201d She queried politely.</p><p>Tiff smiled ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m simply filthy rich,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not well known in the best circles of society.</p><p>Well, there, that admitted, would you like to have coffee sometime?\u201d The woman was openly friendly, brash, and had probably become filthy rich in some scandalous way.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019d love to,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Why not? Jordan thought. \u201cSounds great. Are you staying here?\u201d Tiff shook her champagne-toned head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m here with a friend, Mack over there?\u201d she pointed out the stout man?\u201cwho needs a costume for the artist\u2019s ball tonight. Are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I believe we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll enjoy it. The tickets are cheap, the food is so-so. The artist\u2019s ball celebrates the often talented and more often broke creative element in Venice for Carnevale. And, when all else fails, the drinks are usually strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you there then,\u201d Jordan told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to actually see me?I\u2019ll be costumed, of course. But we\u2019ll find one another. And make arrangements for coffee. I\u2019ve rented a villa, next island over. It\u2019s a fabulous old place, owned by the family of a doge long past. If you like, you can come there. Great history, ghosts, scandal, and all. I\u2019ll tell you some of the tales I\u2019ve been told. Oh! Sorry. I mean, I don\u2019t want to scare you or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not scared that easily,\u201d Jordan assured her.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d She smiled and started away. Then she paused, coming back. \u201cDon\u2019t let it bother you if people whisper about you today. They whisper about me all the time, and I\u2019ve survived!\u201d Before Jordan could say more, Tiff had walked back to her friend. Jordan was surprised to realize that she felt much better after her conversation with the very blunt woman. She smiled, starting out of the hotel again. She mused over the woman\u2019s reassurance without really having to wonder why people would whisper about Tiff. Surely, it had something to do with her lifestyle.</p><p>Outside the hotel, vendors displayed their goods. The usual T-shirts were for sale, as were dolls and masks by the hundreds. By day, many people were in street clothes, as she was, but even by sunlight, many people were costumed. Walking in broad daylight, Jordan saw the masked and elaborately dressed strollers for what they were?revelers enjoying the beauty and make-believe of the immense party which was Venice at Carnevale. The air was cool, the day was bright, the sky was blue. Crossing the bridge outside the Danieli, she paused, looking down the canal to the Bridge of Sighs, connecting the Doge\u2019s Palace and the old prisoners to the new, where many a poor man had passed to his imprisonment, or his doom. That had been the past. This morning, a gondolier with a young couple in his sleek black gondola was singing an Italian love song. As he then came through the canal and glanced up at Jordan, he broke into English verse. \u201cWhen the moon hits your eye like a big piece of pie, that\u2019s amore!\u201d He winked. Jordan lifted a brow with a half smile and waved to the happy couple.</p><p>The gondolier stopped rowing, drifting slowly as he passed beneath her. \u201cBuon giomo, signorina!\u201d he called to her. \u201cCare for a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have passengers!\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cAh, but they are in love. I am alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, such is life,\u201d she teased. \u201cYour gondola is occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must ride another time. I\u2019m Sal. Salvatore D\u2019Onofrio. The best. The most fun, the most handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the most modest!\u201d she supplied.</p><p>He grinned and shrugged. \u201cNo, not the most modest. But you look for me, some other time, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I decide on a gondola ride, I will definitely look for you,\u201d she promised.</p><p>The girl in the back of the gondola, huddled to a young man who couldn\u2019t be much more than twenty, called out to Jordan, her accent French. \u201cHe is the best!\u201d Jordan laughed. \u201cThanks! Enjoy!\u201d</p><p>As the gondola drifted beneath the bridge, Jordan moved on.</p><p>St. Mark\u2019s Square was crowded with people. Passing the entrance to the basilica, Jordan looked over the heads of the ever-moving horde to see that a costume parade was going on by the makeshift bandstand at the opposite end of the Square. A rock band was playing, and a jester was introducing the contestants in English and Italian, throwing in a few words of French here and there. Those in the most fetching and extravagant costumes posed at the columns around the Square for tourists who snapped endless photos. With their masks, most of the elaborately dressed people were wholly anonymous?it was impossible to tell a person\u2019s nationality, color, or even sex.</p><p>Anonymous . .. there is the key, she thought. It\u2019s so easy to come here, don a mask, slip into the crowd, and ...</p><p>The thought brought back a strange sense of unease. In truth, she wouldn\u2019t know anyone she had seen at the ball last night. Except for the contessa, of course. They had met face to face. But the others who had been there ... they might be in the Square with her now, and she would not know.</p><p>She walked through the crowd, suddenly anxious to reach the streets beyond the Square where she would not be quite so tightly packed in by the throngs. An excellent Napoleon?followed by his court?was at her side. He stopped, bowed low, and indicated that she should precede them. She thanked him quickly and walked on by.</p><p>Passing by a plate glass window that displayed mannequins in various costumes, she suddenly went dead still, staring into glass.</p><p>For a moment.. .</p><p>No. It was just a mannequin. This one with a male form, with a short cut, sable brown wig. For a moment, she thought she had seen Steven\u2019s face on the mannequin. Serious hazel eyes, lean features, firm chin. But she was looking at a plastic mold, expressionless features. No hat and no mask adorned the dummy; it was just a well-painted figure in the typical cape. Still, her heart raced, and she mistrusted her own judgment more than ever. Maybe Jared was right. Steven had been dead only a year. He had died chasing down deadly game players. Cultists?with a yen for murder, for sacrifices to their cruel beliefs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She studied the mannequin again, forcing herself to think logically.</p><p>Yes, she could see why she\u2019d had the momentary vision.</p><p>The lean features were similar to Steven\u2019s. The eyes had been painted hazel; the hair was his color as well. The size was about right.</p> <p>A surge of sorrow swept through her. A year wasn\u2019t such a long time.</p><p>He had come suddenly into her life, and she had found herself suddenly responding. He had been charming, intelligent, impressive . .. noble.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been a cop, she thought. He had been too trusting. He had hated violence, but had come on the force in homicide?a man who had believed in rehabilitation, who was completely against the death penalty, and was determined that suspects must be taken alive.</p><p>Taking suspects alive had cost him his own life.</p><p>She had known what had happened when she heard the sirens in the night, when she looked out her door and saw the cop car, and the officer coming down her walk. She had known what he did; she shouldn\u2019t have been shocked. That hadn\u2019t stopped her from being horrified, devastated. She had gone through the stages of grief: denial, anger, pain. But she had remained sane.</p> <p>She had come to the stage of acceptance. She hadn\u2019t lost her reason or her mind in any way.</p><p>Maybe she had, she mocked herself, if she was seeing his face in the features of a store-window dummy.</p><p>Steven was gone. She still felt the sorrow, but she was living her life. He had died under cruel circumstances, and she would be a fool to forget that horrible things did happen.</p><p>A breeze whispered. Soft, cool, beautiful. She forced the past to the back of her mind. She loved Italy, adored Venice, and was not going to let the contessa ruin that simple fact.</p><p>She looked away and kept walking. She was not to blame in this. If it had all been a charade, it had been a deplorable one. Jared had no right to be so callous, and she had every right to be furious.</p><p>Beyond the Square, she came to streets filled with cafes and shops. Glancing through the window of a restaurant specializing in fish, she noted that many people had doffed their masks for the singular pleasure of eating. They all looked so... normal. A chubby little businessman had his cape thrown over his shoulder while his dottore mask lay on the chair by his side. A half moon mask and a large plumed hat lay on the table by the side of his companion, an equally chubby woman with a charming laugh that rang all the way to the streets. Americans, Jordan thought. Vacationers, like herself, loving this fantasy.</p> <p>Looking into the restaurant had made her smile. Yet even as she watched, smiling back at the woman who had seen her, she felt an eerie feeling creep up her spine.</p><p>Stop! she commanded herself.</p><p>But the feeling persisted.</p><p>And it had nothing to do with memories of Steven. She had been smiling at a plump and friendly looking American woman when the strange sensation began a trek along her spine.</p><p>She felt again that she was being watched.</p><p>Whispers seemed to sweep by her, snatches spoken in the wind, there and then gone. Whispers, swift, staccato, like an evil, raspy breeze, just touching her ears, her nape. For a moment, the street seemed to go dark. Reflected in the glass of the restaurant window, darkness seemed to descend, like huge wings sweeping over the daylight.</p><p>The woman seated inside the restaurant was still laughing. The darkness disappeared as swiftly as if it had flown away on wings of light. And still ...</p><p>That feeling.</p> <p>Something... someone. . . right beside her. A cold, fetid, whisper of menace ...</p><p>Jordan swung around, feeling as if bony fingers of sheer ice touched upon her shoulder.</p><p>Gino Meroni did not at all dislike his work.</p><p>Years ago, when he was a boy, his parents had immigrated to America. He went to high school in New York City, but had neither the money nor the inclination to go any further with his schooling. By the time he was eighteen, his mother and father were still producing more offspring, and so he found himself on his own, trying to make a go of it. He was expected to work, to help with the family, but he couldn\u2019t stand the crying of babies, and his mother\u2019s prayers and insistence on church every Sunday, or the sorrowful darkness in her eyes each time she warned him that he was running with the wrong crowd. He liked his friends.</p><p>They knew the cheapest bars. And where to get money when they were broke. They knew which subway routes were poorly policed. They were excellent at removing the burdens of purses, briefcases, and backpacks from those who were surely weary of carrying them. Once, when plying his trade along Fifth Avenue late at night, he made the mistake of mugging an undercover officer.</p><p>He did a stint in jail. He called home. His father refused to bail him out. He never went to prison; his attorney managed to plea bargain a sentence of time served and community service. Community service led him to work in Central Park, a fine place to master the art of surprise and attack.</p><p>One night, the thump on the head he gave to an old geezer who had picked up the wrong prostitute killed the man. He didn\u2019t know it at first; he read about it in the paper the next morning. He wasn\u2019t afraid of being caught; he had learned to wear gloves, to strike, and to run. He hadn\u2019t been seen. The branch with which he had killed the fellow lay on the walk by him and bore no prints. The prostitute, who had lain screaming and begging for her life, hadn\u2019t seen his face or heard him speak. She had run faster than Gino had after he attacked the old man.</p><p>His lack of fear at being caught was somewhat surprising to him. More so was his total lack of remorse.</p><p>The guy had been old. The whack on the head he had bestowed on him had merely put the geezer out of any future misery.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t it. Gino had liked the look of fear on the guy\u2019s face. He had liked the feel of wielding the broken branch with so much power that it shuddered in his hands as it struck gray hair, flesh, and bone.</p><p>Robbing the unwary, however, wasn\u2019t enough. He had to get work?a day job. The only work he could find where he wasn\u2019t asked too many questions was nonunion, back-breaking labor at the docks. There, the bosses liked to use men who didn\u2019t have references. They didn\u2019t believe in bonuses. Overtime was overlooked. He had a strong, burly build. When he worked, he worked hard. His English was perfect, unaccented, though he could slip into the role of a struggling new immigrant when he found it necessary or convenient.</p><p>In a bar one night, he met a stranger who gave him some veiled hints on how to improve his income.</p><p>He agreed to meet the stranger again.</p><p>The man opened up a new world to him.</p><p>First, there were the drugs. What a difference they made after a long day of hard labor. Gino was a good-looking man. The stranger provided not just drugs, but women as well. They liked him. They liked the accent he could affect at will. Every night, when he chose, there was something. Some sweet reward.</p><p>He knew, of course, that nothing in life was free. He expected to be asked favors in return. They were usually easy. Because of his work habits by day, he was trusted. His powerful friends asked only that certain shipments at certain times go by without inspection, that certain crates be guarded and never opened. He was more than happy to oblige. He had a new car, a decent apartment. There were days when he stayed in some of the finest hotels despite his own pleasant lodgings. So little to pay, so much to be gained.</p><p>Then, late one summer afternoon, when he was about to call it quits for the day, two inspectors arrived at the docks. The Star of Sheba, registered to a Middle Eastern country, was about to leave port. There were a number of crates aboard that had been slipped onto the ship illegally. They were important; that had been emphasized to Gino. Crewmen, suspecting something was up, mysteriously disappeared. Gino found himself alone with the two men from the government.</p><p>One of them had put down a crowbar. Gino decided to use it. He stowed the two dead men behind the crates. The Star of Sheba sailed as planned. But the bodies were found, and this time, he had forgotten to get rid of the crowbar, and there were those who had seen him with the government men. The good thing was that the crates reached their destination undisturbed. The bad was that Gino was arrested and charged with murder.</p><p>His friends, naturally, provided him with an attorney, an extremely attractive woman. When he tried to flirt with her and make light of his situation, he found out that she was very intelligent. Sharp as a tack, hard as a nail. He was immediately put in his place as she explained the gravity of the situation.</p><p>Jail was bad, his attorney told him. Prison was much worse. There were lots of guys in there much bigger than he was. All those things he had done to others could be done to him. And looking over the physical evidence... well, she could plea bargain, but he might find himself being a pincushion and more for men who were truly the dregs of society. As they talked, he came to realize that the best thing to do was what she suggested: escape and leave the country. She had a place in Italy; he could go back to his real home. He had come from Bari; her home was in Venice. No matter. There was plenty he could do for her. False papers could be arranged, and the actual escape seemed of little difficulty for his powerful friends. The idea appealed to him far more than being buggered by a bunch of apes. Filthy, toothless, animals, hardly human.</p><p>They arranged the escape for a day he was scheduled to be transferred to another facility. The driver of his car was apparently with his friends; the police escort was stopped by another police car. His escort simply disappeared; he never asked how.</p><p>At a hotel outside the airport he was given new clothing and a passport with a new identity. He reached Venice via Paris. At first, he had little to do; very little to do. He was warned that he must lie low, that he needn\u2019t seek income in any other way than his work for his friends. For a few years, he wasn\u2019t sure what his real worth was?he worked for an important woman, but he was a delivery man, a courier, and captain of the launch. His employer had been away for many years; she was just now reestablishing herself in her family home, yet she was very often gone: a woman of her stature and means had many social obligations in other countries.</p><p>Nor were women such as she bound by the rules of others.</p><p>In time, he discovered what his true talents were to be for his employer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dislike his work. He didn\u2019t mind the cold, the sharp breeze that blew around him, nor the rocking of the boat in winter. The ... messiness of his work didn\u2019t bother him, either. Thinking in American terms, his was a job right up his own alley. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he made a sudden realization, and he was afraid.</p><p>His employer was wonderful. But she wasn\u2019t to be crossed.</p><p>In the middle of his work, filling and weighting the barrels he would sink to the bottom of the Adriatic Sea, he was suddenly very aware of a cold breeze.</p> <p>He dumped all the barrels he had filled, frantically looking around, counting, piecing together, counting again.</p><p>Ice filled him, colder than the sea.</p><p>He was missing a piece of cargo.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Nothing.</p> <p>Still standing in front of the restaurant, Jordan turned around slowly once again, puzzling over the strange sounds of whispering and the impression of winged shadows that had teased her senses. Scanning the street around her, she hoped for a moment to see if the outgoing and brassy Tiff had perhaps followed her route, and was watching her, ready to approach her again.</p><p>But as she looked around, there was no one in the busy street who appeared to be the least interested in her. Groups of people laughed and joked together. She heard bits of different languages?English, Italian, German, French?but she didn\u2019t feel even the faintest hint of a cold breeze touching her nape or hissing in her ear.</p><p>Then, suddenly, she heard her name called.</p><p>\u201cJordan! Jordan!\u201d She spun in the opposite direction as her name was repeated in a loud and friendly summons. Lynn Mallory, an American artist working at the Venetian shop where she had acquired her costume the evening before, was hailing her from the door of the shop. Jordan hadn\u2019t realized that she had walked quite so far, that she was right across from the Arte della Anna Maria, named for the impressive Venetian woman who had formed the co-op store for rising and talented young entrepreneurs.</p><p>\u201cLynn!\u201d she called back, starting over, then ducking back as the same Napoleon and his courtiers came rollicking along. Once again, Napoleon stopped, bowing low to her. \u201cOh, wait, wait! Please, wait!\u201d someone pleaded. A camera flashed. Napoleon smiled regally, then swept his arm again. Jordan hurried by, and he moved on with appropriate hauteur and arrogance.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d Lynn said, greeting her typically with a kiss on both cheeks. Her eyes were merry and bright.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is your costume? In true style, you know, you should dress even to wander through the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I was in a far more casual mood this morning,\u201d Jordan said lightly. Lynn was about Jordan\u2019s age with close cropped dark hair and smoky gray eyes. Jordan, speaking such poor Italian, had found a bond with the American girl the moment she stepped into the shop for the first time two days ago. Lynn\u2019s mother was an Italian-American who had taught her daughter her native language as a child; as an adult, Lynn admitted, she simply loved all things Italian. A semester of college in Florence had convinced her that she wanted to spend a few years, at the least, living in Italy. Anna Maria\u2019s co-op had been the perfect place for her to sell her creations?wooden marionettes dressed in detailed and exquisite costumes.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lynn murmured, eyes clouded with concern as she watched Jordan.</p><p>Jordan grimaced. \u201cSo you heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of our customers attended the ball.\u201d Lynn pulled a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of her jacket, shook one out, lit up, inhaled deeply, and exhaled a long plume of smoke. \u201cIt\u2019s been busy ... my first cigarette in hours.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cWe still smoke everywhere, here in Italy, not like the States. But you can\u2019t light up in the shop, not with so many people and things, costumes, fabric, paint, and art! We could burn a hole in a costume, you know? Or go up like a tinderbox.\u201d Lynn was speaking casually, but she studied Jordan all the while. \u201cYou\u2019re okay now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. But the contessa\u2019s concept of fun is macabre. It was very real,\u201d Jordan said. She realized she sounded defensive.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, the contessa would have entertainment that included the best special effects.\u201d Lynn brightened suddenly. \u201cWell, you needn\u2019t fear when you attend our ball.\u201d She grinned, seeing the confusion in Jordan\u2019s eyes. \u201cTonight, the artist\u2019s ball?naturally, most of us will be in attendance. Friday night is Anna Maria\u2019s Venetian Waltz. We have a palazzo as well, you know. Rented for the occasion, not owned by any of us, unfortunately. But we won\u2019t scare you half to death. We entertain with music, tarot card readers, jesters ... a pleasure palace, but no monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I assume that Jared has had tickets for us from the beginning, but are you sure you want me to come?\u201d Jordan asked.</p> <p>Lynn laughed. \u201cOf course. Yes, Jared has had tickets for months. Surely he told you that the Friday ball is ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just knew there was a round of parties,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI\u2019m glad, delighted, that one of them is yours.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid that Jared only explained the contessa\u2019s party, and it seems the contessa is very important to his business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so Jared felt that hers was the most important party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say that?\u201d</p><p>Lynn shrugged philosophically. \u201cThe contessa .. . is nobility. She is rich. Her party is definitely for the truly elite?invitation only. It\u2019s a big deal to be invited. Come to think of it, none of us at the shop are ever invited to her events. We must be poor peasants in her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d been a peasant in her eyes. Everywhere I\u2019ve been today, people stare at me. I\u2019m the idiot American who panicked at a party and brought in the police.\u201d Lynn\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid the story has traveled, but... you know, there are people who don\u2019t like her as well. Quite frankly, she\u2019s a snot. She breezes down the street as if she\u2019s got a stick up her ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLynn!\u201d</p><p>Anna Maria, tall, slim, a beautiful woman in her early forties, had emerged from the shop just as Lynn spoke. A native Venetian, she had a striking bone structure, long brown hair touched with natural gold highlights, and a sense of energy and purpose. Her English was nearly perfect; her accent was charming.</p><p>Lynn choked, having been inhaling her cigarette when Anna spoke. Anna Maria had her hands on her hips, but a glitter in her eyes belied the stern way in which she had spoken.</p><p>\u201cSorry, the contessa is charming, just charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLynn! Such words you are using. It is sour grapes; I believe that is the saying,\u201d Anna Maria chastised.</p><p>\u201cWe are not invited, so the contessa is a snob. Forgive us, Jordan.\u201d Jordan laughed. \u201cActually, don\u2019t tell Jared I said so, but I think Lynn\u2019s description is rather apt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contessa is beautiful. And she has done a great deal for Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, and she\u2019s a snot? you\u2019ve done a lot for Venice and she ignores you!\u201d Lynn defended.</p><p>\u201cLynn, Jordan is a visitor; we mustn\u2019t air muddy laundry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty laundry,\u201d Lynn corrected.</p><p>\u201cDirty laundry,\u201d Anna Maria agreed, shaking her head. \u201cLynn, do I make fun of your Italian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpon occasion, yes!\u201d Lynn said.</p><p>\u201cJordan, you must not listen to us. Lynn, give me one of your American cigarettes.\u201d Anna Maria took a cigarette and lit up, exhaling with a little sigh of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThe way I\u2019m feeling this morning, Anna Maria, I hate to admit it, but I\u2019m delighted to hear something bad about the contessa,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cIf it was all a charade, it was a horrible thing to plan to do to people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was a charade?\u201d Lynn asked softly.</p><p>Jordan shrugged. \u201cEveryone keeps telling me so. The police were angry, my cousin is still angry, and the contessa ...\u201d She paused, staring at Lynn ruefully. \u201cWell, she acted as if she had a stick up her butt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe streets sometimes have ears,\u201d Anna Maria murmured. \u201cYet, I\u2019m so sorry. I adore my city. And Carnevale. You should have all good impressions of the city and the gaiety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Venice,\u201d Jordan said quickly. \u201cThe contessa\u2019s party did not change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, poor dear!\u201d Anna Maria said. \u201cThe rumor is that you were absolutely terrified. Again, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that, but...\u201d Her voice trailed off, and then she laughed and spoke very softly. \u201cI like to imagine the contessa running through the streets in the middle of the night to the police station. That\u2019s what she gets for her great dramas, always promising something more spectacular than anyone else can offer. Her party might be more exclusive, but you\u2019re right. Such entertainment is sick. I promise you, the artist\u2019s ball tonight is wonderful, but our party will be the most fun. So. What are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a visitor and a novice at Carnevale, I\u2019ve only the one outfit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that will not be enough. Come in, come in, we\u2019ll find more costuming in petite!\u201d Anna Maria dropped her cigarette and stepped on it. \u201cNow ... we\u2019ll go in and find something fun for the artist\u2019s ball tonight and our party on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but it is!\u201d Anna Maria corrected. \u201cIt is Venice, and it is Carnevale, and you must enjoy the splendor of it all.\u201d She glanced sternly at Lynn once again. \u201cIn a way that is not snobby, snotty, or stick up the ass-y in any way at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, look, it\u2019s all right, the store is crowded, you\u2019re so busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever too busy,\u201d Anna Maria said. \u201cAndiamo. We go in to the costume section. Many things are already rented, but ... we never run out of masquerades in Venice, eh, Lynn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Lynn agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd if something does not quite fit, Lynn is an extraordinary seamstress.\u201d Lynn groaned. \u201cNo rest for the weary!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the naughty,\u201d Anna Maria said sternly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can make my own adjustments?\u201dJordan offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Anna Maria protested. \u201cLynn wishes to outdo the contessa, even down to your costume. We shall all three see that it is so.\u201d She indicated the door. \u201cCome along, and we\u2019ll get busy.\u201d Jordan hesitated, thinking that perhaps she should return to the hotel, but it felt good to be with people who sympathized without thinking her totally insane. It felt good to be here, and it would be fun to wear a new costume. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shrugged, and preceded Lynn and Anna Maria into the shop.</p><p>Jared liked to take public transportation in Venice, slipping onto the vaporettos with crowds of tourists and natives, studying the islands of Venice as the boat came to stop after stop. He knew how to get around the city, and loved the architecture of it.</p><p>Today, however, he took a private launch. Arriving at the palazzo, he was greeted by the contessa\u2019s aide, a tall, skeletal woman with iron-gray hair and a forbiddingly gaunt face. Her disapproval of him was obvious today, though she was always cold and silent.</p> <p>He was led to the contessa\u2019s palatial bedchamber, a room as large as many a full house. There was something exquisitely Renaissance about her decor, from the carvings on the great draped and canopied bed to the scenes on the lush Persian rugs. A sitting area flanked the fireplace; the mantel was marble carved in detail with two grinning gargoyles on either side, as if the pair guarded the flames which might be a gateway straight to hell.</p><p>The contessa, dressed in an elegant white silk robe, was seated in a crimson daybed before the fire. A tea service was before her; she had been reading the morning paper. She was one of those women who awoke beautifully: her hair was brushed out, long and sleek; her ageless face showed no signs of slept-in makeup, crinkles at the eyes, or the least of shadows beneath them. She glared at Jared with cool, controlled anger as he entered.</p><p>\u201cContessa ...\u201d he began softly.</p><p>\u201cI have done everything for you,\u201d she countered. A small taunting smile curved her lips. \u201cEverything. And you could not keep that silly girl with you at my party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how she wandered?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is not acceptable.\u201d</p><p>The contessa had not asked him to sit. Jared stood awkwardly for a moment, then came closer to where her impossibly graceful form was arrayed on the day-bed. Her eyes met his; he lowered himself to a knee, humbly lowering his head. It occurred to him that he was behaving like a sycophant, but here, with the contessa, it was to be expected. She had that kind of power, and she didn\u2019t expect humbling reverence, she demanded it.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon. Truly, I beg your pardon.\u201d</p><p>She thrust the local paper toward him. The front page. A reporter had gotten wind of the trouble; the details were sketchy, the story was slanted in favor of the contessa, and written with a touch of humor.</p><p>But though the contessa was mentioned by name, Jordan was cited as the naive American tourist.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou will see that she ceases this nonsense,\u201d the contessa said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with her firmly.\u201d</p><p>The contessa broke into laughter. \u201cYou\u2019ve spoken to her firmly.\u201d Her laughter rose shrilly. The sound of it caused a shiver deep in his heart. \u201cCaro mio, you\u2019ve spoken firmly? Well, we shall see. If I am forced to take matters into my own hands ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can control Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me to bring her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I expected you to control her!\u201d</p><p>He remained on his knee, his head down.</p> <p>\u201cYou come here, you thrive here ... you have everything, because of me.\u201d He nodded. Something left of his pride twitched in his throat. He swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in disgrace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll .. . I\u2019ll leave you now.\u201d</p><p>She touched his hair, her movement little more than a whisper against him. Somehow repellent. Still ...</p><p>seductively entrapping.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cYou may stay. You may stay awhile because I am bored this morning. I will let you have . . . tea with me. You would like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d He looked up at last. Her eyes were on his.</p><p>\u201cI would die to have tea with you, Contessa,\u201d he said.</p><p>At last she smiled with a shrug. \u201cYes, you would, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d The contessa rose. With a single shimmering drift of white silk, she stood in smooth perfection before the fire.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear boy, you would die for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? You wear it so!\u201d Raphael Gambi placed the beaded hat atop his head. It fell over his forehead in a perfect swirl. He posed; body swayed in a seductive arch, lips in a pout, thumb and forefinger upon his chin. Jordan laughed. Raphael\u2019s antics had managed to make her almost completely forget the contessa and the ball. Costume was his life. He knew fabrics and styles, the traditional and the totally off-the-wall.</p><p>Before she tried on any costume, hat or mask, he had told her about how it was worn, the period when it had been worn, and who had been the fashion plate of that particular day. As he showed her what he considered the proper way to wear the cap for a colorful jester\u2019s costume, he proceeded to move about dramatically, slipping a mask from a stand to cover his eyes and pirouette before her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely?lovely on you. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s me,\u201d Jordan told him regretfully. Raphael was of medium height with bright blue eyes that continually glittered as he smiled, full of mischief even when the overload of tourists in the shop caused him a few moments of disgruntlement. Everyone at the Arte della Anna Maria shop had a specific job and Raphael headed the costume department. With his absolute flair for high style and his love of clothing, he was a natural, but today, while they were still in the midst of a round of parties, he was also under a great deal of pressure. When Anna Maria had come to him, saying they must try everything in the world on Jordan, he had not sighed under another workload, but eyed Jordan up and down, noting her good qualities?and the fact that she was so tiny. He\u2019d gone through a rapid exchange in Italian with Anna Maria, then proceeded to sail through the rows of costumes with astonishing speed, providing Jordan with a wealth of choices that barely fit into the dressing room with her. She had tried on vinyl futuristic?supplied by one of their favorite contemporary English designers?Roman, Egyptian, Renaissance, Edwardian, Victorian, and more. Through it all, she had heard customers come and go; she had crashed into others while coming out to survey the costumes in the large full-length mirror, and even heard Raphael sigh with regret when he could not please a very beautiful Israeli woman. Despite the busyness of the shop, Raphael had managed to fully assess her in each of the various styles; he moved with the speed of light, always acting out the proper way of handling a parasol, a mask, a bustle, or whatever accessory or affectation might go with each mode of dress. Throughout it all, Anna Maria and Lynn found time to survey her in costume, as had others in the shop, among them a pretty young girl called Angelina, a native Venetian creator of masks, and Gina, an Austrian native who had made Venice her home for the last decade, and who could slip into any one of seven languages fluently to help whomever might come into the shop. \u201cAllora! Well, it\u2019s true,\u201d Raphael said, stepping back. \u201cThough it is petite, you are wasted in the clothing of the harlequin, the jester! Puff here, puff there?</p><p>personally, I like the vinyl! Sexy, eh? Voila, follows your little form with seductive precision!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vinyl?\u201d Jordan murmured. She\u2019d never worn vinyl before?she didn\u2019t even own anything in leather, other than shoes or bags. Such form-fitting clothing always seemed right on blondes with long legs and lithe figures. \u201cOn me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, si, si!\u201d Raphael said. He placed a hand on his hip, sweeping off the jester\u2019s cap. \u201cNot for our ball. No, no, no, you must be far more elegante for that! But for the artist\u2019s ball tonight? Yes, yes.</p><p>Outrageous, daring, bold, sassy?brash! You will stand out entirely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure I want to stand out,\u201d Jordan murmured.</p><p>\u201cAfter last night!\u201d Raphael said sorrowfully. \u201cAllora, I have heard. That dreadful woman!\u201d Jordan arched a brow. Raphael shrugged. \u201cShe is too good for our shop! She thinks she is queen of Venice, eh, while Anna Maria was working hard for the city long before she came home and decided that she would rule! Ah, well. She makes this dreadful dance of death, and you are so frightened, and she is distraught that her party might be ruined.\u201d He let out a snort entirely out of character for his usual grace in speech and manner. Blue eyes sparkled with evil intent. \u201cTrust me, in vinyl, you will outdo her. And you will wear the sci-fi boots by Justine, our French friend you will meet later, and you will be taller, and it will be perfect. Don\u2019t forget?you\u2019ll have a mask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; I\u2019ll think about the vinyl,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cNow, as for the Arte shop ball...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo question. The fairy tale fantasy gown,\u201d Raphael said with firm determination.</p><p>The costume to which he referred was white, silver and gold. The style was somewhere between Renaissance and Revolution, managing to cinch in the waist and expose plenty of cleavage. The accompanying headdress was a tiara with a feather and silk drape to fall behind.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Raphael assured her.</p><p>Anna Maria appeared at the top of the curving staircase that led to the dressing rooms. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.</p><p>Roberto Capo is here. He says you arranged something for him for this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi, si, allora, si!\u201d Raphael clapped his hands. He grinned. \u201cA friend?he and I went to school together?a man who works most of Carnevale, but has found out he has tonight off. He loves the artist\u2019s ball. I\u2019ll be but a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, Rafael,\u201d Jordan told him. \u201cGo ahead, and take good care of your friend. I\u2019ve taken up way too much of your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for an espresso with Lynn and me,\u201d Anna Maria said. \u201cThen come back and make your choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer choices are made,\u201d Raphael said flippantly. \u201cBut you must come back and admit that I am right.</p><p>And the vinyl... you should take that now. It is such a zoo here, it may take time to get the costumes to your hotel.\u201d</p><p>Raphael hurried down the stairs. \u201cYou\u2019ll come for an espresso, cappuccino?\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>\u201cI should go back. I rather ran out on my cousin-in-law this morning.\u201d Anna Maria shrugged philosophically. \u201cCindy is a dear. I will call her; tell her you\u2019re here, getting costumes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll come.

When she came down the stairs, she saw that Raphael was talking to a moderately tall, dark-haired man. When the man turned around, she realized she had met him. He had been one of the cops at the station last night; he had come in with the contessa when she arrived with Jared and Cindy. He had done little talking to her, not being the officer who spoke such flawless English. He smiled now, somewhat gravely. \u201cBuon giorno, Signorina Riley,\u201d he said pleasantly.</p> <p>His name was Capo, she remembered, Roberto Capo.</p><p>She felt her cheeks flood with color; all of the police had been aggravated with her by the end of last night. This man had watched her with deep, searing dark eyes throughout most of her babbling and the other man\u2019s questioning.</p><p>She saw him struggle for a moment; he had the kind of knowledge of English that she had of Italian?every word had to be recalled and thought out.</p><p>\u201cToday ... you are fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, grazie. But ...\u201d She lifted her hands. \u201cIt was very real.\u201d She had said those words so many times.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cIt is ... understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Raphael corrected.</p><p>The handsome young officer flushed. \u201cUnderstandable. Charades ... masquerades ... they get...\u201d His voice trailed off and he looked at Raphael.</p><p>\u201cCarried away,\u201d Raphael supplied.</p><p>Capo nodded. \u201cIn Venice ... it is beautiful. We try not to?to throw up too much, you know? Not like your New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>Jordan wanted to defend New Orleans, a city she loved, but before she could do so, Capo was speaking quickly again. \u201cNew Orleans is a good city. Carnevale is?different. Here ... the masks, the gowns ... it is a show. Sometimes, the show is too much. There is bad that happens. The contessa should not play at murder and blood.\u201d</p> <p>Jordan smiled at him. \u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSono?I am Roberto?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto Capo, I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrego. Please. I am sorry for your trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, thank you, Roberto. Well. I\u2019ll let you get to your costuming.\u201d She started out, but Roberto stopped her, calling to her, striding to touch her shoulder, then blushing slightly again. He was very good-looking, she noted, with his endlessly dark eyes, classic features, and a taut build.</p><p>\u201cIf you are ever afraid, please, come to me. I will not...\u201d He gave up and spoke quickly to Raphael in Italian.</p> <p>\u201cHe will not laugh at you, or be angry with you,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>Roberto spoke again quickly, and Raphael translated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always better to investigate; please don\u2019t hesitate to go to him, and if he ever thinks that you might help him, he hopes he may come to you,\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow to Raphael, surprised, then looked at Roberto. \u201cI would gladly help him at any time.</p><p>Except that the police did go to the palazzo. It was a charade. Right?\u201d Roberto Capo had understood her. \u201cA charade, of course. And still ...\u201d She smiled, nodding at him. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll remember to ask for you if I have any trouble at all while I\u2019m in Venice. And if you wish to ask me anything, you know that I\u2019m at the Danieli.\u201d Roberto nodded gravely. \u201cI would like to know more ... how you came to the stazione.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoat,\u201d Jordan reminded him with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou ran from the palazzo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wolf?\u201d she hesitated, realizing that there was a language barrier and she was to insist that a wolf had leaped with her from a balcony. \u201cA guest, dressed like a wolf, brought me to the boat,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWho was the guest?\u201d Roberto quizzed her. \u201cYou have not thought if you know him, he offered you no name?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>Last night, it seemed that those words had made them all stare at one another, certain that she had truly given way to madness or?too much champagne. But today, this particular officer seemed to believe her.</p><p>\u201cIf you see this man, if you find him, I\u2019d like to speak with him. You must tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that if I saw him, I\u2019d never know him. He was wearing a mask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew his voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hear his voice in the street, I will be delighted to let you know,\u201d Jordan assured him. She bid him and Raphael a quick good-bye, and slipped out on the street.</p><p>\u201cAh, you are here!\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have been so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being so long!\u201d Lynn protested \u201cIt\u2019s a longer break from that madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way, down the street, you\u2019ll get the best to drink and eat at the cheapest price.\u201d Anna Maria led the way past the popular shops to an alleyway Jordan wouldn\u2019t have explored on her own. They passed a few workers and a woman sweeping the tiles in front of her shop, and Anna Maria greeted them all.</p><p>For a moment, it seemed that a cloud swept over the sun. Jordan felt a chill; she pulled the collar of her wool coat closer around her throat. When the light faded, it was as if great black wings of shadow swept through the alleys, swallowing up the brightness like a great ravenous bird.</p><p>\u201cAh, here we are on break, and there goes the sun!\u201d Lynn muttered, annoyed, and seeing nothing at all eerie in the natural conditions of the earth.</p><p>Jordan intended to shake off the chill immediately; instead, she found herself pausing. Listening.</p><p>Wondering if a strange sense of whispers hoarsely spoken on the wind would descend upon her again.</p><p>No sound ...</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>Lynn had turned back.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, quickly stepping along, and feeling like a fool.</p><p>To her surprise, the tiny cafe deep in the alley was full. She was about to suggest some place else, thinking they\u2019d never get what they wanted in the customary time for a break. But the two girls behind the counter made espresso, cappuccino, poured wine and aperitif with a skill that would have left any American bartender in the dust. Anna Maria called over the crowd huddled at the bar; in a moment, three espressos had been passed over to them. They found space at a counter against the wall, and stood, sipping their drinks.</p><p>\u201cThe city seems huge, eh, with all these people?\u201d Anna Maria said, waving a hand. \u201cBut it is not so big really. We know one another, often. You mustn\u2019t worry about having offended the contessa, even if Jared is upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry if you offend Anna Maria,\u201d Lynn said, grinning. Anna Maria made a face at her. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d Lynn continued. \u201cThe contessa hasn\u2019t really been back all that long. And Carnevale, as it is now, was really brought back by some American businessmen twenty years ago or so, and from the beginning, Anna Maria was asked for help. And that\u2019s true. The world hasn\u2019t really changed so much, especially in Europe. The contessa has money and a title. Anna Maria has talent and class.\u201d Anna Maria shook her head with impatience and modesty. \u201cYou\u2019re going to confuse Jordan. Carnevale began here centuries ago. Years ago, American businessmen?European-Americans among them, certainly?became interested in Venice, invested not just to make money, but to make people aware of the world treasure that is Venice, in saving historical buildings. It is difficult here; the sea is our beauty, and it is also our destruction. I became friends with many of these people working so hard for Venice. I have always loved pageantry, costumes, parties . . . and so, I have been somewhat involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhat involved?\u201d Lynn exclaimed. \u201cWhenever big producers from the world over wish to film scenes in Venice, they come to Anna Maria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to many other people,\u201d Anna Maria corrected.</p><p>\u201cI can see why they would come to you,\u201d Jordan told Anna Maria, smiling, and finishing her espresso.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go thinking so much of me,\u201d Anna Maria said firmly. \u201cWhat Lynn is trying to say is that you must not be worried at all about last night\u2019s party. The contessa may think she can damage your cousin\u2019s work in Venice, and she can be nasty as a cat, but most of the people who love the city and are involved are not titled, rich, or necessarily even Venetian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe like you, and so you are fine!\u201d Lynn finished.</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cWell, thank you both so very much. I admit to having been miserable, and now I feel welcome, and so much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllora, we must go back,\u201d Anna Maria said. \u201cWatch as we leave; if you wish to come back to this cafe, you will find it easily. It is not a tourist cafe; they will not charge you an arm and a foot for an espresso or cappuccino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn arm and a leg,\u201d Lynn corrected, laughing and indicating the door.</p><p>\u201cAndiamo,\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>As they walked, Lynn pointed out street names. \u201cThere!\u201d she said. \u201cThat building, where you see the restoration store? In the fifteenth century, it housed the infamous mistress of a scandalous doge. The doges were elected, you know, but usually from the nobility, or most prestigious families. It is reputed to be haunted by her ghost; though it was not proven, supposedly he was stabbed in the midst of making love, for a dalliance with one of his ministers.\u201d</p><p>Jordan looked up at the building; almost every house and structure was old and unique, with incredible architecture. This one had charming balconies and the cornices were adorned with stone lions that seemed to stand as harsh sentinels, ready to protect those within.</p><p>Not looking where she was going, Jordan suddenly slammed into something.</p><p>Someone.</p><p>She was jostled and might have stumbled, but she was quickly righted by the hands of the person into whom she had crashed. Startled, she stared at a wall of black wool. A second later, she realized that she was looking at a man\u2019s chest, covered in a long, trim-fitting, excellently tailored Armani suit. She looked up. He was tall, a good six foot four, and very blond. Rock star? She thought at first. The feel of the hands straightening her and the size of the shoulders above his chest gave her cause for a second speculation.

His eyes were very blue; ice blue, a cool color that swept over her in a quick assessment.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked in English.</p><p>\u201cYes, fine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should look where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, I am sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRagnor! Ciao!\u201d Anna Maria said, interrupting.</p><p>\u201cAnna Maria, ciao, bella,\u201d the man replied, his Italian sounding, to Jordan\u2019s untrained ear, as unaccented as his English. He broke into a rapid spate that left Jordan catching only a word or two as he kissed Anna Maria on both cheeks and she enthusiastically returned the greeting.</p><p>Lynn, in turn, greeted him, then indicated Jordan and suggested they switch to English.</p> <p>\u201cRagnor, Miss Jordan Riley. Ragnor is a friend to all of us at the shop, and Venice. Jordan is new to Carnevale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome, then,\u201d the man said. He greeted her in like fashion, taking her shoulders, stooping slightly to kiss both her cheeks. She had the strange feeling that he wasn\u2019t really all that pleased to welcome her; the lips that touched her cheek seemed cold and brusque. She was almost tempted to pull away. She didn\u2019t return the gesture.</p><p>She was American, after all; she wasn\u2019t expected to kiss in the European fashion.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do, and again, excuse me,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Tall, very tall. As tall as the man with whom she had danced at the contessa\u2019s ball. The wolf who had been so courteous?and who had swept her from the bloody \u201cperformance\u201d to send her from the palace.</p><p>But this man didn\u2019t seem to know her. Not so much as a flicker of recognition touched his eyes.</p> <p>How many people in Venice were this tall? Come to think of it, how many people anywhere were this tall?</p><p>More than one, she reminded herself dryly. And though Italians were often stereotyped as being small and dark, she had met many tall people here, and many with light eyes and hair.</p><p>\u201cWere you at the contessa\u2019s ball last night?\u201d she asked, deciding that a straightforward question might be the way to find out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Did the slightest flicker cross his eyes then? Or was she as paranoid as Jared seemed to think she was?</p><p>\u201cRagnor wouldn\u2019t be at the contessa\u2019s,\u201d Lynn said, pleased. \u201cHe thinks she is obnoxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLynn,\u201d Anna Maria chastised wearily.</p><p>Ragnor was still staring at Jordan. With displeasure, she thought. Paranoia!?</p> <p>\u201cIt is what you said, Ragnor, isn\u2019t it, when we ran into her at the cafe?\u201d Lynn persisted. She looked at Anna Maria. \u201cI am not divulging secrets?I am trying to make Jordan feel better about not liking her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that I didn\u2019t like her,\u201d Jordan murmured.</p><p>\u201cI would not be on the contessa\u2019s guest list,\u201d Ragnor said simply. \u201cYou were going somewhere; I should not keep you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back to the shop,\u201d Anna Maria said. \u201cOur break has been too long. Were you coming to see me? You are going to the artist\u2019s ball tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course. And I will be by.\u201d He again kissed Anna Maria and Lynn on both cheeks, and offered Jordan a hand?American style. \u201cNice to meet you, Miss Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you; you too,\u201d she said. He hadn\u2019t been glad at all to meet her.</p><p>\u201cYou should come soon. We are trying to talk Jordan into vinyl for the fun tonight. You could give her a new perspective,\u201d Lynn said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said politely, then indicated with a polite sweep of the hand that they should go on. They did so, Anna Maria and Lynn already into a discussion of what would be right for the artist\u2019s ball for a man of his height.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Jordan asked as they walked, briskly now.</p><p>\u201cRagnor is ... a businessman,\u201d Anna Maria explained.</p><p>\u201cWe have known him just a little time,\u201d Lynn explained.</p><p>\u201cYou have known everyone here just a little time,\u201d Anna Maria reminded her.</p><p>They had nearly reached the shop.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t Italian, is he?\u201d Jordan persisted.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>That should have been followed by, \u201cHe is German, Austrian, American, or so on.\u201d But Anna Maria said no more.</p><p>\u201cHe reminds me of someone I met last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite impossible,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cHe is right; he would not be on the contessa\u2019s guest list. When what I call \u2018the old guard\u2019 are about, he is among them. That day, we were at the cafe . . . and the contessa arrived. They must have met elsewhere. When they were introduced, they were cordial, but you could see the hostility between them. He left. Do you know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll find out,\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>\u201cI think that she is jealous of him. He has no title, no history here, but there is a rumor that he comes from an extraordinary family. He is not in the least showy or pretentious, but people want to be near him.</p><p>He has a charisma, you know? Something compelling about him.\u201d Anna Maria sighed. \u201cHe is a handsome man with a powerful appearance. And he is intelligent and interested in art and history?and Venice.\u201d</p><p>Lynn grinned. \u201cAnd he\u2019s built like?as we say in America?a brick shithouse.\u201d Anna Maria rolled her eyes. \u201cLynn speaks with such class in her expressions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to teach you real English,\u201d Lynn said with a sigh. \u201cI want you safe on the streets of Brooklyn, should you choose to go there on a trip to America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Anna Maria said. She paused directly in front of the door to the shop. \u201cWhat Lynn is trying to say is that she has the hots for this man big time, and that she would give an arm and a leg to get it up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get it on with him,\u201d Lynn said with a mock sigh. Her eyes flashed as she giggled. \u201cHe is the one who gets it up.\u201d</p><p>Anna Maria gave a deep sigh. \u201cCome, Jordan, and try your vinyl outfit on again. Raphael is going to insist that you wear it, and you should. It\u2019s terrific on you.\u201d Despite the many people in the shop, Raphael saw her instantly and moved through the many groups of people looking at art pieces, masks, and costumes, to reach her. \u201cVinyl, yes! We\u2019ll dress you up one more time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, vinyl, why not?\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd a really good mask, Raphael, so no one knows me!\u201d She lowered her voice and smiled. \u201cThey\u2019ll still be whispering about me enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them whisper?be outrageous!\u201d he said. \u201cCome, come.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Nari was tired, bored, hungry and restless. Last night, with the disaster at the party, she\u2019d not been able to enjoy a thing.</p><p>She should be resting, and she should not be wandering through the streets so casually, even in a mask.</p><p>She had a certain position to maintain. But she couldn\u2019t sleep, or even relax, and so she donned a mask and went out into the streets.</p><p>Um . .. she was definitely ...</p><p>Hungry.</p><p>She needed to find someone with whom to dine.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that she didn\u2019t want to be home.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be caught resting by uninvited visitors. Because he would come. Of course. He\u2019d been watching her, waiting. He thought that he\u2019d come in, make demands, and force her to change her ways.</p><p>Ah, but he didn\u2019t know the half of it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know who was in Venice now and with whom she had been keeping company.</p><p>Still... she had such a headache! She had no intention of coping with him today.</p><p>She was startled to feel a sudden sense of nostalgia, of loss. Of pain. It had been seeing him again.</p><p>Remembering what had been. Wanting. . .</p><p>Once upon a time ...</p><p>Once upon a time was over and gone.</p><p>And still ...</p><p>How she hated Americans!</p><p>With a mental shake, she forced it all from her mind. The pain she was feeling was simply hunger.</p><p>She wandered around St. Mark\u2019s Square, listening to the band that was playing, watching for someone</p><p>... alone, someone who might want to share some time with her.</p><p>She tapped her foot impatiently to the music. Such silly people came to Carnevale. Those with money who might spend an entire year planning a costume. Elegant costumes to be sure. Ridiculously uncomfortable. A group dressed as the moon and the stars walked by, and all with clothing that required tremendous wiring for the streaks of white and silver and gold that streamed from the stars. They couldn\u2019t possibly sit; they were entirely showpieces.</p><p>Many couples passed in traditional masks that covered the entire face of the wearer. Others passed without costumes. Many of these people had taken tour buses in from the poorer, often war-torn towns of eastern Europe. They were not so finely dressed. They came to gawk. Often, they had nowhere to stay except for their buses. They had little to eat. It was actually a kindness to befriend such a person.</p><p>Their lives were so pathetic.</p><p>All men were born to live, suffer through life and then die. That was the way of it. With these poor people . . .</p><p>She watched, then noticed the American woman, Tiff Henley. She was not in costume. She was attractive?older, but attractive. She was a woman who moved, who saw, who took all that she wanted.</p><p>If the way to acquire what she desired happened to be unpleasant, so be it. Nari had heard that the woman\u2019s last husband had been close to ninety?but had taken longer to die than Tiff had anticipated.</p><p>Tiff must be making up for it. She was staring into the window of one of the most expensive jewelry shops in the Square.</p><p>Nari smiled and started for her. Tiff would love to be invited to lunch.</p><p>But then, a stout man with graying hair came up behind Tiff, joined by two younger men in capes and bizarre masks. They all stared into the window, pointing, talking, arguing the qualities of the items displayed.</p><p>Another woman came up and joined them.</p><p>Nari sighed and shook her head.</p><p>There were too many people with Tiff Henley. Nari didn\u2019t mind charming a few of those beneath her status in her quest for company, but... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was exhausted. Last night had been . ..</p><p>Draining. She really hadn\u2019t the energy to deal with such a group at the moment.</p><p>Still ...</p> <p>She really must have something. A little bite. She was so hungry.</p><p>Nari lifted the cowl of her own cape against the winter\u2019s breeze, turned and moved into the crowd.</p><p>It was still light.</p><p>She simply wasn\u2019t at her peak.</p><p>But the night would come.</p> <p>\u201cMolto, molto ...\u201d Raphael gestured wildly, then grinned. \u201cSexy!\u201d he said.</p><p>She had dressed in her costume upstairs in a fitting room; he had brought her downstairs to be presented to Anna Maria and Lynn.</p><p>Nearly encased in blood-red vinyl, Jordan laughed ruefully, catching Anna Maria\u2019s eye. \u201cI look like a hooker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Raphael protested. He shook his head, surveying her from head to toe. \u201cNo, no, add the sweep of a cape, voila, you look like a comic strip heroine! Now, the boots, the boots are the perfect addition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her a whip and chain,\u201d a deep voice said dryly, \u201cand she can tame lions.\u201d Startled, Jordan looked across the room. The tall blond man was in the shop, leaning laconically against the wall. She hadn\u2019t noticed him at first because of the row of marionettes hanging from the ceiling and the multitude of capes and costumes hung at various places around the shop. Now he stepped forward, studying her with the same thorough assessment as Raphael, yet somehow, his studious appraisal seemed different? hostile.</p><p>\u201cRagnor, it is terrific!\u201d Anna Maria said.</p> <p>\u201cTerrific, yes,\u201d he agreed. The way he looked at her, she felt almost naked. \u201cBut I rather had the impression that Miss Riley didn\u2019t want to appear ... obvious this evening.\u201d A slight smile curved his lips.</p><p>\u201cIn this outfit, she will only be missed by the completely blind.\u201d Jordan had indeed wanted to melt into the crowd. But this stranger\u2019s unsolicited and negative remarks caused her to be completely contrary in return. She felt her hackles rising at the nape of her neck.</p><p>She looked at Raphael. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d She stared at the tall stranger. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely me. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolto bene!\u201d Raphael said. He stared at Ragnor with a puzzled look.</p><p>Ragnor shrugged, idly running a hand over the black velvet cape hanging where he stood. \u201cI merely hope that the police will be out in force. It is indeed sexy. Provocative, one might say.\u201d His fingers slid lightly along the velvet and then fell from it. \u201cI trust that you will have a good evening, Miss Riley.\u201d He inclined his head toward her, kissed Anna Maria on the cheek, and left the shop.</p><p>\u201cStrange!\u201d Raphael said as the door closed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it is too .. .\u201dJordan murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt is too perfect!\u201d Lynn announced. \u201cThis is Carnevale, Jordan, and you do not look too ... anything.</p> <p>Except for terrific.\u201d</p><p>Jordan glanced at her watch, feeling guilty about Cindy. \u201cI think I\u2019d best get back to the hotel. But I will wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to fear,\u201d Anna Maria said, \u201cwe\u2019ll all be there, and we\u2019ll protect you from wayward wolves.\u201d The comment was said jokingly, but it gave Jordan a sense of unease. She shook it off. \u201cGood, as long as I can be in the midst of you all, I\u2019ll be just fine. I\u2019ll just run and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you back,\u201d Raphael offered. \u201cThe Square will be crazy now, so crowded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind, and I have a costume to deliver to the Danieli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you then.\u201d</p><p>In the dressing room, she wondered if she shouldn\u2019t have taken the tall blond man\u2019s advice.</p><p>\u201cHooker,\u201d she told her reflection in the mirror. \u201cBut a high-priced one, at that.\u201d She changed into her street clothing. Downstairs, she found Raphael carrying a garment bag bigger than he was. \u201cAndiamo!\u201d he told her cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cHave no fear; we\u2019ll find you right away!\u201d Lynn called as she left the shop.</p><p>\u201cStay close behind me; we\u2019ll bulldog our way through!\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>She smiled, following close behind. He did know how to move. \u201cScusi, scusi, scusi!\u201d he said, creating a pathway through those still in streetwear, as well as the multitude of historical personages, monsters, creatures, suns, moons, and more. Following him, she again found herself amazed by the elaborate and intricate beauty of so many of the costumes, amused and awed by all that she saw, and once more in love with the city of Venice.</p><p>They passed the basilica, and crossed the bridge from the Doge\u2019s Palace to the Danieli, where they parted in the busy lobby. Raphael kissed her on the cheek. \u201cYou will outshine them all tonight,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cGrazie, ciao,\u201d she told him, and she wondered if Jared was back at the hotel.</p><p>He gave her a thumbs up sign. \u201cGood accent,\u201d he said soberly, then grinned. \u201cYou will truly be splendid.</p><p>My work of art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to make you proud,\u201d she teased and started up the stairs.</p><p>Ragnor arrived at the palazzo in a hired launch, telling the boatman to wait, even if he were inside for an hour.</p><p>He stepped carefully from the launch to the contessa\u2019s dock, listening as the seawater lapped against the piling. Long, determined strides brought him quickly to the contessa\u2019s door. When his knock wasn\u2019t immediately answered, he thrust the door open, heedless of the groaning hinges and the snap as lock and bolt gave. As he had expected, the contessa\u2019s servants, a tall, skinny man of about sixty in black livery and a sour-looking woman of the same age with iron gray hair, were standing just inside. They had been more than aware of his arrival, but why they had ignored his knock he didn\u2019t know. They must have expected him to enter, whether or not they opened the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Ragnor demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe is not at home,\u201d the man said, looking at the door with disapproval. \u201cAnd you have recklessly broken into this palazzo, destroying the contessa\u2019s private property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the police,\u201d Ragnor suggested. Ignoring the pair, he started across the marble floor of the entry to reach the landing. Halfway up the stairs, he swung around. The servant had foolishly seized a sword from the arms display on the wall of the foyer and was attempting to lift the heavy metal in a wild swing. The fool. He\u2019d have never reached Ragnor\u2019s neck, being nearly a foot shorter, down a number of steps, and absurdly out of his league.</p><p>He avoided the first hapless swing, ducking low and sweeping back up to catch the weapon at the hilt.</p><p>He tossed it to the floor below, where the clatter against marble seemed to echo with a shattering recall.</p><p>He pushed the fellow against the banister and continued up the stairs. Reaching the entrance to the contessa\u2019s bedchamber, he thrust it open.</p><p>Apparently, however, the servants had not lied. The contessa was not in. Ragnor strode into the room, throwing open the wardrobe. He stepped into the dressing room and bath, but there was no sign of his quarry.</p><p>In disgust, he turned, left her bedchamber, and strode down the hallway to the second-floor ballroom.</p><p>His eyes swept the scene where her \u201cmerrymaking\u201d had taken place the night before. They had scoured the scrubbed, gleaming marble flooring and columns, the grandly carved great hearth, and the stained glass doors to the terrace, now closed. He walked on into the room, eyes still sharp, senses keen. He knelt down to touch the floor. The heavy scents of bleach and disinfectant filled his nostrils.</p><p>He rose and turned in a sudden fluid motion. The disarmed servant had gone for backup. The two men now glaring at him from the ballroom entry were near his own height. Bulky as freighters.</p><p>And well armed. Where had she found these two?</p><p>He swept out a hand. \u201cGentlemen, come and get me.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cAnd do it quickly, please.\u201d</p><p>If the contessa wasn\u2019t here, where was she?</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Unlike the invitation-only party the contessa had thrown, the artist\u2019s ball was open to everyone, and it seemed that half the population of Venice had decided to attend. Just walking through the streets, Jordan felt the charged atmosphere of laughter and expectation. Groups of friends rambled through the streets, laughter was continuous, and those beings more reserved due to the character of their costumes and masks greeted one another with silent, polite bows and gestures.</p><p>Jordan had linked arms with Cindy on the way to the ball, ignoring Jared who continued to be obstinate.</p><p>He had tried to dissuade her from coming. \u201cJordan, I don\u2019t think this is a good idea. After last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to embarrass you in front of your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, you overreact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about me, Jared, or your own appearance?\u201d Despite the dottore mask he was wearing again, she knew he was scowling. \u201cDoes it matter? If you\u2019re going to go running out screaming about blood and monsters and cults?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, guess what? I won\u2019t even be with you at the ball.\u201d That seemed to disturb him. Poor Cindy was torn, at a loss with Jared\u2019s harsh manner, trying to be loyal to him and concerned about Jordan at the same time.</p><p>Jordan was sorry about what her argument with Jared was doing to Cindy.</p><p>She also wished Jared would jump in a canal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to go walking around by yourself? In that costume? You think you were scared last night; you\u2019ll have every stray dog in Venice at your heels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, stop it, she looks terrific, and it\u2019s a costume party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might as well have just painted her skin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can wear it! She looks beautiful, be proud of her!\u201d Cindy insisted.</p><p>\u201cCindy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, we\u2019re already on our way,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>\u201cYes, and you know what, Jared?\u201d Jordan said, not wanting Cindy to have to fight her battle. \u201cI think I\u2019ll move on ahead, and then you won\u2019t have to worry about me doing anything gauche or ridiculous?such as claiming that people are being murdered?in front of your friends.\u201d That said, she hurried on ahead, and was surprised when he came running up behind her. He put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cJordan! I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t go running off alone.\u201d She hesitated. She couldn\u2019t see his face, only his eyes. He looked like the old Jared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, Jared, one of the cops came into the costume shop today and said that I wasn\u2019t an idiot.</p><p>Bad things can happen anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you went so wild against the contessa. You don\u2019t know who she is. You don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand who she is, Jared, and what she means to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. For that moment, he sounded truly miserable. \u201cNo, you really don\u2019t understand. You don\u2019t know who she is ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have fun, and I\u2019m not going to think about your contessa. I\u2019ll avoid her all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019d come to this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cToo common for her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like this much of a crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, we\u2019ll be fine, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>She was startled when he suddenly hugged her to him. \u201cYes, we\u2019ll be fine. But Jordan, please, please, for me .. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go around saying bad things about the contessa or her party. I\u2019ll simply tell people, if I\u2019m asked, that I\u2019m afraid it was a bit macabre for me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, relieved. Cindy walked up, pleased to see them getting along so well. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.</p><p>The tent is in the square up ahead. Jordan, they had such great entertainment last year. The dancers . . .</p> <p>they\u2019re exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they cut each other up?\u201d she asked, then wished she could bite her tongue.</p><p>Cindy laughed?the sound just a little uneasy. \u201cNo ... they\u2019re sexy. Erotic. They\u2019ve practically nothing on and nearly perfect bodies ... you\u2019ll see. Ah, there, look at the crowd.\u201d They had arrived at the square. Dozens of people were in line, handing their tickets for the event to the jester waiting at the entrance. His face was painted black and white. Jordan stared at the man carefully.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen him before.</p><p>Within the large tent, there were tables set around a stage. At the moment, a group was playing Italian classics with a rock twist. Jared suggested they find a table while he went for drinks.</p><p>As they searched for empty spaces, they were approached by a masked queen in an elaborate velvet costume that shimmered with glittery iridescence.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael?\u201d Jordan said incredulously.</p> <p>He laughed with pleasure. \u201cSi, si?come, we\u2019ve a table over here. Cindy, ciao, bella, viene, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared is coming,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting drinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine. We have wine for the table, too, and seats for you all.\u201d Raphael slipped an arm through Jordan\u2019s leading them to the table. Anna Maria, stunning in a slinky Egyptian costume, complete with extraordinary headgear and lifelike asp, jumped up to greet them. Lynn, apparently dressed as a biblical fig fantasy, rose as well, kissing Jordan on both cheeks, then greeting Cindy. There were others there from the shop, all greeting them, and a number of the shop\u2019s clients and merchandisers, including Justine, the cute young French girl who designed Jordan\u2019s boots, and a couple from Wales who dealt strictly in leather. It was difficult to talk over the music; and there were a wide array of languages being spoken. Before Jared even returned with their drinks, Jordan found herself out on the dance floor with a sixteenth-century cavalier.</p><p>As other couples passed them, she realized that she was being whispered about. She breathed a sigh of relief when a pretty young woman, obviously American, tapped her on the arm. \u201cExcuse me, but that costume is fantastic! Where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>Swinging beneath the cavalier\u2019s arm, Jordan was pleased to be able to tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s the most marvelous shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be visiting them tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Raphael, heedless of the fact that he was an elegant queen, was cutting in on the cavalier. \u201cAllora! Do I know my costumes! Everyone has asked about you, and the costume, and the shop. Now, are you pleased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am having a tremendous amount of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have more fun if you come drink your champagne.\u201d He led her back to the table, producing a plastic flute for her. She had barely touched it when the band started playing an old Rolling Stones tune.</p><p>\u201cCome, come, salute! I love this song!\u201d</p><p>She gulped the champagne, and found herself back on the dance floor.</p><p>An hour later, she had talked to dozens of people. She had walked around with Raphael to see some of the art displayed on the tent walls. She\u2019d danced, she\u2019d watched the first entertainment?a pianist with a delicately perfect woman on top of his baby grand, affixed to a tall glittering pole as if she were part of a music box. She was dressed in ruffly white and pink and carried a parasol, and her movements were as perfect as if she were indeed a wind-up doll. Jordan applauded strenuously, smiling as Raphael wolf-whistled by her side.</p><p>The master of ceremonies spoke, announcing the band again. Jared appeared, minus his mask now, asking Raphael if he could steal his cousin away for a minute. He seemed easy and relaxed, and Jordan smiled at him as the band switched to swing music. She had learned to dance to it from Jared and Cindy years ago, when they had first taken up ballroom dancing.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, and you?\u201d</p><p>His smile deepened. \u201cYeah, I am. A lot of fun. It\u2019s . . . just a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry if I hurt you in any way, Jared. I won\u2019t say anything more, but .. . your contessa is weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contessa is?different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything else unless a corpse lands at my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d She frowned suddenly. \u201cI know you think that I\u2019m just.. . like gun-shy. But I do know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSh. Let\u2019s forget it. It\u2019s a party. And I\u2019m sorry about insulting your costume. You\u2019re too sexy. As your older male relative, I\u2019m supposed to object.\u201d</p><p>Before she could reply, Raphael cut in on them. He carried flutes of champagne for himself and Jordan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, you must go get your own and dance with your wife!\u201d he told Jared. \u201cThe next song is a slow one?an Italian version of Elvis Presley!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I have to take orders from you?\u201d Jared teased.</p><p>\u201cYes, tonight I\u2019m a royal queen. And I dance very well. You?you are so-so. The queen demands the lady in red vinyl. You get out of here!\u201d</p><p>Jared winked at Jordan and went off in search of Cindy. Jordan watched him go, smiling, glad. He seemed to be the cousin she knew and loved again.</p><p>\u201cSalute!\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>She swallowed the champagne as he did. Her head suddenly seemed to spin. \u201cWhoa! How much of this have we had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the table?\u201d he inquired, then offered her a shrug, then a smile. \u201cMolto, molto! This is a party! And are we driving home? No! That is the wonder of Venice.\u201d He began to sing along with the strangely accented version of the Presley tune. Then he suddenly broke away from her. \u201cVinyl! It feels as if you are a thousand degrees. Do you wish to sit?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized it, but she was very hot. She gave him a smile of thanks. He led her back to the table as the master of ceremonies announced the next entertainment and the room went dark except for a spotlight in the middle of the floor.</p><p>Her chair faced the stage. She slipped off her mask, smoothing the dampness from her cheeks and fluffing her hair as she watched a beautiful and perfectly formed young woman walk out on the stage. Her costume was neon blue and almost completely sheer. Her hair was long and as dark as pitch. A nylon cord dangled suddenly from the roof. Slowly, sensually, the young woman approached the cord. She caught it and climbed higher with sleek agility. She wrapped the cord around an ankle, and to the soft music of flute and violin, she went into a series of poses that were nimble and all but impossible; she appeared as limber as a length of nylon herself, and her performance was spellbinding.</p><p>She held a pose, and the music darkened. A young man appeared on the stage, wearing a similar costume of neon gold. He too captured the cord, joined her, and created pose after pose on the wire, their bodies creating almost unearthly visions. Then they came down to the floor together and began a rhythmic, acrobatic dance. The music and the performance softened to a compelling sensuality. The performers\u2019 movements were kept from being graphic by their consummate grace and beauty. A spellbound hush fell over the audience. No napkins crumpled; no chairs shuffled.</p><p>Jordan found herself as transfixed at the others, yet somewhere in the entertainment, she became aware of a presence behind her, like a whisper in the darkness. She started to turn, and realized that Ragnor was now in the chair at her side. The chair was drawn close to her. His eyes were on the dancers, but he knew that she had noted his presence.</p><p>\u201cQuite incredible, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he murmured. He didn\u2019t seem to shift, yet he seemed to be even closer.</p><p>She was sure that his words were heard only by her. He spoke softly; his tone seemed deep. A touch of warmth seemed to drift down her nape, as if she were caressed by his breath. \u201cThe capabilities of the human mind and body are amazing ... when all avenues are explored.\u201d His eyes were suddenly on hers. She found herself arguing for the sake of it \u201cThey are extraordinary contortionists and dancers who have probably practiced dance and movement since they were little children,\u201d she whispered in return.</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cAh, there speaks the practical mind! But what they create with light and music ...</p><p>there\u2019s a touch of magic, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>The warmth he had evoked seemed to be spreading throughout her. \u201cI\u2019d say that they are excellent performers, and that the stage is well set, that the lighting and music are wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you feel no magic, no emotional pull?\u201d He hadn\u2019t moved; again, he seemed even closer.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, I feel that they are beautiful ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you actually feel beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could play semantic games with someone else?\u201d she suggested, but then found that she was giving him an answer. \u201cYes, you can feel beauty. Like the beauty within someone, the beauty of a gentle soul, a compassionate gesture?\u201d</p><p>He was watching the performers again, a small smile still curving his lips.</p> <p>She let out a soft sigh of aggravation.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about magic?\u201d he asked her suddenly.</p><p>\u201cDo I feel magic? No,\u201d she murmured. Was it magic? No, it was discomfort, being so close, feeling his presence as if he touched her, watching the dancers, the eroticism of their every sinuous movement... the performance was arousing; it was meant to be arousing. She was suddenly aware of the fluttering of a few antique fans around the room. And a surge of whispering. Men\u2019s heads bowed to their wives. Or their lovers. Or the acquaintances they had made here, perhaps even strangers behind masks.</p><p>If he had touched her, instinct would have willed her to lean against him, to place a hand on his knee. She would have liked his fingers at her nape, caressing her, the brush of his knuckles against her cheek. . . no, more. . . his clothing on the floor, her hands on his chest. . .</p><p>The heat in the room was increasing. She reached behind, groping for her champagne. She would have liked a gallon of water; anything cold would do.</p> <p>He procured the flute for her, barely seeming to move again. The touch of his flesh as he passed the glass to her felt as hot as blue fire. She gulped the champagne in a swallow; her head started to spin mercilessly. She was going to teeter against him, fall right into his arms as he seemed, with all amusement, to be expecting. His eyes were locked on hers, laughing, confident, uncanny ... yes!</p><p>The lights came up; the room was suddenly alive with a burst of applause.</p><p>Jordan was holding her empty champagne glass. His chair wasn\u2019t all that close to hers. Around the table people were talking and laughing, and Cindy was in Jared\u2019s arms. His head was bent to hers, and he was whispering something that brought a sparkle to her eyes and the deepest smile to her lips.</p><p>Jordan bolted from her chair, startling Raphael, who sat at her other side. \u201cI see a friend,\u201d she lied quickly. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>She hurried, intent on reaching a bar and getting a big glass of water. Before she could make her way through the tables at the stage\u2019s side, she was stopped as a woman in Renaissance apparel suddenly rose, taking her arm. She nearly shrieked aloud, but the woman spoke quickly. \u201cJordan Riley! It\u2019s Tiff.</p><p>Tiff Henley! I thought that was you when I spied the costume, but you had your mask on earlier?smashing, really. I mean, absolutely smashing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTiff,\u201d Jordan murmured quickly. \u201cOf course, hello, how are you? You look terrific yourself. Beautiful costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I had it made. It seems, however, quite ordinary next to yours. But then...\u201d Behind her mask, Tiff quickly gave Jordan an up and down assessment \u201cWell, it seems made for you, and with vinyl, of course, it must be. Tell me, is it terribly hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Extraordinarily so, at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need a breath of air ... some water. Please . .. Roberto, per favore, acqua per Signorina Riley?\u201d</p><p>Jordan glanced to the table. She should have noted the policeman, Roberto, right away. He rose at Tiff\u2019s bidding, quickly pouring Jordan a plastic flute of mineral water from the bottle sitting in the center of the table. He smiled at her, telling her, \u201cGood evening,\u201d in English.</p><p>\u201cBuona sera,\u201d she returned, accepting the glass, \u201cand thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to walk outside ... ?\u201d he inquired. \u201cIt\u2019s much colder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooler, Roberto,\u201d Tiff said, pleasantly inserting the right term.</p> <p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t leave your party?\u201dJordan protested.</p><p>\u201cI would like a walk,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cGo, go! Cool down!\u201d Tiff advised, reaching for her own champagne flute. \u201cWe\u2019re on for coffee tomorrow, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, certainly,\u201d Jordan agreed.</p><p>Roberto led her through the tables and out through the maze of low barricades that had been set up for crowd control just beyond the tent The moon was high, and light shone from the tent, but the ancient buildings created a world of shadows beyond the spill from the party and the glow from the moon.</p><p>Roberto seemed to understand the desire for light that sprang up within her, though, pausing casually by a cement bench in the center of the square, and lighting a cigarette. As he indicated, Jordan took a seat. He remained standing, but set a foot on the bench and leaned an elbow on his knee as he spoke to her.</p><p>\u201cNo further ... difficulty?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNone at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy. I love my city. Venice is beautiful. There is nowhere like it in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve traveled a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted with a grimace. \u201cBut I have seen TV?and I read. And now ... there is the Internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a beautiful city,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>Before he could reply, she heard him hailed from behind. He turned. Jordan was surprised to see another of the policemen from the other night, Alfredo Manetti. \u201cRoberto, Miss Riley!\u201d The officer seemed to have forgotten his impatience with her. He lifted a hand, quickly indicating that she must not rise, and placed his hands on her shoulders before kissing her cheeks. She nodded warily to him, not returning the gesture.</p><p>He said something rapidly to Roberto, which she did not catch at all.</p><p>\u201cMiss Riley is having a wonderful time,\u201d Roberto said carefully in English.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. You liked the entertainment?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cI did. No blood and guts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Artist\u2019s Ball is quite different. Fun, beautiful ... for everyone. You know, though she would deny it up and down, I think that the contessa is here? she would not admit to having a good time with the common rabble, but I saw a beautifully costumed Jezebel in there this evening, and I think it was the contessa? slumming it, as you might say in English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone loves a party,\u201d Jordan said. She rose. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I think the party is winding down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned to Roberto. \u201cThank you for the walk. It was much cooler out here.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for his reply, but hurried back to the tent. The ticket-taker had fallen asleep at the door.</p><p>She passed him, and excused herself as she walked by the throng of people who were not leaving.</p><p>Inside, she was startled when she felt a hand on her arm.</p><p>It was Lynn Mallory. \u201cJordan, I picked up your mask. Everyone was dancing, our table was bare. If you\u2019re through with it for the night, I\u2019ll take it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks. You\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, we have a very long day tomorrow. Carnevale goes on?and on.\u201d Lynn looked tired, but happy. \u201cWhere is everyone? still dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think. Jared and Cindy looked like newlyweds? after watching the acrobatics! Thank God they brought on a clown and juggler right after?for those of us going home alone! Anna Maria ... I think she has gone, too. I last saw Raphael with another queen. They were comparing costumes and jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, then. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m having coffee at Tiff\u2019s palazzo, but I\u2019ll be by sometime in the afternoon.\u201d Lynn gave her a cheerful wave and started out. Jordan was weaving her way through the tables when she felt a hand on her arm again.</p><p>\u201cYou ran away.\u201d</p><p>It was Ragnor. She noted that he had chosen to wear black again, a period costume from the era of the English reformation?black breeches, buckled black shoes, a black cotton shirt and quilted vest. His hair seemed very light against the darkness of his attire, but the ice blue shade of his eyes seemed almost to match in the muted light of the dance floor.</p><p>He was wearing a cape as well, a cowled cape that seemed to be a mainstay of apparel at Carnevale.</p><p>\u201cYou ran away,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t run away. I was being baked alive in this. I needed to get outside.\u201d As she spoke, she realized that he was leading her to the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to run away again?\u201d</p><p>She found herself being led into a spin; the band was now playing swing music. He seemed to know what to do with it.</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s just late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think that you should run away. Go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, I\u2019d like to get to the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant home. The United States. Your cozy little home in the South.\u201d She arched a brow at him. For a moment, spinning once again beneath his lead, she had no breath to reply. When she faced him again, she said, \u201cHow incredibly rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that you may be a cause for trouble here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI may be a cause for trouble? A woman with power and position stages a horrible scene and I may be a cause for trouble? Are you defending the contessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t defend her in the least. But I think that you should go. I can\u2019t imagine why you wound up being where you were when you were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a party. I was invited.\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand in the air. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice that many others you know were not in that ballroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know where I was? You said you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe story is all over Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard. But it\u2019s in the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? The police are watching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve angered the contessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I really don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an American. We don\u2019t grovel before European nobility.\u201d He was swinging her out to the music; it might be the perfect moment to simply slip from his hold and keep going. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there was no such thing as slipping from his hold. His hands were large, his fingers long. They held a startling strength, so much so that he seemed oblivious to the fact that she had meant to escape. She wondered when the song would end. Of course, she could be really rude and just stop dancing. Then he\u2019d be forced to let her go.</p><p>\u201cI was given the impression you disliked the contessa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I suppose her opinion matters to you as much as it does to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen . ..\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should simply go home. You may have put yourself in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is the contessa some kind of a master criminal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion? Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m perfectly safe. As you noted, the police do seem to be where I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not at all sure you want to rely on the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that the police are criminals, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never say such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re in danger; go home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be in danger?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you are fragile.\u201d</p><p>She did stop dancing. She firmly stood her ground, not trying to pull away, but not moving. \u201cI\u2019m not tall, granted, and I haven\u2019t a great deal of weight, but I assure you, I am far from fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that you are suffering from a recent loss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich has not unhinged my mind, sir. I was engaged to a cop, a good man, killed by flesh-and-blood criminals?people for whom he had empathy and regard. If he\u2019d been a little less concerned for the value of any life, he wouldn\u2019t be dead now. He was a cop, not a seer, or a mystic. He was murdered.</p><p>Therefore, I do know that very bad people do exist, that human beings can be monsters. I think that they are far too lax here, that there should be a far greater investigation into the contessa\u2019s entertainments than what I have seen. That does not make me fragile!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour insistence that something has happened is what puts you in danger,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cSo if something did really happen, I should just forget it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should just go home, on the first possible plane. You should let those who know what they\u2019re doing deal with matters here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo there are matters with which to be dealt?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He sighed deeply with aggravation, a sound that was almost a growl. \u201cThere is nothing that should concern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something you can do?\u201d she queried.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Miss Riley, it would be best if you went home. You have lost someone recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a year. I am not insane with grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you are susceptible to fears and nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not!\u201d Or was she?</p><p>The mannequin had stared at her through Steven\u2019s eyes . . .</p><p>\u201cJust go home!\u201d He said angrily. \u201cYou are causing a greater danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to pull away from him. The music had stopped. He dropped her hands and walked away without another word. Stunned?and furious with herself for staying with him on the dance floor as long as she had?she hurried back to the table where she and her party had been sitting.</p><p>She waited there for a minute as the master of ceremonies announced the last dance of the evening in several languages. She searched the dance floor from where she stood, but saw no sign of Jared or Cindy. She sat for a moment. Jared and Cindy would never just leave her. She drummed her fingers on the table. The sound of the last slow dance faded away.</p><p>Conversation and soft laughter could still be heard in the tent, but the band had stopped playing and even the die-hards were tiredly making for the exit. Jordan realized that Jared and Cindy must have thought that she had left, probably with the group from the Arte della Anna Maria shop, when they had seen that her mask had been picked up from the table. She was on her own.</p><p>She stood up, looking around for Tiff or Roberto, but the table where they had been sitting was empty as well.</p><p>Oh, well, she had walked here. She could walk back.</p><p>She joined the exciting crowd. Knowing the general direction from which they had come, she started that way, glad to see that most people seemed to be headed in the same direction. A knight in armor nearly plowed into her. He apologized profusely, nearly stumbling. She helped straighten him, reeling at the scent of whiskey on his breath.</p><p>\u201cWanna join us for a nightcap?\u201d he slurred to her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no thanks?early morning,\u201d she lied. And hurried ahead. Going beneath an archway between two fifteenth-century buildings, she quickened her pace until she could no longer hear the knight clanking along.</p><p>She came to a fork in the pathway, one walk leading over a bridge to another island, the other leading back inland. She paused, trying to remember how they had come, what landmarks she had seen.</p><p>Venice was historic, wonderful, beautiful. To the unobservant visitor, however, come the deep darkness, it all looked alike.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d she swore aloud.</p><p>Something fluttered by her ear; not a bug, something bigger. She was aware of the flapping of wings.</p><p>A bat? She felt her skin begin to crawl.</p><p>The bridge. That would at least get her away from the old building to her right, a grand but derelict structure with a crumbling facade that apparently harbored bats.</p><p>She hurried over the bridge and along a path.</p><p>The stores were all closed for the evening. She peered into darkened windows, trying to decide if she had come this way or not. If she could just get back to St. Mark\u2019s Square, she would be able to find her way.</p><p>If she could just find anyone to point her in that direction, she\u2019d be fine.</p><p>She saw a sign on a building ahead and hurried toward it. An arrow pointed to her left with the words</p><p>\u201cSan Marco\u201d printed above it. Of course, that could just mean the island, but at least, getting to the island would be a start. Once there, of course, she\u2019d find winding pathways, piazzas and bridges as well, but hopefully, she\u2019d see something familiar?or find another sign.</p><p>She followed the direction of the arrow through another archway between buildings. She looked back to assure herself she had come the right way. The buildings were casting deep shadows on the walkways beneath the light of the moon. The moon itself was now becoming a darkened blue orb in the night sky as clouds drifted below it. She started, stopping dead in her tracks, as the length of shadow seemed to stretch out from the buildings across the piazza she had just crossed.</p><p>Something flew by her again, close enough to tangle in her hair. She let out a startled gasp. Bats. This time touching her. She ran forward, shaking her head, feeling the first sense of real fear.</p><p>Nasty little creatures, bombarding her at night. But just bats!</p><p>She stopped again, shaking her head, inhaling deeply. Which way had she run? Ahead of her was another archway. Was it one she had already walked beneath? No.</p><p>Once again ...</p><p>Wings ...</p><p>Flying close, not touching her; she instinctively ducked.</p><p>This time, the wings seemed to whisper. Hisses, warnings, not formed into words, but sounds that seemed to echo and flutter with danger . ..</p><p>She ran, hurrying beneath the arch. She came upon another little bridge that traversed a small canal. She could see down the length of water to another bridge.</p><p>Someone was there. A figure ... a man. In a dottore cape and mask.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d she called out.</p><p>He stood there, waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d she called again. She had never been so glad to see anyone in her life, she thought as he made a sweeping gesture, indicating that she should come around.</p><p>Then he moved, crossing the bridge.</p><p>\u201cJared, wait, damn you!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>She ran over the bridge, then tripped on the cobblestone landing. Despite her desperate effort to prevent a fall, she went down. Swearing, she cursed her high-heeled red leather boots and looked at her leg, feeling a pain in her knee but hoping she hadn\u2019t wrecked the rented vinyl costume. As she looked over her uninjured costume, she found herself staring at the ground. To her amazement, a shadow seemed to be sweeping toward her.</p><p>Heedless of her knee, she leaped to her feet and ran. She turned back. The shadow seemed to have risen from the ground, to have become a real form in the pathway. She kept running, trying to find the street that would lead around to the other bridge.</p><p>A flutter of wings suddenly seemed to surround her. Bats . . . shadows . ..</p><p>Again, the hissing sound. Fluttering. Speech that wasn\u2019t speech. Shadow whispers . ..</p><p>She ran faster, bursting out upon a lighted square. She could see the path to the other bridge. It was now empty.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d</p><p>She thought she heard her name being called. No, whispered, fluttered by bat wings. A breeze was picking up. She could hear it, whisking by her.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d</p><p>She looked ahead. A larger bridge loomed before her. He was there. Jared. Or a man, a figure, in a dottore costume.</p><p>\u201cJared, damn you!\u201d</p><p>She heard the panic in her own voice.</p><p>She raced toward the bridge. Jared was already over it. It seemed he had gone down the darkest path before her.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Jared, wait!\u201d</p><p>She started running again, telling herself not to look back.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but do so. Shadows seemed to be dancing, snaking around the facades of the buildings as well as the paths between them. Those shadows were encroaching, moving swiftly, as if they too ran, as if they would come and overtake her, and she would be swallowed into the darkness.</p><p>She nearly ran into a dead end, just barely stopping herself from plowing straight into a wall. She turned back. The shadows had her nearly cornered. She had to escape this dead end before the shadows covered it; somehow, she knew that, knew it in the naked fear that now ran rampant in her.</p><p>She shot across the space to the pathway she had strayed from, just barely making it before the stretch of shadow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJordan!\u201d</p><p>She thought she heard her name again. A fluttering, and now, a sound of laughter, deep husky laughter, neither male nor female, just. . .</p><p>Evil.</p> <p>Fluttering, laughter, sounds, whispers.</p><p>She came to a halt. Shadows seemed to play and dance on the facades before her now. Graceful, a sweep of darkness, circling her. For a moment she stood transfixed, trying to tell herself, somewhere deep in the logic of her mind, that this could not be happening. Shadows were no more than an obstruction of light. The whispers, hissing, fluttering.. . the laughter, were no more than her imagination, night sounds taking on new meanings as she gave way to panic.</p><p>But the shadows did seem to take shape. Like dancers on the walls.</p><p>She felt a shove suddenly. And she was sure that she distinctly heard the word, \u201cGo!\u201d Instinct moved her again. She ran?in the direction she had been pushed. A cacophony of whispers seemed to rise behind her. A fluttering, breathing, hissing.</p><p>She ran and ran.</p> <p>A shadow rose before her.</p><p>She plowed right into it.</p><p>She heard fierce muttering in Italian. An old man rose, shaking his head, steadying her as she nearly tripped over him. He said something about \u201cCarnevale\u201d and something nasty about \u201cturistas!\u201d Jordan could barely apologize?in any language. \u201cPiazza San Marco!\u201d she said. \u201cPer favore!\u201d The old man pointed.</p><p>She nodded and thanked him. She ran again, then saw that she was on the path that led directly to the left of the Danieli?and that let out on the well-lit area that edged the Canale Santa Maria della Salute.</p><p>She burst into the light. There, on the broad walkway before the water, were other people. Not many. A couple ambling beneath the blue moon. A threesome waiting at a vaporetto stop. A restaurateur, sweeping up in front of his cafe.</p><p>She stopped running, doubled over, caught her breath. In seconds, in the light, she regained a sense of sanity.</p> <p>She\u2019d been lost and confused. A bat had gotten into her hair. She\u2019d panicked, and she\u2019d run like an idiot, and hurt herself, but now she was safe.</p><p>She rose and felt a sharp pain in her side from the running, and she felt the soreness in her knee.</p><p>Damn Jared! He had waited for her, but not long enough for her to catch him! He hadn\u2019t been worried, she told herself. He probably hadn\u2019t realized that she was lost, or for that matter, afraid.</p><p>She stretched and looked back. If the old man was still out on the path, she\u2019d give him a wave of thanks.</p><p>The old man was not there.</p><p>Her breath caught again.</p><p>In the moonlight, she saw a wolf. A huge silver wolf, sitting in the center of the path.</p><p>Yet even as she watched, the wolf rose to all fours. Strange glittering eyes seemed to stare back at her in the night.</p> <p>Then the wolf turned and disappeared into the shadows.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Entering the Danieli, Jordan saw that some night owls were still in the lobby bar. The tables in the handsome lobby and bar area were occupied by couples and small groups. At one of the period sofas that flanked a Persian rug, Jordan saw Jared and Cindy. On a coffee table in front of them were empty espresso cups. The two were t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, apparently feeling both drowsy and romantic.</p><p>Jordan was about to accost Jared, telling him he should have stopped for her, when she gazed at his cup again. Empty. He leaned back in the sofa, his arm around his wife, his mask cast to the floor by the sofa.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d Cindy straightened, then stood. \u201cI was starting to worry about you. We knew you left with the folks from Anna Maria\u2019s, but the party has been over now for quite a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave with the group from Anna Maria\u2019s,\u201d Jordan told them.</p><p>A waiter hovered nearby, smiling pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cLast call, Jordan, if you want anything. They do have decaf espresso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea, thank you, something like an English Breakfast,\u201d Jordan said, sitting across from Cindy and Jared in a richly upholstered armchair.</p><p>Cindy sat again, staring at her. Jared leaned forward frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI knew we shouldn\u2019t have left. I thought you\u2019d taken your mask and gone. As a matter of fact, I was angry with you for not telling us you were leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left together?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been back a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least half an hour,\u201d Cindy told her.</p><p>\u201cWere you all right?\u201d Jared asked. He sounded anxious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t with the people from the art shop?\u201d Cindy asked.</p><p>Jordan shook her head, watching them. \u201cThey thought I left with you; you thought I left with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where were you? You weren\u2019t in the tent when we left,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cI ran into two of the cops.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s frown deepened. Before he could say anything, Jordan added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I made no accusations against anyone. I was charming and totally sane. We just talked about the artist\u2019s ball?and the beauty of Venice. And, of course, the heat of vinyl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are smashing,\u201d Cindy said, smiling. Jordan smiled back at her. Cindy was a wonderful friend.</p><p>Sympathetic when she needed a defender and pleased with her every little accomplishment.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmashing, but too provocative,\u201d Jared said, sounding distracted, a frown still furrowing his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou came alone? I mean, that\u2019s a definitely red costume, and I\u2019m sure the streets were filled with wolves tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I thought I saw a wolf along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see any wolf costumes tonight, did you Jared?\u201d Cindy asked.</p><p>Jordan decided not to mention the fact that she thought she had seen a real wolf.</p><p>\u201cNo wolves,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBelieve it or not, I did see a giant ape. Jordan, I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019d have never left you. As Cindy said, I was kind of put out, worried, and angry?thinking you\u2019d just walked off without telling us.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you made it home all right,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>She lifted her hands. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d She smiled a thank you to the waiter as he brought her tea. Leaning forward to pour the tea, she told Jared, \u201cAs a matter of fact, I was ready to come in here and yell at you.</p><p>I think it took me so long to get back because I was following the wrong dottore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen I left, I did confuse the streets. Then I saw a dottore ahead. I thought it was you, and that you just weren\u2019t waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been right here?it couldn\u2019t have been Jared,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cJordan, the dottore costume is one of the most common in the city. I\u2019m so sorry ... I hope you weren\u2019t frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not at all,\u201d Jordan lied blithely.</p><p>A fire leaped and crackled in the fireplace. Low conversation filled the lobby. A concierge remained behind the long desk before the front door, and several receptionists were still on duty behind the perfectly polished check-in desk. The feeling of ... normalcy was so prevalent in the lobby?not just normalcy, but comfort and warmth?that it was easy to believe that she was letting her own mind run riot.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she seen Steven\u2019s face on a dummy today?</p><p>\u201cSo you had a good time?\u201d Cindy asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. The people from the Arte della Anna Maria shop are wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Cindy agreed.</p><p>Both Jared and Cindy kept staring at her; Jared a little skeptically, as if he doubted that she was really relaxed and comfortable.</p><p>\u201cWe should never have left,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re here, I\u2019m here. And you should go up to bed,\u201d Jordan said. She indicated their empty demitasse cups. \u201cGo on up to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>She shook her head firmly. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll finish my tea and come up. I have my own room, I\u2019m over twenty-one, I\u2019ve caroused in the streets alone in the dark, and I can surely make my way up the stairs to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink your tea alone?\u201d Cindy began.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Jordan said firmly. \u201cI\u2019d like to wind down a little by myself.\u201d Cindy rose; Jared joined her more slowly.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Jordan repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>She gave him a vast sigh of impatience. \u201cFine. I had a great time. I\u2019m just going to drink my tea and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Cindy gave her a kiss on the cheek and tugged on Jared\u2019s hand. He followed along behind her, still watching Jordan as he headed for the stairs behind the receptionist\u2019s desk.</p><p>When they were gone, Jordan leaned back in her chair. She was glad they had chosen seats near the hearth; despite the heat she had felt in her vinyl earlier, the excursion home had given her a chill. Now the natural warmth of the fire seemed to enwrap her, and it was comforting.</p><p>The waiter came by to clear away the cups. He cast Jordan a smile.</p><p>She smiled back, then leaned forward. \u201cScusi ... are there any wolves in Venice?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWolves?\u201d</p><p>She searched her mind for the word in Italian. \u201cLupo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLupo, wolf, si, I understand, signorina.\u201d He smiled, shaking his head. \u201cBig dogs, yes, people keep big dogs, even in little apartments. But wolves ...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNo, signorina, no wolves. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw a wolf in the street.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sage nod. \u201cThere are many wolves at Carnevale, signorina?out to howl when they can hide behind a mask, yes?\u201d</p><p>She grinned, shaking her head. \u201cNot the human kind. A real wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big dog, signorina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople down the calle .. . they have two huskies. And down by the fish restaurant, maybe a quarter of a mile over the bridge, there is a man who owns a malamute. A big, big dog that looks much like a wolf.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course, thank you, that must be it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, pleased that he had been of help.</p><p>She rose.</p> <p>\u201cBuona notte, signorina,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cGrazie, buona notte,\u201d she told him, and headed up the stairs. Once inside her room, she made a point of locking her door.</p><p>She walked across the room to the windows and saw that though they had been closed, the shutters opening to the walk and canal below had been left open. She opened the window, reaching for the shutters, but paused.</p><p>By day, she could look out and see the bustle of human traffic on the broad walk before the hotel; she could see the sweep of the canal and the majestic basilica beyond. Leaning far out, she could see the pillars before the Doge\u2019s Palace and the Piazza San Marco.</p><p>Now ... the night was quiet.</p> <p>It seemed that even the last of the revelers had gone to bed.</p><p>About to close the shutters, she hesitated, and took a seat in front of the window.</p><p>She loved her room here. The bed was set back in a section of the room that was divided from the sitting area by draperies held with gold cords. There was a window in the area with the bed, and the window here. A picture-perfect view was offered from either window. The room was furnished with well-kept antiques. Each night when she came in, there was a tray of fresh fruit and mineral water waiting for her.</p><p>She opened the water and walked back to the window. She sat in the chair there again and stared out, listening to the lulling lap of water against the docks beyond.</p><p>The tea had tasted good; the water was better.</p><p>She had drunk far too much champagne tonight Leaning back, she closed her eyes and let the cool breeze waft over her. Ragnor\u2019s suggestion as they danced passed through her mind. Maybe she should go home.</p> <p>Steven Moore had joined the police force as a homicide investigator right when the city and the neighboring countryside had been plagued by a series of bizarre cult murders. The people of Charleston had been deeply concerned?it wasn\u2019t so much that her leading citizens were disappearing, but Charlestonians tended to be both old guard, as well as concerned with being progressive. The city was beautiful: the Battery area had its antebellum houses and courtyards, the public parks offered mature trees and gardens, and to the east lay the shimmering Atlantic. The city was rich with history, from Revolutionary to Civil War times, and yet it strove to move into the future. There were problems, yes.</p><p>Moving into the future wasn\u2019t easy. The Deep South carried a great deal of baggage, as well as the traditional charm and hospitality. But such strange and bizarre happenings ...</p><p>The countryside surrounding the city was also rich in ruins and marshes. First, the decomposed remains of a young woman were found in the basement of a condemned manor by the river; little more than bones were found. Not a scrap of clothing was discovered near the remains, no sign of cause of death. The medical examiner\u2019s office eventually sent the remains to the FBI; the bones told her age and race?eighteen to twenty-four, white. She\u2019d had no dental work done whatsoever and had died with perfect teeth.</p><p>Later, rumor started about Latour House, an abandoned Colonial mansion just outside the city. Lights were seen, strange music was heard, and children from neighboring farms swore they heard laughter and chanting. The house was investigated; people had indeed been living in it. Remnants of fires were found, along with bottles, blankets, and cooking paraphernalia?including a George Foreman grille. The homeless had taken up residence, so it appeared. But then another body was found. This one had not decayed quite so thoroughly, and there were strange markings found on the remaining flesh. This girl\u2019s teeth had been riddled with cavities; her remains were traced back to a missing persons report filed in Columbia six months earlier. Steven had just taken his position with the homicide department. He\u2019d been among the officers to find the remains.</p><p>The next body was found in an abandoned mill. This time, fingerprints on a beer bottle were traced to a local high school tough guy who became a whimpering child in the hands of juvenile authorities. He told bizarre stories of a devil-worshiping cult, of a grand master who demanded that he and others lure young women?preferably homeless girls and runaways?to designated places.</p><p>The boy swore he had no hand in the murders, nor could he recognize the leaders of the cult. When talking to the police, though, he suddenly clammed up. No amount of pressure could get him to talk.</p><p>He was found dead in his cell at the juvenile detention hall. He\u2019d gotten hold of a straight razor, and slit his own throat Jordan had met Steven at a local restaurant He\u2019d immediately caught her attention with his deep concern for the young man who\u2019d had such a checkered past, but was still a child. She\u2019d started talking to him over coffee; she\u2019d agreed to a date. His dedication to his work was admirable; his ability to keep his work and the rest of his life balanced was more so. He was often on call, but Jordan didn\u2019t mind. She always had work to do, a book to read, and Charleston was her city?she had friends, and loved the movies, plays, museums, and everything else the city offered. Her parents had left her a house near the Battery where she kept a canvas hammock beneath a giant magnolia. She would lie there, reading and waiting for him to come. She could still hear the grate of iron when the gate would open and he would slip into the garden, touch her hair, her cheek, and lie beside her. He\u2019d asked her to marry him in that old hammock. She hadn\u2019t really known him that long, not even six months, but among his other attributes, he had been an incredible lover, and it had never occurred to her to refuse him, even though the speed of his question somewhat amused her.</p><p>Jared and Cindy had thrown them a wonderful engagement party, right before Christmas. They made their plans. They\u2019d have a cat and a dog, maybe even a bird in the garden. One boy, one girl. They laughed as they talked about names, from the traditional to the odd. They teased one another about rethinking it all if they should have two boys, or two girls. If they couldn\u2019t use a name they loved for a child, they\u2019d just have to get another pet.</p> <p>Then, after Christmas, another body was found. In the marsh area, decomposition could set in amazingly fast; a body could be reduced to little more than bone in a few days. Animals and insects could see to that. This time, the medical examiners found slash marks on the vertebrae of the neck, and the police knew that the cult had not died away, but had just been lying low. The FBI was called in to assist in the continuing investigation.</p><p>Tire tracks were found near the marsh; the vehicle used to dump the body had been a new model truck.</p><p>A knife found near the site was traced to a new Ford truck owner.</p><p>The man, however, and his truck, had disappeared. The search was on.</p><p>The last time Jordan saw Steven alive, he had stopped by the house to tell her he was hot on a lead, he\u2019d be late, very late coming home. He worked long hours, but that had never bothered her because it was easy for her to adjust her work schedule. He had his own key to the house. He could come in and wake her whenever he chose.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t come back.</p><p>That night, there was a fire at an abandoned and tumbledown barn. Through the night, firefighters worked desperately to get the blaze under control, but it had been created through the work of a well-planned arsonist.</p><p>When the fire was finally out, eight bodies, hopelessly charred, were discovered.</p><p>Weeks later, forensic specialists had the remains sorted. Steven\u2019s body was the first to be identified, his belt buckle hadn\u2019t burned completely and his badge had hardly been seared. Among the others were two backup officers, a twenty-three-year-old prostitute, the last victim of the cult, and five cult members. One of them was identified, through dental records, as the owner of the Ford truck. Piecing together the evidence, the police and FBI deduced that Steven and the others had hoped to surprise the cult members. A gunfight had taken place, and the kerosene, intended to destroy the murder scene, had ignited. Candles that had been set up around the victim had spurred on the flames, and the barn had gone up like a tinderbox.</p><p>In her grief, Jordan knew that Steven would have felt his life was a fair trade for having destroyed something so heinous as the cult that had taken so many young lives.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t changed the fact that he was dead.</p><p>The cool breeze coming in reminded her of the last winter they had spent together. She could almost hear the creak of the hammock in the garden, where she had so often bundled up and waited, regardless of the weather.</p><p>Soothing . ..</p><p>Jordan was never sure when she drifted from consciousness to sleep, or when memories twisted to become the substance of dreams.</p><p>She felt she was light as air. She was in the hammock, and it was winter; there was snow all around. But the snow wasn\u2019t cold; it was soft, and drifting, and not even wet to the touch. It wasn\u2019t snow, but clouds, she realized, and suddenly, he was walking through them.</p><p>Steven. Dark hair in a rakish mop, slightly tousled as it so often was. He wore a sheepish grin, as if he were late, but had a good excuse, and knew that she would understand. She wanted to jump from the hammock and greet him, but she was far too lethargic to do so. He would come to her. He would arrive at the hammock, perhaps slip up behind her. She\u2019d feel his breath at her nape, and his fingers slipping beneath the collar of her sweater.</p><p>He was there with her.</p><p>\u201cYe olde hammock,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cToo cold, it\u2019s winter,\u201d she whispered. But his fingers were warm; hotter than vinyl, hotter than watching the acrobatic dancers ...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never cold, where you are,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She needed to talk. She wanted to tell him that she had seen his features on the face of a mannequin.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t there anymore. He was ahead of her in the snow again. Not snow, clouds; he was walking and walking, coming through the clouds, but he didn\u2019t seem to be able to reach her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t Steven,\u201d she whispered softly. She didn\u2019t say more; in the dream, it seemed far too rude to remind him that he was dead.</p><p>\u201cI can, and I will.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled, because he was stubborn, and this was a dream, so of course he could come to her.</p><p>\u201cSteven ...\u201d</p><p>A dream, filled with clouds, and the memories of a slow-burning warmth that could destroy the very concept of winter.

The animal snarled, lips pulling taut, canine teeth luminescent.</p><p>\u201cJordan, the damned wolf is in the way,\u201d Steven said.</p><p>\u201cThere are no wolves in Venice,\u201d she told him. \u201cOnly big dogs.\u201d The clouds seemed to be streaming around both Steven and the wolf. It was snowing, and the snow was cold, blustering against her skin.</p> <p>She woke with a start.</p><p>She nearly screamed aloud.</p><p>A man was standing above her. She was still seated by the window; the man was bowing low to her, he was nothing but a dark form . ..</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>He jerked up, giving himself a shake.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d Jordan reached over and flicked on the lamp by the chair.</p> <p>He was in long flannel pajama pants; his chest bare. For a moment, he looked disconcerted, as if he had been sleepwalking.</p><p>Then, he looked uncomfortable. He stared at the window and moved away. Frowning, Jordan glanced out.</p><p>It was snowing in Venice. Tiny crystaline snowflakes, drifting in the window.</p><p>She looked back at her cousin. \u201cJared, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tapped to make sure that you had come up and were okay. But you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d She looked quickly around at her door. It was closed. She stared at Jared. \u201cI locked the door,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He shrugged, edging back toward it. \u201cIt was open.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI swear, I locked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlide the bolts.\u201d It seemed as if he didn\u2019t want to be near the window.</p><p>Of course not It was actually snowing, in Venice. Something that didn\u2019t happen all that often.</p><p>Jared had a decent chest. He was tall and slim, had good shoulders and a wiry, athletic appearance.</p><p>Now, there were goose bumps all over his flesh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I came in,\u201d he told her, sounding firm now that he had gotten away from the window.</p><p>\u201cYou might have had pneumonia by morning! Lock those shutters, and close the window! And get under some blankets.\u201d</p><p>Because his commands made sense, she obeyed them, then stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cJared, I\u2019m sure I locked the hallway door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you thought you locked it but didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and shivered.</p><p>\u201cGet in bed, Jordan, I\u2019ve been really worried about you. Please don\u2019t come down with an awful flu or cold.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cJared,\u201d she told him, coming his way and setting her hands on his ice cold shoulders, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I am going to bed. I\u2019m going to snuggle under the covers and sleep late.\u201d She gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI had a good time tonight.\u201d</p><p>He looked unhappy. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back, frowning. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look like you\u2019re glad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ... I shouldn\u2019t have let you come here. I shouldn\u2019t have brought you to the contessa\u2019s party ...</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t all right. She was dreaming about her dead fianc\u00e9 and wolves that stood in the shadows in streets.</p><p>No matter what happened, or what she imagined, she wasn\u2019t going to tell Jared about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, and I\u2019m having a great time,\u201d she told him. She waved a hand in the air. \u201cI m angry about the contessa\u2019s sense of entertainment, but when I see her again, I swear I\u2019ll be charming and cause no more trouble.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, wetting his lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, quit, it\u2019s all right. Go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, you\u2019re my cousin, my best friend, blood relation, all that. I love you. Now get out of my room and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>He studied her, nodded, and turned to leave. At the door, he hesitated, looking back. \u201cGet over here and bolt the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYessir.\u201d</p><p>When he was gone, she carefully locked the door, making sure he heard the sound.</p><p>\u201cGo back to your wife!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he whispered against the door. \u201cWatch it, will you? Do you know what that sounded like?\u201d Jordan laughed. \u201cYes, and you must look great out there, too. Get to your room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>When he was gone, Jordan found that she was wide awake. She flicked on the television, wondering if she could get anything this late at night There was an Italian game show on. She couldn\u2019t understand the language of the enthusiastic contestants, but the game had to do with answering questions and losing pieces of clothing and then getting into a whipped cream fight.</p><p>She left the television on and crawled into bed.</p><p>The lamp was still on, dispelling the shadows.</p><p>She decided to sleep, for what remained of the night, with the light on.</p><p>Cindy Riley woke suddenly. She didn\u2019t know why. For a moment, she stared into the darkness of the room.</p><p>Instinctively, she reached across the bed.</p><p>Jared wasn\u2019t with her. Yet the moment she realized this, she saw that he was in the room. He had opened the window to the night, and stood there, despite the chill, staring out at Venice.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woke you, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you didn\u2019t wake me,\u201d she protested. She got out of bed and walked around to where he stood, laying her cheek against his back as she slipped her arms around him. \u201cYou\u2019re freezing!\u201d she told him. \u201cWhat are you doing, standing here like this?\u201d</p><p>He was silent a moment, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s snowing. It doesn\u2019t snow that often in Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s white wet stuff,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared .. . you\u2019re freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, almost as if he were confused by that fact.</p><p>\u201cCome back to bed, I\u2019ll warm you up.\u201d</p><p>He turned with a sudden fervor that startled her. \u201cWill you? I am cold, so very, very cold.\u201d There was something about him . ..</p><p>They\u2019d been married for years. Good years, because they were good together. She loved him, liked him, enjoyed his company, and very much enjoyed their sex life. They had been together for years. Still, tonight. . .</p><p>His arms seemed stronger. The tension in him seemed to leap through his flesh, no matter how cold he seemed. The simple touch of his hands upon her shoulders felt erotic.</p><p>They\u2019d made love that evening. Coming up from the espresso they had shared downstairs, they\u2019d been warm and familiar and had fallen easily into bed, kissing, petting, slipping naturally into the act of love.</p><p>This ... suddenly seemed almost illicit Erotic, exciting ... and it was just the feel of his body beneath her fingers, and the way his hands felt on her shoulders ... and the way he looked at her, something in his eyes ...</p><p>The window remained open. Cold air was sweeping in. He leaned down and kissed her with hard, wet, opened mouth, passion that belied the ice of his flesh. She felt his teeth graze hers, the length of his tongue seemed to sweep to her gullet, and it was like shooting a lightning rod straight down to every erotic zone in her body. A second later he was lifting her. When she hit the bed, her nightgown was already halfway ripped from her body.</p><p>Small loss . ..</p><p>His lips, his tongue were everywhere. Along her throat, her collarbone. Electric. She started shaking, not from the cold but from the eagerness aroused within her.</p><p>\u201cMy God, what were we drinking tonight?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. He was between her thighs. She went into spasms of ecstasy, trying to throw off everything around her, she was so on fire. She felt the graze of his teeth. He was growing too forceful ...</p><p>almost painful... in his ardor. She wanted to whisper a protest. She couldn\u2019t; her voice wouldn\u2019t come, and she was shaking violently as orgasms pounded through her system. He rose above her, and she could wrap her limbs around him quickly enough. Dimly, she wondered if the whole of the bed was shaking, if the people in the room beneath wouldn\u2019t waken, and think that the roof above them was about to fall in ...</p><p>Later, she didn\u2019t know how much later?if the passion they shared had raged through the night or lasted no more than a few volatile minutes?she felt the cold again. By then, Jared was crushed to her side, still panting.</p><p>\u201cThe window,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe window. It\u2019s freezing.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t move. She leaped up, stark naked, and rushed over to the window, drawing in the shutters first and securing them, then closing the heavy glass window. Shivering and bare, she wrapped her arms around herself, then decided to make a pit stop before flying back into the warmth of the bed. She closed herself into the bathroom?never being one to assume that such necessary things needed to be shared in marriage?and when she was done she washed her hands and doused her face with water. Looking into the mirror above the sink, she was startled to see thin scratches on her neck, and the slightest trickle of blood from one of her breasts. There was a streak of the stuff on one of her thighs as well.</p><p>She washed up quickly. The little cuts were nothing at all.</p><p>Turning off the light, she scampered across the room and flew back into the bed, wrapping the covers around her. She slipped her arms around her husband again. For a moment, he didn\u2019t move. He was lying on his back, staring up at the ceiling, or with his eyes closed, she wasn\u2019t even sure, it was so dark to her since she\u2019d been in the bright light of the bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>At last he moved again, his fingers easing through her hair.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was ... wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know, I try.\u201d</p><p>He sounded as if he were making an effort to speak lightly.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely different; I\u2019m not sure I want to try it every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove nibbles.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to mention the fact that love nibbles didn\u2019t usually draw blood. After all, it had been ...</p><p>Spectacular.</p> <p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>It seemed he was a long time answering. But then he turned, drawing her very close to him, holding her tenderly.</p><p>He was shaking.</p><p>\u201cJared, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing ... I\u2019m just cold. Whoa, so cold!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you silly man, you were standing in front of an open window watching snow.\u201d His lips brushed her forehead with a kiss. So different. Now, a touch as tender as a breath of sweet, warm air.</p> <p>He was still shaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting another blanket.\u201d</p><p>She got out of bed, stumbled over something in the dark, banged her toe against the bedstead, and swore.</p><p>\u201cJared ... a light would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, just come back to bed,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get you a blanket,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>\u201cJust come back to bed.\u201d He let out an impatient sigh. A second later, he was up, drawing her into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re all the warmth I need.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, wondering if he could see at all in the darkness how he had touched her.</p><p>But when they were back in bed, huddled together as close as two peas in a pod, he was still shaking.</p><p>She said no more, though; she just tried very hard to give him all her warmth.</p><p>She wished Jordan could see just how sweet he could be at times. He really was a beautiful man.</p><p>And to think ...</p><p>There had been times lately when she had thought that she was becoming a monster herself.</p><p>A green-eyed monster. She\u2019d harbored such doubts! But tonight... she was simply ashamed of herself.</p><p>He loved her. Completely, she thought Cindy slept with a smile curving her lips throughout the night.</p><p>Little cuts ... a few drops of blood. They meant nothing. Nothing at all.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Cindy and Jared were not at the breakfast table in the morning.</p><p>Jordan thought wryly of the way they had been the night before. Good for them.</p><p>Jared must have left her room and jumped his wife for the second time that evening. So much for romance fading with time and marriage!</p><p>At the rooftop restaurant, Jordan ordered coffee and a croissant, remembering that she was to head off to see Tiff\u2019s rented palazzo soon. She studied the advanced reading copy she had of the vampire book and jotted down notes on a few of the comments she wanted to make in her review. When she\u2019d finished a second cup of coffee, it was still early. She headed back to her room, calculating the time in the States.</p><p>One in the morning.</p><p>Due to the fact that her work was heavily syndicated, she got her assignments through an agent, rather than an editor. And Liz Schultz, her agent, was a night owl and a close friend. She had been the one to see a book review Jordan had written for a magazine and taken her into syndication. Liz had been new at her job; they had each taken a chance on the other. Their struggles, frustrations, rejections and triumphs had created a solid bond between them.</p><p>Liz wouldn\u2019t mind a call at home at this hour.</p><p>Jordan dialed the number through her phone card and was surprised when Liz answered almost immediately, sounding as if she were no more than a room away.</p><p>\u201cHey, Liz. It\u2019s Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan! Hey kid, it\u2019s great to hear from you. Wait, never mind. You\u2019re going to tell me that you\u2019re having too much fun, that you don\u2019t want to do any work.\u201d</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t going to say that at all. I was going to tell you that the director\u2019s vampire book is great. I\u2019m going to fax the review to you soon, I\u2019ve got all my notes. I\u2019m just going to type \u2018em up this morning, and then the review will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGory stuff, huh? But tell me, how is Venice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019m having a wonderful time. I\u2019ve always loved the city. This is different, though. You should see some of these costumes up close and personal. They\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the parties? Any good men?\u201d</p><p>Jordan hesitated, thinking about the contessa\u2019s ball.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jordan, I\u2019m sorry, maybe it\u2019s still too soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Liz, nothing like that. No, I was just thinking that having the vampire book with me was kind of strange?\u201d</p><p>Liz let out a gasp. \u201cI should never have given you that book!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz, no, wait, just listen. Do you remember me telling you that Jared was mainly concerned about one ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one given by the princess or the duchess or whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContessa. Contessa della Trieste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you telling me about it, yes. To Jared, it was like being invited to the White House or something. Was it spectacular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was horrible. And bizarre. I was in an upstairs ballroom, dancing, having a fine old time, then this storyteller started a tale about a horrible man who killed his wives. He grabbed people and they started falling ... then all these other people in the room grabbed one another and where one woman fell, I saw this huge pool of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Jordan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, a wolf got me out of the ballroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man in a wolf\u2019s costume. He put me in a boat and disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Did you get the police, what happened? I didn\u2019t read anything about it in the papers, and you know how many international newspapers I take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happened, it was the contessa\u2019s idea of fun. And by the way, I did make the local papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to the police, the police went to the palazzo, they got the contessa, and Jared and Cindy, and they all explained to me that the entire tiling was a show. Naturally, it was written up in the papers the next day that an American woman had gone a little crazy over the evening\u2019s entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntertainment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was awful, but?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s a contessa, so whatever, is that the thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. But the next morning, I read the vampire book, and it was even more fascinating.\u201d On the other end of the line, Liz hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Jordan. Maybe I was wrong, sending you that particular book. Maybe you should come right home. That book must have just made it all worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Liz, honestly, I was glad to have the book. And you\u2019ll like my review.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the author will be glad. Strange material ... but popular, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just gotten in another one, to be published next October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn vampires?\u201d</p><p>Liz hesitated. \u201cVampires, cults, Satanism, copycats, rumors ... there\u2019s a really interesting chapter on defense against vampires. The author is a cop.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s fingers tightened on the wire as she felt a spasm of pain. \u201cA cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fellow in New Orleans who has worked some really bizarre cases. He doesn\u2019t say that vampires exist, but he suggests ways of dealing with people who think they\u2019re vampires. His book goes back into the ancient legends and all as well?interesting reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, all this reading may not be good for you under the circumstances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a fragile person about to go over the edge. If this book is by a police officer, I very much do want to read it Send it by FedEx. The earliest delivery possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that the contessa\u2019s entertainment ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas real?\u201d Jordan hesitated, remembering dancing with Ragnor?and his comments about the contessa.</p><p>Yes, he did think that the woman was a criminal</p><p>Dangerous . . .</p><p>\u201cLiz, I\u2019m keeping my nose clean, behaving rationally, I\u2019m just a civilian visitor to a beautiful city, and especially because of Jared, I\u2019m being as cool, collected and courteous as I can be. But I want that book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to get your ass on a plane. If that woman is dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz, I\u2019m staying in one of the most beautiful hotels in the world, with my cousin and his wife just next door. I\u2019m fine. And the police think I\u2019m a little crazy, so they\u2019re keeping an eye on me. Send me the damned book. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. All right. But I\u2019d better hear from you frequently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>They said their good-byes, and Jordan hung up. She glanced at her watch.</p><p>It was late enough for her to go down to the concierge and get instructions on how to walk to the palazzo that Tiff Henley had rented.</p><p>Sal D\u2019Onofrio loved his work, and he loved Venice.</p><p>The mornings now tended to be quiet. Party-goers at Carnevale were usually late sleepers. But it was also a good time for work in Venice because there were so very many people here. And every human being with an ounce of romance in his or her soul was compelled to take a gondola ride.</p><p>He had already taken a couple of early-bird British women for a two-hour ride among many of the canals. They wanted to see the buildings of Venice, to go off the beaten track. He had taken them far, singing away.</p><p>They\u2019d loved his singing.</p><p>They\u2019d tipped him generously for his tunes.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t sing for money. He sang because it was fun. One of the British women had joked that a good singing voice must be a requirement for all gondoliers. He had told them that no?some gondoliers couldn\u2019t sing worth a single lira?they had just gotten lucky. He had told them, too, that not all gondoliers were exceptionally good looking?they had gotten lucky in that aspect as well. And few had his gift for languages. He\u2019d never had much schooling, only what had been required; he had always known that, like his father before him, he would be a gondolier. He had a natural ear for languages and was fluent in French, Spanish, English, and Italian. He could converse somewhat in German and knew a smattering of Russian. He was good looking, and even the other gondoliers admitted grudgingly that he had the best singing voice. Italian, however, was a language made for singing. Those who came for rides usually wanted to hear Italian songs sung?after all, they were drifting through the beauty of Venice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His British ladies were gone, but the morning had already been well worthwhile. He sang as he drifted along alone, dunking of heading back to the dock and waiting, but singing in hopes of luring some straying tourists.</p><p>They all loved, \u201cO sole mio!\u201d</p><p>Yet even as he sang, his pleasant tenor booming across the narrow canal he navigated, he noted something bobbing in the water ahead. He narrowed his eyes, still singing, but more absently, and quietly.</p> <p>He used his pole expertly to slow his vessel.</p><p>His singing stopped abruptly mid-note as he narrowed his eyes and stared into the water.</p><p>No...</p><p>He hunched down and reached into the water, grabbing for the bobbing, ball-shaped object. His fingers wound into something.</p><p>Hair.</p> <p>Even as the thought reached him, he saw the object, full front, just inches before his face.</p><p>He let out a hoarse cry of horror, dropping it as if it burned him.</p><p>The blood drained from his face. He felt the eggs he\u2019d had for breakfast scrambling and scorching in his stomach.</p><p>He retched and plopped down into his boat, first using canal water to rinse his face, then remembering what he\u2019d just found in the water, and retching again.</p><p>He breathed deeply and straightened his shoulders.</p><p>The ... thing ... was now bobbing in the water again, just a few feet away. He watched it, still breathing deeply.</p> <p>After a moment, he knew what he had to do.</p><p>It was a pleasant, uneventful walk to Tiff Henley\u2019s palazzo.</p><p>Jordan crossed several bridges, but the directions she had been given were excellent, and she had no trouble finding the palazzo, a well-kept structure near the Accademia.</p><p>The entry was up a short flight of stairs, and Tiff herself answered when Jordan used the massive ring in a brass lion\u2019s mouth to knock.</p><p>\u201cYou made it!\u201d Tiff said, pleased. She was dressed in faux leopard pants and a cashmere sweater with a fur-trimmed neckline that wasn\u2019t at all synthetic, Jordan was certain. Despite the weather, Tiff was wearing flashy sandals that clicked on the marble of her palazzo\u2019s entry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d Tiff said, leading her in, \u201cThis is nothing so fine as the contessa\u2019s ancestral home or whatever, but it\u2019s really quite adorable.\u201d</p><p>Jordan looked around with interest as Tiff took her coat The foyer was small and cozy; the steps leading upward were narrow and winding, but the banister was really beautiful, marble with a blue tinge, and the steps themselves were covered in a plush, navy blue carpeting that made them seem warm and welcoming.</p><p>\u201cThis place was built during the Renaissance and it\u2019s still in the same family. The owner is a hoot. He said that they were the nobility of the lira! No titles in the family, but they made a mint importing and exporting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great?I like it much better than the contessa\u2019s,\u201d Jordan assured her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s?cozier. But then,\u201d Tiff said with humor, \u201cyou\u2019d like it better than the contessa\u2019s place if I\u2019d rented a barn. Is there such a thing as a barn in Venice?\u201d Tiff didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019d stay in a barn just to be here; thankfully, I don\u2019t have to. Come on up, come on up! I ordered in Bellinis or whatever you call them from Harry\u2019s Bar?you have been there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jordan loved the fabled Venetian establishment, once beloved of Hemingway. The prices were high, but the food was excellent. \u201cJared entertains at Harry\u2019s a great deal,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, he would, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d Tiff said. \u201cActually, he could have told you how to get here? I rented this through your cousin and made all the arrangements for my stay through him. He\u2019s really quite good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I rather like him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wife is a sweetie, too. I should have invited them as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad. They\u2019re sleeping in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get to know you better anyway. Come up, come up, we\u2019re all set up on the patio on the second level.\u201d</p><p>Jordan followed Tiff up the stairs.</p><p>The landing on the second floor was large, with hallways going off to the left and right while directly in front there was a large expanse of marble flooring that led to columns, and beyond them, a plate glass window with a double doorway leading to a terrace that directly overlooked a charming canal.</p><p>\u201cThere are heat lamps out here; it will be warm enough,\u201d Tiff assured her, leading the way.</p><p>Jordan was barely seated with a famed Venetian Bellini in hand when Tiff leaned on the table across from her. \u201cOkay, so I don\u2019t mean to be rude or crude or anything, but just what exactly is the sad history behind your being so sensitive to things of a frightening nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sensitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fianc\u00e9 was killed.\u201d</p><p>Jordan sighed. \u201cTiff, I\u2019m completely sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are!\u201d Tiff sounded almost angry, as if it would be ridiculous for anyone to think anything else. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m so, so sorry! How terrible. He was a cop, right, killed in the line of duty? Hunting down some terrible murderers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently, you have the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have the story through one of the girls at the art shop. And she, I believe, got what she knows through Cindy. Not a long line of gossip, but you do know how things change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have it basically right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still mourning this poor fellow? They probably shouldn\u2019t have brought you here. I\u2019m sure they thought Venice! Carnevale! Such fun, that will take her mind off things. And, of course, there are masks worn everywhere and an abundance of handsome young men, only a few of whom don\u2019t speak English. Hm. Maybe the not speaking English would make a man more appealing.\u201d Tiff laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cMore Bellini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks. This is a bit early for me, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, these are just sissy drinks. And we\u2019re not driving anywhere! Oh, well, bottoms up, even if I\u2019m drinking on my own.\u201d</p><p>Tiff finished her drink and poured another. \u201cSo? are you still in mourning, and perhaps, just perhaps, a bit oversensitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him a great deal.\u201d She paused, eager to change the subject \u201cYou\u2019ve been widowed, I\u2019ve heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral times,\u201d Tiff said. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. As to Steven ... I miss him, still. I really loved him. But he\u2019s gone, and I know it. And I like going to parties; I enjoy meeting people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you last night, with Ragnor. You were beautiful together. I was jealous as all hell. Of course, he is a little young for me, but what the hell? I\u2019ve always married old men, a younger fellow would be such a novelty!\u201d</p><p>Jordan lifted her hands. \u201cGo for it then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but he\u2019s not interested in me. I watched him last night. He was watching you all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even see him when I first arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was there. Watching you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan wasn\u2019t sure whether Tiff\u2019s observation disturbed her...</p><p>Or excited her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cTiff, you\u2019re most welcome to pursue him with all vigor. He was quite rude to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRude?\u201d Tiff said, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cRude. He told me that I should go home, that... I don\u2019t know. That I caused trouble, or stirred trouble</p><p>... that I could be putting myself in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanger!\u201d Tiff sounded delighted. \u201cHow ... beguiling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in Ragnor,\u201d Jordan said. She hesitated. She was lying. She was interested. Because he angered her.</p><p>That much was true ...</p><p>But last night...</p><p>She felt an uneasy surge of warmth again. Last night, as they\u2019d watched the acrobatic dancers, she\u2019d felt... a stirring. That term was an understatement She\u2019d felt as hot as blue Sterno flame, dying to touch and be touched, as she hadn\u2019t felt since ...</p><p>\u201cTiff, you must know what it\u2019s like when you lose someone: you learn to live with it and go on, but you never really get over the sudden loss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had a sudden loss,\u201d Tiff said, helping herself to smoked fish. \u201cIn feet, I\u2019m afraid, my last loss took for longer than I planned. But that, of course, makes me quite proud. I did marry an old fellow for his money?don\u2019t pass that honesty around to the rest of his heirs!?but the doctors had only given him six months to live. Thanks to me, he was a happy old cuss for almost a year and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is?quite commendable, \u201dJordan said, forced to smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I thought so,\u201d Tiff said proudly. \u201cBut now ... let\u2019s get back to Ragnor. You know what I think?\u201d Jordan lifted her shoulders and arched her brows, waiting. She knew that Tiff needed no encouragement to go on.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s incognito here, that he\u2019s in some kind of hiding,\u201d Tiff said.</p><p>\u201cIn hiding? He walks around in the open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no one really knows anything about him. He only showed up in Venice a while ago, although apparently, he\u2019s got lots of business dealings with some of the American businessmen who\u2019ve been putting money into \u201drestore Venice\u201c funds and the like. He is popular with all the right people?except for the contessa, of course. I think he may be underworld.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s even Italian,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no ... but there are crime families all over Europe. Maybe he got into something horrible as a youth, maybe he is a criminal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should both stay away from him, \u201dJordan said.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, no! That makes him all the more fascinating. Along with the feet that he seems really and totally repelled by the contessa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be his one really admirable aspect,\u201d Jordan said dryly.</p><p>Tiff shrugged. \u201cWell, no, I have to admit that I do love the nobility thing. I\u2019m dying to get to know her better as well. Don\u2019t worry?I\u2019ll never invite you at the same time. Actually, I wish she\u2019d invite me back to her palazzo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordan decided not to mention the fact that the contessa had insisted she must come by again. \u201cTo use an American expression, Tiff, I\u2019m afraid that I consider the contessa to be an absolute ... slime bucket!\u201d Tiff laughed, pleased as punch again.</p><p>\u201cWell, you tend to be so honest?I thought that I\u2019d be honest, too,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>Tiff smiled and went on. \u201cBack to Ragnor?if I\u2019m able to talk to him, and invite him over, may I use you as bait?\u201d</p> <p>The term Tiff used disturbed Jordan. \u201cBait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I\u2019m able to say I\u2019m having a dinner?or a lunch, breakfast, or even drinks?and that you\u2019re coming, I can at least get him here, to my lair, you know.

May I use your name in my pursuit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Thank you. I mean, I\u2019ll be careful?I won\u2019t plan anything too close to Anna Maria\u2019s ball or anything like that. Hey, I promised you a ghost tour. Want to hear my favorite story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, I think it was during the sixteen hundreds, the youngest daughter of the house, a beauty, fell in love with the wrong fellow. Her uncle had been elected doge at the time, and this fellow was the son of a rival politician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like Romeo and Juliet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard the ending. The two fall in love, and there\u2019s a rumor that the family just won\u2019t have it Anyway, such a young man can\u2019t just disappear, so you know what happens?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe supposedly falls off the balcony and breaks his neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow terrible. So now he haunts the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Unfortunately,\u201d Tiff said with a sigh, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, of course, the daughter is certain her family caused the accident. So she decides to kill herself as well and jumps off the same balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s why you never get to see him haunting your bedroom. The two of them are haunting the place as a pair.\u201d</p><p>Tiff shook her head. \u201cNope! The daughter jumps off the balcony?but hits the canal. She means to drown, of course, but she\u2019s rescued by a young gondolier. She marries the fellow, and they move to Rome, and live happily ever after. Isn\u2019t that a happy ending?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure?except for the original young man the daughter was in love with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, there can\u2019t be a happy ending for everyone!\u201d Tiff said. \u201cThere\u2019s more; come on, we\u2019ll walk around the place and I\u2019ll give you more history.\u201d</p><p>The palazzo was beautiful, with the master bedchamber being exceptional. The original owner meant to make money renting the place. A large room had been converted into a bath with a marble Jacuzzi tub large enough to accommodate several people, a shower with multi jet sprays, plush rugs, and massive double sinks. The bedroom itself had a sitting area, a breakfast table by a window, and a huge bed covered in rich maroon silk.</p><p>\u201cSeductive, eh?\u201d Tiff said, her smile gleeful. \u201cNow ... if I can only get the young blood in here that I want to seduce ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I hope you get it,\u201d Jordan said and glanced at her watch. \u201cThanks for the breakfast, Tiff, and the tour. The place is really wonderful. It should definitely do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I hope so. I mean, I\u2019m doing all the right things. Of course, I have help here, but only every other morning. I\u2019m actually quite a fine cook, and I\u2019ve always been detailed, organized, and neat. Anal, even!\u201d she admitted with a smile.</p><p>She went downstairs with Jordan, showing her out On the streets again, Jordan was surprised to realize that she laughed each time she thought about Tiff\u2019s brash honesty. Tiff was indeed something.</p><p>She\u2019d enjoyed the morning, and walking back, she felt again just how much she loved Venice.</p><p>The city was uniquely charming.</p><p>And by day, there were no shadows.</p><p>Ragnor sat at an outside table in St. Mark\u2019s Square, watching.</p><p>The day was cool, and last night\u2019s snow had vanished as if it had never been. The sun was out, the bandstand was quiet for the moment, and he had a good view of the people coming and going from the Square.</p><p>As the day was bright, he wasn\u2019t the only person wearing dark glasses. He\u2019d always been fond of shades anyway, ever since he\u2019d gotten his first pair. They were great when you wished to see, but didn\u2019t want your thoughts seen in return.</p><p>He\u2019d never been particularly fond of costumes and had no intention of wearing one by day. He sat in his long, black leather cape with a black turtleneck beneath it. Black boots kept his feet warm.</p><p>He was very fond of black.</p><p>It was the color of the night.</p><p>And the color of his coffee. It was good. He liked this particular cafe because they did brew large, strong cups of what they called American coffee, though he knew few Americans who drank their coffee quite so strong. Over the years, however, he\u2019d acquired a taste for heavy, rich roasts, and this place brewed them well.</p><p>It was also an excellent vantage point. He could see from the Basilica to the newest part of the Square, the length erected by order of Napoleon Bonaparte, and gazing in the opposite direction, he could see those coming and going from St. Mark\u2019s and the Campanile, and even coming in from the pillars on the canal.</p><p>There were jugglers performing, and dotting the area, everywhere, were makeup artists, bartering for the privilege of securing clientele. Children loved the work; butterflies drawn on cheeks in vivid color, cat faces, kiss faces, diamonds, glitter, and sparkles. Adults weighed the value of makeup versus a mask.</p><p>The pigeons were everywhere. Vendors sold little bags of corn to be thrown to the birds, heedless of the fact that they tended to inhabit the Square for whatever tidbits of food could be found.</p><p>It was an interesting place for people-watching. As always, during Carnevale, those who were especially stunning, odd, or unusual paraded around in their costumes, posing by the pillars, faces bland as they met camera after camera. There were those who came only to watch, who oohed and aahed over a performer, then over a costume, then over a sparkling display in a shop window.</p><p>He shifted, sipped his coffee, and leaned back, certain, if he waited long enough, he would be able to accost Nari. She would pretend, of course, that she seldom wandered into the streets. Especially by day.</p><p>He knew her better.</p><p>An American woman started screeching near him; he smiled, watching her. She and her husband had been attracting pigeons for their two young sons.</p><p>The pigeons had done what pigeons often do?on her arm.</p><p>Her husband did his best, running around, grabbing napkins.</p><p>Then he saw her.</p><p>Nari was across the road in a long dress, sweeping cape, and theatrical mask. He cast a pile of lire on the table and took off in pursuit.</p><p>She reached the walkway to the streets beyond the Square. He followed, making his way through the crowd. He walked down a length of shops, around the corner of a restaurant, closing in on her.</p><p>Back on a narrow canal, he nearly reached her. Then, suddenly, someone ran straight into him.</p><p>Searching the crowd over the woman\u2019s head, he caught her shoulders, apologizing swiftly.</p><p>\u201cRagnor! Hello, ciao! It\u2019s me, Tiff Henley, fancy running into you.\u201d He stared down into the woman\u2019s face, trying to remember her. Yes, Tiffany Henley, the very rich American, well-kept, attractive, widow of a man three times her age, a powder puff blond but not at all stupid. She\u2019d used her assets and gotten where she\u2019d wanted to go.</p><p>\u201cYes, Tiff, hello, how are you?\u201d</p><p>He looked beyond her, his temper rising.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased to run into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have collided, and I am awfully sorry, I\u2019ve got to run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But I would love to have you over for drinks tomorrow, before Anna Maria\u2019s ball?you are going, of course.\u201d</p><p>He barely heard her?he was still searching through the crowd ahead of him. Her hands were on his chest, stopping him from moving forward. He was tempted to shove her aside. There were crowds all around them. Seething at the interruption, he forced himself to hold his temper, and his anxiety, in check.</p><p>\u201cTiff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe American girl will be there.\u201d</p><p>Distracted, he looked down at Tiff. \u201cThe American girl?\u201d He knew exactly whom she meant, and also that she had meant to distract him.</p><p>\u201cJordan Riley. And her family ... a few others.\u201d</p><p>Watching Tiff, he was certain that she was making up her guest list as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWill you come? Truly, I\u2019d love to have you.\u201d She was still determinedly touching him, stopping him from moving on. \u201cI mean, of course, you\u2019re welcome to come by any time at all. The palazzo is really quite charming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, do come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, I\u2019ll try, but if you\u2019ll excuse me ...\u201d He kept staring over her head. He meant to find Nari.</p><p>He was going to have to find her.</p><p>Dusk was closing in again.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Though Jordan had intended to head straight back to the hotel, she found herself wandering instead, and looking into shop windows. She found a place with beautiful leather goods and bought a jacket that just happened to fit her perfectly.</p><p>On a roll, she found a pair of knee-high low-heeled boots in five and a half?an amazing find. Both shopkeepers were happy to have her purchases sent on to the Danieli, and so she wandered into a coffee shop for an espresso. It was while she was standing at the counter, idly noting the wood-framed mirror above the bar, that she saw the man in the dottore costume and mask?staring at her. She thought she saw the eyes within the mask?of course, she didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, he was too for away?but she knew that he was staring into the espresso bar, and that he was looking specifically at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had the strangest sensation that this was the man she had followed last night, thinking he was Jared.</p><p>She sipped the last of her espresso, reminding herself that the dottore costume was one of the most popular in Venice. There was no reason whatever to assume that she was seeing the same man.</p><p>Nevertheless, she quickly left the bar, anxious to reach the street, and confront the man.</p> <p>When she emerged, he was gone. She looked to her left. A small bridge crossed a narrow canal about a half block down. She saw the man in the black cape passing a couple in Victorian dress. She hurried that way.</p><p>Not at all sure what kept her footsteps so dogged, she followed the next passage along the canal.</p><p>Once again, ahead of her, she saw him turn the corner.</p><p>She passed by shops selling Versace, Dior, and Ralph Lauren, stores with handsome facades and fine goods within. The streets were crowded again; the party-goers of the night before had done their sleeping and were up and about, again some costumed, some not She felt bold, not crazy, and not afraid; there were still a few hours of daylight left.</p><p>No matter how fast she walked, though, he seemed to remain ahead of her, always in front of several groups of people. She quickened her pace again and turned a corner. She passed under an archway between two buildings.</p> <p>A balcony with gargoyles and stucco lions suddenly seemed familiar; she realized that she had walked this way the night before.</p><p>She paused, surveying her surroundings. As she did so, she looked ahead.</p><p>At the end of the pathway, off the busy and beaten track, there was another bridge. The black-cloaked figure stood upon it, looking back at her.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she called out. \u201cWho are you!\u201d</p><p>Apparently he didn\u2019t hear her. Once again, the man turned and started walking.</p><p>One more bridge, she decided. Then she was giving up this silly chase.</p> <p>On the next bridge, she paused. She couldn\u2019t see the man anymore. Ahead, right after the bridge, was a piazza. At the far end of it was a beautiful old church. The walls were peeling; stained glass windows were broken and covered with boards. The structure, however, was very handsome, with marble steps; stone angels guarded the double doors of the entry, and the wooden doors themselves were carved, and apparently, at one time, gilded.</p><p>Jordan forgot the cloaked figure for a moment and approached the old church. Just as she crossed the bridge, she heard someone call to her.</p><p>\u201cSignorina!\u201d</p><p>She turned. A gondola was about to slip beneath the bridge. She recognized the handsome young gondolier she had seen two days earlier.</p><p>He\u2019d said that his name was ... Sal D\u2019Onofrio, she remembered?and that she should come to him, of course, when she was ready for a gondola ride. He had sung so cheerfully the last time she had seen him near the Danieli. Now, he had no customers in his craft, and he looked grave and tired.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, looking briefly back to the church, and surveying the corners of the piazza. The cloaked figure was gone. Following him had been foolish anyway. He probably hadn\u2019t even been looking at her. It was impossible to see a man\u2019s eyes through a mask like that at a distance.</p><p>The gondolier was shaking his head. \u201cBeautiful lady, you should not be wandering here. This is not the area where there are people, not much to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? All tourists want to see what other tourists don\u2019t see!\u201d she told him.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t laugh; he didn\u2019t even smile.</p><p>He shook his head, maneuvering his pole to bring his gondola next to the low wall fronting the piazza.</p><p>\u201cVenice is wonderful. But now, you should be back with the crowds, by San Marco. You should feed the pigeons?all visitors must feed the pigeons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure where I am right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I do intend to take a gondola ride, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the best. But I was thinking more of a time near sunset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo charge, signorina. I will bring you back to the Danieli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can find my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Allow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no dock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can jump the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that legal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But please, this is not .. . this is not where people roam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had thought to explore that church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head impatiently. \u201cIt is abandoned. Not a church anymore, you understand?</p><p>Please, let me take you back.\u201d</p><p>Because he seemed so earnest, and so sincerely concerned for her, Jordan found herself relenting.</p><p>\u201cStep on the wall,\u201d Sal encouraged her.</p><p>She did so. He had perfect coordination, and amazing agility, leaning to grasp her hand, then lifting her by the waist to set her into the gondola.</p><p>She teetered a little as the gondola listed from side to side, as the water lapped at the hull. He seemed relieved when she took her seat, and then he pushed off from the wall.</p><p>The gondola shot down the canal with startling speed as he wielded his pole.</p><p>They had entered a larger body of water when he turned to her. \u201cVenice is a good place, a really good place. Little crime, but always, when you have so many people from so many places, people with money, jewelry ... there will always be criminals who want what isn\u2019t theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being concerned,\u201d she told him, studying him. She wondered suddenly if she was a total fool?if he could be among those criminals, planning to bring her down a deserted canal, lift her purse, bonk her on the head with his pole, and toss her into the water.</p><p>No. He was moving quickly, not singing, not pointing out the sights, bringing her bit by bit to more heavily traveled areas. Soon, she realized that they were back in the area behind St. Mark\u2019s Basilica. She knew these waters; they were lined with restaurants, hotels and shops.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so serious today; is something wrong?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He hesitated, but smiled, shaking his head. \u201cNo. But you must be careful. There are so many people. All people are not good. There are thieves, maybe . . . worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am very careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe more so. Please. Stay with people you know.\u201d</p><p>He was so somber that she nodded, not at all tempted to tell him that she was independent and capable.</p><p>Or that she had already been scared enough to make sure that she was doubly watchful in all that she did like following a stranger in a cloak and mask? she mocked herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be more careful, Sal, really.\u201d</p><p>About to pass beneath a bridge, she noted that Ragnor was standing on the calle to her left side; she saw him immediately because he was taller than those around them, his light hair a beacon against the black leather of the cape he was wearing.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t alone, and he hadn\u2019t noticed her, or the gondola.</p><p>She smiled slightly. Tiff had found the object of her desire. The brash American woman had halted his travels; she was speaking to him earnestly, her hands on his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d she repeated, a strange sensation tingling at her nape. Ragnor had warned her about danger in Venice. Now Sal was doing the same, while Jared\u2019s belief was that she was losing her mind.</p><p>Maybe. She was seeing a dead man\u2019s face on a mannequin. Wolves in the shadows. She was hearing the whisper of wings in the night.</p><p>She should just fly home. That would be the intelligent thing to do.</p><p>No...</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go home. Something was going on.</p><p>And though she had been afraid, she was also compelled, determined, and ...</p><p>Beguiled?</p><p>That was the term Tiff had used earlier. As to her reason for staying, it seemed to fit perfectly. She would be careful, she told herself, as she had promised Sal. And she knew for a certainty that bad things did happen. In a real world.</p><p>\u201cThe Danieli,\u201d Sal said, sliding next to the side entry of the hotel. \u201cPlease, you will not be alone?\u201d A bellman waited to assist her from the gondola. As she stood to disembark, Jordan kissed Sal\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cI promise, I\u2019ll stay close to friends. And thank you for being so sweet. You are the best gondolier.\u201d He offered her a deep smile. \u201cGrazie. Ciao, bella!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCiao, bravo,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She thanked the bellman as well and entered into the lobby of the hotel. It was busy, filled with laughter, languages, costumes, and an air of camaraderie and warmth. She surveyed the lobby for a moment, smiling slowly.</p><p>People were so beautiful.</p><p>They were having so much fun.</p><p>She felt oddly protective of Venice. If something was happening here to mar the wonder of this city, it had to be stopped.</p><p>Sal D\u2019Onofrio poled his gondola out of the narrow canal, heading around the vaporetto that waited at the dock in front of the Danieli. He passed the Square and the Doge\u2019s Palace, entering into the waters of the Grand Canal. He hadn\u2019t spoken of his discovery that morning to any of his friends, he had delivered his grisly find to Roberto Capo at the police station. And now ...</p><p>He still did not feel like singing. He was going home.</p><p>Tomorrow, after a night\u2019s sleep, he would be himself again.</p><p>Gondolas were out in masses. He passed by one of the landings. Giuseppe Donati, a friend, waved at him; he had just picked up a young couple in full costume. He waved back. Giuseppe indicated a lone costumed figure on the dock, a man seeking a gondola.</p><p>Sal waved a thank-you to his friend. He had not really intended to pick up another costumer, but it might be a good thing to help shake off his unease. He slid to the bank, forcing himself to talk cheerfully to the man in English.</p><p>\u201cAlone, signore? And you wish to ride?\u201d</p><p>The masked man nodded gravely. He hopped into the gondola, needing no assistance. He spoke in a low voice; indicating the route he wanted to take. He spoke in English, with what accent, Sal couldn\u2019t tell. It didn\u2019t matter. He was glad?he\u2019d drop this passenger near his own home, and then he\u2019d be a little richer for the night he intended to remain home.</p><p>They moved along the busy canal, watching pedestrians, shopkeepers, children, dogs and dog-walkers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They moved off the beaten path. Here and there, an old man shuffled along, headed for a bar or trattoria. A woman swathed in black hurried to a church service. A young housewife strolled with her baby in a carriage.</p><p>Another turn. They were far from the shops, into a mostly residential section of the city. Dusk was now falling. The lights that fell upon the canal were dim, coming from dwellings where fathers were returning from work, some to stay, some for a bite before returning to work to soak in the tourist dollars by night.</p><p>It was still Sal\u2019s city. Warm now in the glow of home and day-to-day living.</p> <p>Ahead was a wide bridge, one that connected two islands of houses. They were not too far now from his own.</p><p>The gondola drifted beneath the bridge.</p><p>Sal barely heard the man in the dottore costume move.</p><p>He had just started to turn, not quite hearing but sensing the whispers ...</p><p>He felt the hands on his shoulders, powerful in a vise that would soon break bone. The grip was agony, but even as he opened his mouth to scream, the noise was choked off in the sudden rampant flow of blood.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t even aware of the razor-honed piercing that seared into his neck, creating the bubble of blood in his throat...</p><p>Nari was in the center of the Square, masked, surrounded by revelers. She stood still, staring up at the sky, appreciating the dying of the day. Night... soon. She could hear the laughter around her, the talk, the languages. She could hear the music, playing at the bandstand. When she concentrated, she could hear more.</p><p>A pulse ...</p><p>Thump, thump, sweet, delicious.</p><p>Breathing...life ... essence ...</p><p>Tonight. It might be tonight. She had a plan in place, and actually, missing out on her intent here and there wasn\u2019t so bad. It was rather like a game.</p> <p>Cat and mouse. The chase creating an even sweeter scent of fear. And the taste of fear ...</p><p>She started when she felt a grasp on her arm. She glanced up in horror.</p><p>Ragnor. He had found her. Here, in the open.</p><p>\u201cIt stops,\u201d he said.</p><p>She wanted to jerk away furiously. She knew that she could not.</p><p>\u201cReally? What are you going to do with me to make it stop? Kill me?\u201d she taunted.</p><p>\u201cPut you away,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your intent anyway, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said softly. She couldn\u2019t escape him. Why not enjoy the moment She brushed her knuckles against his cheek.</p> <p>\u201cRagnor ...\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, forcing her to drop it. She smiled slowly anyway. \u201cDo you think that I ever forget?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that I ever forget?\u201d he cross-queried harshly. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Nari, that it stops. I\u2019m warning you. Threatening you, if you like. You could have everything, you have a life here, a beautiful palazzo, a title, a position. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget yourself, don\u2019t you, Ragnor? I know the legends, that you think yourself so different, but in all honesty, are you so very above us all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll? Many are living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenpecked. Locked into a world like a cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing rational and surviving. Nari, look around you? you have everything!\u201d She studied him for a moment. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have everything. But I know what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much more that you could be.\u201d</p><p>She rose on tiptoe to whisper in his ear. \u201cI like what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time. Definitely a threat. I could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could what? Break me here and now? In front of all these people? They\u2019d arrest you, throw you in jail. You could escape of course ... but then, what about your face? You couldn\u2019t just wander around all these nice people, then, could you? Damn me and you damn yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are already damned,\u201d he told her flatly.</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t!\u201d she marveled. \u201cThe truth is what is, and you know it, though, you always thought you were different.\u201d He was different She felt a spasm of hunger suddenly that was so violent she could barely contain it She wanted to touch him again. All these years ... he was still Ragnor. Solid, never faltering. Beautiful. The rugged planes of his face, the wall of his chest Old regrets died hard. Well, she had made her decisions and her choices. She had underestimated him. And now, looking into his eyes, she knew it was too late.</p><p>\u201cThere are laws?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir laws? Our laws? What laws?\u201d she taunted. \u201cThe world is in chaos, Ragnor?hadn\u2019t you noticed?</p><p>And we will prevail. Foolish fellow! Don\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that I can break you?and will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it be so very easy?\u201d she whispered softly, moving against him.</p><p>\u201cLike snapping my fingers.\u201d</p><p>She moved away. \u201cIt\u2019s that American girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar. You\u2019ve been watching that girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have an interest in the American girl, Nari, you\u2019ve created it.\u201d Nari smiled. She had at least found his weakness.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like you, you know,\u201d she informed him. \u201cShe senses that you\u2019re not... well, you\u2019re just not right at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was she among the ... select guests at your party?\u201d</p><p>Nari hesitated, then lied. \u201cCan I help it if the foolish creature stumbled into the wrong place?\u201d Was she being dishonest as well? Eventually, he would know the truth. The whole truth.</p><p>And that the girl was, indeed, select.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing here, the horror you\u2019re creating, goes far beyond the American girl. And there are ways around it.\u201d</p><p>Nari shrugged. \u201cWhy? It\u2019s estimated that there are perhaps hundreds of serial killers all around the world today. The police continue to search for a majority of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will bring the fires of hell down upon us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn you, maybe. We are the fires of hell.\u201d She suddenly softened her voice, her words damp with a sweet whisper of breath. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever ... crave . .. old times? Remember what was, how it could be</p><p>...\u201d Again, she spread her fingers over the expanse of his chest.</p><p>Again, he removed her hand. She was startled by the fury of his rejection.</p><p>\u201cWhat an ass you are. And as to the American ... I, at least, am friendly with her family. As a matter of fact... I have plans with her this evening.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened with such intensity that she was afraid he would break a bone. She felt her cheeks paling, her power draining.</p><p>\u201cIf you so much as touch her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your interest is mere concern for the benefit of mankind?\u201d Nari scoffed. \u201cIf I touch her?\u201d Nari started to laugh. \u201cOh, Ragnor!\u201d</p><p>Again, his grip tightened. She gasped with the pain, fighting, struggling to find her own sense of power.</p><p>\u201cIf you think that I\u2019m all that you have to deal with . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cRagnor, let go of me! You\u2019re hurting me,\u201d she cried out. Anyone in the crowd might have heard her.</p><p>There were carabinieri in the Square. Still, he didn\u2019t let go of her; his eyes were a blue fire as he stared at her. She felt again the deep, bitter pain of loss. And a shooting agony of raw, furious, jealousy she\u2019d thought could never touch her again .. .</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhat plans do you have? Where are you meeting her tonight?</p><p>What is it you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be at Harry\u2019s!\u201d Nari gasped out. She had to ease his grip; she couldn\u2019t afford to suffer any broken bones right now. \u201cYou\u2019d have to kill me before I\u2019d say more now. Yet if you kill me, you\u2019ll never know, you\u2019ll hunt forever, and your precious little midget of an American would be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try that, Nari. I told you that this all stops. It has nothing to do with one person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She relaxed into his hold. \u201cBecause if you hurt me now, I\u2019ll enjoy her myself! Every last... lick.\u201d His grip had eased; he stared down at her, eyes still the greatest threat he offered. \u201cAll right, Nari, tell me what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. She forced herself from her fascination with simply being so close after so many years. Once he\u2019d been hers. Raw, lithe, supple, naked, moving. Raked with scars, torn with conflict, passionate and hungry, like lightning in the night. . .</p><p>No. That time was gone. And she could give nothing away, he was destined to pay for being what he was. Bitterly, bitterly, she forced herself to remember only vengeance. Only life, as she knew it. The life she could have. Wild, free, abandoned, savage?a life with freedom to ease the torment inside her, fill the hunger ...</p><p>She cursed him suddenly. She\u2019d hit his weakness. He was worrying about the American girl. Well, he\u2018d best worry, because he didn\u2019t begin to understand the complexity of what was happening here.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Ragnor. You\u2019d best worry about her. Because guess what? You\u2019re both going to die!\u201d She saw the anger that tightened his features. Now, here, in the Square? she had to escape him. Had to move, before he touched her again. She had been reckless; she had come so close to ruining everything. She had put him on guard. . .</p><p>He would touch her again. And she couldn\u2019t allow it She found her strength. Stepping back, she turned into the crowd. She felt him reaching for her, felt the power exuding from him just a breath away. But there were so many people here. And she had her own strengths. Amid a jungle of capes, she disappeared into the coming night.</p><p>Her plans for the evening were ruined. And yet...</p><p>He couldn\u2019t follow her. He couldn\u2019t risk it. He had threatened her, but she had warned him. And he did have his weaknesses, no matter how he denied it.</p><p>Now, he\u2019d be afraid.</p><p>And always, he\u2019d have to be on guard.</p><p>And while the cat was very, very busy, the mouse could play ...</p><p>Upstairs in her room Jordan found a note from Cindy, slid under the door.</p><p>Hey, kid!</p><p>Where are you? Silly question, if you\u2018re reading this now, you\u2019re in this mom! Missed you today; we\u2019re meeting at Harry\u2019s at 8:00? please be there, or call, or I\u2019ll be too worried to pig out on my favorite pasta! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Love, Cindy</p><p>Smiling, Jordan set the note aside. Harry\u2019s was a short walk past the Doge\u2019s Palace and along the waterway. Crowded?very crowded at night. She liked Harry\u2019s and was in a mood for the crowd that would be there. The bar was always busy, and during Carnevale, she was certain that the wait would be very long, except that Jared would have made reservations, and he knew the people there well. She looked forward to a nice night with her cousin and his wife.</p><p>She glanced at her watch; she had plenty of time.</p> <p>Walking into her bathroom, she filled the tub and added scented bath oil, making sure that the water was very hot Stripping down and slipping into a bathrobe, she called room service for a pot of hot tea.</p><p>She threw open the window as she waited, looking out to the bustling calle and canal. Venice was already coming alive for the night. Turning back into the room, she switched on her television and attempted to watch the news in Italian, trying to find out if there was anything going on in the city that might have upset Sal so much.</p><p>She saw a weather map and nothing more. A knock sounded on her door. She absently bade, \u201cCome in!\u201d</p><p>A cheerful waiter arrived with her tea. The tray was adorned with little cookies as well. She thanked the room service man, signed her bill, and made certain to lock her door when he left.</p><p>Cup of tea in hand, she went into the bathroom and slipped into the tub. She closed her eyes. The water was hot and wonderful. She thought about rising to look through the vampire book once again.</p> <p>Why?</p><p>It would just get her going again. Tomorrow, with luck, Federal Express would find her and she\u2019d have another book on the subject. Eyes closed, steam misting around her, she relaxed. No costumes tonight.</p><p>She was going to wear the wicked new heels she\u2019d gotten in Charleston just before leaving, and the backless black cocktail dress. She was going to get a little buzzed, maybe. And like Cindy, pig out on pasta.</p><p>She was so relaxed that she didn\u2019t know what suddenly startled her.</p><p>She sat up in the tub, frowning, looking around, wondering what had so suddenly drawn her from her comfortable introspection.</p><p>Jordan listened.</p> <p>Nothing ...</p><p>She rose from the tub anyway, grabbing her robe. Leaving the bathroom, she walked into the bedroom and saw instantly that she had left the window open. The cool night air was drifting in, battling with the heater. Wind and whispers seemed to stir around her face and hair, chilling her.</p><p>She closed the window.</p><p>She was still cold.</p><p>Jordan gave herself a shake, walking around the room. She looked into the closet, then under the bed, and then felt like a fool. There was no one in the room. Yet she still felt the same sense of unease.</p><p>The bath was ruined.</p><p>She was definitely not getting back into it.</p><p>Nor did she feel comfortable in her room. She was suddenly eager to leave.</p> <p>Too early to meet Jared and Cindy.</p><p>But never too early to take a walk over to Harry\u2019s and buy herself a drink.</p><p>She dressed quickly, barely touching up her makeup and brushing her hair with no more than a lick and a promise.</p><p>When the knocker sounded, Tiff was upstairs. Feeling pleased, she\u2019d filled the Jacuzzi tub with scented crystals, and sank in. She hadn\u2019t been expecting anyone, and she considered staying in the tub. She was wonderfully relaxed. And the idea of getting up, toweling off, walking down the stairs and answering the door to just anybody was not pleasing.</p><p>The brass knocker sounded again.</p><p>It occurred to Tiff that it might just be him. Her latest obsession.</p><p>He\u2019d been cordial enough in the street, even if he had seemed to be in a hurry.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe ...</p><p>She jumped out of the tub and grabbed her robe. Since it was silk, it clung to her warm, damp flesh.</p><p>Maybe that wasn\u2019t a bad thing. She still had a nice enough figure. Well, all right, it wasn\u2019t exactly hers ...</p><p>well, yes, it was. She\u2019d paid for it; it was hers!</p><p>So thinking, she pulled the towel from her hair, shook it out, and went hurrying down the stairs.</p><p>Thank God for the plush carpet lining! Her damp feet would have gone sliding right off marble! She could have slid down the stairs, her obsession leading straight to her demise! Broken bones, broken neck, what a way to go!</p><p>\u201cHold your shorts on!\u201d she called, rocketing to the door.</p><p>She should have looked out the little peephole, put in by the current owner, but by the time she reached the door, she was in far too much of a hurry.</p><p>She threw open the door... to a woman of medium height in costume, mask, and sweeping long cloak.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Tiff said, noting instantly that the clothing worn was expensive, that the mask was exquisite, lined with crystal, probably Swarovski.</p><p>\u201cTiff?\u201d</p><p>She recognized the rich, cultured, slightly accented voice, even though her name had been the only word spoken.</p><p>\u201cContessa?\u201d she said, too surprised to hide her incredulity.</p><p>\u201cI was in the neighborhood. I heard you had taken this palazzo. It\u2019s so rude of me to come without warning, yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Tiff said quickly, stepping aside. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were expecting someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ...\u201d She laughed a little nervously. \u201cI guess I was a little anxious. I wanted to reach the door before the knocking stopped. I\u2019m so glad I reached the door before you went away.\u201d The contessa smiled slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou must forgive my appearance,\u201d Tiff said. She shouldn\u2019t have gushed so much.</p><p>\u201cBut you are busy,\u201d the contessa said, indicating Tiff\u2019s robe and damp hair.</p><p>\u201cI was pruning, ready to go out. Please, please, come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2018 t stay long.\u201d The contessa stepped into the foyer, allowing her cowl to fell, and sliding off her mask.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me take that for you,\u201d Tiff said, very carefully setting the mask on the carved oak stand by the door. \u201cAnd your cape ...\u201d</p><p>The contessa surrendered her cape, and looked around the palazzo. \u201cQuite nice. I\u2019ve actually been here before .. . years ago. The work they\u2019ve done is lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very comfortable. Far better than a hotel, though there are many lovely hotels here,\u201d Tiff said. She was trying not to babble. Here was the contessa, visiting her. This was almost as exciting as a visit from the man she had hoped to see. Of course, she was standing there in a robe, her hair damp, clinging to her face. She was hardly dressed for a contessa.</p><p>\u201cIf you give me just a minute, I can find something?\u201d</p><p>The contessa waved her hand, her beautiful, ageless features curling into a smile. \u201cNo, no, do nothing!</p><p>I\u2019ll be but a few minutes, and you can sink back into your tub. I would leave very unhappy if I ruined your bath!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll get some wine. We\u2019ll sit upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed wine, please. May I wander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. The bar is upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>Still feeling awkward, stunned, and complimented beyond all measure, Tiff started up the stairs. The contessa followed her. But as Tiff went to the wine cabinet, the contessa did indeed wander. With two glasses of her very best wine poured, Tiff looked around and did not see the contessa. \u201cContessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here!\u201d</p><p>She had gone into the master bedroom. She turned as Tiff came into the room, smiling and accepted a glass of wine. \u201cMagnifico!\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done beautiful work. The room where the bath is now was a dowdy, closed-in place. Now ... what a lovely ... lair.\u201d Tiff flushed, wondering if the contessa could be aware of her reasons for wanting such a sumptuous suite.</p><p>\u201cI admit, I enjoy creature comforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething we share,\u201d the contessa said. She wandered to the long windows, which were open to the terrace beyond. \u201cQuite wonderful. And this is my favorite time of day. When the colors of sunset fade away, day is gone, and night is with us! With all its shadows and secrets!\u201d Standing there, she looked almost as if she were in rapture. Tiff walked over to the grand, silk-covered bed and sat, watching her.</p><p>\u201cSo much time is wasted sleeping,\u201d the contessa said. She walked over to where Tiff sat and sank down beside her, swallowing her wine. \u201cFruity, yet dry, rich and bold. A fine choice, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I get you some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, just sit! Let me enjoy your company. I take my time when I savor a new taste,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cSo! You fascinate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fascinate you?\u201d Tiff said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I truly admire a woman such as you. It\u2019s a difficult world. Too many men, far too often, for too many years, have preyed upon women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! Think about it. The businessman with a young secretary who needs his approval to advance? The aging executive has an affair with the sweet, young thing while his trod-upon wife sits at home and can do little since her own life and livelihood depend on him. Movie stars ready to decay find young starlets for wives. While you, my smart and lovely and more mature woman, turned the tables. Here you are?a woman of substance! You needn\u2019t bow to anyone because you are your own master. And now, while you are still relatively young, you have the ways and means to do what you will, with whom you like!\u201d Tiff had to smile. \u201cWell, there are those, including a few of my stepchildren, who have tended to think of me as a money-grubbing bitch. And I\u2019m not so terribly young, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d She hadn\u2019t realized that she\u2019d twisted, exposing the length of her legs, as she\u2019d turned to the contessa on the bed so that they could converse. Now, she noticed the contessa looking at her exposed flesh. She felt the warmest flush envelop her. She started to close her robe, but the contessa\u2019s hand landed on her knee before she could do so.</p><p>\u201cYoung enough. Look how beautiful you are! You\u2019ve kept yourself up, another point I admire very much.\u201d</p><p>The contessa\u2019s long fingers, covered with jewels, moved over Tiff\u2019s knee, slightly down her calf, slightly up her inner thigh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tiff didn\u2019t embarrass easily, but it seemed that her blood flooded her limbs, and she felt as hot as if it steamed. She should move, withdraw ...</p><p>But now the contessa\u2019s eyes were on her, deep, languorous, sensual. Tiff found that she couldn\u2019t move; she could only stare into the contessa\u2019s eyes. The contessa smiled slowly as her fingers kept moving.</p><p>\u201cTell me, bella,\u201d she said, her voice a soft whisper that seemed to caress, \u201chave you ever been with a woman?\u201d</p> <p>She should have said something witty, something in the way of denial for what was happening now, but all that came to Tiff\u2019s lips was one word, barely breathed out, \u201cNo.\u201d The contessa shrugged, her supple fingers still just stroking. \u201cNeither had I been for many years.. .many, many years. But when I discovered that men were deceitful ... when they played about as they would ...</p><p>that it was possible to seduce beautiful young things myself. And I learned that women could be seductive, appealing ... so appetizing.\u201d</p><p>Tiff managed to swallow. No, she\u2019d never been with a woman, but. ..</p><p>\u201cPoor Tiff! So many years with old men desperately seeking their own pleasure! Oh, the things you must have done to bring them to the point of ... possibility!\u201d</p><p>The contessa seemed able to read her mind. Even as she spoke, Tiff felt the most ungodly surge of desire sweeping through her! God, yes! The things she\u2019d done, the patience she had needed, the pleasure she had brought . . . while finding no satisfaction herself.</p> <p>\u201cI can show you pleasure,\u201d the contessa whispered.</p><p>Her lips seemed to be so much closer. Her words, her whispers, were like swathes of silk, sweeping over and around Tiff.</p><p>She wanted the contessa to do more. So much more. Bring those artful fingers higher and higher and higher, touch the intimate place that now seemed to be throbbing, crying out to be touched.</p><p>\u201cAllow me ...\u201d</p><p>The contessa\u2019s hands were on her shoulder, a touch so delicate, and yet so forceful. Tiff fell back, the silk robe completely open, the belt lost somewhere, her legs splayed.</p><p>The contessa was still over her. Her fingers now stroked Tiff\u2019s throat and moved slowly down her torso.</p> <p>\u201cSuch beautiful breasts ...\u201d The contessa\u2019s words were now no more than air, warm air that stirred and excited her until Tiff could barely stand it.</p><p>She\u2019d never been with a woman ....</p><p>Why not?</p><p>This wasn\u2019t just any woman; this was the contessa . . .</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t stop now if she wanted. Those delicate, ring-laden fingers were on her breasts, tracing the tiny patterns of veins in them. Tiff\u2019s legs were spread. She felt liquid, unable to move.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, beautiful ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLifted and enhanced,\u201d Tiff heard herself say.</p><p>The contessa\u2019s laughter was like the soft tinkle of bells. Tiff felt the wetness of her mouth. Tiny licks, like little drops of pure fire, darting as swiftly as the tongue of the snake, doing things as deliciously wicked . ..</p> <p>The contessa\u2019s caress lowered against her. If she could have moved, Tiff would have seized the woman\u2019s head, and dragged it swiftly down between her thighs. She ached, throbbed, she could feel herself swelling ...</p><p>Licks . . . traced her veins, touched her abdomen, trickled along her inner thigh, landed. Tiff nearly shot through the roof. Lord ... what a climax! She was faint, she nearly blacked out. Dear God, but the codgers she had married had been ... worthless. This was what the French called le petit mort. So good, it was like dying . . .</p><p>She\u2019d never, ever, experienced anything like this, she hadn\u2019t believed it existed. She was drifting in the pleasure, her mind stunned, yet her thoughts racing, and the contessa didn\u2019t just leave it at that, she was moving lower, against her thighs, a slight stab of pain, the greatest pleasure, and again, the world fading in the ecstacy, the little death of the French ...</p><p>Nari dined slowly, taking her time.</p><p>When she was sated, she sat back, surveying the shock white body of the woman on the bed.</p><p>Amused, she stood, still surveying the remains.</p><p>There was one woman who had died happy. There were so many excellent ways to enjoy the richness of a good meal. The veins at the throat were fine, but those in the thigh could be punctured in a way that let the blood flow smoothly.</p><p>She smoothed back Tiff\u2019s hair, fondly surveying the body that had provided such pleasure. She laughed aloud then, remembering Tiff\u2019s eagerness to greet her. \u201cPoor Tiffany ... you did rush down to your own demise, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She stretched, elated, as pleased as an alley cat that had just consumed an entire bowl of milk with no interruption, and without having to share a lick.</p><p>She walked to the window and looked out at the darkness that now shadowed the night. She felt completely invigorated, powerful, wonderful.</p><p>After such a delicious meal, Nari was surprised to feel a taste of bile rising in her throat. She clenched her teeth, hating him. She had come here because ...</p><p>He\u2019d left, her. . . hungry, so hungry, but hungry in a way that she couldn\u2019t fill, no matter how sated she should have been, no matter how sweet the seduction of her prey . . .</p><p>She looked back at Tiff. Something now, must be done with the remains. What a bother.</p><p>She looked back to the street, frowning. The carabinieri were out in large numbers, she noticed. Why?</p><p>For a moment, she thought that he might be angry. Such a feast should have been shared. And perhaps she had not chosen the right victim ...</p><p>He had his own agenda.</p><p>She tossed her head. Well, there were times when he forgot just who she was.</p><p>And now ...</p><p>Now, tonight, she felt a terrible gnawing inside. Bitterness, hatred, vengeance. Well, she was moving toward her goal. And she was filled; she surely felt her own power.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t felt quite so deliriously strong in a very long time ...</p><p>She closed the window.</p><p>The night was young.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Harry\u2019s was busy, as always. Jam-packed.</p><p>People waited for tables, stood by the bar, huddled in the doorway.</p><p>Just within the door, Jordan hesitated. There was nowhere to sit, nowhere to go. She contemplated slipping back out and waiting outside, forgoing her drink, but the night was turning fairly raw. She hadn\u2019t wanted to stay in her room, but she didn\u2019t particularly want to stand outside shivering, either.</p><p>Even as she stood feeling a little lost and forlorn, she saw one of the doormen hurrying her way. She smiled, assuming he was bearing down on her to take her coat Then she realized he was rushing to greet someone who had just come in behind her.</p><p>\u201cSignore, welcome back.\u201d</p><p>She felt a hand on her shoulder. She started; as she turned, she saw that it was Ragnor, and that he was greeting the doorman. \u201cBuona sera! The lady and I were hoping to have a drink,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>Though he was speaking pleasantly to the doorman, Jordan saw that he was watching a couple at the far end of the bar. The couple rose, leaving an empty space.</p><p>\u201cCome, come!\u201d the doorman said.</p><p>Jordan looked around, ready to refuse if there were people who had come in ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cCome, come,\u201d the doorman insisted, ushering them along the bar. \u201cTables for the others are almost ready.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, he had taken their coats, and she was seated on a bar stool. The bartender was instantly before them. She decided on a good old Southern Jack and Seven. Ragnor ordered Dewars on the rocks.</p><p>She swirled the swizzle stick in her drink, then turned to find that he was watching her.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear out the bar.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPeople left; others are ready for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConveniently so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the doorman and the bartender, but don\u2019t worry, I respect a queue. There just happened to be an opening here. What did you think I might have done? Sleight of hand? Mind-controlling darts?\u201d He appeared amused. She felt a little ridiculous, and therefore, angry. And defensive.</p><p>\u201cWere you following me?\u201d she asked curtly. He had been so close behind her.</p><p>His answer took a moment. She felt the assessment of his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ve got quite a bit of ego wrapped up in such a small package.\u201d</p><p>She felt her cheeks burn. \u201cI was assuming you meant to tell me again to leave Venice.\u201d She stared ahead at the bar, turning her swizzle stick once again. She was aware that he kept watching her, also aware that her black cocktail dress was form-hugging and close to risqu\u00e9. She was also aware that he was well dressed, his clothing was handsomely tailored. He had great hands, she noted as she had before. One rested against his drink, powerful there, the fingers long and tapered. He\u2019d make it in a barbarian movie, just as he wore Armani with a smooth and cultivated flair.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving Venice?\u201d he asked. He sat facing her on his stool. She felt the brush of his knees.</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t get on a plane and go right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She thought he would argue. He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I stay? How kind of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the Danieli?\u201d he asked, his tone casual.</p><p>\u201cFine. Have you stayed there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not in a while. I wonder if it\u2019s changed. Maybe I\u2019ll walk you back and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have coffee or drinks in the lobby anytime,\u201d she told him.</p><p>A slight smile curved his lips. \u201cYou won\u2019t allow me to walk you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting my cousin and his wife here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Anna Maria, Raphael and Lynn, so it appears,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>From where he sat, facing her, he could see the door. She swirled around and saw that Jared and Cindy had arrived and that they were accompanied by the others.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s bright eyes widened as he saw Jordan. \u201cDarling!\u201d He made a typically dramatic stride through the milling cocktail crowd to reach her. He kissed her on both cheeks, took her hands, and guided her down from the stool to turn her around before him as he admired her dress. \u201cSimply scrumptious!\u201d he said. \u201cDelizioso! Ragnor, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d Ragnor murmured. He rose from his bar stool as well, stretching out an arm as Anna Maria approached them, her smile broad. Lynn followed, delighted, and a round of double-cheeked kissing went around as everyone greeted everyone. Cindy seemed pleased to welcome Ragnor; only Jared appeared to be a little stiff. He spoke politely, and made no protest when Anna Maria suggested that Ragnor must join them for dinner. Jared seemed leery of the stranger among them, and curious?even suspicious?when his eyes met Jordan\u2019s.</p><p>She shrugged, trying to assure her cousin that she hadn\u2019t invited or encouraged the man to join them.</p><p>The doorman came, telling them that their table was ready. Jordan found Ragnor\u2019s hand on her back, guiding her through the crowd into one of the dining rooms. With his fingers against her naked back, she had to admit, again, that he had an effect on her. Like fire. An uncomfortable effect. At the bar, she had felt the urge to lean in against him, to feel the fabric of his suit against her cheek, to breathe in the clean, intoxicating scent of his shaven cheeks. Now, as she had last night, watching the dancers, she felt an intoxicating sensuality in proximity. Lynn would say that she wanted to jump his bones. She wouldn\u2019t be quite so crude?or honest But her mind strayed during the simple act of walking from bar to table. His hands were unbelievably masculine. She wondered what it would be like to feel them moving along her arms.</p> <p>And other places.</p><p>She wondered if his chest was as broad and compelling when naked.</p><p>She wondered what it would feel like if she were naked too, rubbing against the length of him. And if his chest was bare, his hips would be bare, and then she found herself wondering if he was powerful and lithe and large throughout...</p><p>He pulled out a chair for her at the table. She sat. Her face was lobster tinted, she was certain. From head to toe she felt a crimson flush. She wasn\u2019t even breathing normally.</p><p>Maybe he would sit somewhere else, other than beside her!</p> <p>He didn\u2019t. He took the chair at her left. Lynn was already seated at her right A waiter set her half-finished drink in front of her. She reached for it, taking a long swallow. Menus appeared and Lynn reached over, pointing at items, telling her what she thought was especially good. She responded, nodding, saving something, she wasn\u2019t sure exactly what Jared and Anna Maria were discussing a number of the people Jared had booked for her ball the following night; the seating had already been planned, there were several hundred guests coming, but it seemed that Anna Maria wanted to know more about those coming, so as to put people with similar interests together.</p><p>\u201cSo?where were you off to today?\u201d Cindy suddenly asked Jordan.</p><p>\u201cI went to have coffee with Tiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the palazzo marvelous?\u201d Raphael asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marble in the foyer is supposed to have been salvaged from the ruins of a Roman palace,\u201d Anna Maria told her.</p> <p>\u201cYou had coffee all day?\u201d Jared asked. The question sounded a little grating to Jordan, and she wasn\u2019t pleased to realize that now everyone at the table was looking at her, as if they all waited for an answer.</p><p>\u201cI had coffee, I shopped, I wandered,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might come by the shop,\u201d Lynn said.</p><p>\u201cI knew you all would be very busy,\u201d Jordan told her.</p><p>\u201cTiff is something, eh?\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cIn actuality, a very highly paid prostitute,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d Cindy remonstrated.</p><p>\u201cWell! She marries old rich men for their money. Isn\u2019t that kind of the same thing?\u201d Jared queried.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about old and middle-aged men who discard their wives of thirty years or so to go after shapely young things?\u201d Jordan said in defense of her friend. \u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about Mrs. Tiffany Henley, Ragnor?\u201d Cindy asked.</p><p>Ragnor arched a brow. \u201cI suppose we all have our priorities. She is blunt, beyond a doubt.\u201d Lynn giggled. \u201cShe has much more to say about you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cShe is fine; a bit much sometimes, but polite,\u201d Ragnor said with a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know her very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you with her this afternoon,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>His eyes suddenly turned full force on her.</p><p>\u201cOh? And where did you see me from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA canal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing in the canal?\u201d Cindy asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in the canal. I was in a gondola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took a gondola ride all by yourself?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Again, she felt that he was asking questions like a disapproving parent.</p><p>\u201cAre gondolas supposed to be dangerous?\u201d she asked lightly.</p><p>\u201cA gondola should be shared with a lover,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cActually, I wound up on the gondola because of you,\u201d Jordan told Jared, wishing that she weren\u2019t so aware of Ragnor\u2019s eyes, always seeming to be on her.</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. I thought that I was following you home last night?but of course, it wasn\u2019t you. It was another man dressed in a dottore costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a man?\u201d Ragnor asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with you taking a gondola ride today because of me?\u201d Jared asked, baffled.</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw the man again. I followed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou followed a stranger in a dottore costume?\u201d Anna Maria queried.</p><p>\u201cThat was an idiotic thing to do,\u201d Jared said harshly.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is in costume, Jared,\u201d Jordan said coolly. \u201cAnd people follow people in costumes all day, snapping pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did this man in the costume lead to the gondola?\u201d Anna Maria asked quickly, trying to ease the tension.</p><p>\u201cI saw a friend. And he gave me a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait. What friend do you have who is a gondolier?\u201d Jared demanded.</p><p>\u201cJared, you have lots of friends I don\u2019t know, and I have friends you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Venice?\u201d he queried.</p><p>\u201cYes. In Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.. .what was Tiff up to? \u201dRaphael asked Ragnor. He might just as well have said, \u201cHey, how about that game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well she asked me to the cocktail party she\u2019s having before Anna Maria\u2019s ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiff Henley is having a cocktail party?\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>\u201cShe assured me you were coming,\u201d Ragnor replied.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t had a chance to tell you,\u201d Jordan told them quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou knew she was having a cocktail party?\u201d Jared queried.</p><p>\u201cI just learned about it this morning.\u201d</p><p>The wine steward, who had been standing nearby, cleared his throat. Jared quickly apologized in Italian, and a discussion regarding choices for dinner wine went around the table.</p><p>\u201cI think you just found out about this cocktail party tonight.\u201d Jordan started, Ragnor\u2019s whisper so close against her cheek, so softly spoken.</p><p>She smiled sweetly at him. \u201cI think that big egos can come in very large packages as well.\u201d His head remained lowered near hers, his eyes dark, intense, and strangely serious. \u201cDo you dislike me, Miss Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because you insult me each time we meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of insulting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that you implied I looked like a real hooker in red vinyl.\u201d Avery slight smile curved his lips. \u201cI could apologize, but that isn\u2019t really the answer, is it? So, why do you dislike me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because you\u2019re a liar,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>\u201cWhat lies have I told?\u201d Ragnor inquired.</p><p>\u201cYou were at the contessa\u2019s ball. And you deny it.\u201d</p><p>He sat back. \u201cWe\u2019re not at all friends, I do assure you. That is no lie.\u201d She would have believed him. Except at that moment, Raphael suddenly had a question for Ragnor.</p><p>\u201cRagnor. I saw you with the contessa in the Square today. At least, I\u2019m quite certain that it was the contessa. She was wearing a mask, but... there\u2019s something in the way she moves, yes? Have you two decided that you are not such great enemies?\u201d Raphael was full of his sense of fun. He lifted his wineglass. \u201cYou seemed quite close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the sun and the moon, my friend,\u201d Ragnor said evenly.</p><p>Everyone at the table was staring at him.</p><p>\u201cNight and day,\u201d Anna Maria murmured.</p><p>Jordan excused herself suddenly, rising with a murmur about going to the ladies room and asking Lynn to order for her. She hurried off to the restroom and doused her face in cold water. She stared at her reflection.</p><p>\u201cGo home, get out of this insanity!\u201d she told herself. But the more it seemed she should do so, the more she longed to run, the more she felt impelled to stay.</p><p>Ragnor was a liar. He was with Tiff today, and with the contessa in the Square. It didn\u2019t change the fact that she was torn between hostility . . . and almost overwhelming desire.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s handsomely built,\u201d she told her reflection. \u201cGood, rugged features, great hands. You\u2019ve been alone; you lost a fianc\u00e9 a year ago. You are human, and that is all.\u201d She suddenly realized that another woman had come in and was staring at her. She had spoken aloud.</p><p>\u201cScusi, scusi,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, per favore, mi scusi,\u201d Jordan murmured quickly, slipping by the woman.</p><p>Great. As if the world didn\u2019t think that Americans were crazy enough.</p><p>She ran right into Ragnor. He had apparently followed her, and waited for her to emerge.</p><p>\u201cI had to make you understand that I am not in any way the contessa\u2019s friend,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYour friendships are completely your own business, Mister . .. Mister ...\u201d She threw up her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t even know your last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that you believe me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may be important that you trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I try not to trust comparative strangers at the very best of times.\u201d She started by him. He caught her hand.</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be such a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, \u201dshe said, extricating her hand from his. \u201cYou are very strange, sir.\u201d She started by him again.</p><p>Somehow, and she wasn\u2019t at all sure how he managed it, he was in front of her again.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Jordan, I\u2019m sorry I insulted your vinyl. I meant no offense. You were simply far too enticing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Excuse me,\u201d she murmured, and this time, he didn\u2019t stop her.</p> <p>\u201cJordan! I hope that I ordered well for you,\u201d Lynn said as she reached the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that you did,\u201d Jordan assured her, taking her seat.</p><p>She pointedly gave her attention to Lynn as Ragnor took his chair. \u201cWhat am I having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great antipasto, there on the table now. Then rigatoni funghetti, delicious pasta with mushrooms in oil and garlic, and then seppia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cIn English, cuttlefish. Like an octopus or squid. You\u2019ve seen it here, surely. It\u2019s the special dish of Venice,\u201d Lynn told her.</p> <p>Jordan\u2019s stomach instantly churned. Cuttlefish. Yep. She should have known. She\u2019d seen it on menus, read about it in guidebooks. She was a seafood lover?of anything that didn\u2019t look too much like seafood.</p><p>No whole fish with the eyes staring at her.</p><p>Or anything that was related to an octopus in any way, shape, or form. Octopus was very popular here, she knew. She\u2019d never managed to enjoy a plate of anything with little octopi on it; seeing the tiny suckers on the little legs didn\u2019t do anything for her.</p><p>She hoped her smile didn\u2019t slip.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d she managed.</p><p>She turned her attention back to the general conversation at the table in time to hear Ragnor responding to something Cindy had said.</p><p>\u201cLegends are always intriguing. Most interestingly, they correspond.\u201d He offered Cindy a rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cEven the angels who were cast from heaven in Judaism and Christianity have much in common with say, the old Roman gods, Assyrian deities, and the Norse rulers of Valhalla.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAngels align with the old gods and goddesses?\u201d Cindy said skeptically. She paused to smile at the waiter as her pasta was served.</p><p>\u201cLucifer, the beautiful, the fallen. Satan was an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that God is a legend?\u201d Anna Maria queried with a frown.</p><p>Ragnor shook his head. \u201cOh, no, I believe that there is a God. I\u2019m saying that what we see as the pagan ways of the past are not so different. Knowledge is different, history is different, but there has always been a concept of good and evil and death has always been a great mystery. Different societies have tried to explain it in different ways, but worldwide and throughout history, there has been a belief in a hell, or an underworld. The Greeks crossed the River Styx. Hell has always been down, and heaven is always up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as people are really very much the same,\u201d Lynn commented. \u201cHuman nature does not change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all love the glitter of gold!\u201d Raphael put in.</p><p>\u201cAnd we all fear monsters, and see the same creatures!\u201d Anna Maria agreed. \u201cThe great hairy man, the missing link, is universal. Big Foot in the United States is Sasquatch in Canada and the Yeti in Asia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd darkness and shadows hide all evil!\u201d Raphael announced. They all stared at him. He shrugged. \u201cE</p><p>vero! All over the world, children are afraid of the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dark is what we can\u2019t see or understand. That\u2019s always frightening,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>Darkness and shadows, and things that seem to move within them, Jordan thought. She bit into her pasta. It was delicious. She would finish it, then move the cuttlefish around on her plate, and pretend that it was delicious, too.</p><p>\u201cSo, Ragnor?is there a Loch Ness monster?\u201d Lynn asked.</p><p>\u201cIf so, I\u2019ve never seen it,\u201d Ragnor said, bringing the soft sound of laughter around the table. \u201cBut who knows? There have been a lot of sightings?-just no beached creatures for scientific proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no such thing as a Loch Ness monster,\u201d Jared insisted.</p><p>The waiter arrived to take their pasta plates. Jared seemed to be scowling, irritated by the conversation that seemed to be fun for the others.</p><p>\u201cBut many legends have later been explained by science,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cSea monsters?we know that giant squid and other such things do exist And blue whales! Larger than any dinosaurs! We accept them easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen blue whales?they\u2019ve been seen since men first put to sea,\u201d Jared told her. \u201cThere\u2019s your proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never actually seen a blue whale,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cOther people have seen blue whales, but other people have also said that they\u2019ve seen the Loch Ness monster.\u201d Jared groaned. \u201cCindy, it\u2019s not quite the same. You\u2019ve seen pictures of great blue whales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watch Discovery,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few pictures of the Loch Ness monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that the great blue whale has more documentation going for it,\u201d Lynn said, attempting a compromise.</p><p>The dinner plates had arrived. Jordan looked down at her plate, already forcing a smile for Lynn.</p><p>There was no cuttlefish in front of her. She was staring at a plate of chicken marsala. She glanced up and caught Ragnor\u2019s eye. He smiled.</p><p>The cuttlefish was before him.</p><p>\u201cLynn ordered it for me. You don\u2019t have to?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve dined on far stranger creatures.\u201d</p><p>Lynn didn\u2019t notice the change. She was still talking about legends, faraway places, sea creatures. By the time she turned to Jordan, the plates had been subtly switched once again.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn adventure in taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain I\u2019d have it again, but?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that you tried it,\u201d Lynn told her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should have asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Thank you. My meal was delicious!\u201d she said, and thankfully, she wasn\u2019t lying.</p><p>The evening went pleasantly. lingering over espresso and dessert, they talked about the ball the coming night. Yes, Anna Maria assured them, they were all exhausted with the preparations, but pleased.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you think that the contessa will come?\u201d Cindy asked Anna Maria.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. She does not have a ticket. She would not have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if she is curious?she does put on costumes and walk around the streets, though she would never admit to it!\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cRaphael, we always know to whom we sell our tickets. And even those we give out through special friends with interests in Venice, like Jared are to people known to us because we are so careful to seat people where they will enjoy themselves. I have a list of everyone who is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if she showed up at the door, would we let her in?\u201d Lynn asked.</p><p>Anna Maria tossed back her beautiful, sleek hair. \u201cThe world is full of \u2018ifs.\u2019 I said that right in English, didn\u2019t I? I refuse to live by \u2018ifs.\u2019 And the contessa would not come to a party that I gave. It\u2019s late. We have a very long day tomorrow. We must get the check and get going. Signore, il con to, per favore,\u201d she called to the waiter.</p><p>The check had already been paid. \u201cI crashed the dinner party. It seemed the thing to do, under the circumstances,\u201d Ragnor explained.</p><p>The others all thanked him and told him it wasn\u2019t necessary. Jordan looked at him curiously. \u201cWhen did you manage to pay the check?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhen I \u2018followed\u2019 you to the ladies room,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t really following me. You just happened to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. I was following you, too.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out her chair. Outside the restaurant, they went through a round of cheek kissing again. Anna Maria and her group were ready to take a vaporetto.</p><p>\u201cWhich way are you going?\u201d Jared asked Ragnor.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve just taken a room at the Danieli,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jordan started.</p><p>\u201cGreat! We can walk back together,\u201d Cindy said. She slipped her arm through her husband\u2019s, leading them on ahead.</p><p>Jordan stared at Ragnor. \u201cYou\u2019re really at the Danieli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why move into the Danieli?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t stayed there in a while.\u201d</p><p>She started forward. He fell in step at her side, not touching her.</p><p>\u201cThank you for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She stopped walking. \u201cJust what do you do for a living?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the street as he walked, a small smile on his lips. \u201cYou know, in many places in Europe, that might be considered a rude question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an American. According to many Europeans, we tend to be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not usually, are you?\u201d he queried, looking at her.</p><p>She sighed with exasperation. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just answer a straight question?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI dabble in antiques,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDabbling in antiques must be a prosperous vocation.\u201d She brushed his sleeve, indicating his dress.</p><p>\u201cArmani, Versace ... rooms at the Danieli, constant travel, so it seems. And apparently, you speak a number of languages?well. That tends to imply quite an education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world itself can be quite an education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure. But I think you\u2019ve had a lot more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are getting intensely personal, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am intensely curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask if I\u2019m a drug smuggler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right. I have lots of that dreadful stuff known as family money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was this family from, originally?\u201d</p><p>It seemed he still hesitated, then he shrugged. \u201cNorway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorway!\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, his head at a slight incline. \u201cYes. I shouldn\u2019t have thought that would be a tremendous surprise. I\u2019m definitely Teutonic looking. Then there\u2019s my name?Ragnor. And my surname.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you before?I don\u2019t know your surname.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cWulfsson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWulf-son?\u201d she repeated. \u201clike ... son of the wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly common name where I come from,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Wolf. Wolf\u2019s son.</p><p>A tall man in wolf\u2019s clothing, leaping from a balcony to a boat.</p> <p>A wolf in the midst of the shadows.</p><p>A large dog. Right.</p><p>Jordan felt light-headed, uneasy.</p><p>They passed by a shop window. She glanced at it and started.</p><p>There was the mannequin again. The one she had passed earlier. An echo of Steven\u2019s face remained.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ragnor asked. She hadn\u2019t realized that she had paused and was staring at the mannequin. Steven\u2019s face had passed through her mind\u2019s eye once again.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>It was a dummy; a mannequin. Well dressed, made of rubber or plastic, or whatever they used to make dummies.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said.</p><p>She felt his hands on her shoulders, the intensity of his eyes on hers. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She shook her head. She wasn\u2019t sharing any more about Steven with anyone. \u201cNothing, really. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the store window, then looked back at her. \u201cI wish that you\u2019d trust me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She lifted her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a shop window, as you can see.\u201d Jared and Cindy had paused ahead. Her cousin called back to them. \u201cHey, you two, are you coming?\u201d Jordan then heard Cindy\u2019s voice, though she hadn\u2019t intended her words to carry. \u201cJared, leave her alone! She\u2019s walking with a fascinating man after a year of mourning!\u201d Jordan was staring at Ragnor as they both heard Cindy\u2019s aggrieved whisper. She flushed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She turned; he followed. She walked briskly, passing Cindy and Jared. A moment later she turned back to the three who were a few feet behind her. \u201cThere\u2019s the hotel. Excuse me, will you, I\u2019m going to hurry on ahead. I\u2019m suddenly really, really tired. Excuse me, please.\u201d She quickened her pace, nearly swinging the revolving door into a bellman as she hurried into the hotel.</p><p>She apologized quickly and went to the concierge for her key. Before anyone could come up behind her, she raced up the stairs to her bedroom door.</p><p>Inside the room, she noted that the night maid had been in. Her bed was turned down. The shutters had been thrown open. The window was almost closed; the night was very cool.</p><p>She remembered the uneasy sensation she\u2019d had in the room before she\u2019d left. She shook her head, wanting to sleep, hoping to not be plagued by ridiculous fears. Methodically, she went through her room, checking the bathroom, the divisions of the room, under the bed, even the television cabinet. She secured the shutters and closed the window.</p><p>She discarded her heels and black cocktail dress and got into a flannel Winnie the Pooh nightgown.</p><p>There was a knock on her door. She hesitated, peered through the peephole, and saw that Ragnor was out there.</p><p>She opened the door, glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded, anger, exasperation, and even a plea in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure you were up here, safe, sound, locked in, all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was locked in?until you had me open the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind if I look around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeep midnight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell past midnight,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go away and stay away,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in, walk around, look around. Then please .. .\u201d He stepped past her and repeated the actions she had just taken. She watched him, arms crossed over her chest as she waited. She stood near the door. He would leave. He had to leave. She couldn\u2019t believe it. She was tempted to ask him to stay. To just walk up to him and say I don\u2019t know a damned thing about you. I still think you\u2019re lying. You\u2019re evasive if not entirely mysterious. You could be a mass murderer for all I know. But, okay, I admit it, I\u2019m no better than Tiff, I feel this incredible urge to touch you, to check out what\u2019s going on beneath the tailored clothing, lord, what a body, is it all that great? I\u2019d really like to just hop into bed, turn out all the lights and have sex, the kind where you forget everything because you\u2018re so desperate for that moment. . .</p><p>\u201cLooks good,\u201d he said, stepping before her.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks. I thought so myself. You\u2019re not a drug smuggler. An antiques smuggler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA criminal of any kind?\u201d</p><p>At that, he seemed to hesitate.</p><p>\u201cYou are a criminal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great! You\u2019re warning me to be careful, you\u2019re in my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before?you seem to have created an ... an atmosphere of tension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she told him.</p><p>To her amazement, he did so. The second he stepped out of the doorway, she was sorry. This was absolutely crazy. She had the most insane temptation to throw herself against him.</p><p>\u201cWhen you feel like explaining things to me?telling me the truth about, just about anything?give me a call,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She closed the door, firmly locking it.</p><p>She leaned against the door for a moment, biting her lip. She didn\u2019t hear him leave. A moment later, she threw open the door again. The hallway was empty. She closed the door again, locking it carefully.</p><p>It took her a long time to get to sleep.</p><p>When she did, the dreams came again.</p><p>Steven was there. He was dressed as the mannequin in the window, but he was the man she had known, passionate, level, caring, noble ... all the rest. He called her name, trying to reach her through a sea of fog, apologizing because he just couldn\u2019t come close enough.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the wolf,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get rid of that wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no wolves in Venice,\u201d she told him. \u201cI talked to the waiter. They just have very big dogs.\u201d But the wolf was there again. Silver, huge, it sat a few feet away, much closer than it had been before.</p><p>Steven, she saw, was beyond the window, walking in the fog.</p><p>The wolf was at the foot of the bed.</p><p>Steven kept coming. The wolf growled. She saw the great canine teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d Steven said.</p><p>She had to explain the wolf. \u201cThe waiter really assured me. No wolves. I think it\u2019s just a malamute, Steven, see the eyes?\u201d</p><p>The fog was rising all around her, swirling around the foot of the bed. There shouldn\u2019t be fog in the room. It had to be the maid\u2019s fault; she had left the window open.</p><p>\u201cJordan . ..\u201d</p><p>It was Steven, calling her name.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too, so much, Steven.\u201d Guilt assailed her. She did miss him. He had been everything good in a man. A cop. He\u2019d cared for victims; he\u2019d wanted reforms; he done everything, given the final sacrifice of his life.</p><p>I miss you, but I\u2019m dying to go to bed with another man now, Steven, she thought.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say the words aloud, but it was a dream. Could he read her mind in a dream? Was she speaking anyway? Even in the dream, she knew that a psychiatrist would have a heyday with her. This was all perfectly understandable. She\u2019d been in love, deeply in love, engaged. She shouldn\u2019t forget so quickly. A year. Steven was dead, and she was not.</p><p>There was an explanation, yes, surely . . .</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Steven!\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cLove me more than the wolf!\u201d he called to her.</p><p>\u201cI do love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me back in your mind, Jordan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always in my mind.\u201d</p><p>The wolf growled again.</p><p>The fog rose over the bed.</p><p>She awoke with a start.</p><p>Though the shutters were closed, little shafts of light streaked into the room. She could see the motes dancing in the air.</p><p>There was no fog in her room.</p><p>And there was no wolf.</p><p>And no sign of Steven, naturally.</p><p>Morning had come and dreams had broken.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>She awoke very late.</p><p>Despite the hour, Jordan went upstairs to the rooftop restaurant, desperately in search of coffee. One of the waiters, a pleasant man she was coming to know, greeted her with a smile, and the much needed cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cBuon giomo, Signorina Riley,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s not morning, but then ... it is Carnevale. I can get you eggs, if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coffee is wonderful, thank you so much. If it\u2019s already lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn omelette. Formaggio, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely, thank you. Have you seen my cousin or his wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSignora Riley left not long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. Oh ... by the way, have you seen a very tall man, light haired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, signorina, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you.\u201d</p><p>At the next table, a woman was finishing a bowl of soup; her companion was reading an Italian paper.</p><p>\u201cEven here in Venice,\u201d the man said in English.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, dear?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cA head?a severed head was found in a canal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, how awful!\u201d the woman said. Then she added \u201cJust the head? No body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet?but I assume you\u2019ve got to have a body to have a head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jordan found herself rising, approaching the couple. \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m sorry for being so rude. Did you say that a head had been found?\u201d</p><p>The man lowered his paper, looking at her over the top. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry to say. But you shouldn\u2019t worry. It was found far from here. This is a wonderfully safe city, young lady. It\u2019s likely that this was a personal vendetta.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh? Did the man have enemies?\u201d</p><p>The man cleared his throat. \u201cWell, actually, right now, the man is an unidentified head. The authorities are trying to make an identification, checking missing persons reports and all. Here, would you like the paper?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, thanking him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the amount of Italian I can read wouldn\u2019t give me much of the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as I said, it\u2019s not something you should worry about. Honestly. My wife, Alyssa?\u201d He inclined his head toward his wife, and Jordan smiled at the attractive, silver-haired woman in acknowledgment,</p><p>\u201c?we\u2019ve been coming here for nearly twenty years, every Carnevale. These are the most wonderful people in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHarold, the poor girl is white as a sheet. You shouldn\u2019t have been reading so loudly,\u201d Alyssa said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s all right. I shouldn\u2019t have been eavesdropping. Um, does it say anything about how long the head might have been in the water?\u201d</p><p>Harold shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they know as yet. Unfortunately, when a head is in the sea ...\u201d He hesitated, clearing his throat. \u201cWell, fish chew at it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarold! We\u2019re at lunch!\u201d Alyssa admonished. \u201cAnd this poor dear hasn\u2019t even been served yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s all right I\u2019m a pretty hardy soul,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI\u2019m Jordan Riley, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlyssa and Harold Atwater,\u201d Alyssa said, extending a hand. \u201cA pleasure. Where are you from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCharleston, South Carolina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fellow Southerner,\u201d Harold said, as if he had decided beforehand that there was something about her of which he approved.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re from Texas,\u201d Alyssa said.</p><p>\u201cOh, look, there\u2019s that tall fellow I told you about the other day!\u201d Alyssa said to her husband. She grinned at Jordan. \u201cI think he must be a European film star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRocker, probably?look at that hair,\u201d Harold said.</p><p>\u201cRich rocker, Harold, look at the cut of his clothes,\u201d Alyssa rolled her eyes at Jordan.</p><p>Jordan turned, already aware that it had to be Ragnor Wulfsson coming into the restaurant. He carried a paper; his eyes were shielded behind very dark glasses. He was wearing black jeans, a tailored shirt, and a fitted black leather jacket, blond hair queued at his nape.</p><p>Jordan stiffened slightly and offered Alyssa a return smile.</p> <p>\u201cAntiques dealer,\u201d she told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know him!\u201d Alyssa said, flushing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean anything ... he\u2019s rather hard to miss, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she said pleasantly, adding a soft, \u201cI don\u2019t know him all that well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig fellow,\u201d Harold said. \u201cGerman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorwegian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be a bouncer. Or a tough guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Harold!\u201d Alyssa said softly, noting that Ragnor had seen them and was coming their way. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! There is no such thing as a Norwegian mafia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Italy! Hush up about the mafia!\u201d Harold warned.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Ragnor said, reaching the table. He nodded to Harold and Alyssa, and looked at Jordan. \u201cYou\u2019ve just arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few minutes ago. Ragnor, Harold and Alyssa Atwater. From Texas. Mr. and Mrs. Atwater, Ragnor Wulfsson?from Norway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginally,\u201d Ragnor said, shaking Harold\u2019s hand, and inclining his head politely to Alyssa. \u201cA pleasure to meet you. You must be familiar with Italy, Mr. Atwater; I see that you\u2019re reading an Italian paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I was in the service, stationed in Italy,\u201d he said. \u201cGrisly thing, this, have you seen the headlines? Oh, do you read Italian?\u201d</p><p>Ragnor arched a brow, accepting the paper. \u201cYes, I read Italian,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI tell you, Harold, the Europeans have it all over us! He\u2019s Norwegian, his English is perfect, and he reads Italian as well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak Spanish nicely.\u201d Harold absently complimented his wife.</p><p>\u201cNorwegian, Italian, English ... and I\u2019m sure Mr. Wulfsson speaks one or two other languages,\u201d Alyssa said.</p><p>Ragnor looked up from the paper long enough to offer her a smile. \u201cA few,\u201d he agreed, and gave his attention back to the paper.</p><p>\u201cThere has been a severed head discovered in one of the canals,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I see that.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa gasped suddenly. \u201cJordan Riley! Why, you\u2019re the young lady who thought she was in the midst of mass murder at the contessa\u2019s party the other night.\u201d</p><p>Jordan felt her flesh warming uncomfortably. \u201cYes. Were you at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you saw nothing ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t in the upstairs ballroom, dear,\u201d Alyssa said. \u201cPoor girl! No wonder Harold\u2019s words were so disturbing, and this story... but honestly, you mustn\u2019t worry. I mean?lord knows! This head might have floated over from Greece or Albania or... well, somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a head would have made it quite that far,\u201d Harold said.</p><p>As he spoke, the waiter arrived with Jordan\u2019s omelette. It was decorated with greens and tomatoes. The plate was attractively arranged. But the eggs ...</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Alyssa murmured, appearing a little ashen. \u201cWill you gentlemen please put that paper away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d the waiter asked anxiously. \u201cMr. Wulfsson, may I bring you coffee? Will you be joining Miss Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>Alyssa rose. \u201cGo eat your omelette, while it\u2019s hot,\u201d she suggested to Jordan, glancing at the plate on the table as if it were the severed head itself. She shuddered. \u201cLovely to meet you. Harold, we have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo we don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. Goodbye, we\u2019ll be seeing you.\u201d She had her hand on Harold\u2019s arm, he was up, a big man, ready to follow his slender wife.</p><p>\u201cKeep the paper!\u201d he said to Ragnor.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Thanks very much,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>When they had gone, Ragnor slid into a seat at Jordan\u2019s table. She took her chair opposite him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember asking you to join me for breakfast,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t really breakfast,\u201d he murmured, eyes scanning the paper.</p><p>Jordan wished she could read Italian. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too much. A head was found in one of the smaller canals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear the contessa\u2019s palazzo?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>His eyes shot up at her. Not that she could really see his eyes. His Ray-Bans shot up at her.</p><p>He stared at her a while. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople were killed at her party. I\u2019m convinced of it. If only someone else believed it.\u201d He didn\u2019t contradict her. He translated from the paper instead. \u201cPolice will call in a forensic artist to try to re-create the face so that bulletins can be sent throughout Europe, as there are no reports of missing persons in the Venice area at this time.\u201d</p><p>She sat back, staring at him. \u201cCan you take those off, please?\u201d she asked, indicating his glasses.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cWearing them at the table is extremely rude, something even an American wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see Americans wearing sunglasses at the table all the time,\u201d he replied absently.</p><p>She leaned forward, shoving the omelette aside. \u201cYou spend your time warning me that I\u2019m in danger, that I create danger, then you tell me that a severed head means nothing in Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you can\u2019t go assuming that this severed head has anything to do with the contessa. And if you go to the police insisting again that the contessa\u2019s party was full of costumed creatures ripping up guests, they\u2019re just going to think that you\u2019re crazy again. Delusional, suffering from stress brought on by grief due to the loss of a loved one.\u201d</p><p>She started to rise; he caught her hand. \u201cWhy are you angry with me when I tell you the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not telling me the truth about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you what you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at the moment, I have work to do. Will you excuse me?\u201d His face was expressionless, but he didn\u2019t release her hand. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cDown to the front desk?I was supposed to get some work by FedEx today. Then I\u2019m going to my room to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bring the red vinyl costume back to Anna Maria\u2019s and pick up the outfit I\u2019m wearing tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the lobby. Make sure you stop by to get me before you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want you with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hard to shake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you let go for now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t touched your food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry. And I am awake and aware, and it seems like a good time to get some work done.\u201d He released her hand. His attention was back on the newspaper article.</p><p>Jordan took the elevator down to the lobby level and went straight to the front desk, asking if a package had arrived for her. To her surprise, it actually had; it had arrived in almost exactly twenty-four hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a note from her agent right on top. She scanned it and went straight to the manuscript.</p><p>Vampire Legend and the Criminal Mind.</p><p>She started reading as she walked up the stairs. There was an introduction about the author, a cop named Sean Canady who lived in New Orleans. His record had been filled with commendations, and he had worked homicides for years.</p> <p>The first section of the book centered on solved criminal cases involving occultism and vampirism, going back into history for centuries, and including cases involving cannibalism, all the way up to the murders perpetrated by Jeffrey Dahmer.</p><p>The book was absorbing. In her room, she flopped down on her bed and kept on reading until she realized that she hadn\u2019t locked her door.</p><p>Her reading material indicated that she really should do so.</p><p>She stood, rushed to the door, locked it, and stretched back out to read again. The manuscript was very well written: detailed without being graphic, to the point, and yet explanatory. There was a section on cases still under investigation, including the murder of several prostitutes in New Orleans, and the occult killings that had occurred in Charleston, South Carolina.</p><p>Steven was in the book, mentioned by name. She bit her lip while reading that section.</p> <p>There was a chapter on the various psychologies involved in such murders, written in cooperation with one of the leading men from the FBI who worked on criminal profiles. The author stressed the fact that although serial killers were often white males between twenty and thirty-five?men who might have tortured animals as children, who held menial jobs, and were often married?there was also a breed of very organized killers with the ability to charm and get ahead in life, attractive and appealing men in appearance and manner, such as Ted Bundy.</p><p>Sometimes killers left their signatures. Sometimes they wanted to be caught. Sometimes they wanted the power trip that came with outwitting the police.</p><p>There were those who were truly ill.</p><p>And those who believed they were dealing with vampires.</p><p>Vampire lore had come into play in the capture of a \u2018vampire\u2019 killer in Colorado who thought he was a vampire. The scare had been so real in the small western town where the killings took place that many women had armed themselves with stakes and large crosses, kept vials of holy water by the door, and hung their windows and doorways with garlic. The killer, who selected his women by breaking into bedroom windows, had avoided these households, believing himself susceptible to the weapons of legend. The police knew of one victim who had saved herself through her efforts. The killer\u2019s footprints had been found in her garden and he later admitted to making an attempt to strike at her, but had seen the garlic, and knew that he would be falling prey to his own doom. There was a list of suggestions from the author on keeping safe. Most of them were common sense, but Jordan kept reading anyway.</p><p>? Avoid being alone in any dark or any potentially dangerous place.</p> <p>? Always keep doors and windows locked.</p><p>? Keep a dog?barking is a deterrent to many would-be criminals.</p><p>? Never invite strangers in. Never.</p><p>There was a knock on her door.</p><p>She nearly jumped through the ceiling.</p><p>She glanced at her watch. Three o\u2019clock. Hours had passed, and she hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>She leaped up, then paused, and for some reason, decided to shove the manuscript under her pillow.</p><p>Walking to the door, she looked out the peephole, expecting Jared or Cindy.</p> <p>It was Ragnor.</p><p>Never invite a stranger in. Never.</p><p>But.. .</p><p>Last night, she had done so.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>The knocking sounded again.</p><p>Jordan squared her shoulders, giving herself a mental shake. Her reading material was beginning to have an effect on her. As he raised his hand to knock again, Jordan opened the door.</p><p>He stared at her expectantly and glanced at his watch. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he queried.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA walk to Anna Maria\u2019s to return the last costume?the vinyl. And pick up whatever delight Raphael planned for you for tonight.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to tell him no, to go away. She wasn\u2019t even sure she wanted to go to the ball that evening.</p><p>Maybe her reading material was getting to her; she wanted to immerse herself in it.</p><p>Maybe she was simply and totally crazy. Ragnor had a ... presence. He wasn\u2019t just striking, he was compelling. She liked the sound of his voice, the shape of his jaw ...</p><p>As she had before, she felt the sudden temptation to fly into his arms, lay her head down, and believe that everyone was fine and normal, that he wasn\u2019t a man with a million dark secrets, that... that she could just bury herself in sensation. Turn off the lights, forget the shadows, have faith in the dark, and the feel of him.</p><p>She took a step back. She wasn\u2019t prey to true insanity.</p><p>And she was torn, longing to read more of the new book. She wanted to find out more about the author.</p><p>She wanted to talk to him and tell him what she had seen . . .</p><p>And that a head had appeared in a Venetian canal.</p><p>But she knew she had to go to the ball. And she needed to return the one costume and get the other.</p><p>And, of course, she had to go to Tiff\u2019s for drinks. She would ruin everything for Tiff if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSure. Great. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to get the vinyl costume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She walked back into the room to get the costume that was hanging by the window on a lamp stand.</p><p>When she turned around, he was just inside her door.</p><p>She had invited him in last night.</p><p>Yes, and it was day, and she was alive and well.</p><p>She carried the costume, slipped her handbag over her arm.</p><p>A killer could be charming, attractive in appearance and manner. . .</p><p>Jordan hurried out into the hall, eager to reach the lobby and the flood of people there.</p><p>Tonight, the Danieli would hold its own ball in celebration of Carnevale.</p><p>She wished she were just staying here, attending this ball instead of Anna Maria\u2019s.</p><p>Not fair.</p><p>Anna Maria had been wonderful to her; everyone in the shop had been wonderful. They had sympathized with her when the rest of Venice had been laughing at her. Lynn had promised good-humored, beautiful entertainment. She had looked forward to the ball, and she was going to enjoy it.</p><p>Even if her footsteps were dogged by this ...</p><p>Stranger.</p><p>\u201cIs there a fire?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She had breezed through the lobby; they were already out on the street.</p><p>He took the costume from her, throwing it over his shoulder. \u201cYou walk exceptionally fast, for such a small person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walk exceptionally slowly, for a giant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you either lie or evade all my questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve answered your questions. My name is Ragnor Wulfsson. I\u2019m originally from Norway. I deal in antiques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you loathe the contessa, but you were with her in the Square. In a very friendly manner, according to Raphael. What is it between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing between us. I met her before? and we are definitely antagonistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland, years ago. We are natural enemies. Is that enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will have to do for now. And if you distrust me so very much, why are you with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t seem to shake you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. His long strides were now passing hers, and she was puffing somewhat to keep up with him. They reached the Arte della Anna Maria shop. Lynn was outside, smoking.</p><p>\u201cBuon giorno!\u201d she cried happily, stamping out her cigarette and greeting them both with the customary kisses. \u201cWe were growing worried. Afraid you had decided not to come to the ball!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never miss Anna Maria\u2019s ball,\u201d Jordan assured her.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in, both your costumes are ready!\u201d</p><p>In the shop, Raphael left a slender woman to study a row of costumes and hurried to Jordan, his enthusiasm at seeing her very warming. He kissed her, fussed over her, greeted Ragnor, and relieved him of the vinyl costume. He had Jordan\u2019s costume ready for her, but ushered her into a corner to look at masks. \u201cYou heard about the head?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Venice! At Carnevale.\u201d He was indignant that such a crime should mar the beauty of his city, and the occasion. \u201cBut it must not worry you. No one knows where it might have come from?the police are on it.</p><p>They are really very good here. We are hard on criminals. You have seen the officers with the automatic weapons, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must still love Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Raphael sighed, smoothing the ostrich feather on the mask. He glanced over his shoulder at Ragnor.</p><p>\u201cBut you have found a good friend. Big! It is good to walk the streets with such a friend. Mucho macho.</p><p>That\u2019s Spanish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a very manly man.\u201d</p><p>Jordan laughed. \u201cOr chauvinist,\u201d she mused.</p><p>\u201cPerdoni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Raphael, nothing. Hey, if I ever want to read the Italian paper, will you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I will help you with anything. After today, our ball is over, we collapse, and then we are like free people again. I would love to spend time with you, help you read Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She kissed him on the cheek. \u201cWhat will you be tonight?\u201d He grinned. \u201cSomething very flamboyant. You\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d Ragnor had been deep in conversation with Anna Maria. As Raphael walked Jordan to the entrance, apologizing that he must get to other customers, the door opened, and Cindy and Jared entered. Cindy looked tired. Wan.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jordan greeted her cousin-in-law.</p><p>Cindy\u2019s face lit up with a smile. \u201cHere you are. I was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d</p><p>Cindy glanced at Ragnor. \u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d She seemed pleased. Jared didn\u2019t. Anna Maria was coming forward to greet Cindy. Jared came over to Jordan, whispering to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you spending too much time with this guy? We don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were walking in the same direction,\u201d Jordan told him.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been all day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn my room, working.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to satisfy him. She wanted to believe that Jared was acting the part of the protective older brother today; she sensed it was more than that.</p><p>Anna Maria called to Jared, who stepped forward, dutifully kissing her cheeks, and responding with pleasure to something she said. Cindy stepped back to Jordan, smiling then with wicked delight. \u201cYou go, girl! He\u2019s a hunk. If it weren\u2019t for Jared, I\u2019d be tempted. Oh, hell, I adore Jared, and I\u2019m tempted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, it\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis eyes are never off you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you tell, behind those glasses?\u201d</p><p>Cindy giggled. \u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere should be! Steven has been dead a long time now,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>\u201cTiff has a thing for him. That\u2019s why she planned that little cocktail party tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we\u2019re invited?\u201d Cindy asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a word from Tiff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all definitely invited, though I admit, I\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls, are you ready?\u201d Jared asked, turning toward them.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even get my costume,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>\u201cI have it,\u201d Jared told her, glancing at his watch. \u201cIf we\u2019re planning on getting to Tiff\u2019s and then the ball</p><p>... it\u2019s time to make tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, if we\u2019re to change and be ready,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you at the ball. What are you going as, Anna Maria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hostess,\u201d Anna Maria said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be someone you\u2019ll never expect,\u201d Lynn volunteered.</p><p>\u201cRaphael?\u201d Cindy asked.</p><p>He drew his finger to his lips, smiling mischievously.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be flamboyant,\u201d Jordan volunteered for him.</p><p>\u201cTil later,\u201d Ragnor said, kissing Anna Maria goodbye. He started out the shop first. Jordan started to follow. Jared caught her arm.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you going with him?\u201d</p><p>She pulled her arm back. \u201cHonestly, Jared, we\u2019re going to the same place. And by the way, did you hear that they pulled a head out of the canal? Not a fish head, Jared, a human head.\u201d He sighed with exasperation. \u201cYes, I heard. That must mean there are bodies by the truckload floating in the water, all from the contessa\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that someone was killed?and that his head was severed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys, you\u2019re blocking the door,\u201d Cindy warned.</p><p>Jordan moved ahead, catching up with Ragnor, who had both their costumes under his arm.</p><p>She slipped her hand around his free elbow. He looked down at her. She saw a brow arch behind his glasses, but an annoying smile was on his face, so she knew that he was aware she was merely irritated with her cousin.</p><p>\u201cBe careful of him,\u201d Ragnor whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my cousin. I adore him. He\u2019s not a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere can be no one stranger than a person you think you really know,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Quit being so cryptic!\u201d she implored.</p><p>He was silent as they walked along, several yards ahead of Cindy and Jared. Then, after a while, he startled her when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy. She looks very tired and pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally, she\u2019s tired. Everyone parties all night.\u201d</p><p>Again they walked in silence. Nearing the hotel, they went by the shop with the mannequin in the window that had twice seemed to look at her with Steven\u2019s face.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized that she had stopped, staring at it again. It was just a mannequin.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ragnor queried.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She looked up at him. It was dark now, and he had shed his sunglasses at last. She was surprised by the intensity of his stare. \u201cNothing,\u201d she repeated. \u201cNothing at all. I like that outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you say that I lie!\u201d he told her softly.</p><p>\u201cWe have to hurry if we\u2019re to make Tiff\u2019s. Now, Mr. Wulfsson, there\u2019s a woman who is fond of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a pleasant person.\u201d</p><p>Jordan smiled. She liked Tiff very much herself; there was just something about her. But she wasn\u2019t sure that \u201cpleasant\u201d was a word she\u2019d use to describe her.</p><p>\u201cI believe she finds you far more intriguing than merely pleasant.\u201d He paused, gazing at her. \u201cPerhaps the right person?under ninety?will come along for her. You knew absolutely nothing about her cocktail party tonight until I told you about it, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised. I told you, I saw you two together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants you to visit her palazzo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen her palazzo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so she wants you to see her palazzo with her in it.\u201d He didn\u2019t reply as they kept walking. Nearing the Danieli, he asked her, \u201cAnd you have no interest in me</p><p>.. . yourself?\u201d</p><p>Jordan laughed, actually enjoying the conversation. Yes, maybe once she could have been. If she had met him under different circumstances. If she didn\u2019t dream of Steven, if...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen somewhere along the line, you\u2019ll have to give me a reason to do so.\u201d They\u2019d reached the hotel. Jordan went through the revolving door. As she asked for her key, Jared was close behind her. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to meet in the lobby in about thirty minutes. This thing at Tiff\u2019s is going to be a pain.\u201d</p><p>She turned and looked at him. \u201cJared, you don\u2019t have to go. I do. She\u2019s become a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, she\u2019s been your client, throwing lots of money your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still not the best social companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s blunt and honest and I like her. But I won\u2019t be angry if you don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Cindy and I will go.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder where Cindy and Ragnor were talking. She thought that his jaw clenched, and she realized that Jared wasn\u2019t as concerned for her as he was hostile to Ragnor.</p><p>\u201cOkay, the lobby in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>She took her costume from Ragnor, politely thanked him for carrying it, and hurried up the stairs.</p><p>Apparently, Cindy, who did like Ragnor, was making sure that he also knew they were to meet in the lobby in thirty minutes.</p><p>Jordan barely had time to jump in and out of the shower and dress. But the fantasy costume was easy, and it came with a bejewelled tiara-like headpiece and mask. She ran a brush through her hair before donning it, touched her cheeks with glitter makeup, and was ready. She started for the door, then hesitated.</p><p>The maid had put her reading copy of the detective\u2019s vampire book on the desk, next to her laptop. She walked over to it and flipped to the copyright page. The book was being published by something called DeMac Publishing, New Orleans. There was an E-mail address for inquiries. Dropping her little jeweled purse, she pulled out her chair and typed out a quick E-mail to the author, introducing herself briefly and telling him she\u2019d greatly appreciate a chance to talk to him, or chat over the Internet.</p><p>Satisfied, she sent the E-mail, then jumped up to meet the others in the lobby.</p><p>Ragnor was in a typical black cape and top hat; he was appearing in Edwardian fashion this evening.</p><p>Cindy was gorgeous in an elaborate Elizabethan costume and Jared was once again in dottore adornment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I know the way,\u201d Jordan told the others. \u201cBut maybe I should get the directions again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where her palazzo is,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>\u201cThen you should lead the way,\u201d Cindy said and yawned. \u201cMy lord! All these parties! I\u2019m sleeping half the day away, and I\u2019m still exhausted.\u201d</p><p>It was good that despite being tired, Cindy seemed to be cheerful. Jared seemed tense; he kept his mask on as they walked. Ragnor was quiet, yet watchful, Jordan thought, and unerringly polite and courteous to Cindy.</p><p>They continued to talk, discussing the Bridge of Sighs and the prisoners who knew they were doomed once they crossed it, and famous residents of the prisons, such as Casanova.</p><p>Jordan kept on ahead, suddenly anxious to reach Tiff\u2019s. But when they arrived, and she tried the big brass knocker, no one answered.</p><p>Jared pounded on the door as well. They all stood awkwardly in the street.</p><p>\u201cWell, great, she\u2019s invited us all over, and she isn\u2019t here. Are you sure this is the right time and the right night?\u201d Jared said to Jordan.</p><p>\u201cBefore Anna Maria\u2019s party,\u201d Ragnor said. \u201cThat could be no other time or night.\u201d Jared pounded again. They waited.</p><p>\u201cWell this is ridiculous!\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about her,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cWorried about her!\u201d Jared exclaimed. \u201cShe made us walk through half of Venice, and now she isn\u2019t here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you see, that\u2019s the point! She really wanted us over,\u201d Jordan argued. She pounded the door again, then stood back in the calle, looking upward. \u201cTiff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, if she can\u2019t hear those brass knockers pounding, she can\u2019t hear you calling,\u201d Jared said. He glanced at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ll give her five minutes.\u201d</p><p>They remained awkwardly at the entry to the palazzo.</p><p>\u201cI think we should call the police,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cThe police!\u201d Jared scoffed. \u201cBecause she forgot she invited us to a cocktail party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t forget; I know it,\u201d Jordan argued. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTry the door,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>Jared did so. \u201cLocked.

If she hasn\u2019t even let us in yet.. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Ragnor said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you three go on ahead to Anna Maria\u2019s? I\u2019ll wait around here for a while and see if she does show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should stay, too,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>Now, even Ragnor seemed impatient with her. \u201cGo on, Jordan. I\u2019ll give Tiff a few minutes, then I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p> <p>Jordan shrugged. Well, if Tiff did return in the next few minutes, she\u2019d be elated to find Ragnor waiting there for her?alone.</p><p>She should happily walk off.</p><p>But something didn\u2019t feel right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d Ragnor said firmly.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jordan said at last.</p><p>She turned and started away with Jared and Cindy. Looking back, she saw that he did remain, a tall, caped figure, arms crossed over his chest, as if standing sentinel.</p> <p>\u201cJordan, come on,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>She stumbled; he caught her arm. They headed through narrow streets to catch a vaporetto to Anna Maria\u2019s ball.</p><p>Ragnor watched them go.</p><p>He waited until he was certain they had rounded the corner. Then he tested the lock again. The doors were firmly bolted. He looked around the square.</p><p>Darkness, shadows. No amblers passing through.</p><p>Then he entered the palazzo.</p><p>The foyer was empty. There was no sign of a struggle. Marble floors gleamed. \u201cTiff!\u201d he said, calling the woman\u2019s name.</p><p>He walked up the stairs, to the balcony, through the rooms. He came to the master suite. Nothing appeared to be amiss. The great bed was neatly made in its silken splendor. He turned and started to leave, but then, the faintest hint of an odor teased his senses.</p> <p>Blood.</p><p>He came to the bed, stared at the silk.</p><p>There, the tiniest drop.</p><p>Perhaps Nari hadn\u2019t meant to, but she had left her calling card.</p><p>\u201cMarisa, come on!\u201d</p><p>Marisa Kosolovich turned her head to see that her friends, Josef, Ari and Lizabet, were waiting for her.</p><p>She tossed back the rich wealth of her auburn hair, impatiently. They\u2019d been standing at the bar at the trattoria, and while her friends had spent some of their precious money on their own espressos, she had managed to get hers bought for her by the tall Italian man in the handsome suit. He wasn\u2019t young, but he wasn\u2019t old, somewhere between thirty and forty. He was very appealing, a businessman with bright hazel eyes and a quick smile. She\u2019d chatted about her arrival with her friends?making it sound as if they had come by plane and were young people seeing the world, rather than a group from a war-torn nation on a bus that was now parked near the train station. They were nearly broke, sleeping on the bus that had brought them here. They were willing to come with no accommodations and food from home, just so that they might see the sights and sounds of Venice at Carnevale.</p><p>She sighed. The others seemed fine with their situation. She was not. She\u2019d actually planned on finding some Americans?they usually had the most money to spend and were easily influenced by any foreign accent. She liked Americans, and she really wanted to get to America. When the soldiers had come to her village to dole out food, they had all been taken with her. She\u2019d developed the plan then to marry and get away, but the troops hadn\u2019t stayed long enough for her to get to know any of the men. They had told her, though, that she was beautiful. They had said it with their eyes as well as their words.</p><p>And more than anything, she wanted to get away.</p><p>Carnevale was always full of foreigners?lots of them American. She had been certain that in the two nights the bus stayed in Venice she could find the right person.</p><p>She had chosen the trattoria for their splurge, and there hadn\u2019t been a single American in it. But the Italian had been cute and kind, buying her an espresso and offering her something to eat. She\u2019d accepted the espresso but demurred on the food, though God knew why, she was hungry enough. She didn\u2019t want to look hungry, that must be it. And she didn\u2019t want to look like a woman who would balloon into someone as round as a tomato in a few years.</p><p>Lizabet was at the door, looking stern. Ari just looked impatient. Josef was concerned.</p><p>They weren\u2019t together as couples, just friends. They came from the same village. Or what was left of it.</p><p>She lifted a finger, ready to swing back into conversation with the tall Italian businessman. But, to her disappointment, he had turned to his friends. Some sporting event had come on the television over the bar, and his back was actually to her.</p><p>\u201cMarisa! The music starts in the square any minute! \u201dJosef announced. Tall, skinny and awkward, Josef had gone the last few years without enough to eat.</p><p>She left the bar and came to the door. \u201cMarisa, you mustn\u2019t just attach yourself to people like that. They will get the wrong idea.\u201d</p><p>Ari and Lizabet were already walking ahead. \u201cAnd what would the wrong idea be, Josef?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat you are easy, that we are easy?that we are left with no pride, no sense of self-worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a wrong idea?\u201d she queried.</p><p>\u201cOur home has been through a great deal. We should have a stronger character,\u201d he admonished.</p><p>\u201cOur home is a hellhole, and soldiers will come again and again. Bombs will fall.\u201d Josef shook his head. \u201cNo, there is peace now. And we will rebuild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will rebuild. I\u2019m not going home.\u201d</p><p>Josef looked at her with surprise. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying in Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot stay in Venice. You don\u2019t have papers. You don\u2019t speak Italian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make friends,\u201d she hissed to him. \u201cLook, Josef, you tell me all the time that I am beautiful. I will manage on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me you are beautiful. There are scores of beautiful young women. To me, you are special. To others</p><p>.. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo others?what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are ... too loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be what I need to be!\u201d she said angrily. \u201cI am attractive only to you, eh?\u201d She walked on ahead, angrily. She passed Lizabet and Ari. \u201cHey!\u201d Ari called, \u201cnow you\u2019re in such a hurry?\u201d</p><p>She was dressed as a harem girl?the best outfit she could piece together from old scraps of clothing, but she was proud that she looked much better in rags than many of the rich tourists in Venice looked in their expensive hand-made or rented costumes.</p><p>\u201cYou intend to act like shy little refugee schoolchildren!\u201d she informed them. \u201cI came to Venice to have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came to stay,\u201d Josef called out in a sulky tone.</p><p>\u201cShe is going to meet a rich American, and he is going to take her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosef says that I am special only to him,\u201d she pouted.</p><p>\u201cWe are all only special to our friends!\u201d Lizabet told her with a troubled frown. Lizabet was very religious. She had prayed on the floor of the bus for what had seemed like hours last night before finding her seat to sleep in cramped discomfort.</p><p>Marisa walked on ahead of her friends. Masked and costumed characters paused to bow to her; she bowed playfully in return. One man, tall and sleek, though he was costumed and in a mask that covered most of his face, did more than bow. He took her hand. Bent low over it, he kissed her. He spoke to her.</p><p>In Italian. His voice was deep and pleasant.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he said in English.</p><p>\u201cGrazie!\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the square, to listen to music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, perhaps I will find you again, cara mia.\u201d</p><p>He walked by. Josef, Ari, and Lizabet reached her. \u201cThere, you see!\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cCan we please get to the music?\u201d Lizabet asked. \u201cWe all know that you are beautiful, and you will go places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr stay in Venice,\u201d Josef repeated acidly.</p><p>Josef felt more for her than she had realized, Marisa thought, but Josef had nothing and would go nowhere. If she was foolish enough to love Josef, she would have a child each year and grow as fat as a house and spend her life in her little village doing laundry and baking bread and washing dishes. She was sorry if she had hurt him, but she could see what he could not. There would always be war. Soldiers would come again, and men would go out and fight, and the villagers would be weak-willed and defenseless, able to do nothing as stronger enemies came and dragged them out, raped their wives, and burned their houses.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, Josef,\u201d she said, under her breath.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t gone much farther when Josef determined that they had made a wrong turn. The stream of human traffic was no longer with them. \u201cWe must go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the map?\u201d Ari asked.</p><p>As they pulled out the map, Marisa looked around the street. It was very dark here. The waters of the canal beyond them were black in the night. The few lights in the streets created blacker shadows against black streets and walls.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Ari said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think, look here ...\u201d Lizabet told them.</p><p>Marisa wasn\u2019t paying attention. As her eyes adjusted to the shadows, she saw a man ahead, going up the steps of a building. He was wearing a cape and mask. She felt her heart pounding. Was it the same man who had kissed her hand?</p><p>As she stared at him, he turned. He drew a finger to his lips?well, as close to his lips as the mask would allow. Then he beckoned to her.</p><p>And disappeared behind a door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going this way,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMarisa, stay with us!\u201d Josef told her.</p><p>\u201cI cannot stay with you; I will get nowhere!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ari said, \u201cwe are following that bridge, there, and going on to the square. When you get tired of the darkness, follow us!\u201d</p><p>Even Josef turned his back on her. Marisa was glad.</p><p>The moment they started walking, she flew to the shadows against the wall and flattened herself there.</p><p>She waited until she could no longer hear the echo of their footsteps on the calle. Then she ran up the steps.</p><p>The door was ajar. She pushed it open. \u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>It was shadowy and dark within, but the room was lit by candles here and there.</p><p>She stepped in, taking care to leave the door ajar, and started walking along a central aisle between pillars.</p><p>\u201cHello? Ciao?\u201d she called, her voice softening as it seemed to ricochet around the room. She kept walking in.</p><p>It was a church, she thought, with a bit of awe. But a church like no other. There were no longer any pews in it, and as she neared the altar, she saw that there was no cross above it. There were paintings though. One very strange painting, of an angel ripping into and consuming lambs, was hung above the altar, where the cross should have been. She looked around. There were side chapels, as in most churches. They were dark and shadowy, some curtained, some open. She blinked. In the candlelight, dark shapes seemed to flit from chapel to chapel.</p><p>Was he playing games with her?</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re here!\u201d she called, walking to the left side, through chapel after chapel. Candles burned.</p> <p>Strange black cloth draped the altars.</p><p>She paused, thinking she heard whispers, or hisses. Wings, fluttering around her. Footfalls across the stone floor.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t play forever, you know!\u201d she said.</p><p>She crossed the nave and started along the right wall of chapels, looked up at the last painting above the black-clad altar. A figure with a crown of thorns sat holding a handful of severed heads.</p><p>She was suddenly cold in her harem outfit.</p><p>A sound fluttered from across the room again.</p><p>\u201cHello, where are you?\u201d she called. Her voice was stronger. Angry. And a bit too tremulous. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, if you want me to stay, show yourself.\u201d</p><p>Candles on the altar flickered and wavered. There was a sudden, sweeping hiss of movement near her, very near her. It seemed to brush her hair.</p> <p>Slowly, she began to back away.</p><p>At first, she barely heard the creaking noise. It was the sound of a door. Moving slowly. The sound was somehow hideous in this shadowy, silent place. She turned, and the sound registered. It was indeed a door. The door to the strange church.</p><p>Closing.</p><p>Just as she started racing for it, it slammed with a vengeance.</p><p>She ran for the door, throwing herself against it. She pounded, slammed, swore, and pounded some more.</p><p>Finally, she exhausted herself.</p><p>She stared back at the altar. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny at all. I will go to the police. The polizia, do you hear me!\u201d Forcing her courage, she walked back toward the altar. \u201cI am leaving here, now, do you understand? Do you understand!\u201d</p><p>She called out, facing the altar.</p><p>Then . . .</p><p>It seemed as if ice touched her. As if a finger of cold stretched across the room, finding her nape, traced the line of her spine.</p><p>She spun around, and in surprise, she screamed aloud.</p><p>There he was. The figure in the dark cloak and the strange mask. She stared at him, her throat going dry.</p><p>For once, she had nothing to say.</p><p>He walked to her slowly. Very slowly. She could see his eyes. They were not so beautiful now, but she couldn\u2019t draw her gaze from him.</p><p>He reached her. He touched the front hooks on the bodice of her harem costume. She wanted to tell him no. She couldn\u2019t speak, and she couldn\u2019t draw her eyes from his. He slid his hands beneath the fabric on her shoulders, and the bodice fell to the floor with a strange whisper.</p><p>He stepped back.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he acknowledged.</p><p>Then he lifted his hands, as if in supplication to heaven. \u201cMy children .. . I bring you beauty!\u201d he said.</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t draw her eyes from his. She heard again the strange, whispered, rustling sound. A breeze, a hiss, blowing by her, lifting her hair . ..</p><p>And then the shadows moved.</p><p>And descended.</p><p>She was aware, in one split second, that she should have gone home. She should have married Josef, raised a dozen children, gotten fat, and baked bread.</p><p>She felt the first touch.</p><p>She started to scream .. .</p><p>And scream.</p><p>And as she was lifted to the altar, she realized that she had spoken the truth.</p><p>She was staying in Venice.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>By the time they reached the palazzo Anna Maria had rented for her ball, the festivities had already begun.</p><p>They were greeted at their water taxi by costumed hosts who helped them to the dock; as they neared the grand entrance, trumpets announced them.</p><p>They entered a spacious hall already crowded with guests in magnificent masks and costumes. People milled and talked, helping themselves to artistic little hors d\u2019oeuvres at side tables, and Bellinis and champagne passed by servers in traditional black serving attire.</p><p>From the moment they came in, Jared was greeted by various business acquaintances. He made many introductions, then got into a conversation about arrangements for a group of grad school artists who wanted to come to Venice the following year.</p><p>Cindy suggested they move off and help themselves to hors d\u2019oeuvres.</p><p>\u201cHey! Earth to Jordan. Shall we get something to munch on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. I was looking for Tiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll show up,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cJordan, honestly, I like Tiff. She\u2019s brash; she\u2019s had a past tarnished to pure rust, but she\u2019s fun. Still, Jared has made travel arrangements for her for years, and she changes her mind like the wind. Don\u2019t let her ruin your evening.\u201d</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t respond to that. Cindy didn\u2019t understand that Ragnor Wulfsson was an object of desire to Tiff. But then, Ragnor had stayed behind, there wasn\u2019t anything she could do, and the party was fun and entertaining. On the dais at the foot of the double stairway, harem girls were dancing to flute music.</p><p>Throughout the crowd, harlequins were practicing bits of magic. Everyone was dressed to the teeth; costumes were bejeweled as she\u2019d never seen before, there were gladiators, wood nymphs, Edwardians, knights and damsels. On the tables, there were ice sculptures, flower arrangements, shining silver coffee urns. The beauty and activity were almost too much to take in.</p><p>\u201cThose little pastry puffs are as good as they look,\u201d Cindy said between bites. \u201cAnd I\u2019m starving.\u201d Jordan stared at Cindy. She was wearing a half mask, plumed hat, and Regency dress. With her sandy blond hair and tall stature, she was dazzling, but beneath the mask, she looked a little pale. She must really need to eat, Jordan thought.</p><p>\u201cLead me to the table,\u201d she said.</p><p>As they were sampling the food, they were suddenly approached by an elegant Southern belle with a cinched waist, incredible spill of petticoats, and beautifully curled hair.</p><p>\u201cCiao!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCiao!\u201d Jordan replied, staring at the woman.</p><p>\u201cCiao,\u201d Cindy said politely.</p><p>They both waited expectantly. The belle burst into pleased laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d Jordan murmured.</p><p>He spun before them. \u201cAm I not magnificent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, yes!\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>He batted his lashes. Jordan wondered how he had managed the false eyelashes without so much as a hint of glue showing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d Jordan told him.</p><p>\u201cGrazie, grazie,\u201d Raphael demurred. \u201cAnd you, ladies! You\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone here is spectacular,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWell, few are anywhere near as spectacular as you,\u201d she teased. \u201cRaphael, have you seen Tiff Henley yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have not seen her?not that I know of any way. But if you had seen me and I hadn\u2019t spoken to you, would you know that you had seen me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Cindy said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be along,\u201d Raphael said, and frowned. \u201cWere you to meet her here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, but she had invited us to a cocktail party before the ball, and when we got there, she wasn\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>Raphael waved a hand in the air, indicating that Tiff could be flighty. \u201cShe probably forgot that she invited you.\u201d</p><p>Trumpets sounded again.</p><p>\u201cAh! There we are,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cThat is the announcement that we are to go up the stairs and take our places. Ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two go ahead,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cI\u2019m going to find my husband.\u201d Raphael linked arms with Jordan, smiling at her. \u201cThe fantasy costume is just right! You are sparkling and glorious, like a mythical siren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. But, you totally outdo me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed with pleasure. \u201cWe shall be the most beautiful, together. I made sure that I am seated at your table. Anna Maria wanted to put you, Jared and Cindy with all his business people, but I could not do that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m much more fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can dance. All the men will be trying to cut in on both of us. Depending on how cute they are, we\u2019ll let them cut in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Who else is at our table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLynn?she helped me convince Anna Maria that you could not be left with the chairman of the dental association\u2019s travel planner, or the agent for the American bankers group. His wife is ... well, she would be like sitting with a battleship, you know? She is gray and solid. I\u2019ve yet to see her smile. In fact, I think she came as Brunhilda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be a very nice lady.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow with a secret smile. \u201cI can still give up my place at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Who else is with us?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are ten at each table. At ours, Jared and Cindy, Lynn and I, a cookbook author and her husband, an English artist and his wife, and my friend, the policeman, Roberto Capo. You do like him, yes?\u201d</p><p>She liked Roberto Capo just fine. He hadn\u2019t seemed to think that she was crazy.</p><p>And she could ask him about the head that had been found in a canal.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Tiff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she was seated with other friends long ago. But we\u2019ll look for her later, if that will make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ragnor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe speaks so many languages so well?he has been seated with a mix of German and Scandinavian couples. In the north,\u201d he explained, \u201cmost people do speak English. Where else can you go but Sweden to speak Swedish, eh? Still, Anna Maria tries very hard to see that everyone will have dinner companions with whom they can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will she be sitting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnna Maria does not sit?she flits!\u201d Raphael explained. He rolled his eyes. \u201cShe is the hostess, and so she moves about all night, and makes sure that everyone enjoys the ball?of course, she is a slave driver until we get here. But she asks nothing that she doesn\u2019t give. She is wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond a doubt,\u201d Jordan agreed.</p><p>At the top of the stairs, they were greeted by hosts dressed as Swiss Guards. They were led into one of the large ballrooms off the foyer. More buffet tables were filled with all manner of delicacies. At the end of the room, on a dais, a group played chamber music.</p><p>\u201cHere we are!\u201d Raphael said, indicating their table. Roberto Capo and two other couples were already seated. The men stood as Raphael made introductions. The English artist was Peter Smith; his wife was Sherry.</p><p>The American author of cookbooks was Mary Winston; her husband was Fred. They were both round and cheery, as if they truly enjoyed Mary\u2019s recipes. Jordan didn\u2019t remember her name; she hoped that if she had ever reviewed one of the woman\u2019s books, her words had been kind.</p><p>\u201cAnd of course, Roberto,\u201d Raphael ended his introductions with a flourish.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, how are you?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cDelighted to see you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIl piacere e mio,\u201d she told him, glad that, \u201cthe pleasure is mine\u201d was one phrase she knew in Italian quite well.</p><p>He smiled; she took the seat next to his.</p><p>Lynn arrived then, as a matador, complete with dark mustache, red cape, and bull-slaying sword.</p><p>\u201cPlastic, I\u2019m afraid!\u201d she explained, when it seemed her sword might pierce Mary Winston\u2019s Martha Washington skirts.</p><p>Jared and Cindy arrived, and the introductions went around the table again. Jordan admired Anna Maria\u2019s social talents as she saw how quickly and easily they all fell into conversation. At times, she thought, Roberto Capo wasn\u2019t quite following everything that was said, but Raphael paused now and then to make a quick explanation in Italian. Waiters arrived to fill their wineglasses and they all trooped to the buffet table. \u201cMy name was Astrella before I married,\u201d Mary Winston told Jordan as they stood in the line. \u201cI do adore Italian food. My next book is on Tuscan cuisine. Perhaps you\u2019d review it for your newspapers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy publishing house is small,\u201d Mary said with a sigh, \u201cand your reviews are so popular in syndication, they\u2019ve not dared send you anything yet. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I didn\u2019t know I was so popular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, have you tried this dish yet? In English, it\u2019s cuttlefish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I have tried it,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have the swordfish.\u201d As conversations took off at dinner, Jordan was grateful to be next to Roberto Capo. She spoke to him quietly. \u201cI heard they found a severed head.\u201d</p><p>Roberto looked distressed. \u201cYou must not worry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... you think that you were right? That at the contessa\u2019s ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that. It\u2019s just curious. Have they found out who the head belonged to? Have they?\u201d She broke off. He was looking at her, frowning. She realized that she was speaking too quickly.</p><p>But Raphael had heard her. He translated quietly, glancing at the others at the table, aware that Jordan wouldn\u2019t want Jared to know what they were talking about.</p><p>Roberto shook his head and replied in Italian to Raphael.</p><p>\u201cThe head is still with forensics. They haven\u2019t found the rest of the body, and they have no missing persons report with which to make a comparison. They will do an artist\u2019s reconstruction and send the picture around Europe.\u201d</p><p>Jordan was disappointed; she hadn\u2019t learned anything new.</p><p>\u201cI understand your concern,\u201d Roberto said.</p><p>Jordan nodded. Jared was glancing her way suspiciously. As he turned his head she noticed that his features appeared lean and sharp. Maybe she had caused Jared a lot more trouble than she was willing to admit. Maybe that explained Cindy\u2019s pallor and fatigue.</p><p>Still, she hadn\u2019t been wrong. Either the contessa had hosted a group of murderous monsters, or her sense of humor and entertainment were warped beyond measure.</p><p>Dessert and coffee were served, and more activities for the guests were announced. On the ground floor, a rock band would be playing, while there would be ballroom dancing on the second floor. Tarot card readings were in the entry to the second floor ballroom. Palm readers would be there as well.</p><p>Jugglers and magicians would travel to both levels. More coffee, sweets, and after-dinner liqueurs would be available at all the banquet tables. The \u2018Pleasure Palace,\u2019 for those who dared, would be in the back room of the second level.</p><p>\u201cShall we dance?\u201d Raphael inquired immediately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been asked by such a charming belle,\u201d Jordan assured him.</p><p>Raphael wanted the fast action on the ground floor, but as he started to lead her down, Jordan made him pause. \u201cWhere was Tiff supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTable seven, in the room where they\u2019ll be setting up the Pleasure Palace. I think she wanted to make several trips,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>They walked over to table seven; it was already empty. It appeared, however, that someone had been seated at every chair.</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cYou see why we don\u2019t worry so much about Tiff? Don\u2019t be angry; enjoy your night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Where was Ragnor supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTable eighteen?the next flight up.\u201d He groaned. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll look.\u201d But upstairs, the tables had emptied as well.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they both decided to get lucky,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cGive them no more thought.\u201d Downstairs, they danced. As Raphael had expected, they were often cut in on. A dottore came and danced with Jordan. She was certain at first that it was Jared, but as she talked, and he failed to respond, she realized it wasn\u2019t he. He thanked her in Italian for the dance.</p><p>There had been something so familiar about him ...</p><p>But as she was claimed by a short Julius Caesar, she noted that there were at least five dottores in the room. All of them seemed to be about the same height.</p><p>Around midnight, Raphael excused himself to dance with Anna Maria. This time, she was partnered by a handsome Basque jai alai player who had fun showing her the immense muscle in his right arm, and the smaller muscle in his left. She thought at first that he was explaining his costume, he wasn\u2019t. The game had given him two definitely different-sized arms.</p><p>As the dance ended, Jordan thanked him and hurried after Anna Maria and Raphael. Anna Maria, resplendent as Mary, Queen of Scots, kissed her cheeks. Jordan told her that the party was wonderful, then asked about Tiff.</p><p>She gave her the same reply Raphael had given earlier. \u201cShe must be very well costumed; I have not seen her.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI believe all the tables wound up full, but then, though people are seated, many, many people here have known one another for years, and they ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTable hop,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cTable hop. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have our cards read!\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201dJordan murmured.</p><p>But the next thing she knew, she was upstairs, watching as an Italian woman spread out her cards. She indicated that Jordan was to touch them. When she turned the cards over, she shook her head and shuffled them again. This time, Jordan gave close attention to what appeared. She saw the Grim Reaper before the woman could collect the cards.</p><p>\u201cThat was death, right?\u201d Jordan insisted of Raphael.</p><p>\u201cIt can mean many tilings, she says.\u201d</p><p>The tarot reader spoke quickly and earnestly in Italian. She looked at Jordan as if she were about to whip out a cross and put it between them to ward her off.</p><p>\u201cRaphael ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says that you must watch out for the shadows. And take the gravest care at deep midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is warning me of death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the card may mean many things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut death is one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, watch out for the shadows. And deep midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is deep midnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe true dead of night. When all light has faded. When shadows fall even in darkness. Let\u2019s dance again. This was not good.\u201d</p><p>Downstairs, Roberto Capo was the first one to cut in on her. As they danced, he asked her if she was happy, if she was having fun.</p><p>\u201cYes, very much so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look so worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to a friend\u2019s house tonight and she wasn\u2019t there. And she isn\u2019t here.\u201d She made certain to speak slowly. \u201cTiff Henley. Do you know her?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhen did you see her . .. last time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the head?it is not hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, of course not. I\u2019m just worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you do not find her. And if you ... if you find out anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the contessa?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe contessa ... this man who was there as well. The wolf?\u201d She wondered what expression she gave, or what movement she made that caused him to say next, </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have seen the man again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.

If your friend does not appear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>A moment later, Raphael was sweeping down on her again. \u201cThe Pleasure Palace! We must go do the Pleasure Palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do they do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey strip off your clothing, bathe you with oil and honey, and ravish you mercilessly!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll skip it.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. They bathe your hands in hot oils and slip cold sweet grapes between your lips. It\u2019s fun; it\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let up. \u201cIf I wind up ravished mercilessly, I\u2019ll never forgive you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIf they start to ravish me mercilessly, and you stop them, I\u2019ll never forgive you!\u201d he replied. \u201cCome, come, we\u2019ll have fun.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, many people shared that view. The lines were long?one on either side of a brilliantly colored harem-like tent set up in the rear of the room. It appeared that they were mixing couples, taking one person at a time from each side of the line. A woman dressed as Marie Antoinette appeared with a man costumed as Julius Caesar. They were both laughing.</p><p>\u201cViene, viene! Come, come!\u201d beckoned one of the girls in a harem costume. She held open the festooned flap to the tent.</p><p>Raphael gave Jordan a little push.</p> <p>She stepped forward and into the tent.</p><p>The flap fell, and instantly, she felt as if she had stepped into a black pit.</p><p>For a moment, there was nothing. The darkness seemed overwhelming.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment, thinking that it would help her adjust to the total darkness. She had the strangest feeling of being pulled forward.</p><p>Come to me.</p><p>She wondered if she had heard the words, or imagined them. There was a scent in the tent; probably some kind of an incense, and yet. ..</p><p>Sandalwood, she thought. It reminded her of Steven. So much was reminding her of Steven lately. It was, she reflected ruefully, the intense attraction she was feeling for another man. Steven was gone, lost to her. It was all right to move on.</p><p>Come to me.</p> <p>The words were so strongly set into her mind that she nearly walked forward. But she did not; the darkness was suddenly overwhelming. Fear bubbled in her, an almost uncontrollable panic. Something was going to jump out at her, rush her, sweep her into something horrible.</p><p>She could feel it, sense it, nearly taste it, touch it. . .</p><p>There was a very gentle touch on her hand. She almost screamed aloud. But she could see then, faintly.</p><p>The harem girl was wearing something in her headband that glowed in the dark.</p><p>The girl took her right hand. Another person reached for her left hand. She was drawn a step deeper into the tent, and then, though she didn\u2019t touch anyone, she was aware that she was standing in front of another person. She felt the rays of warmth that seemed to surround her.</p><p>Her fear subsided. The strangest sense of total well-being stilled her rising panic.</p><p>Her palms were brought upward. Warm oil was poured into them and rubbed gently into the flesh. Her hair was lifted. The warmth was rubbed into her nape. Something cool and exotic touched her lips.</p><p>A grape.</p><p>She obediently ate it.</p><p>She could hear the person opposite her breathing. A man, evidently; the figure was tall. The whisper of his breath held a sweet scent of wine. He exuded an aura of power, and that strength and masculinity apparently gave her the sense of calm and security that now enwrapped her.</p><p>Great! she thought briefly. This is someone\u2019s husband, for all I know!</p><p>The warmth he emitted touched her cheeks like a surge of sunlit air. A grape was pressed between her fingers, then she realized that they were being handed grapes to slip to one another. A grape touched her mouth again. She parted her lips and took it, marveling that the whole thing should have been rather silly, but that it wasn\u2019t. She brought her grape to her darkly shadowed partner\u2019s lips, and he too took in the fruit.</p><p>They were closer than they had been. She didn\u2019t remember being so close.</p><p>The oils that had been worked in at her nape and her palms seemed to grow hotter. A whisper of deepening heat seemed to work its way into her. A languor stole over her; she could easily lean forward, find the hands that touched her, will them to work their magic ...</p><p>Fingers pressed into her shoulders in a kneading massage. She felt the tension slip away, felt the stranger\u2019s breath, and a stealing ray of lightning sweep through her. She closed her eyes. She could sleep, she could curl up with a total stranger, she could feel a sweet and slow-burning fire that somehow came with the languor, but defied it. Knuckles brushed her throat, caressing softly. Her hands were drawn to the stranger, to his cheek, to the lapel of his jacket, down the fabric of the breast. Something came to her lips again. Wine. Warm, rich, fruity. Delicious. Then fingers again, on her shoulders, stroking her cheeks</p><p>A chime sounded, startling her from the reverie which had laid claim to her. The harem girl with the glow-in-the-dark headdress took her hand again, leading her to the exit.</p><p>She stepped through the flap and was startled, then angry, to find Ragnor right in front of her, waiting to help her down the steps. She had taken his hand before even seeing him. What an idiot. She should have known, should have recognized his scent, the size of him, the height!</p><p>\u201cYou planned that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, we were in opposite lines! And you walked into the Pleasure Palace of your own volition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d Raphael called, ready to slip beneath the flap of the tent. \u201cWere you wildly ravished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d he said, just as the harem girl slipped beneath the flap.</p><p>Ragnor was openly amused.</p><p>\u201cThat was very rude,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re not supposed to know who you\u2019re getting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe glad I was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else might have ravished you. You were putty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutty. Jelly. Molding clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? I do beg your pardon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to be there for you. You were just ... compelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompelled! When I walked in, I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were what?\u201d he demanded, frowning.</p><p>\u201cScared,\u201d she admitted. She left him standing by the tent and started across the room; Raphael would have to fend for himself when he came out. After all, he was Italian, and this was his shop\u2019s party.</p><p>But then she paused, looking back. Ragnor had been following her at a leisurely pace.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Tiff?\u201d she asked him. \u201cWas she home?had she not heard us? Or gone out? Did she come here with you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his eyes suddenly guarded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I waited. I didn\u2019t see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t seen her at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Before Jordan could question him further, Raphael rushed up to them, his turn in the Pleasure Palace complete. He put an arm around Jordan\u2019s waist and buried his head against her shoulder. \u201cUgh! You two</p><p>... you two got each other! And me .. . allora!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Were you ravished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly eaten alive by a four-hundred-pound Amazon! She giggled insufferably and put her fingers where they were not supposed to be put!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to be ravished,\u201d Jordan reminded him politely.</p><p>\u201cYes, but. .. one wants to be ravished by the right people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take your chances in the Pleasure Palace,\u201d Ragnor said, then added, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d He left them, and started toward the one open balcony where the smokers, and those who just needed some air, had gathered.</p><p>Jordan watched him go, nonplused. She\u2019d been so angry to discover that he had been the one with her.</p><p>Because again, she had felt that intense . .. beguilement. After the fear. The very real and horrible fear she had experienced at first.</p><p>Just by standing there, he had done something that had lulled her. Maybe she should have remained afraid.</p><p>But now had walked away. She felt at a loss.</p><p>And cold again, as if his warmth were seeping away.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to dancing,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>On their way back through the second floor ballroom, Jordan noticed Cindy and Jared waltzing together. When they reached the ground floor, they stopped for espressos laced with liqueur.</p><p>There were at least three dottores on the dance floor.</p><p>They had barely begun when Roberto Capo cut in on Jordan. \u201cMy friend never showed up,\u201d she told him, shouting over the music. \u201cI\u2019m worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are certain that she isn\u2019t here?somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain of anything, but she wasn\u2019t at her palazzo tonight, which was strange, very strange.</p><p>Having that little party meant a lot to her. I\u2019m worried, and you\u2019re the only one who listens to me.\u201d She was exasperated, and probably speaking too quickly for him, but he seemed to understand her.</p><p>\u201cCome tomorrow to the station. To see me. Me, you understand?\u201d She nodded her thanks, then quickly fell silent. Over his shoulder, she could see a dottore approaching.</p><p>The dottore cut in. Jared?</p><p>Unease welled within her. Because it might be Jared?</p><p>Or because it might not?</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>The dottore was a German with a good grasp of Italian and a little English. He was a pleasant man.</p><p>As they danced, she saw that Cindy had come down with Jared. At least, she thought it was Jared.</p><p>Her German dottore was fun, and a wild dancer. After three numbers, she was breathless, and begged herself off the dance floor. Downing a tall glass of mineral water, she saw that there were now at least four dottores in the room.</p><p>She wished that Jared had opted for something a little more original, at least chosen different costumes for each party. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few moments later, she was pulled out to the floor by another dottore. She stared into his eyes the best she could while moving to the music.</p><p>No, not Jared.</p><p>During an excellent interpretation of an Elvis Presley ballad, Ragnor cut in on the dottore. She thought about protesting, then wondered why. She was attracted to him. She liked being with him, even if her thoughts ran to the erotic. She was an adult; Steven had been gone now for a long time. She didn\u2019t deserve the guilt with which she seemed to be punishing herself.</p> <p>She allowed herself to be drawn comfortably into his arms.</p><p>\u201cStill no sign of Tiff?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something really wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may still turn up,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t think that he believed that.</p><p>When the song broke, she told him that she was thirsty. A cold beer seemed the best thirst quencher, since there had been so much dancing that they had actually run out of bottled water.</p><p>For a moment, Jordan reflected on what she might be doing to her liver. Champagne, Bellinis, red wine, espresso with Kahlua, and now beer. But it was very cold and felt so good going down.</p><p>Ragnor wasn\u2019t wearing a mask or sunglasses. For once, she could see his eyes. He seemed to be searching for someone.</p><p>\u201cLooking for Tiff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, as if she had startled him. \u201cUm. Excuse me for a moment, will you?\u201d Once again, he simply walked off.</p> <p>Lynn found her by the table. \u201cHey, that\u2019s my favorite disco song. Want to dance with a matador?\u201d Jordan looked out to the floor. Guests had begun to depart, and the dancing had gotten down to a group of happy?partly sloshed?people wildly moving about. As usual at most such gatherings, the sex of a partner didn\u2019t matter anymore. People were just having fun.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe costume may not have been such a great idea,\u201d Lynn admitted, shouting above the music as she gyrated. \u201cNo cute guys have hit on me! Actually, no guys have hit on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it might be the mustache!\u201d Jordan called back to her.</p><p>A moment later, another dottore popped in front of her. Lynn had turned around to dance with the gypsy sun god on her other side.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>Jordan raised her brows, looking at her companion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Jared. Are you having fun? What\u2019s the matter, too many Venetian friends? You don\u2019t talk to me anymore?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cJared, I\u2019ve tried conversations with a German and, I think, a Brazilian dottore. How was I suppose to know this one was you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m tall and devastatingly handsome, even in a cloak and mask!\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cHow silly of me! I forgot!\u201d she teased. \u201cHey, have you seen Tiff yet?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut if I had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. You might not have recognized her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be like Tiff to purposely stand us all up, create an air of mystery, and then tell us tomorrow that she was the silver space alien or the woman in the Swarovski crystal cloak and mask. Did you see that costume? Man, it was spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone here is spectacular.\u201d</p><p>The music had taken a break; she realized that she had shouted that last comment. A slow tune began again.</p><p>\u201cGo find your wife!\u201d Jordan told her cousin.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, right? Having a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He moved off. Jordan walked back to the buffet table where they were beginning to pack up what was left of the food. A waiter handed her another beer. She shrugged, thanked him, and accepted it. She watched the dancers and found herself approached by the sun god.</p><p>\u201cPer piacere. Please?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>With a rueful shrug and a smile, she took a long swallow of the beer, set it down, and allowed him to lead her to the floor.</p><p>As they danced, he told her not to miss the Peggy Guggenheim museum. She assured him she had seen it several times.</p><p>\u201cAnd the churches! So many, but you must try to see them. There are over two hundred.\u201d The sun god was an Italian with a good conversational knowledge of English. \u201cWhen an address is \u2018Campo\u2019</p><p>something or the other, it means a square with a church. Pop into any of them; you\u2019ll be astonished at the art work you find, especially in some of the lesser known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a great church the other day, but . . . oh, a friend stopped me. Maybe I can find it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake an effort to do so.\u201d</p><p>The band leader announced the last number of the night: another Elvis Presley song, slow and sweet.</p><p>\u201cHe likes Elvis,\u201d Jordan commented to her partner.</p><p>The sun god nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s my friend, Rico Andretti. He knows every song Elvis ever wrote. He loves this party; so many Americans. And he sounds like Elvis, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does, he\u2019s excellent.\u201d</p><p>The sun god was pleased with her comment. And he was a very decent dancer. When the number ended, he asked her if she needed a walk back to her hotel.</p><p>Over his shoulder, she saw a dottore at the door. Tall, dark-haired. And surely, devastatingly handsome, even in a mask.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but no. I came with family. They\u2019re just leaving.\u201d Her partner graciously bowed aside.</p><p>The dottore slipped out the door.</p><p>Jordan followed, looking around as she did so. No sign of Lynn, Anna Maria, or even Raphael. They must be there somewhere; Jordan was certain that Anna Maria never left her own ball until the last guest had departed. But all she saw were the caterers cleaning up and a few people slipping out to the dock beyond.</p><p>She started across the floor, anxious to reach the dottore.</p><p>A hand caught her arm before she could cross the marble floor. She stopped, turning. Ragnor was there.</p><p>\u201cI need to catch up with Jared,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left a few minutes ago with Cindy. She wasn\u2019t feeling well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he just left me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you have friends here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she paused, staring at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think that he likes you very much, and he doesn\u2019t trust you at all.\u201d</p><p>Ragnor shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s natural. But you cannot go home alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Venice. It\u2019s a very safe city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the same hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re free to follow me.\u201d</p><p>The last of the vaporettos had left with most of the guests; they waited with a few stragglers?all going in different directions?for water taxis.</p><p>They wound up last in line.</p><p>\u201cSee, you\u2019re supposed to be grateful for me,\u201d Ragnor told her, as a group ahead of them boarded a water taxi.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one left.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head toward the Swiss Guard who was standing on the dock, ready to hail their taxi.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone is stranger than you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat may be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk more about yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust what you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I feel that you\u2019re a very dangerous character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am?in a way.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWe never get anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would, if you\u2019d let us,\u201d he said very softly. A breeze stirred, and it felt as if there was a warmth to it, though the night was chill. His words were definitely a sexual innuendo. And to herself, there was no denying that it evoked a sexual response.</p><p>Yet even as she felt a growing excitement, a slow burn within, she thought she heard a hissing sound.</p><p>Looking back toward the palazzo, it seemed that shadows swooped and fell around the entry. She looked up at the sky, wondering if the moon had been covered. A sense of fear and unease in the darkness again swept through her.</p><p>Yes, she was glad that he was there.</p><p>Inadvertently, she took a step closer to him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t protest when he slipped an arm around her shoulder.</p><p>The water taxi arrived. The Swiss Guard and driver helped her on; Ragnor followed closely.</p><p>The water taxi took off flying over the canals. She realized then that she\u2019d definitely had far too much to drink. Her head was swimming.</p><p>She leaned against his shoulder. Fingers smoothed her hair beneath the fantasy headdress she was wearing. The touch was nice. She gave way to it.</p><p>A moment later, they\u2019d reached the dock near the Danieli.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked him, trying to steady herself to disembark.</p><p>\u201cAlmost three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lord, we did close that party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeep midnight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She shook her head. That expression again. He hopped out of the water taxi, and she noted that he was careful to skirt any possibility of slipping into the seawater. He helped her out; she was more careless herself, and amused.</p><p>\u201cAfraid of water?\u201d she teased, as he steadied her on the dock.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, that water is very, very cold.\u201d</p><p>He started leading her toward the hotel. As they reached the promenade, she looked back toward the dock.</p><p>Shadows, changing, shifting. She gave her head a shake, thinking again that she heard whispers, and flutterings, like the sounds made by birds. Bats ...</p><p>But there could be no bats near the docks.</p><p>Ragnor turned back. The sounds stopped. Were they real, or had she imagined them? Had he stopped them by merely looking that way?</p><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s get to the room. It is very late. And clouds are coming. The moon will be covered.\u201d She leaned against him as they walked. \u201cAre you afraid of the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the dark.\u201d</p><p>As they neared the door to the hotel, she paused again, looking back. A shadow seemed to stretch nearly to the door; it shifted, receded. Fear stole into her. She could have sworn she heard whispering again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Ragnor was aware of it, he gave no sign. He urged her into the hotel. They stopped for their keys. She gave her room number; he gave his.</p><p>\u201cSo you really do have a room here,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOf course. What did you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she told him honestly, then added softly, \u201cWell, goodnight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your room.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not objecting.</p><p>When she opened her door, he entered first. She watched him, amused, as he went through the room, checking the bathroom, the bedroom area, the sitting area, and then beneath the bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you expecting an evil chambermaid?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>She leaned against the door. Her head continued to spin. She wondered wryly if she\u2019d heard whispering, or the sloshing of alcohol in her own veins.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, responding with a question rather than an answer.</p><p>\u201cPerfectly,\u201d she said, but stumbled as she tried to cross the floor with dignity.</p><p>He laughed, coming to her aid, leading her to the foot of the bed. \u201cToo much booze, eh?\u201d he queried, sitting beside her. \u201cYour fairy crown is on the side of your head.\u201d As he spoke, he reached for the headdress, removing the pins and untangling it from her hair. He cast it toward the armchair facing the shuttered window by the bed. Perfect aim. He hadn\u2019t even looked. His eyes were on hers. His fingers threaded into her hair, smoothing it. Knuckles grazed her cheek. Then he kissed her.</p><p>The heat that instantly pervaded her was electric. Like a shock, it traveled from her mouth to her torso and limbs; she trembled, instinctively curling her arms around his neck, holding on to something steady.</p><p>He kissed like a practiced lover, parting her lips with a controlled, hot, wet passion. She tasted his lips, his tongue; the movement of it within her mouth seemed to be an invasion so intimate it elicited anticipation throughout her body. When his lips parted from hers, a bare breath away, she felt the moistness, the hint of slow, burning lava that remained. She felt the rising thunder of her heart; the pulse of blood, the fever of it. She inhaled with a deep shudder.</p><p>Should I have?</p> <p>Had he spoken the words, or like shadows and whispers in the night, had she imagined them?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. His eyes were still on hers. She moistened her lips to speak again, silently praying first. Dear God, don\u2019t let it be the alcohol!</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t, and she knew it though the words she spoke next were surely helped along by the flames of too many Bellinis. \u201cActually ... I\u2019ve been dying to see your chest\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he murmured softly, his whisper then against her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll show you mine . .. if you\u2019ll show me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very old line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so old as you think.\u201d</p><p>She reached up, touched the planes of his face, and found his mouth again. His lips remained fused to hers, tongue entangled, as he struggled from the Edwardian coat and cravat and shirt. She broke from the kiss, breathless again, her palms against his chest. Muscle rippled there, almost as if he were a weight lifter. Something else. He wore a medallion. A religious medallion. Beautiful, old, of a Celtic design. It appeared to be a finely crafted cross. She felt a strange relief flood through her. Surely this had to mean . . .</p><p>That he liked jewelry?</p> <p>She realized that she was just standing there, staring.</p><p>\u201cWell? Did you just want to see my chest, or were you planning on doing something with it?\u201d She nuzzled against the supple plane of it, fingering the medallion, feeling a greater flood of longing. It had to be okay . . .</p><p>The intoxication of touching him was overwhelming. She forgot the medallion, and all her fears. \u201cI always thought you had great hands, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, you know, I wouldn\u2019t want to seem loose or easy or anything, but lots of people have seen my hands. But not so many know what they can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that spectacular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can judge for yourself.\u201d</p><p>He scooped her to him, bearing her down to the expanse of the bed, his mouth on hers, lingering on her throat, moving down to her collarbone, to the cleft in the fantasy costume. She wasn\u2019t sure how or when, and she must have been a participant, but the white and gold costume was off, and she was quickly aware of just how talented he was with his hands ... and his mouth, and even the contours of his body.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted the shirt gone, in the stirrings of her mind, and wanted more gone, and in minutes, she wasn\u2019t thinking at all, and there were no ghosts to disturb her, no conscious thought at all. He was a wall of muscle, and dexterity, and he touched her with a searing hunger, a fierce passion that was tempered only by tenderness. She wanted to crawl within him, inside his very skin, come closer with each new wave of raw desire that assailed her. She would have been the one to forgo seduction and foreplay, so eager and desperate had she become, but he was the consummate lover. Yet, she thought, in a far distant corner of her mind, she had been seduced long ago.</p><p>Beguiled.</p><p>Yet, Lord, was it good ...</p><p>His stroke brought her closer to ultimate intimacy, each touch of his lips was a caress against a new zone of her flesh, traveling, discovering, eliciting ever greater abandon. She buried herself against him, writhed, arched, felt the trail of touch and liquid fire bum over her limbs, her breasts, low against her belly. She felt like a ship caught in a storm, swept in a sea of sensation so acute and overwhelming that it left no room for conscious thought or movement His flesh seemed to burn beneath her fingers, a bastion of sinew that aroused with each breath. He moved between her thighs. Sounds escaped her, words, cries ... the storm and sea became a part of her, and though she could not crawl into his flesh, he at last rose above her, and even as he thrust into her, she felt as if the room became a burst of light as an orgasm shook through her with a force that seemed to stop the world. She soared on clouds of ethereal shadows, felt the power of his movement, and flew ever higher.</p><p>The night became a blur.</p><p>The night.</p><p>Deep midnight. Blues of a dark, moonlit sky, the blood-red colors of sunset. Hunger that became an agony of desire, moisture, lava, flying again, sensations of eroticism and fulfillment that left her shaken again and again. Fire and light, ash and shadows; cinders that sparked anew, again and again, to a blaze.</p><p>She came so many times, she was intoxicated with the feelings, and then she was exhausted, so replete, and so glad to lie against him. And still, the darkness, just the feel of him beside her, and with it, no nightmares, no ghosts haunting her dreams, no wolves sitting at the foot of her bed. She slept, secure, ecstatic, warmed ...</p><p>Safe.</p><p>Safe. The world mocked her as she fell into the depths of her sleep.</p><p>He remained a stranger. Stranger, by far, than a passerby on the street.</p><p>Strange. . .</p><p>Was she a total fool?</p><p>Totally . . .</p><p>Beguiled.</p><p>She woke with a pounding headache, groaning aloud, and bemoaning her mix of wine, beer, champagne, and after-dinner drinks. She glanced instantly to the side of her bed.</p><p>No one.</p><p>For a brief moment, she wondered if she might have enjoyed an alcoholic dream of bizarrely erotic proportions. She realized then that she was naked, and that the fantasy costume lay at the foot of her bed. A glance at the bedside clock told her that it was nearly three in the afternoon. She could hear movement in the hall beyond her door.</p><p>The maid, she thought, waiting patiently to get in.</p><p>That thought sent her flying out of bed, headache or no. If he had left, her door should be unlocked.</p><p>Yet, when she reached it, she found that it was securely bolted.</p><p>She stepped back, frowning.</p><p>How the hell had he managed that?</p><p>Had she imagined it all?</p><p>Lord, no, she couldn\u2019t have! There had to be an explanation. He had gotten someone to come, and lock the door from the outside. Surely.</p><p>She stared at the door, and her head pounded anew. She walked into the bathroom and quickly downed two Motrin. She turned the water on in the shower, hot and hard, and stood beneath it.</p><p>She leaned against the tile, just letting the water wash over her, praying that the Motrin would kick in, and her headache would fade.</p><p>She dressed quickly, she\u2019d give her eyeteeth for coffee. She paused by her computer and saw the,</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got mail!\u201d announcement floating by. She quickly clicked in.</p><p>There was an amazing amount of spam, jokes from friends, a note from her agent and at the last, a quick note from the cop in New Orleans who had written the book. \u201cI\u2019d love to talk to you.\u201d He left an address and a phone number.</p><p>It was late in Italy; still early in the states. She E-mailed him back, saying that she\u2019d call later, and thanking him for his response.</p><p>Armed with both books, she headed upstairs for coffee and something to eat. The American couple was there again, and they greeted her pleasantly. She looked around for Ragnor, but as yet, he hadn\u2019t put in an appearance.</p><p>She opened her book and read about a case that had occurred in an Old West mining town near San Francisco when the gold rush had been on. A saloon girl had taken sick after a mysterious miner had passed through town. She\u2019d died; the town lamented her death, and buried her. Nights later, she began to appear to her old customers in their dreams. Three men were taken sick and eventually died. Then they, too, began to appear in dreams. The sheriff was a realistic, logical fellow, but he had still ordered his deputies out by day; the corpses of the \u201cspirits\u201d were exhumed, and their heads severed before they were burned to ash. Afterwards, there were no more appearances, and no more of the strange, fading sicknesses.</p><p>She flipped to a case of serial killings in the Midwest in the late fifties. The killer?a white male, thirty years old, married, with one child, and a blue collar job? had thought himself a vampire. His victims had been tortured, raped, and drained of blood. He had gained access through the sliding glass doors of victims\u2019 homes, selecting them because they lived alone in ground floor apartments surrounded by shrubbery.</p><p>He wrote letters to the police, warning that \u201cvoices\u201d had told him that he was a descendant of Vlad Dracul, and that he was forced to drink blood to survive. The police actually warned women living alone to line their sliding glass doors with garlic, wear large crosses, and keep vials of holy water at hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When finally apprehended, the killer told police that indeed, several women had been spared because he hadn\u2019t been able to enter their apartments because of the garlic.</p><p>Jordan sat back, staring at the book. She wondered if Italian would-be vampires might consider themselves immune to garlic.</p><p>She found herself thinking about Ragnor. She never saw him in the early hours of the day. He had a strange habit of appearing when she expected him to be elsewhere, and disappearing when she was sure he had just been near. He would tell her nothing about his past.</p> <p>She suddenly jumped up, thanked the waiter who was always so attentive and kind, and hurried back to her room.</p><p>She turned on every light and stood in front of the mirror. She studied her neck thoroughly. Not a pinprick. She felt foolish.</p><p>She looked at her E-mail. No return as of yet. She bundled her two vampire books into her bag and hurried out of the hotel, eager to reach the district station where Roberto Capo worked.</p><p>It was very much like any police station at home. There was an information officer at the front desk.</p><p>There were a number of people there, all speaking among themselves in different languages. She didn\u2019t need to speak Italian to realize that two of the women being ushered in were being arrested for prostitution. A balding man ahead of her had lost his wallet in a gondola. The pretty Italian woman at her side was bringing her husband some lunch.</p> <p>Jordan asked for Roberto Capo, apparently managing the question in Italian so well that the officer gave her a long reply?none of which she understood. But he read her baffled expression and smiled. \u201cRoberto was in this morning and just left. He was not feeling well.\u201d The officer shrugged. \u201cHe had last night off.</p><p>He\u2019ll be in tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. Does he usually work mornings, or nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, during Carnevale? He works all hours. Call if you like, before you come in. I\u2019m Dominic Donatello. I\u2019ll be on days from nine to five for the next week. I\u2019ll find out his hours for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the American who was frightened at the contessa\u2019s party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks one more time. Especially for not laughing at me.\u201d He waved a hand in the air. \u201cWomen like the contessa . .. they don\u2019t realize that there is real crime in the world and one must not make fun of death and terror.\u201d</p><p>Jordan suddenly heard her name called. She turned; it was Alfredo Manetti.</p><p>\u201cMiss Riley, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked politely. \u201cCome, come, into my office.\u201d A moment later, she was seated at the all too familiar desk where she had been made to feel a fool after the contessa\u2019s party. But this morning, Alfredo seemed to have no intention of making her feel foolish.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still upset,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She leaned forward, folding her hands on the desk. \u201cI\u2019m sure my cousin explained all this to you before.</p><p>I was engaged to a homicide cop, and he was killed in the pursuit of cultists. I know that such people are out there. And now?you have a severed head.\u201d</p><p>Alfredo leaned forward then. \u201cAnd I assure you, forensics are working studiously on discovering the identity of the man and the cause of his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I would say that the removal of a man\u2019s head is a good reason for death,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He flushed; the tables were somewhat turned.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine is missing. Tiff Henley.\u201d</p><p>Alfredo threw up his hands. \u201cMrs. Henley comes and goes like the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she had invited a group of us over, and she wasn\u2019t there. And she didn\u2019t show up at the party last night. I\u2019d like you to find out what has happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will find out what I can about your friend,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as to the contessa . . . she has contributed huge sums of money for orphaned children throughout Italy. She helps finance large groups of poor Europeans, just so that they can see the wonder of Venice. She is generous to a fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m accusing the contessa of nothing. I\u2019m merely saying that I believe something bad is going on, and that if it doesn\u2019t stop, many people might die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take your words to heart,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She rose, wondering if he meant what he said, or if he was mocking her. She was determined to talk to Roberto Capo, no matter how difficult it might be. It was aggravating to have to wait another day, but she didn\u2019t intend to say anything more to Alfredo Manetti.</p><p>She thanked him and left the station.</p><p>As she entered the lobby of the Danieli, the concierge called her to say that he\u2019d received a message for hen Roberto Capo had called the hotel and wished to meet her. He had left an address for a trattoria where she could find him until seven-thirty or eight.</p><p>She glanced at her watch. It was just five, but she decided to leave right away.</p><p>The concierge brought out a map and showed her how to reach the address, suggesting that she might want to take a water taxi, since it was a bit of a walk. She didn\u2019t mind walking, and according to the map, she could take a side calle or two and stop by Tiff\u2019s, knock on the door, and see if by chance Tiff would respond today.</p><p>She thanked the concierge and headed back out.</p><p>Five o\u2019clock, and it was already getting dark, she noted.</p><p>In front of the hotel, she stood still for a minute, listening. All she heard was the chatter, laughter and the occasional shout that rose on the promenade. A vaporetto had pulled in at the dock; there were plenty of people out and around.</p><p>She remained still for several more seconds and realized that she was listening for the sound of wings, for hisses and whispers on the air.</p><p>There were none.</p><p>At Tiff\u2019s, she pounded on the door and waited ten minutes, knocking again and again. Tiff made no appearance.</p><p>At last giving up, Jordan decided to start her walk to the trattoria.</p><p>At first, she ran into people here and there. The festivities for Carnevale were beginning to wind down; though some people still wore costumes, headed to private parties or events, more and more people were wearing street clothes, and seemed to be going about their daily business.</p><p>As she came closer to the area where she was to meet Roberto, she realized that she was encountering fewer and fewer people. Once again, as she followed the map, she crossed over one little bridge after another.</p><p>There were fewer shops.</p><p>Fewer lights.</p><p>She realized uneasily that it had grown very dark; the night came on quickly in Venice in the winter. The evening was chill, and clouds were passing over the moon.</p><p>\u201cIt may snow again,\u201d she told herself out loud, and realized that as she was speaking she was growing afraid.</p><p>She stared at the map again and started across another little bridge. Something looked familiar here.</p><p>She realized she was heading in the same direction she had come when she followed the dottore and ran into Salvatore D\u2019Onofrio and saw the beautiful, but decrepit, old church.</p><p>Just then, she found herself halting in the center of the bridge. What there was of moonlight fell upon her here.</p><p>On either side of the bridge, the buildings seemed to melt into shadow. She swallowed hard, turning.</p><p>Down the narrow canal, she could see another bridge. And standing in the center?-just as she was standing?she could see the caped figure of a dottore. He seemed highlighted in moonlight, and all around him, the world seemed to be in shadow.</p><p>She wondered if she imagined the figure.</p><p>It beckoned to her. She felt her heart thundering. Instinct warned her that she should run along, but she stood still, just feeling the slam of her heart against her chest.</p><p>Then the dottore turned, and seemed to float across the bridge, cape flying behind him.</p><p>She did hurry then; she started to run. As she came across a shadowed walkway, a hissing sound seemed to surround her ears. She told herself that it was the sound of her own breathing.</p><p>She sensed the strangeness fluttering around her, as if a dozen birds flew by, close to her ears, twittering, whispering .. .</p><p>She tried to read her map while running. She burst from the shadowed walkway to a dark piazza, with lights here and there.</p><p>Looking down an alley, cast in an eerie mist of shadow and light, she could see the old derelict church.</p><p>Again, she stood still, afraid of the church, and yet tempted to walk toward it. More than tempted; she felt a pull . ..</p><p>She looked at the map. The trattoria was to her right.</p><p>She was going to come back to the church. But though she was impelled to go in that direction, something stronger bid her away.</p><p>She saw the lights of the small trattoria casting a glow upon the path ahead of her.</p><p>She started toward it, rounding the little angle in the street that would bring her to the entry.</p><p>In front of it was a medieval archway between very old buildings. Before she could reach the shadowed area below the archway, she saw Roberto Capo on the other side. He was shaking his head in a frenzy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come! Don\u2019t come?go! To your left again as you head back, there\u2019s a vaporetto stop! Go!\u201d Suddenly, she was certain that she heard wings; a flurry of wings, alive with whispers and hisses. The shadows beneath the archway seemed to extend, like a black, viscous liquid, coming after her.</p><p>Shadows! she protested mentally. Shadows, changing beneath the moon!</p><p>But Roberto had told her to run.</p><p>The shadows were stretching in the other direction as well. Suddenly, they seemed to sweep over Roberto Capo, encompassing him as a giant wave of ink-black sea ...</p><p>Or like the wingspan of a great ebony bird.</p><p>She turned and ran.</p><p>As she did so, she dropped her map. She didn\u2019t pause to pick it up. She didn\u2019t look back. She felt that the ink-black shadow wings were following, close on her heels, and she had to escape them before ...</p><p>There was a feeling of glacial cold at her nape. As if an ice-encrusted finger of pure bone had thrust out from the darkness and touched her, as if it would creep around her throat like a vine, hold her, pull her back .. . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heedless, half-crazed with fear, she turned left as he had suggested.</p><p>And then, like Lot\u2019s wife, she turned back.</p><p>A dottore stood there, in the calle where she had been, between her and the archway where she had seen Roberto.</p> <p>She stood still, startled, watching.</p><p>The dottore lifted his mask. His face remained in shadow. He reached into his pocket for something.</p><p>A knife? Was he a psychotic, hidden behind a mask, running through Venice, his cape flying behind him like some modern-day Jack the Ripper?</p><p>He did not draw out a knife. He\u2019d reached into his pocket for cigarettes and a match. She stared, remotely thinking that she would see his face, that it would be important to do so, when he lit the match.</p><p>The match flared; he lit the cigarette. She could not see his face, for he bowed his head as he cupped his hands around the match.</p> <p>No knife.</p><p>Yet somehow, he seemed more dangerous than if he had pulled out a machete. There was a carelessness in his movements. He did not need a large weapon to torture, destroy, commit murder.</p><p>She could run, and it would not matter, because he could catch her, no matter how fast she tried to flee . . .</p><p>She pulled in a ragged breath, fighting for reason, for sanity, for movement She started to back away, then stopped dead.</p><p>There was a new menace.</p><p>Behind her.</p> <p>She saw nothing, felt a second shadow approaching from behind. Around her, above her, in a strange cascade, darkness, deeper than night, seemed to be overtaking her. Terror, unlike anything she had ever known, assailed her. She was paralyzed where she stood, trembling violently, unable to do so much as open her mouth.</p><p>She saw the darkness soaring over her then.</p><p>She watched it, certain that the dottore saw it, too.</p><p>He did. He backed away, as if from her.</p><p>She heard, as if in echo of Roberto Capo\u2019s warning, \u201cRun!\u201d She ran.</p><p>And as she did so, she mocked herself. She was running like an idiot from shadows.</p><p>No, from the dottore in the street, from a menace of evil stalking the streets of Venice, the innocent, the unwary.</p><p>She burst upon a broad calle; the vaporetto stop was right before her. People milled there. Families, tourists, business people. Dear God, she could hardly breathe! Her lungs were killing her, her calves felt as if knives were stuck in them. If her heart pounded any harder, she would go into cardiac arrest.</p> <p>Because of a man in a dottore mask who had paused to light a cigarette!</p><p>He had just been a costumed reveler, a tourist in love with Carnevale, one of the dozens of people who chose the dottore costume for dress-up . . .</p><p>She could think rationally now as she paused, breathing hard, joining the group at the vaporetto stop.</p><p>Everyone looked normal. Unafraid. They talked. A woman excused herself as she stepped around Jordan to rejoin her group. Jordan realized that she had shoved her way right into the center of the crowd.</p><p>Did fear create fear? Was she doing this in her own mind? What had she actually seen?</p><p>A man in a dottore costume, lighting a cigarette.</p><p>But what about Roberto Capo, shouting at her, warning her away?</p><p>A vaporetto arrived. She got on, realizing afterward that she didn\u2019t have a ticket, and she didn\u2019t know where it was going.</p><p>Luckily, the vaporetto was crowded. No one asked her for a ticket. After it first stopped somewhere she couldn\u2019t begin to recognize, she asked a man in her faulty Italian if the boat went to the area of St.</p><p>Mark.</p><p>\u201cSi, si,\u201d the man told her. \u201cA Hotel Danieli.\u201d</p><p>She thanked him. As the vaporetto made other stops, as people got on and off, she found that she was doubting her own sanity again. It was like going to a well-made horror movie. While the film was rolling, you were transfixed, caught in the fear. Then, when the credits rolled and the lights came on, the smell of popcorn and the sounds of conversation caused the fear to slip away. She almost wished that she could hold on to the feeling; perhaps then she could make some sense of it.</p><p>But she had seen Roberto Capo. And he had told her to run!</p><p>The vaporetto at last pulled up to the dock at the Danieli. She walked up to the hotel, then paused on the street. There were so many people out. They all seemed fine. Was she the only one in the entire city concerned about the fact that a severed head had been found floating in a canal?</p><p>She asked for her key, but before she could head to her room, she saw that Ragnor was sitting in the lobby, reading a newspaper. There was an empty coffee cup in front of him. It appeared that he had been there for some time.</p><p>He saw her and folded his paper, frowning and rising. As she walked over to him, he demanded,</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow at his tone. \u201cThat\u2019s really none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin has been worried sick.\u201d</p><p>A small twinge of guilt assailed her.</p><p>\u201cThey were sleeping. I went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But I didn\u2019t see you either.\u201d She felt a flush of warmth spreading through her, being near him again. To her he had lost none of his attractiveness, even though last night dispelled any physical mystery they had between them. If anything, intimacy had made him more appealing.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t elected anyone as her guardian, and as much as she liked being close to him, there were other mysteries still not solved. She didn\u2019t want him knowing that she had been to the police, nor did she want to share her strange experience of the night. She was a wary moth, drawn to the flame. So tempted, so impelled, and yet so aware of the fire.</p><p>\u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should check with Jared and Cindy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey ate and went up to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis early? When they were so worried about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Cindy that if you didn\u2019t appear soon, I\u2019d go out and find you. But give their room a call. She\u2019ll want to know that you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>She left him and called. Cindy answered the phone; she sounded exhausted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. A touch of the flu. I slept all morning, and I\u2019m tired again. But you! We\u2019ve been worried to death!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went out. Remember, Venice is a really safe city. The cops carry big guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenice is a safe city, but still .. .\u201d Cindy\u2019s voice trailed off. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just get scared when I don\u2019t know where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Are you going to get something to eat with Ragnor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have a nice night. And please, don\u2019t take off tomorrow without telling us that you\u2019re leaving, and where you\u2019re going, please?\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to tell Cindy that she was well over twenty-one, and that she lived alone in Charleston, and that she knew a smattering of Italian?bad Italian, but enough to get around. But Cindy was earnestly concerned, and Jordan didn\u2019t want to hurt or worry her anymore.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right? Maybe you should see a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, if I don\u2019t start feeling a little bit better ... well, it\u2019s not so much better... I don\u2019t really feel ill, just exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t perk up, you\u2019ve got to see a doctor,\u201d Jordan insisted.</p><p>Cindy promised she would, then asked Jordan to hang on a minute, Jared was saying something.</p><p>She sighed when she came back to the phone. \u201cHe wants you to watch out for Ragnor. Don\u2019t trust him, and don\u2019t let him up to your room.\u201d</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t tell them that that particular warning was too late.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to dinner,\u201d she said simply. That wasn\u2019t a lie. How could she argue with her cousin when she wasn\u2019t sure what she felt herself?</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d Cindy said. Her voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cPersonally, I think he\u2019s the best in the world for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Okay, get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>She rang off and came back to Ragnor. He was reading his paper again.</p><p>\u201cAll right. They\u2019ve gone to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do want to go to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well. Give me a minute; I want to run up to my room.\u201d He frowned slightly, as if not certain that she should. He started to fold the paper as if he\u2019d go with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right down,\u201d she promised, and headed for the stairs before he could stop her.</p><p>She hurried to her door and into her room. She quickly checked her E-mail. There was another note from the cop in New Orleans. It was simple, brief, and to the point.</p><p>Please call me anytime.</p><p>She considered putting through a phone call right then, but she didn\u2019t want to take too much time. She\u2019d call him around noon tomorrow. That would be very early in the morning in the States but the cop\u2019s message had read any time.</p><p>And at noon, for some reason, everyone she knew tended to be sleeping.</p><p>She washed her face quickly, switched jackets, and opened the door. Ragnor was waiting for her in the hallway. \u201cI was getting worried.\u201d</p><p>She sighed with exasperation. \u201cWhy is everyone worried about me all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you?I think you might have stirred up trouble.\u201d He was quiet as they walked to the restaurant, a little place just a hundred feet away once they had left the hotel and crossed the bridge to their left. There were many people in the restaurant, and many people in the streets.</p><p>It felt very safe.</p><p>They ordered wine and joked with the waiter, a man who seemed to know Ragnor. Then they ordered their food. When the wine arrived, along with an antipasto, Ragnor drew the newspaper from the pocket of his black suede jacket. He opened it, smoothed it out, and pointed to a picture.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize that person?\u201d</p><p>She stared at the face and at the headlines. The words meant nothing to her, except that she thought she recognized the word for death.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the man before. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an artist\u2019s rendition of the man whose head was found in the canal.\u201d She stared at the picture again. She shook her head slowly. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen him. I\u2019m positive I\u2019ve never seen him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey think he\u2019s Slavic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him.

Jordan took a bite. It was delicious. Ragnor knew Venice, and he knew his restaurants.</p><p>She took a sip of her wine, studying him. \u201cI\u2019m an open book. I live in Charleston. I was born in Charleston. Jared and I both grew up with my grandmother, Granny Jay. We have her eyes. I\u2019m short?he\u2019s tall. He started dating Cindy in high school. They adore one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jared and Cindy. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did leave Charleston to go to Brown. I majored in English and Comparative Literature. I write articles now and then, but mostly I do book reviews, fiction and nonfiction. I\u2019m syndicated, and in the last few years I\u2019ve done very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your personal life?\u201d</p><p>She took another sip of wine. \u201cI told you. I was engaged to a cop named Steven. He was killed. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the grisly details?that\u2019s why I supposedly went so out of my mind at the contessa\u2019s party, seeing real evil in her entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd after his death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working. Don\u2019t you want to ask me about my life before Steven? There was a guy named Zachary my first year of college. He was cute?had great hair. Then there was Jimmy Adair. He wanted to move to the wilderness in Montana and rough it. Go back in time. Live in a cabin with no electricity and study wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got something against wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope?I\u2019d love to visit him sometime. I just didn\u2019t want to live there. Oh?I love movies, too. Well, there you have it Steven came along, and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say you\u2019re sorry, or something like that.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSo ... you\u2019ve been in deep mourning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured casually. \u201cSo?just who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRagnor. Wulfsson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my real name.\u201d</p><p>Their main course arrived. They smiled and talked to the waiter. He left.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re really from Norway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Originally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve traveled a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent things over the years. But mainly, spending family money. Parting with antiques here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd learning languages. You must be very bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more so than the next man. I travel, and I listen. And take the time,\u201d he murmured ruefully.</p><p>\u201cTime?time in a place helps a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew the contessa before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care to go into that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you think she\u2019s evil?\u201d Jordan wiggled her brows, as if half teasing.</p><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s evil,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou think the contessa caused that man to be murdered, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should tell the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And the police will arrest her because I think she caused a man\u2019s death?\u201d Jordan shrugged. \u201cIt would help if you went to the police. Then they might take me more seriously.</p><p>Though I must say, Roberto Capo?\u201d she broke off.</p><p>\u201cRoberto Capo what?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy. You should tell him what you think. Maybe it will matter. Maybe they\u2019ll get someone in there to investigate the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter if they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, she covers her sins well.\u201d</p><p>Again, the waiter came by. It was time for coffee and dessert. They both decided just coffee, and it was then that Jordan remembered to ask, \u201cHave you heard from Tiff?\u201d His expression became guarded. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would my being worried do?\u201d he returned, sounding tired.</p><p>\u201cWe have to make someone look into the fact that she\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the police are looking into her disappearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think so?\u2018 \u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll go down there and insist they find out about Tiff tomorrow, all right?\u201d She nodded, pleased. Their waiter brought the check; Ragnor paid and they started out. The streets were quieter now, but with him, she saw no shadows.</p><p>And heard no whispers.</p><p>\u201cYou really insist they do something?\u201d she asked as they walked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>When they returned to the hotel, he followed her to her room. She watched as he went through all the motions he had gone through the previous evening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more neurotic than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you that I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>She was silent a moment as he watched her. Then she asked, \u201cAre you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She bolted the door.</p><p>A minute later, she was in his arms.</p><p>Later that night, hours later, she turned to him and asked, again, \u201cWho are you? really?\u201d He was silent for a moment, stroking her hair. \u201cI\u2019ve told you the truth. I am from Norway; I have lived all over the world. And my name is Ragnor Wulfsson.\u201d He drew her against him, as if falling asleep.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t asleep, she thought.</p><p>She pulled away slightly. It was very dark in the room, but she could see the planes of his face.</p><p>She traced them, thinking that his features were exceptionally fine, that he was an incredible lover, and that she liked him, liked being with him .. .</p><p>That she wanted to know him more, that she loved his touch . ..</p><p>That she had never felt as she did when she was with him.</p><p>Except that...</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, what are you?\u201d she asked very softly.</p><p>\u201cA man,\u201d he murmured. \u201cA man.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stir again.</p><p>Yet, she thought, he still wasn\u2019t sleeping.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>When he was a small child, he was unaware of the world of violence and cruelty into which he had been born, of the strange heritage due to come his way.</p><p>His village by the sea was productive and peaceful. Fanners tilled the earth; fishermen went to sea; shepherds tended their flocks. In spring and summer, the fields were rich, and the forests were filled with game. During the long, cold winters, men carved fine images from blocks of wood, and the storytellers entertained young and old alike with tales of the daring of the gods, the wars with the giants, the follies of all creatures upon the earth. There was law and order among his people; disputes were settled in the great central house, where his great-uncle had the final word. Sometimes, of course, a grievous complaint would be settled in battle, and the clash of arms was like a war among gods in which Odin blew the north wind and Thor, in his fury, sent down lightning and thunder. There was no dishonor in dying in such a battle, for Valhalla was open only to those who fought with the greatest courage and defied the realm of Hel, goddess of the underworld. Religion and storytelling were one and the same.</p><p>Despite the richness of his village and the customary peace and domesticity within it, he was, from an early age, taught the rudiments of battle. His father was nephew to the jarl and held a place of honor within this realm. His father was also greatly feared as one of the most powerful of the warriors; he was often gone, and his name was spoken softly and with a strange whisper of both awe and dread. As the seventh son of this incredible man, the boy was watched expectantly, and he knew, from the time he could talk and walk, he would one day go forth into the world, where he would be required to outdo other men with his prowess and courage. He would not be allowed to fail. This in itself was not in the least strange, for most young men of noble families were taught the virtues of strength and power. Despite the fine location and lush fields of his homeland, it would remain rich, and give plenty only if its sons went out upon the seas, settled new homelands, and brought back the wealth of others.</p><p>He always knew he would go a-Viking. It was a way of life. His brothers before him had gone, and they returned, sometimes years later, to boast of great conquests, to bring back foreign gold and art. They told about the monks who had inscribed the books they brought back, helpless fellows who cried to their one God but received no help from him as they battled the men they called demons who had come to their shores.</p><p>Often when his father was gone, his mother would speak of her husband, then lower her head and whisper a prayer to Freya. As he grew, he began to wonder whether she prayed that her husband would return, or that he would not.</p><p>As he neared his thirteenth birthday, he was already taller than most of the men, and they were a tall breed. He was also singularly adept in his training with arms.</p><p>Some of his first memories were of going to the docks to see the returning warriors, bold men, fierce men, berserkers among them, who had sailed the seas through wind and storm to strike the coastal towns of other peoples. There they sought gold and treasure, wreaked havoc, and sometimes returned not just with riches, but with a cargo of humanity as well, slaves to work for noble men\u2019s wives, to till the fields, gather the harvests. Theirs was an intriguing community, for dauntless valor and steadfast bravery were the greatest traits in a man, and a slave who proved his mettle might one day become one of them, and strike out upon the seas himself. When the warriors returned, the longhorns would sound, and the village would come out to welcome the returning heroes, to hear their stories of battle and conquest, and marvel at the goods from civilizations across the seas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At thirteen, he was to sail with his oldest brother, Hagan. They would stop in the islands north of Scotland, held by Norse jarls, then head south and raid a village along the Hebrides where it was rumored that monks had come from France with reliquaries of gold fashioned by fine goldsmiths in Paris.</p><p>The Norsemen had no interest in the fragile pieces of bone and ash so reverently contained in the gold vessels; they only wanted the precious metal.</p><p>Sailing was good; he loved it. He didn\u2019t mind the backbreaking labor of rowing the great dragon-pronged ship when there was no wind, and he loved a storm at sea. The wind sweeping the sky, the roiling gray, the black toss of the waves, all created a tempest that made him feel very alive, a warrior against the obstacles set forth by the gods.</p> <p>The islands where his distant cousins ruled, slave-masters of many of the original inhabitants were intriguing. He had never seen so many different peoples: many were short, dark-haired, and spoke a strange language that he found fascinating. There, on the isles, they were refitted for their travels; they practiced with arms, and held contests to win women, armor, weapons, and shields. All was going well until one of their hosts heard word of the treasure they had come to seize from farther south; the inhabitants of the isles felt that the treasure was more rightly theirs, and heated arguments arose, near to a drawing of swords and an all-out massacre between them. But rising from his seat around the huge fire in the jarl\u2019s circular hall, Hagan boasted that his brother had been born under a special sign, therefore he could best a man twice his height, and twice his size. His brother, seventh son of the seventh son, born beneath the black moon of deep midnight, would fight their strongest, most able man. They would fight to the death, and the men of the victor would be the warriors to seek the prize.</p><p>Ragnor was stunned?as stunned as those laughing at him?and though he could not humiliate his brother, he wasn\u2019t at all sure why it seemed his brother was intent on his murder. The jarl assessed him carefully.</p><p>Ragnor informed him that this destined prowess of his had yet to be tested, but the jarl demanded that the fight should follow as Hagan had suggested. He called to one of his champions, a man called Olaf the Giant.</p><p>Olaf had been aptly named; he appeared as wide as he was tall, and his height was staggering, but there was nothing in the man run to fat or drink. His breadth was muscle. At thirteen, Ragnor was lean despite his customary work with heavy weapons and the monotonous labor of rowing. The gods expected courage when he stood before Olaf the Giant, but Ragnor could not meet his soon-to-be slayer without a look at his brother that indicated his feelings of betrayal. He knew, however, that it would be far better to fall to one of Olaf\u2019s massive blows than to act the coward and face the fury of his fellow Vikings. He stepped onto the dirt patch before the fire that was assigned as the fighting place. He was granted three shields and three weapons. He chose an axe, a mace and a sword.</p><p>He had barely stepped forward, barely hoisted his wooden shield, when Olaf bore down on him, vowing to give him a quick and painless death and allow him a \u201cchild\u2019s\u201d place among the gods. Olaf\u2019s one simple swing of his battle-axe shattered Ragnor\u2019s shield into splinters. He retreated, taking up the next shield handed to him. The shield was barely in his grasp before Olaf was coming toward him again, raising his battle-axe.</p> <p>This next time, Ragnor leaped aside; Olaf\u2019s swing missed, and his giant axe swung hard into the earthen flooring.</p><p>\u201cKill him now! It\u2019s your chance!\u201d his brother roared.</p><p>But all he had known thus far was the role of student, and so Ragnor hesitated. Olaf brought his weapon from the ground and came at him, swinging again.</p><p>Ragnor ducked and circled around, to the great amusement of the onlookers. When Olaf shattered his second shield, Ragnor dropped the mace as well as the remnants of protective wood; he then picked up his sword.</p><p>When the giant came forward, laughing and drawing back his axe, Ragnor sped forward, striking instantly and with dead precision.</p><p>Ragnor caught him in the throat. Olaf, amazed, dropped his weapon and clasped his throat with both hands.</p> <p>Blood gushed through the man\u2019s fingers. For seconds that seemed an eternity, Olaf stared at Ragnor.</p><p>Then he fell dead to the floor.</p><p>Men all around him cheered. His brother rushed forward and hoisted him on his shoulders. He should have felt the elation of his fellow men. He felt hollow instead.</p><p>That night, the Jarl of the isles gave Ragnor a shield fronted with silver, an ancient bequest brought back from the ruins of an ancient Roman village on the mainland far to the south. The jarl awarded him two women as well, presents from a group who had gone a-Viking all the way to the lands of the yellow people.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mind the gift of the women at all. They taught him things he had never imagined. But despite the drink he consumed and the energy required from the women, he didn\u2019t sleep that night.</p><p>He should have died.</p><p>The next morning, he accosted his brother.</p><p>\u201cYou were quick to risk my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never risked your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was twice my size, brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are our father\u2019s seventh son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m immortal? A child of the gods?\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>Hagan put out a finger, touching him directly on the forehead. \u201cThe seventh son of the wolf, who is the seventh son of the wolf. And a child of deep midnight, conceived of the hour, born of the hour. You have the cunning of the wolf, and the hunger, and the loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that kept me alive?\u201d</p><p>Hagan shrugged with a broad grin. \u201cWell, I had heard that it would do so. And now I have proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou risked my life!\u201d Ragnor said again angrily.</p><p>\u201cA Viking does not live forever. And his place in the halls of Valhalla is great only if he has performed great deeds on earth.\u201d</p><p>The following day, they left, striking out for the rich treasure they sought.</p><p>When they came ashore, Ragnor was sickened by the carnage. His brother\u2019s men set upon the little community of monks with a vengeance.</p><p>Men with tonsures, clad in brown wool, raced about screaming, dropping to their knees, crying for their One True God. Hagan laughed and ignored them, slicing them as he approached their place of worship.</p><p>Ragnor followed behind, trying to remind himself that he was a youth here, that they would call him a girl, weak as a woman, if he decried the violence.</p><p>But they had set him up to battle a giant; he had some say.</p><p>So he shouted with such force that he caused them to halt and stare at him. \u201cLeave them! Leave them be!\u201d he demanded. And striding forward, he snatched the skinny man his brother was about to skewer from Hagan\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come for treasure. Take the treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a coward?\u201d Ulric, one of the fiercest warriors shouted. \u201cThe seventh son of the seventh son? a coward?\u201d Ulric roared with laughter.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t such courage as you, to slice up men who are not even armed. The gods would mock you. A warrior! A man who slays men who are like sheep!\u201d</p><p>There was silence among them.</p><p>\u201cGet the treasure!\u201d Ragnor insisted.</p><p>The monks were too stunned to protest; he thought later that many would have died to save their relics.</p><p>One stood at the doorway to the monastery, a very tall man. \u201cTake the silver and gold, leave what means nothing to you?the bone and the ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bone and the ash are the earth\u2019s!\u201d Hagan ordered.</p><p>\u201cLeave them their talismans,\u201d Ragnor said. \u201cI have heard of the halls of Valhalla, and what I have heard is that the greatest warriors know when to give mercy.\u201d</p><p>The Vikings swore as they let the remaining monks house their precious relics in the stoneware dishes which were surely meant for their meals. But the precious relics were left behind. Before they left, the tall monk found Ragnor perched on a rock, waiting.</p><p>\u201cI had visions that you would come,\u201d the monk told him.</p><p>Ragnor looked at him skeptically. The monk smiled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother me, or I\u2019ll let them slit your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lad with fire,\u201d the monk murmured, \u201cbut a lad, still, nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be years before you are full grown. But I prayed years ago, knowing that the Viking ships were busy again. And God answered me in a dream, telling me not to fear. You would come to protect us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to steal silver.\u201d</p><p>The monk shrugged. He pulled a pendant from around his neck and held it out to Ragnor. Ragnor nearly hit him when he reached out to pull it over his head.</p><p>\u201cSilver, not stolen, but given. It is set with jewels? and a relic said to come from the very body of John the Baptist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. You are the seventh son of the seventh son, you know. But not the seventh son of your mother.\u201d</p><p>Ragnor frowned.</p><p>\u201cYour father took her from these shores years ago. She was a healer, a pagan child, brought to the church. Your father was blessed?or cursed?with the way of power. Your mother knew the way of the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool, old man. How can you know all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you, he is Odin. To the Romans, Jove. He is greater than they ever knew, but one and the same.</p><p>And so I know.\u201d</p><p>The monk left him. Later that night, he asked Hagan about his father. Hagan, enjoying a fat leg of the holy men\u2019s sheep, shrugged. \u201cThree wives. Maida, whom he loved as a child, my mother. Ingrid, whom he stole from the Danes. Elspeth, your mother, whom he seized from a raid just north of here, many years ago.\u201d</p><p>Later, as they sailed away, he saw the monk at the stairs of the monastery again, watching them go. The monk lifted his hand.</p><p>Angry, Ragnor did not respond.</p><p>They did not return to Norway. News of their exploit with the monks traveled, and rather than making them appear weak, they found that their services were being sought by many nobles, of their own kind ruling the isles, of the various lords of the peoples of Scotland, and the rihts, or kings of Eire well. They even traveled down to Sicily. Hagan listened to those who would hire their services, and as was the right among Norsemen, the men were free to choose to fight or to refuse that particular battle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ragnor found himself returning again and again to the monastery they had first ravaged, intrigued by the abbot there, the books, and the many languages the monks could speak. He returned his share of the silver reliquaries they had taken.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want for these?\u201d the lean, sharp-nosed abbot asked him.</p><p>\u201cLanguages.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to learn languages, as you speak them. The Latin with which you write, the Gaelic I hear in the villages, the English of the lower countries. Then French and?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne by one, lad. One by one,\u201d the abbot told him.</p><p>And so, he became a regular visitor.</p><p>As time went by, Ragnor learned to join the fighting, and with each season that passed, he became more adept at the art of warfare. Among the Vikings, many came to him to ask him what he thought of a particular battle. \u201cDublin is a town founded by a Viking. Now the king asks us to fight against interlopers from the north. That is a good fight.\u201d</p> <p>He agreed it was a good fight. And he discovered, when he was convinced of the valor of a fight, he could be savage. There were times when he could take life with a vengeance, and yet, he always remembered the way he had felt when Olaf died, and he refused to allow wanton murder of peasants, women, children, and the aged in any place where he fought. Revenge, he had noted, could make murderers of those who had been downtrodden. It was amazing, he had discovered, when their force had won the day for a threatened people, just how quickly those people could turn, ready to cut out the hearts of their foes, once they had power.</p><p>They fought for the king of an isle off the western coast of Scotland, a battle they fought against a group of Danes, very much like their own.</p><p>The king of the isle rewarded them with a smaller island to call their own. They grew wealthy, and others joined them. The men took wives?some willing, and some coerced. They traveled home and brought riches with them, but Ragnor had no desire to stay. In the time he had been gone, his mother had died.</p><p>His father had gone a-Viking a different way, and though he felt a deep loss at his mother\u2019s passing, he had not known his father well, and though respected and awed, he had not been in Ragnor\u2019s life enough for him to greatly miss his presence.</p><p>He was sorry forever, for the void he felt in many ways. There were so many questions he might have asked.</p><p>His uncle, however, was still the jarl. He assured Ragnor that his mother, though originally taken as a slave, had been among their people many years, and had been loved, and had been honored with the greatest of funerals; her byre had burned brightly on the fjord throughout a long, moonlit night.</p> <p>\u201cThere is so much my parents might have told me,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there is not as much to tell as there is to learn, and only time and life can be the teachers we really need,\u201d his uncle told him.</p><p>With little then to hold him to his old life, Ragnor returned with Hagan and their many men to their isle off the western coast of Scotland.</p><p>By his thirtieth year, he had his own home, cattle, sheep, and horses. He had not married, but neither was he lonely. There were many women in his life, strangers in faraway places, captives who were eager to please, and housemaids who were willing to serve. His brother and he had formed a bond of real friendship and led their large army of mercenaries together.</p><p>That year, they were called upon by the rich chieftain two days south of them, inward on the river.</p><p>Ragnor traveled with Hagan to speak with the chieftain.</p><p>Their people were being taken and killed. Not far away, foreign enemies had come in and decimated a village. They were dark invaders, fierce, with small, slim, horses that disappeared into the night; darkness was when they wished to strike.</p><p>The people were terrified of them. They did not just come and kill. They could slip through the defenses at night, with no one knowing, and more of their children would be gone.</p> <p>The mission appealed to Ragnor. But on their return trip, they stopped at the monastery from which they had first stolen the silver. Ragnor wasn\u2019t sure why, but he was keen to talk to the old abbot he had so strangely defended, a man whose name was Peter.</p><p>Peter seemed to be expecting them. He had soup and bread ready, and he listened avidly to everything Ragnor and Hagan said.</p><p>\u201cThe evil has come,\u201d Peter said.</p><p>\u201cBah!\u201d Hagan told him. \u201cThey are foreigners? cowards, as Ragnor would say, who only fight the unarmed, the weak. They prey upon women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling us not to go?\u201d Ragnor queried, for his friend seemed so strange.</p><p>\u201cNo, you must go. And you must not just kill these infidels. You must destroy them, utterly. They will use any weapon: hands, fists, teeth. Yes, teeth, you must beware in battle. They are an ancient enemy. I think they are the lamia of the ancients in the East; they bring not just death but infection. They are everything against God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your one great God were so powerful, he would destroy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod has created man with a heart and a soul. A man may fight for good or for evil.\u201d Hagan was aggravated. \u201cA man\u2019s cause is good; his enemy\u2019s cause is bad.\u201d Peter ignored him. He stared at Ragnor. \u201cBeware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will destroy them,\u201d Hagan said confidently. \u201cWe will return to our isle, gather our ships, and go to the chieftain, and there, build and create his defenses for him. Then we\u2019ll rout his enemies!\u201d Two weeks later, they had made the journey. Yet, even as they steered their boats through the river pass, they could see ahead. As they neared the village, where so recently Hagan and Ragnor had been welcomed and beseeched for help, they saw nothing but burned-out farmsteads and the rubble of homes.</p><p>They brought their longboats in, and the men all stared at the carnage in silence. Gudric, the Rune Sayer, shook his head. \u201cTurn back!\u201d he told Hagan.</p><p>Hagan would not be persuaded. \u201cWe go in. We see if any are living; we promised our aid, and we will see to the dead.\u201d</p><p>Even Ragnor felt a hesitance as they stepped ashore. He knew that his brother felt it, but Hagan didn\u2019t believe in allowing cowardice to rule a man\u2019s actions.</p><p>They had just gone ashore and seen the death, and the flies, when Eric, left behind to guard the ships, called out to them.</p><p>More ships were coming. To his amazement, Ragnor saw that a ship of monks was coming; Peter stood aft, tall and straight against the wind as the ship followed theirs.</p><p>The monks all carried swords.</p><p>Ragnor walked with Hagan to greet the monks as they arrived.</p><p>\u201cYou have given up God\u2019s way of peace and taken to the sword?\u201d Hagan demanded.</p><p>\u201cThis is God\u2019s battle we wage. Against those who would steal the dead, not the living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk, you make no sense,\u201d Hagan said flatly.</p><p>Ragnor turned to start to the center of the village. The place held an eerie calm. It seemed that no creatures had been spared. Horses and dogs and farm animals lay about in the midst of slaughtered humans.</p><p>\u201cThere is something evil here,\u201d Gudric warned. Grudgingly, he indicated Peter. \u201cAs the monk says, the gods would fear to tread here.\u201d</p><p>The Norsemen continued forward. Hearing a hacking sound, Ragnor turned to see that Peter was industriously engaged in removing the head of a fallen man.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d he remonstrated, more in amazement than in disgust or anger.</p><p>\u201cWe will cremate them with prayers,\u201d Peter said, as if that explained his actions.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s look to the living,\u201d Hagan said.</p><p>They kept walking and came to the village church. As they stood there, the door creaked ajar. The brothers looked at one another. Hagan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWho wants to live forever?\u201d he queried lightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d Ragnor said and shrugged as well. \u201cI am the seventh son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is just a church.\u201d</p><p>They took a step closer. The door burst open. A child came flying out; she buried herself in Hagan, who was so startled he nearly fell over.</p><p>A young man appeared, a mere boy with no more than a scruff of hair on his cheeks. \u201cWe ran to the church when they descended,\u201d he blurted out. \u201cOh, God, can you understand me? We are all that\u2019s left.</p><p>They?they attacked the sheep and the cows. I saw my father ...\u201d He said no more. He collapsed. The monks had come from behind. One of them helped the boy up.</p><p>\u201cHow many live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen, twenty ... all in the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart building a barricade!\u201d Hagan roared to his men.</p><p>\u201cYou build your barricade,\u201d Peter said. \u201cBut I am telling you?you will be safe in the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must build defenses?\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>\u201cThen you must,\u201d Peter told him. \u201cAnd we must do what we must do. Son,\u201d he asked the boy, \u201cwhere are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing out now that... that we see you.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, more people spilled out of the church. Those behind were so frenzied, they pushed those in front forward.</p><p>A woman catapulted into Ragnor\u2019s arms. She steadied herself against his chest and looked up at him with large dark eyes. Dark brown hair tumbled down her back. Her kirtle was ripped and torn, she was dusty, her cheek was bruised. She was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d she whispered to him.</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, you\u2019ve come. You didn\u2019t lie to my father, my chieftain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will keep the rest of us alive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will, or we will the with you,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cAlan?help the men find what remains of our tools. Mary, help me get together water, and what food we can find.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were still against him. \u201cWe will fight with you, or die!\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He watched her as she drew her hands back and walked around him with a determined sway of her hips.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get going! Darkness comes quickly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the dead, my brothers,\u201d Peter said to his monks.</p><p>Ragnor shook his head, but the monks went to work with ferocious energy, collecting the animals and the people. A great crematory bonfire was lit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The smell of the roasting flesh was ghastly.</p><p>Even to a Viking, Hagan told him woefully.</p><p>By nightfall, Peter insisted they all go into the church. Hagan agreed. Norsemen did not fear the dark, he assured Peter, but his men were worn. The church afforded the best center of defense, with the spiked wall they had built circling around it.</p> <p>Hours passed. The surviving women had gathered what food and water they could. The chieftain\u2019s daughter came to Ragnor\u2019s guard post by a window, standing by him as he looked out on the moonlit night.</p><p>\u201cHagan says another man will take watch. You are to eat,\u201d she told him. \u201cCome, I have food for you.\u201d She led him to a corner where the hard wooden benches had been drawn together, creating an awkward table.</p><p>He ate, wolfing down his food, then looking at her. \u201cHave I taken your share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had, you would have been welcome. I am in your service ... though, of course, your kind take what you will.\u201d</p><p>He sat back. \u201cMy kind?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cVikings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Vikings.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head for a moment, then stared at him again, smiling ruefully. \u201cAll right. Perhaps it is not just Vikings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen. Men always take what they will, and leave behind ... devastation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see these men, these dark enemies, come in the night?\u201d She looked away from him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen nothing. I came here and hid under the altar, as my father said. We knew that they were coming, by darkness. Most of the men went out to fight. You saw what befell them. Some of the women and children made it to the church. Most did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you when we met with your father and the others,\u201d he told her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the chieftain had a daughter. What is your name?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, hazel eyes brilliant.</p><p>\u201cNari,\u201d she told him. \u201cMy name is Nari.\u201d And she slid her hand into his hand, entwining her fingers with his.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Cindy was sleeping soundly. It was a wonderful, dreamless sleep. She might have been dead to the world.</p><p>She was wakened by her husband\u2019s touch.</p><p>She groaned softly.</p> <p>His whisper was against her ear. His hands were moving.</p><p>\u201cWant me to stop?\u201d</p><p>Yes! she almost screamed aloud.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. She loved his attention; she was just so exhausted. But though she had been afraid to admit it, she had wondered about her husband\u2019s fidelity, and she had felt terribly jealous of the contessa, though she had determined all along that it wouldn\u2019t show. At first, of course, she had denied it to herself.</p><p>She still tried to believe she was wrong. She had fallen in love with Jared as a teenager, and in all their years together, she had never lost the depth of her feelings for him. And lately ...</p><p>It was almost as if they were kids again.</p><p>She gathered what energy she could, turning against him, stroking his cheek. \u201cNever stop; I love you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His energy seemed to mock her exhaustion. She told him softly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just so, so tired ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right\u201d He sounded like the same old teasing Jared. \u201cI\u2019ve got the hots for two, babe.\u201d He did. She didn\u2019t need to move. And he was so fevered and volatile she felt herself carried along.</p><p>But then he grew rough, which sometimes had been fine, but tonight...</p><p>He found what he needed; she would have to admit that she did too. But even as they drifted, he was kissing her again, a rough touch, teeth ...</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d she found the anger and energy to stop him. \u201cJared, God I love you, but I don\u2019t understand this, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, he was up. She saw him standing at the open window.</p><p>Now she was in pain and freezing.</p><p>\u201cJared, please!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He closed the window. She didn\u2019t feel him come back beside her.</p><p>It seemed to take every bit of energy she had to rise enough to reach the bedside lamp and turn it on.</p><p>Jared was gone.</p><p>Jordan slept so very well, deeply, dreamlessly, aware of the warmth and the touch of the man beside her. This was probably one of the reasons people married these days, she reflected, amused. Falling asleep beside someone this way. Resting and knowing he was beside you. A duo against the night, against the world. Someone to whom to say goodnight, and greet in the morning. This kind of feeling didn\u2019t come that often. And perhaps, it was the reason marriages fell apart, when the problems of the day intruded into the night, and there was no longer this wonderful feeling of just sleeping together.</p><p>As the night went on, she knew that he was there. Just before dawn, when the pale streaks of the sun were nothing more than a tease in the sky, he was still beside her.</p><p>Not much later, she turned for a more comfortable position. Now, the rays of dawn were just twisting their way through lattices and draperies, causing pastel whispers in the dark, and displaying the motes that danced within them.</p><p>Ragnor was no longer with her.</p><p>She rose, walking to the bathroom. \u201cRagnor?\u201d she murmured, but there was no answer from him.</p><p>Suddenly feeling a chill, she walked around the room, turning on all the lights. The room was empty. She checked the door. It was locked.</p><p>Perplexed, she sat at the foot of her bed. She should go back to sleep. It was ridiculously early.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t sleep, so she rose, and took a long shower. She dressed and noted her books on the desk. She shouldn\u2019t read anymore; reading just gave her crazy thoughts.</p><p>She went and picked up the book by the cop, plumped her pillows, and started to read again, flicking through sections she had read, noting the structure of the book. Things that had happened in history came first, some of the examples of absolute intolerance, such as the witchcraft burnings in Europe and the hangings in Salem. There was a case of savage murders that had occurred in France which had received little attention due to the horror already prevalent as thousands went to the guillotine. However, when one man, Comte d\u2019Alargon, met his fate at the blade, the murders, begun so suddenly and savagely, just as quickly ceased.</p><p>The historical moved into the more modern, and it was after a study of \u201cmodern\u201d vampires and vampire cults that the cop stressed the section on the psychology of dealing with \u201cvampires.\u201d Jordan chewed her lip while reading that section, then suddenly flew out of bed. She dropped the book, grabbed her key and her purse, and left the hotel.</p><p>It was a bright, cool, but beautiful day. She wandered along the rivas and calles she had walked the night before. People were out and about; they walked dogs, shopped, hurried here and there to work. At a cafe, she paused for a cafe latte and a roll, then continued down the street She paused in a religious shop and bought a number of crucifixes, small and large, and splurged on a beautiful inlaid silver cross pendant, and waited while the chain was adjusted for her. Her next stop was a little shop where they sold blown glass vials, and she went on to the first campo she could find and the charming little church that sat within it. Luckily, there were only a few tourists present; she still couldn\u2019t help but look around her as she filled her newly bought vials with holy water.</p><p>Her last shop was a pleasant open-air market where she bought bananas, apples, grapes?and strings of garlic.</p><p>Returning to her room, she decorated the windows with garlic. The maid had already been in, so for the day at least, her strange decoration would stand. She dripped some of the holy water on the window sills, praying. Perhaps they weren\u2019t really the usual prayers for what she was doing, for she whispered aloud, \u201cDear God, please don\u2019t let me be totally out of my mind.\u201d She set the vials in clear view on her desk, grateful that this was a Roman Catholic country, and Italians were accustomed to rosaries and crosses, statues and more.</p><p>With all of that done, she went down to the concierge and asked him to call the police station for her.</p><p>Roberto Capo had yet to come in.</p><p>Next, she asked him to dial Tiff Henley, but though Tiff had left a personal message on the answering machine of her rented palazzo, Tiff herself did not come to the phone.</p><p>She thanked him, and would have taken coffee up to her room, but she saw Cindy then, sitting in the lobby.</p><p>To her amazement, Cindy, who eschewed sunglasses on the hottest days in South Carolina, had on a pair of dark glasses.</p><p>Jordan walked over to her cousin-in-law. \u201cCindy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan! Great. Want coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She sat down in the big, comfortable wing chair opposite the sofa where Cindy sat, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cSomething to eat?\u201d Cindy said. \u201cThere\u2019s the nicest young waiter down here. He\u2019s earning money to spend a semester in the United States. He\u2019s an International Relations major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had something earlier,\u201d Jordan said, \u201cbut coffee sounds great.\u201d The waiter came by, a handsome young man with dark eyes and honey-colored hair. Cindy introduced them, and they talked for a few minutes about travel, the States, and where he was going in America.</p><p>There were three places he really wanted to study: New York, L.A. and Miami. She suggested that he should visit Kansas as well, to get a better feel for the middle of the country.</p><p>A moment later, he brought their coffee. When he had left, Jordan leaned forward. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the shades?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Cindy took off her glasses. There were dark circles under her eyes. \u201cI just?I just look like shit! So</p><p>. ..\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, you\u2019ve got to see a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re due to go back to the States in a week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have excellent medical care in Venice. I don\u2019t know everything that Jared does, but I\u2019ve read up on the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know the doctors are good; I just really don\u2019t think that anything is wrong.\u201d Jordan arched a brow.</p><p>Cindy shrugged. \u201cLate hours. Really late hours.\u201d</p><p>Jordan sat back. \u201cJared is that much of an animal?\u201d</p><p>Cindy flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if we\u2019re on some kind of a second honeymoon. I\u2019m elated, of course. You know that I\u2019ve loved Jared forever and ever?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe should let you get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say anything to him. I\u2019ll go back up in a few minutes and take a long hot bath, and then a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to say anything,\u201d Jordan murmured.</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he see the bags under your eyes?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cJordan, if you say anything, I\u2019ll never forgive you. And watch it, please, he\u2019s coming.\u201d Jared, in jeans and a casual jacket, came walking over to them from the entry. So her cousin had been up and about. Well, it wasn\u2019t that early anymore, she realized. It fact, it was well past noon.</p><p>He stopped by Jordan\u2019s chair and kissed her on the forehead, then sat down by his wife. Jordan watched him. He seemed to be attentive enough, taking her hand, kissing her cheek. He didn\u2019t seem to notice the circles under her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid you order me coffee?\u201d he asked Cindy.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming. I hadn\u2019t a clue as to where you were.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou two forget; I work while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust who do you work for, Jared?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cindy gave her such a frown that she amended her words. \u201cWho were you working with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He gave a wave of his hand. \u201cSome people involved with the \u2018Save Venice\u2019 committee. They donate money to restore buildings, things like that\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cIn fact, I have another meeting in a few minutes. And you?\u201d He suddenly pointed a finger at Jordan. \u201cThe contessa has asked that you join us all for dinner at her palazzo tomorrow night. She is very concerned and wants to make up for the way she scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared, I don\u2019t want to have dinner with the contessa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral reasons. I don\u2019t want to go back to her palazzo?ever. I can\u2019t imagine enjoying a dinner with her. I really dislike the woman.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply, stretching his hands out before him. \u201cJordan, I understand. But there are a lot of people I come across whom I find to be unpleasant You don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing to me when you act like this. The contessa is big money. She influences lots of people who have big money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the only woman in the world with money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenice is my specialty?my love,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>He glanced at his watch again and rose. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for coffee. Jordan, be a big kid for me, huh?</p><p>You are screwing me royally here?I need you to come to dinner.\u201d He kissed Cindy on the head again, assuming that he\u2019d get an affirmative from Jordan on the dinner.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to today?\u201d he asked Cindy.</p> <p>\u201cA nap.\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged, a proud-as-a-peacock, macho look in his eyes. \u201cGood,\u201d he whispered softly. \u201cI\u2019ll be back by dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d Cindy murmured as he started to walk away. But he paused, looking back at Jordan. \u201cAnd you?what are you up to?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe I can spread some more nasty rumors about the contessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to return my costume. Maybe go shopping around the Rialto Bridge.\u201d She rose, giving a wave to Cindy. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my room for a few minutes, if you need anything, Cindy.\u201d As she walked by, Jared took her arm. \u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay off your wife!\u201d she told him angrily and pulled free from his hold.</p><p>She was certain that he wanted to come after her; she was even certain that he wanted to haul off and strike her. But Cindy called him, and he turned back to her.</p><p>Jordan took advantage and ran up the stairs.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stay in her room as long as she had intended. She was really worried about Cindy, but as long as she intended to take a long bath and sleep, that was probably the best thing for her. Jordan picked up her latest costume to return, then, on a whim, brought the cop\u2019s book on vampires, and headed back down the stairs.</p><p>Neither Cindy nor Jared remained in the lobby.</p><p>Once again, she asked the concierge to call both Tiff and Roberto Capo for her. Tiff\u2019s answering machine came on, and Roberto Capo had yet to report to duty.</p><p>She left the Danieli and headed straight for the Arte della Anna Maria shop. After the usual greetings, everyone kissing everyone\u2019s cheeks, she lingered, admiring Lynn\u2019s latest puppets, and asking if they had all recovered from the hectic pace of the pre-party days.</p><p>\u201cSi! All goes well,\u201d Anna Maria told her.</p><p>\u201cWe have time for coffee, a snack!\u201d Raphael said with pleasure.</p><p>Anna Maria frowned. \u201cAll of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s slow, not many people ...\u201d Raphael said hopefully. \u201cGina is upstairs; she can watch the shop.\u201d He slipped an arm around Anna Maria. \u201cWe\u2019ll take Jordan to the trattoria down at the corner; just for a quick break. They have spent a lot of money here, renting so many costumes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo call Gina!\u201d Lynn told Raphael. \u201cWe\u2019ll be out waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only want to light a cigarette. You just smoked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLynn, you should wait, and catch up with us,\u201d Anna Maria said. She pointed out the window. \u201cThat lady is thinking about buying your latest harlequin. Talk to her?there is quite a price tag on the marionette, eh?\u201d</p><p>As it happened, Lynn wound up talking to the woman interested in her art, Anna Maria went upstairs to talk to Gina, and Jordan and Raphael started walking to the trattoria. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She looked at him. He seemed genuinely concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know your friend, the policeman, Roberto Capo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I went to meet him in a bar. I believe that he thinks something is going on as well, but though I don\u2019t understand the structure of the Venetian police, I think that Alfredo Manetti is his superior, and Manetti is convinced that I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met Roberto?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I went to meet him, I was almost where we were supposed to meet?then he told me to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you to run?\u201d Raphael was trying to make sure that he was understanding her English.</p><p>\u201cI could see the place we were to meet, and I saw him ... I\u2019m sure it was him ... and he suddenly told me to go, to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he had stumbled upon a robbery or something. We\u2019re not like Rome, where the pickpockets are everywhere, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I called the police station a couple of times, but he isn\u2019t in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s strange. I\u2019ll call for you again from the trattoria.\u201d They went through the line at the trattoria. Jordan liked the place very much; she could see all the food.</p><p>No chance of winding up with seppia, or cuttlefish.</p><p>When they were seated, she showed Raphael the book she had carried with her. She sipped coffee, watching him. \u201cI know that all of Venice is convinced I\u2019m overreacting to everything because I was engaged to a cop who was killed. But this book ... well, it stresses the feet that there are cults, and there are sick people, and that bad things do happen.\u201d</p><p>Before Raphael could reply, Anna Maria joined them, a plate of cold cuts and pasta on her tray.</p><p>\u201cAh, at last!\u201d she said sitting, then she glanced at the book. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA book about killers who are vampires,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d Jordan protested. \u201cIt\u2019s about criminal cases in which people thought they were vampires, or monsters of some sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be reading it,\u201d Anna Maria said, twirling her pasta. \u201cYou suffered enough with your fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that Jared used my past as an explanation for my behavior, but I swear to you, I am completely sane,\u201d Jordan said. Was she? Hadn\u2018t she spent the morning buying garlic and collecting holy water</p><p>Raphael flipped through the book. \u201cYou know, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the contessa was some horrid monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because we don\u2019t like people doesn\u2019t make them monsters,\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>\u201cBut a severed head was found in a canal,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd there have been other things,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cOf course, in other places, they would not be so big.</p><p>But here, in Italy, to desecrate a Catholic church ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Catholic church?\u201d Jordan demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt was no longer a Catholic church!\u201d Anna Maria said. \u201cThe building had been deconsecrated because of the danger in the structure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, it looked like a church, had been a church, and was still owned by the Church,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll manner of strange graffiti, that is all,\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>\u201cAncient strange graffiti,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cBabylonian ... Persian, something like that. The scholars never quite put it all together, or understood what was written. Much was in hieroglyphics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgyptian?\u201d Jordan murmured.</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cRome did conquer Egypt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere in the world, there is graffiti,\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>\u201cCiao!\u201d Lynn cried, joining them at last with her tray. \u201cI sold my marionette! Lunch is on me?oh, but you all have already paid, of course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go buy us all some champagne,\u201d Rafael suggested.</p><p>\u201cNot for me?no more alcohol,\u201d Jordan protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd not for Raphael. He will be sending the clean costumes back to the cleaners, and attaching the wrong hats to the wrong costumes!\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>But Raphael wasn\u2019t paying attention. He leaned forward. \u201cToday\u2019s paper carried an interview with some poor young students bused in from a violent area in the former Yugoslavia. They had a wonderful time, but one of their friends did not get on the bus to go home. They seemed to think that she fell in love with Venice and intends to stay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I had come from a war zone, I\u2019d want to stay,\u201d Lynn said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably attached herself to someone,\u201d Anna Maria commented. \u201cPoor girl. Maybe she will find her dream.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stood up suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ll call Roberto.\u201d</p> <p>He left the table. Anna Maria shook her head. \u201cSuppose, Jordan, that the contessa is an evil woman?</p><p>We have no proof. You left her palazzo and went to the police. The police went to her palazzo. They found nothing. There has been graffiti in Venice. Tourists come in, and they don\u2019t want to leave. How can you prove anything there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cBut I believe that somehow the severed head in the canal got into the water because of the contessa.\u201d</p><p>Raphael slid back into his chair. He looked at Jordan. \u201cRoberto called in sick today. I tried his home and got his answering machine.\u201d He passed a piece of paper to her across the table. \u201cHere\u2019s his home number, if you wish to try later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you very much.\u201d She pocketed the paper in her jeans. \u201cAnd!\u201d She said suddenly,</p> <p>\u201cTiff Henley is still missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid that will prove nothing,\u201d Anna Maria said. \u201cTiff has been known to swear she\u2019ll be at a function, and fly to Zurich the same day. I\u2019m afraid that Tiff isn\u2019t at all dependable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other cop I met, Alfredo Manetti, said that he would look into Tiff\u2019s disappearance,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Anna Maria told her. \u201cThat will make you feel better, yes?\u201d Raphael was still flipping through the book. \u201cI wonder how many disappearances happen without anyone knowing each year. In Venice, the government has long been concerned about the buses coming in. People sleep on them ... they haven\u2019t enough to eat. When they leave, it is hard to have a real count of people. And some who come in ... they are from very poor areas. They have no relatives, or their relatives are fighting to survive, and no money to spend on searching for those who may be lost. They must think that their family members have found rich Venetians, they are backpacking with other students. Maybe they have found an American, or a wealthy Japanese or German businessman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d Anna Maria said with a sigh.</p><p>He looked up at her. \u201cRemember when Carlotta stopped by for her costume? She told us that it was very strange around the church that had been so vandalized. She heard noises, and saw shadows at night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShadows, in Venice, at night, imagine that!\u201d Lynn teased.</p><p>Raphael made a face in her direction. He shook his head, staring at Jordan. \u201cI work my fingers to the bone. She sells a marionette and makes a fortune!\u201d Jordan decided not to tell them that she saw shadows and heard noises.</p><p>\u201cI think that you are all being far too ...\u201d He paused, searching for the word he wanted in English for Jordan\u2019s benefit. \u201cSkeptical! That\u2019s it, skeptical! Jordan is right?there are bad people out there. And look how many people have seen ghosts. Or believe in spirits. And as Father Vesco once said at mass, if we believe in the power of God, or a force of good, there is also a force of evil. To the Chinese, yin and yang. Who is to say that someone has not believed himself a monster, and then gone about doing evil to people who would not be missed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael, you will get Jordan upset,\u201d Anna Maria protested again with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset at all,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that Raphael understands why I am so concerned?especially about Tiff.\u201d</p><p>Lynn looked at Anna Maria. \u201cIt is better that we admit things happen. Then Jordan doesn\u2019t feel like a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you are ... putting egg in my face?\u201d Anna Maria said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no?egging you on, I think,\u201d Lynn said.</p> <p>Anna Maria nodded. \u201cI do not like the contessa.\u201d She hesitated and gave a little shiver. \u201cIt is ridiculous, but I think ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Jordan persisted.</p><p>\u201cIf evil is in people, then evil is in the contessa. Whatever money she gives, no matter that she is a benefactor of the arts.\u201d</p><p>As Jordan was listening to Anna Maria, amazed by her confession, she straightened. Where she sat at the table in the trattoria, she could see clearly out the glass door just behind the counter with the cash register.</p><p>She was sure that she saw Ragnor. Not many men were so tall, and though there were many light-haired Venetians and tourists, few were as blond as he.</p><p>She rose, kissing Anna Maria on the cheek. \u201cYou do have great instincts!\u201d she told her. \u201cThe contessa is evil, I\u2019m convinced, and I\u2019m glad that others feel it. I think even Cindy knows it, she just pretends that it isn\u2019t true because of Jared. Excuse me, please, all of you. I think I just saw a friend.\u201d Raphael started to protest, but she was already out of the trattoria. She rushed out to the street.</p><p>It was definitely Ragnor. He was in the calle, about a block before her. She started to follow, then stopped dead in her tracks.</p><p>A woman had joined him. A woman wearing a traditional, long, Venetian Carnevale cape. She wore a large hat that obscured her features, but no mask.</p><p>It was definitely the contessa.</p><p>She caught Ragnor by the arm. He turned to her. She said something earnestly. He lowered his head to listen.</p><p>As Jordan watched, he slipped an arm around the contessa, leading her down the next narrow alley.</p><p>For a moment Jordan stood very still, feeling the breeze against her cheeks.</p><p>Then she followed.</p><p>She reached the alley, but did not see them. She walked through the alley, coming upon the canal that stretched along the riva on the other side.</p><p>There was no sign of Ragnor or the contessa, but as she stood there, she was startled to hear slow music, and see that most of the people near her had paused, and now stood still by the canal.</p><p>A gondola was going by.</p><p>As well as being black, it was draped in black. There were bouquets of flowers strewn over the forward section.</p><p>Centered in the gondola was a coffin. Large, black, trimmed in gold. Drapings and flowers were over the coffin as well. A tall woman, dressed all in black, with a black veil, stood at the rear of the gondola, as if keeping guard over the coffin.</p><p>Behind the gondola followed others, all draped in black.</p><p>Jordan realized she was watching a Venetian funeral procession.</p><p>Next to her, a woman spoke softly in English, making the sign of the cross. \u201cPoor Salvatore! Such a horrible end!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sad. He was the very best. Such a handsome, charming and kind young man,\u201d replied her companion, a tall man with a German accent.</p><p>\u201cThey said it was an accident; he didn\u2019t duck for a bridge,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>The man made a guttural noise of doubt \u201cHe was a gondolier for years! He knew every bridge in Venice. He finds a head in the water and gives it to the police ... and then he dies.\u201d Jordan stared at the couple next to her in amazement. \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m so sorry for interrupting, but ... is that a funeral for ... Salvatore D\u2019Onofrio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, terrible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the woman said. \u201cI went on so many wonderful trips around the city with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has shown Venice to many, many foreigners,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he ... he found the head in the canal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and brought it to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, the next day, he is killed by a severe blow to the head?and found in the canal himself. The body must have traveled.\u201d The woman swallowed, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but... well, the body traveled.</p><p>It was caught in the motor of some water vessel ... and I\u2019m afraid that Adriatic sharks had a way with him as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was already dead when that came about,\u201d the German man said, consoling them both.</p><p>\u201cThank you, thank you for the information,\u201d Jordan said. She felt cold, cold beneath the shining warmth of the sun. As long as she lived, she would never forget the sight of the funerary gondola, draped in black, the flowers, the woman in her veil at the rear ...</p><p>Salvatore. It was Salvatore, who had been so worried about her.</p><p>Who had found a severed human head in the water ...</p><p>Kind, wonderful, gentle, handsome, his life ahead of him.</p><p>Salvatore D\u2019Onofrio, a man who had known that there was danger in the shadows, a man who had warned her, taken her away, was dead.</p><p>As she stood there, the gondola passed under the archway of a pedestrian bridge.</p><p>Upon the bridge, watching as the funerary gondola poled by, was a man.</p><p>He wore the costume of the dottore.</p><p>Then, as the gondola passed, he looked straight at Jordan, stared for several minutes, raised a hand, and disappeared across the bridge.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Jordan didn\u2019t notice the note at first. When she returned to the hotel and opened her door she was intent only on making sure that nothing had been changed.</p><p>Her garlic cloves still lined the windows. In fact, the room reeked of them.</p><p>Her vials of holy water remained where she had placed them, right on the desk. She fingered the large silver cross around her neck. It remained in place.</p><p>She went next to her computer, checking her E-mail. She was elated to see that she had received another note from the cop in New Orleans. \u201cPlease come and see us at the house, whenever you can.\u201d He left an address. She put through a call to him, but again, an answering machine picked up. She left a message. \u201cThank you so much, I would love to come see you.\u201d She tried the number for Roberto Capo that Raphael had given her. Again, she was frustrated when an answering machine picked up. She left him a message. \u201cRoberto, this is Jordan Riley. Please call me. I\u2019m worried about you. Also . . . the gondolier who died recently of a terrible accident was the man who found the severed head in the canal. I knew him. He warned me about danger.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThere is something going on here, and you seem to believe me. Please, call me.\u201d She left the name of her hotel, though he knew where she was staying, and her room number as well.</p><p>She was about to call Tiff when she saw the envelope that had been thrust beneath her door. She picked it up and found a handwritten message in a hotel envelope. The operator had written out what she had heard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Miss Henley called. Please meet her this afternoon, if you are able.</p><p>There was an address at the bottom of the paper. It meant nothing to Jordan.</p><p>Once again, she made a quick survey of her room, making sure it was properly protected. Not wanting the night maid to come in and move anything?or open a window?she was careful to leave the do not disturb notice on the door. Fingering her cross, and putting one of the vials of holy water in her purse, she hurried down the stairs.</p> <p>At the concierge desk, she asked for directions.</p><p>\u201cThis is near the place you went the other night,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019ll have no problems. On your map?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I lost the map you gave me the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have another. You wish to walk?\u201d</p><p>It would soon be growing dark, but there was still daylight left. Jordan decided to walk, and to firmly retrace her footsteps. She wanted to know exactly where she was going, how to return, and also how to go back again, in case she needed to.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>The concierge mapped out the best route for her and pointed out that if she were tired when it was time to return, there was a vaporetto stop nearby. She thanked him and left the hotel.</p><p>Along the way, she realized that she had left the cop\u2019s vampire book with Raphael at the table. She thought about ducking by the shop to get it back, then decided she could do that the next day. She wanted to find Tiff.</p><p>The sun was setting as she walked, and the wind was picking up, but she was still certain she could reach her objective before dark. She fingered her cross, saying a little prayer for Sal D\u2019Onofrio. \u201cWhat a good man!\u201d she whispered out loud.</p><p>The walk was pleasant. The streets were filled with people, a few still in costume. On various corners, she saw artists and performers, including a man who did characterizations of tourists in their costumes, a woman who moved liked a robot, all dressed in silver and a dancer, on a pedestal, as if she were the figurine on a music box. On one corner, a violinist played.</p><p>Jordan stopped by each of them, leaving a few thousand lire in the hats they had set out to collect donations.</p> <p>As she neared her destination, the streets grew quieter. She entered a mainly residential section of the city, with only a few tourist shops. She passed a fruit and vegetable market, campo after campo each with a beautiful church at its center, wells and statues, and even little garden areas. She wondered after a while just how many bridges she had crossed. She had meant to be so careful and determined, but she had been drawn to the charm of the entertainment for moments, even forgotten the heaviness that lay on her heart, having discovered that Sal D\u2019Onofrio was dead.</p><p>At last, she came to a neighborhood she knew. She saw the archway under which she had last seen Roberto Capo and found the trattoria where they had been scheduled to meet. The host welcomed her, speaking English automatically, as if Jordan wore a sign that said, \u201cI am an American, linguistically challenged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA table for one, signorina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now, thank you very much. I was to meet a friend here the other night. Roberto Capo. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi, si. A good customer. A friend to me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not. The other night ... he was waiting for someone, yes. He had a... sneezes. A cold, as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he is ill?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I think. He was anxious to see you. Perhaps he\u2019ll come in later. You may wait. Have a drink, on the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I have to meet another friend. Oh, where is this address, please? I know that it is near.\u201d She showed him the map.</p><p>\u201cBack down the calle. To your right. Somewhere there; I am not sure of this exact address, but you\u2019ll be close enough to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you; grazie mille.\u201d</p><p>Outside, she realized that in the brief time she had been in the trattoria, the sun had nearly set. There were shadows lining the streets once again.</p><p>She spoke to herself out loud to keep up her courage.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t find Tiff right away, I\u2019ll go back to the trattoria, and then straight to the vaporetto stop.\u201d She followed the host\u2019s directions and found herself in a large campo surrounded by narrow little streets, or calles, that went off in several different directions. She looked for the address on the map, and it appeared that she was in the right place, but she didn\u2019t see anything except buildings that were old and beautiful, but were certainly not shops, restaurants, or any other kind of public place. Where the hell was Tiff?</p><p>She looked across the campo and saw the old church that had intrigued her before. It was boarded up, in great need of restoration.</p><p>Walking over to it, she saw that the boards covering many of the broken windows had fallen. Stone steps led to beautifully carved doors.</p><p>She stared at the church, tempted, then remembered how anxious she was to meet Tiff. She decided to walk down the street a way, and see if she couldn\u2019t find a resident or shopkeeper who might tell her exactly where she should be.</p><p>As she turned down one of the streets, she hesitated, looking back, remembering how Raphael had said that an old, deconsecrated church had been vandalized.</p><p>There was no graffiti on the walls, or on the boards that covered the broken windows, but it was a deconsecrated church, she was certain. Sal D\u2019Onofrio had told her so. It was definitely derelict. She looked around the campo, suddenly afraid that she would hear noises.</p><p>Whispers from the shadows; the flutter of wings; hisses that seemed to sound right next to her ears, like words she couldn\u2019t quite comprehend.</p><p>The evening was quiet. The shadows were still.</p><p>She started down the street.</p><p>The sounds of her own footsteps seemed to snap and echo in the darkness.</p><p>She turned a corner and found an old woman sweeping her steps.</p><p>\u201cMi scusi, per piacere ...\u201d What was the proper tense for \u2018do you know where this is\u2019 when asking a stranger for help in finding a place?</p><p>\u201cSai dov\u2019e questo numero?\u201d</p><p>The woman understood that she needed help. She smoothed her graying hair and studied the map under the light from her front door.</p><p>\u201cSi. La chiesa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa chiesa?\u201d Jordan said. Chiesa. Church. \u201cEvero?\u201d The woman sighed impatiently. She walked forward, showing Jordan the way, right around the next corner. \u201cLa chiesa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa chiesa,\u201d Jordan repeated and thanked her.</p><p>Jordan walked slowly back to the campo and stared at the church. She realized that there was light coming from within. Also, though she had thought that they were closed earlier, one of the carved doors was now slightly ajar.</p><p>\u201cTiff, if this is some kind of a joke, I\u2019m going to throttle you myself!\u201d Jordan muttered.</p><p>Tentatively, she approached the church.</p><p>Not about to have any tricks played on her, she opened the door fully.</p><p>It started to swing back. She gritted her teeth and looked around the campo. There was an old metal boot scraper next to the small fountain that stood in front of the circular path immediately before the steps to the church.</p><p>The fountain merely drizzled a trail of water escaping from the mouth of a big fish.</p><p>She swore at Tiff again as she went up to the boot scraper, a metal piece made of two fish facing one another.</p><p>\u201cThe damn thing is probably rooted into the street,\u201d she muttered, using such force in her attempt to pick it up that she nearly careened backwards with the heavy weight.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m wrong.\u201d She gritted her teeth as she strained to carry the heavy weight up the steps, where she opened the door wider, and propped it open with the metal boot scraper. That done, she looked in.</p><p>\u201cTiff?\u201d</p><p>There were candles burning in the church, most of them seeming to glow from an altar in front of the choir stalls, a distance that seemed far from the door.</p><p>\u201cTiff, damn you!\u201d</p><p>She entered the church and started along the central aisle. She meant to move quickly.</p><p>Her footsteps were slow.</p><p>She saw the chapels on either sides of the nave of the church, secretive dens of shadow. There were altars in all of them and artwork hanging above the altars.</p><p>She curled her fingers about the cross that hung round her neck.</p><p>\u201cTiff?\u201d</p><p>Fear was setting in. She glanced at the side chapels to make sure that the shadows weren\u2019t moving. She imagined she heard a fluttering of wings.</p><p>It was the sound of her own breath.</p><p>Get out of here, idiot!</p><p>Then she realized that the candles at the altar were set around something in a rectangular pattern. A long rectangular pattern.</p><p>A body.</p><p>For a moment she stood dead still; even her heart seemed to cease to beat.</p><p>\u201cTiff?\u201d</p><p>She started walking again, forcing her footsteps along faster.</p><p>Yes, it was Tiff. She was stretched out on the altar in a long white garment, just like the innocent ing\u00e9nue in a horror movie awaiting the menace of the villain.</p><p>\u201cTiff, damn you, this isn\u2019t funny! Get up.\u201d</p><p>Something swept past her head.</p><p>Then, the roof above her seemed to be alive with the flutter of wings.</p><p>\u201cBats!\u201d She looked up at the ceiling.</p><p>Yes, bats.</p><p>\u201cDive bomb me again, and I\u2019ll come back with a lighter and a can of gasoline, and let them arrest me for burning down half of Venice!\u201d she threatened, raising a hand to the roof.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Tiff... !\u201d</p><p>She neared the altar, shaking she was so scared and angry, but not about to leave without Tiffany Henley, and not without telling her just what she thought of this cruel nonsense.</p><p>\u201cTiff, get up!\u201d</p><p>She swore, brushing her sleeve on a candle as she reached out to shake Tiff.</p><p>It was definitely Tiff. Dressed in white ...</p><p>Like a white shroud, winding all the way up to her neck. Any minute now, Tiff would open her eyes wide and go, \u201cBoo!\u201d She\u2019d tell Jordan that she just couldn\u2019t help it, she had the money to play such an elaborate joke, and she just wanted Jordan to be able to laugh at what had happened at the contessa\u2019s palazzo. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Tiff didn\u2019t move when Jordan shook her. Her arm was stone cold.</p><p>Jordan stared at her face. Her eyes were closed. Her color was ashen.</p><p>More than ashen. She looked as if her flesh had been bleached to white.</p> <p>\u201cTiff... ?\u201d</p><p>She shook the woman again. Tiff wasn\u2019t just cold; she was icy. Jordan swallowed, losing her breath.</p><p>\u201cTiff?\u201d she whispered again, this time her voice a plea.</p><p>But she knew the truth.</p><p>Tiff was dead.</p> <p>She lifted her newfound friend by the shoulders. Then she gasped in horror, dropping the body and stepping back.</p><p>Tiff\u2019s head had remained on the altar. It had been severed from her body. Only the white shroud had hidden the decapitation.</p><p>She found her breath and let out a bloodcurdling scream. For an instant, she was transfixed in horror; a second later, the human drive for self-preservation shot into her like lightning.</p><p>She turned to flee, even starting to run for the open doorway before she saw that it was blocked.</p><p>A man stood there.</p><p>In black pants and a black leather jacket.</p> <p>Head shining golden in the candlelight.</p><p>Ragnor Wulfsson.</p><p>\u201cOh, you bastard!\u201d she shrieked, stopping, looking madly about for a weapon, something to throw. A dusty hymnal lay on the ground; she plucked it up, throwing it</p><p>\u201cJordan, no!\u201d he called to her, but she was in a frenzy, beyond listening, far beyond hearing him or comprehending.</p><p>She raced back for a candle, reaching for it with such abandon that she scattered half the candles, and disrupted the body.</p><p>She was dimly aware of the awful sound as the head hit the floor.</p><p>She threw a candle, then another.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d he shouted again, striding down the aisle. \u201cJordan, damn you, watch out, come to me, run to me!\u201d</p> <p>But she was backing away.</p><p>She had to get around him.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d he shouted her name again.</p><p>And then, that was all she remembered. She felt the incredible sting of a sharp thud against the back of her head.</p><p>The shadows definitely moved.</p><p>They shot across her eyes.</p><p>They formed a solid wall of blackness.</p><p>And she careened into the dust-laden marble of the deconsecrated church.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>\u201cJordan, Jordan ...\u201d</p><p>At first, she was only dimly aware of her name being spoken. Then she felt the pounding in her head.</p><p>The sound of her name penetrated through the layers of darkness and she opened her eyes.</p><p>Night.</p><p>She heard a trickle of water. She shifted her head slightly; skyrockets exploded. They cleared; she looked around and focused on the face peering down into her own.</p><p>Raphael.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. I don\u2019t own a cell phone. Stay still; I\u2019ll get help.\u201d She stretched out a hand, grasping his arm. She was quickly gaining consciousness and memory. \u201cNo, don\u2019t leave me. Look in the church.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, thinking that she was still under the spell of the conk on her head.</p><p>\u201cJordan, this was not a good place to meet. I don\u2019t know what you wanted, but?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe church, look in the church,\u201d she said desperately. She realized exactly where she was?just feet away from the steps to the church. She lay, half off, half on the silly little fountain. She touched her face; her cheeks were damp. Raphael must have used the water from the fountain to revive her.</p><p>He stood. \u201cYou need to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said firmly. Was she crazy? She probably did need to go to the hospital. Her skull could be fractured, for all she knew. What had happened? She\u2019d gotten there, gone into the church, seen the body...</p><p>And then Ragnor.</p><p>And then ...</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she cried suddenly. She didn\u2019t know how she had gotten outside the church, but Raphael shouldn\u2019t go in. There was something very wrong inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiff, Tiff. . . is dead. On the altar. Someone cut her head off.\u201d He stared at her, then turned toward the church. \u201cNo, don\u2019t go in! You could be in danger, Raphael?\u201d But he ignored her. He was already heading toward the church. The door still stood open.</p><p>The boot scraper was back, next to the fountain, right where it had been. In fact, the way she lay, it might appear that she had tripped over it, fallen, and cracked her head.</p><p>Raphael was already going up the steps. She struggled to her feet, dizzy only for a moment. Her head was clearing. She tested her skull. It seemed fine. Her fingers were still upon her scalp as she hurried forward after Raphael.</p><p>He stood just within the church. He hadn\u2019t gone in far?there was so little light.</p><p>No candles burned now.</p><p>Down the stretch of the aisle, they could just make out the altar. It appeared to be empty.</p><p>Every instinct in Jordan screamed that she shouldn\u2019t enter the church again, but she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes; astonishment made her travel down the aisle quickly, determined to see the altar, and around it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jordan, allora!\u201d Raphael cried. \u201cStop! This building has been closed down until repairs can be made. It might be dangerous in here!\u201d</p><p>She ignored him, proceeding to the altar.</p><p>There was no sign of Tiff. Not a speck of blood.</p><p>\u201cShe was here!\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Raphael demanded.</p><p>\u201cTiff! I\u2019m telling you, she was here, and her head had been cut off.\u201d Raphael walked down the aisle. He pulled out his keys, flashing the mini-light attached to them around the area.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cThere is nothing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cJordan, Anna Maria was right. I should not have put things into your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Jordan raged. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I came here, and I saw her body on the altar. I thought Tiff was playing a joke on me?she had left me a message to meet her here. And there she was, on the altar.</p><p>So I walked up to it, yelling at her, telling her to quit fooling around. Then I?I touched her, I tried to shake her by the shoulders. Her body came up; her head?her head stayed down. It wasn\u2019t attached.</p><p>Then I saw Ragnor at the door, and then ... someone hit me!\u201d Raphael was looking at her, trying not to appear skeptical.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that you were so afraid for Tiff that you rushed here, tripped, hit your head ... and imagined the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t take any trips to Oz!\u201d</p><p>Raphael stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I didn\u2019t imagine anything.\u201d</p><p>Raphael flashed his mini-light around the corners of the church. There was nothing to be seen anywhere.</p><p>Not even a rat scurried across the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou saw Ragnor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn front of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he walked up to you and hit you on the head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI?no!\u201d she murmured, confused herself for a moment She had seen Ragnor, yes. He had been shouting at her, hadn\u2019t he? Telling her to come to him. And she had thrown something at him ... a hymnal.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The church was very dark, and more deeply shadowed than ever with Raphael\u2019s little mini-light flashing around. He shivered.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, one second!\u201d she whispered. She walked back to the altar, running her fingers over it. \u201cRaphael, she was here! There\u2019s not a speck of dust on this altar. Look at this place?if something hadn\u2019t been there, there would be dust!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get the police,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>Maybe Roberto Capo would be back in the station at last Whether they mocked her or not, she had to tell them what she had seen.</p><p>\u201cAll right. But we\u2019re not leaving this area. Things? change around here, far too quickly.\u201d He nodded, \u201cWe\u2019ll call from the public phone down the calle. But Jordan, please, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d They started down the aisle?two rational human beings, walking at a steady gait She sped up a little to catch up with him. He hurried more; she sped up again. They were running by the time they reached the door and burst out upon the steps.</p><p>Jordan nearly tripped. She would have done so, and sprawled right down on to the fountain if Raphael hadn\u2019t been there to catch her.</p><p>He kept her arm as they came down the steps and studied her gravely.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come running out and trip and wind up knocked out by the fountain,\u201d she told him firmly.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your head,\u201d he told her, touching her temple.</p><p>\u201cNot there! On the back of my head. How could I have stumbled forward and hit myself on the back of my head?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you get the right station, and ask for Roberto Capo.\u201d They walked to the edge of the campo where there was an enclosed public phone. Raphael called the operator, then frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhich is the station you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear the Danieli! I\u2019m a tourist, I don\u2019t know the address. You should know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a law-abiding citizen. I never call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto is your friend! You should know.\u201d</p><p>He swore softly in Italian. \u201cSi, si, I have the number.\u201d He rattled off something to the operator; she put him through. He spoke for a minute, then covered the mouthpiece. \u201cCapo won\u2019t be in today; he has a fever.\u201d</p><p>She could hear someone speaking into the phone. Raphael winced. \u201cAlfredo Manetti is on the line.\u201d Jordan threw up her hands. Convincing him of anything was impossible. She\u2019d have to deliver her own head on a silver platter for him to believe that something was really wrong.</p><p>Raphael started speaking. He talked a long time.</p><p>He gave Jordan a number of sideways glances, and talked some more.</p><p>He hung up. \u201cThey are coming,\u201d he told her. \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a drink; no alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have a concussion, yet? Big bump, bruise on the bone. No alcohol; you\u2019re right. But a cafe or te?we\u2019ll probably have a few minutes to wait. I told him that no, it wasn\u2019t exactly an emergency. No one is in danger at the moment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordan wondered if that was true. Looking around the campo, she shivered. She heard no hisses, whispers or wings. The shadows stretched long in the night, but they weren\u2019t moving.</p><p>Still, she felt as if they were being watched. As if evil eyes looked out at them from the darkness.</p><p>\u201cCoffee will be fine,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>They walked back to the trattoria. The same kind host met them. Before Jordan knew it, Raphael explained that she\u2019d had an accident. The host\u2019s mother was there, and brought ice cubes and cold water and hot tea. She wanted Jordan\u2019s feet propped up. She was so kind and considerate that Jordan felt guilty.</p><p>It occurred to her to ask Raphael how he had come to be there. He seemed baffled. \u201cYou called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called the shop and left me a message.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI never called the shop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, someone did. I didn\u2019t take the call. Lynn answered and wrote down the message. I think she was jealous that you asked me to come, maybe, and not her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t call!\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Alfredo Manetti arrived at the trattoria. He came over to the corner table where Jordan and Raphael sat, waiting. He pulled a chair out, straddled it and leaned on the back of it as he stared at the two of them.</p><p>\u201cAll right, now, Miss Riley. Tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>She sat straight, pulling the ice bag from the back of her head and facing him squarely. \u201cI received a note from Tiff Henley. Remember, I told you she was missing? And you promised to check on her.\u201d Manetti nodded. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer note left an address and asked me to meet her. The concierge gave me the directions. I followed them. I couldn\u2019t quite find the place, but a lady in the street told me it had to be the church. When I got there, there were candles burning. I saw something on the altar and walked up to it What I saw was Tiff?</p> <p>playing a cruel joke on me, I thought. But I tried to get her to get up?and saw that she had been decapitated.\u201d</p><p>Manetti was just staring at her. He studied her coldly. \u201cBut the body has disappeared?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe body was there?have your men check. There isn\u2019t a speck of dust on the altar. And you know, if you do what I suggested before?use Luminal?that\u2019s l-u-m-i-n-a-l, in English?at least, you may find out that there are little spatters of blood around, undetectable to the naked eye, especially in the shadows of such a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insulting the Italian police, Miss Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m merely challenging your personal investigative techniques.\u201d He appeared a bit amused. But then he said, \u201cYou\u2019re certain that you saw Tiffany Henley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, because when I told you that I would investigate her disappearance, I did so. Mrs. Henley left Venice on an Alitalia flight to Paris Saturday at eleven A.M.\u201d Jordan felt as if a wave of ice water washed over her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe purchased the ticket herself at the airport; the clerk remembers her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she came back!\u201d Jordan whispered, but the words sounded false to her own ears. She leaned forward again. \u201cWill you please check out the church?\u201d</p><p>He nodded gravely and stared at Raphael. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>Raphael stuttered. He didn\u2019t want to let her down. \u201cWell, there was no body when I arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what were you doing at a boarded-up building?\u201d Manetti asked him.</p><p>\u201cJordan called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone claiming to be Jordan called me and asked me to meet her there.\u201d Manetti nodded again. He seemed to be sympathetic.</p><p>Bull! Jordan thought.</p><p>\u201cSo ... you get a call, you arrive, and Miss Riley is unconscious by the fountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi,\u201d Raphael murmured unhappily.</p><p>\u201cBut you seem fine now, Miss Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a bump on the back of my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should get you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut perhaps you have done injury to yourself, causing illusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not having illusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome. We will retrace what happened.\u201d</p><p>They left the trattoria and walked back to the church. Manetti had brought other officers with him, and they were in the church. Large police lights now illuminated dark corners. The place did not appear sinister at all. Artwork was gone from the side chapels, and there was nothing above the main altar.</p><p>\u201cThere were other things here,\u201d Jordan murmured.</p><p>\u201cThey are gone now, too,\u201d Manetti said.</p><p>Jordan threw up her hands. \u201cYou have no intention of believing a thing I say, or really checking into the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d Manetti said with a deep sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice I have six officers in here. I made a point of going to the airport when I discovered that Mrs. Henley was not at her palazzo. Now, we have looked and looked ... but as you see, there is nothing but dust.\u201d Jordan strode angrily to the altar. She wiped her hands over it \u201cAs you\u2019ll note, there is no dust here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the one thing my men did find was a crumb-filled food bag, Miss Riley. Someone has probably slept on the altar. With so many poor foreigners in Venice, this place was probably used as a shelter.\u201d At that moment, Jordan realized that there was nothing she could say or do that would convince this man that she had really seen Tiff Henley dead.</p><p>And decapitated.</p><p>\u201cI nearly married a police officer?as you know. I would never play tricks on law enforcement officers,\u201d she told him angrily.</p><p>\u201cI know that you would not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You hit your head, Miss Riley. I\u2019ve put through a call to your hotel, but your cousin and his wife seem to be out.\u201d</p><p>She needed help. Mental help. That\u2019s what he was trying to tell her.</p><p>\u201cWhereas Carnevale is healthy fun for most people, perhaps it has not been the wisest time for you to visit,\u201d Manetti suggested softly.</p><p>She stared at him intently, but her mind was racing. I don\u2019t trust my cousin at all anymore, sad but true. You doubt my every word. And now, the man who has made me feel secure has proven to be</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cI saw Ragnor Wulfsson after I saw the body. Find him and bring him in; then you\u2019ll have corroboration of what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll watch for the man. Now, there is little else you can do here. I think you should go to the hospital, since we cannot reach your relatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019m fine. No knot on my head. I\u2019m sure I imagined my fell.\u201d She looked at him coldly. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to my hotel, and stay in my room for a while.\u201d She was certain of what she had seen, and of what had happened. And that she was personally in danger here. \u201cPlease don\u2019t trouble yourselves too much, but if you are able to get hold of my cousin and his wife, please ... please tell them that I\u2019ll meet them at Harry\u2019s between ten and eleven. That\u2019s usually a good time to get in without a reservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Riley, I\u2019m sorry to say this, but I think it might be in your best interest to cut your visit to Venice short, and go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Maybe you\u2019re right,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll spend my time at the hotel looking into what arrangements can be made in the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you to the hotel,\u201d Manetti said.</p><p>\u201cI can walk Jordan back?\u201d Raphael offered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see her back,\u201d Manetti said firmly.</p><p>\u201cThat is kind of you, Officer Manetti,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially since we must surely stop by the station first.\u201d</p><p>Manetti frowned. \u201cThe station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to file a report I mean, just in case any of this proves to be real in the future, surely you\u2019ll want what happened tonight in your records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Manetti murmured.</p><p>\u201cRaphael, I\u2019d appreciate very much if you\u2019d come as well.\u201d She stared at Manetti. She wanted her words recorded as she said them?she trusted Raphael to see that her account of what happened went down correctly on paper.</p><p>A police launch took them to the station. She sat with an unknown officer at a desk, ignoring his looks when his eyes fell upon her skeptically as he typed the words Raphael translated for her. Manetti looked on. As she was nearing the end of her story, there was a commotion at the front of the station. Manetti excused himself. Jordan finished, Raphael read the paper, nodded at her gravely, and she signed the typed police report.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she murmured to Raphael.</p><p>He nodded, but as they started to slip out the entry, they saw that Manetti was in deep conversation with a young woman who was very upset and insistent; Manetti was trying to calm her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe woman ... she is the sister of the gondolier who died. She is angry with Manetti, who is telling her what the autopsy report said?that her brother\u2019s body was mangled by the sea and sharks and other creatures, but that it still appeared he died from a blow to the head?slamming into the stonework of a low bridge. She says that he did not, that he was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right?he was murdered,\u201d Jordan murmured.</p><p>Raphael stared at her.</p><p>\u201cI know that she\u2019s right.\u201d Jordan sighed. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Manetti think it\u2019s a little bit suspicious? The man finds a severed head?and all of a sudden he meets a grisly death himself?\u201d Raphael watched her for a moment, then whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t think it will help right now if you bring that up.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, maybe not. Jordan couldn\u2019t help herself. She walked up to the two, apologizing to the woman in Italian, then telling Manetti. \u201cHere I go again, insulting you. Listen to her! What kind of an ass are you? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Look into Sal\u2019s death, do some investigating!\u201d</p><p>Before Manetti could reply?and she began to fear that his reply might be an arrest and a one-way ticket to an Italian institution for the insane?she swung around, grabbed Raphael\u2019s arm, and left the station.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you until we can find Cindy or Jared?\u201d he told her, but she shook her head firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay, Raphael, honestly.

She promised to see him the next day; it was a lie, but she would call the shop when she could and assure him that she was fine.</p><p>When he left her, she hurried up to her room and moved as swiftly as she could. She didn\u2019t intend to be caught there.</p><p>Ragnor had an uncanny habit of appearing when she did.</p><p>First, she went on the Internet and found that she could still get out of Venice that night. She could get a flight to Paris that would connect her directly to New Orleans. If she hurried. If she could get out of the hotel and get a water taxi to the airport quickly enough.</p> <p>She paused suddenly, feeling as though a breeze had picked up in the room, when there could be no breeze. She looked around the room, an uneasy feeling seeping deep into her bones. She jumped up and searched the sitting area, then burst into the bathroom, her heart pounding. The door was still locked.</p><p>She returned to her laptop, desperate to move quickly.</p><p>She booked the flight, praying that her credit card, overextended in her travels, wouldn\u2019t be rejected.</p><p>She had grown overly anxious but took the time to E-mail the cop in New Orleans, telling him her flight arrangements and her time of arrival. She was going backwards, in time. If she made the nine o\u2019clock flight out of Venice and connected with the overseas plane in Paris, her arrival time in New Orleans would be just after midnight. She packed up her laptop, underwear, and an overnight bag, leaving the rest of her clothing and belongings in the room, carelessly shutting her bag. Terrified that some force was going to stop her, she was running as she left the room, and had to force herself to go back and lock the door.</p><p>She didn\u2019t check out, nor did she take a water taxi from the Danieli. She hurried to the hotel across Saint Mark\u2019s Square and took a taxi from there to the airport.</p><p>After presenting her passport, she was the last person to run aboard the plane. She watched Venice disappear, feeling a strange sorrow as the plane rose in the night sky. She loved the city like few other places in the world.</p><p>But she would be back.</p><p>Gino Meroni walked into the second-floor ballroom of the palazzo.</p> <p>He was alone in the room, dressed in the dottore costume. He liked to be known as the dottore. Oh, yes, he\u2019d said. He liked to cure people of all their ills.</p><p>Gino was accustomed to the eeriness of costumes at Carnevale, and the strangeness of his employers, as well. He had shamed himself, he knew. But he had also done well in his efforts to make up for his errors, and he hadn\u2019t expected to be afraid tonight.</p><p>But he was.</p><p>A fire crackled in the great hearth. That was the only light in the room. The dottore sat in a huge wing chair by the fire, but he was a large man, and did not at all appear dwarfed by the chair; in fact, his power seemed enhanced by it. He was angry. Things tonight?things with which Gino had not been involved ?had not gone well. He knew that the contessa was not even here, she had been wounded so badly. And the dottore .. .</p><p>He had escaped with little injury, but the contessa and others had taken a sad toll for his deliverance.</p><p>That night, Gino had done well at all his tasks.</p><p>Still, the light from the flames burning in the hearth seemed to dance upon the room in shades of blood red. The dottore sat so still, his knuckles white on the arms of the chair as he clutched them tightly. The room was very quiet It was an ominous silence. The dottore made Gino stand in that silence for a very long time, nervously shifting from foot to foot.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d the dottore said at last.</p><p>\u201cI went as directed,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to clear our place, but I could do nothing about the woman for she wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d He didn\u2019t say that he had been clearing away the last of the refuse when the man had entered the church with the woman. He told the dottore instead that \u201cThe police came. Many of them.</p><p>But it was all right. I saw to it that nothing was left behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the girl walked away with the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The police think that she\u2019s crazy.\u201d Gino then put a note of trial and exhaustion into his voice. \u201cThere was quite a mess you left behind; I was scarcely able to manage for your safety.\u201d The dottore nodded gravely.</p><p>\u201cSo much would not have been necessary?if you had not been careless with your duties. There is still a wealth of trouble to be dealt with due to your inability to dispose of our refuse with efficiency.\u201d He\u2019d lost the head. That one head! He cleaned up so much for these people, and he\u2019d lost one head . . .</p><p>\u201cI work well for you,\u201d Gino said. \u201cI ask no questions. I risk myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d Gino lifted his hands. \u201cWhat is so special about this one girl? I can bring you dozens of girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Riley is my concern,\u201d the dottore said coldly. \u201cYou have failed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t create the problem at the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have failed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI defended you! The girl will still be available. You will have her eventually. Your game will just go on a little longer. And as to the other... I made one error. One mistake.\u201d The dottore leaned forward. \u201cThere are no mistakes in my employ, Gino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contessa said that?\u201d Gino began, sweat breaking out on his flesh. Odd. He was sweating, yet felt cold inside, cold down to his shoes.</p><p>\u201cThe contessa does not matter in this anymore. You have failed me.\u201d Since he\u2019d been an adult, Gino had dealt in death and danger. Entering a world of crime, he had always known what the consequences could be.</p><p>He had always thought that he would know, and accept, when his time came.</p><p>The dread and fear he felt then were horrible. He was afraid that he would begin to shake, that he would lose control of his bowels, humiliate himself completely.</p><p>Perhaps the dottore was bluffing, warning him with such a threat.</p><p>There were no mistakes.</p><p>And the dottore didn\u2019t bluff.</p><p>\u201cSo, after all my service, you will . .. you will sate your bloodlust on me,\u201d he said, and he tried to sound as if he would die with honor.</p><p>\u201cMe? I would be sickened by you, Gino,\u201d the dottore said.</p><p>\u201cThen ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are others who are hungry.\u201d</p><p>The dottore lifted his hand.</p><p>From the far corners and shadows of the room, Gino heard a scurrying sound.</p><p>Hisses ...</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Whispers.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to scream, he wasn\u2019t going to ...</p><p>The first pain seared into him. Horror began its crawl over him.</p><p>He began to choke on horror. And his own blood.</p><p>The crimson tongues of flame that had glowed over the room had been but a taste of what was to come.</p><p>And as red death descended upon him, he lost all resolve.</p><p>His screams echoed with bloodcurdling agony throughout the palazzo ...</p><p>And into the night.</p><p>Though her first flight went like clockwork, Jordan was once again the last person to board the plane when she came running along the walkway to her gate at Orly.</p><p>This time, her late arrival was good; she wound up being placed in business class with a comfortable seat and plenty of amenities. She was exhausted but tense when she sat and buckled on her seat belt. A glass of champagne seemed a good thing. Wine with dinner might help give her a few hours of sleep before she arrived in New Orleans. Dinner was good. She tried to watch a movie. The seat next to her was empty.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>But after the first few hours into the flight, she knew that she would be missed at the hotel. Manetti would have gotten hold of Jared and Cindy by now; they\u2019d realize that she wasn\u2019t going to show up at dinner.</p><p>If Manetti had really traced Tiff Henley\u2019s departure from Venice, he could do the same with hers. She was going to visit a man she didn\u2019t know, who could be an insane and corrupt human being, and it was beginning to seem possible that she was losing her mind.</p><p>Or else she wasn\u2019t. She found herself looking around the plane. Again, she had the uneasy feeling she had experienced in her room.</p><p>Someone was there.</p><p>Of course someone was there. It was a full plane.</p><p>People were settling in, reading, playing with the controls at their seats. No one was watching her.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t help it. She experienced the sense of being ...</p><p>Followed?</p><p>The flight attendants looked suspicious, as if they were watching her. She could swear that the pinched-looking woman in the seat across the aisle was watching as well. She was skeletal looking.</p><p>Jordan could swear she could see the outline of her teeth beneath her thin skin.</p><p>That is crazy! she told herself.</p><p>She forced herself to close her eyes, to try to sleep. The champagne, wine, and long hours she had been keeping all seemed to kick in. She slept There was a noise. A terrible hissing sound. Whispers ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The flutter of wings.</p><p>She opened her eyes. The flight attendants had gathered to stare at her. The skinny woman was between them. They all stared, and smiled, then opened their mouths.</p><p>They had far more than teeth . . . they had fangs, canine fangs, huge, glistening, white, seeming to drip a slimy green liquid. No, no, not dog fangs, snake fangs, long, sharp, glistening, and they were laughing because she was here, on the plane, cornered, and there were monsters in the world.</p><p>She turned, trying to back away into the next seat. She was wearing a cross; she carried holy water. . .</p> <p>But she couldn\u2019t reach her purse. She couldn\u2019t crawl into the next seat because someone was there. Ragnor. And he was laughing, and the plane was alive with flying creatures? bats. Their wings fluttered everywhere. And she whispered to Ragnor, \u201cHelp me, please, help me!\u201d But, of course, he would not, because he had taken her for a fool, and his mouth was opening then, and he had the longest fangs of all, dripping, sparkling, like razors caught in the light, but it was midnight, deep midnight, and she could almost feel the pain of his touch . . .</p><p>\u201cMiss Riley!\u201d</p><p>She awoke with a start.</p><p>A young Frenchwoman, a flight attendant who spoke English perfectly, was standing over her. She had been gently touching her shoulder.</p><p>She had no fangs.</p> <p>No bats flew about the plane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you were dreaming?a nightmare,\u201d the woman told her gently, and with an awkward smile.</p><p>\u201cYou screamed,\u201d she added, indicating an irate man standing in back of her. \u201cIt\u2019s really ... well, we really try not to allow our passengers to scream on overseas flights. Other passengers think that something is wrong. Really wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am so sorry!\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>The woman gave her a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. None of us can help our nightmares, I guess. If you could just try to stay awake ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Jordan said apologetically.</p> <p>\u201cUm ... I mean, please, really, I know it might be hard, but you really might want to stay awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, again, I am so sorry!\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, but?it was a loud scream. They heard you in the back row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay awake.\u201d</p><p>She felt her cheeks reddening. She tried to apologize to the man behind her. He wasn\u2019t mollified.</p><p>Stay awake ...</p><p>She was losing her mind.</p><p>Making everyone around her a monster.</p> <p>No ...</p><p>She wasn\u2019t losing her mind. She\u2019d had a nightmare; she knew she\u2019d had a nightmare.</p><p>But what had happened at the church had been real.</p><p>She glanced at her watch.</p><p>And prayed for the time to pass quickly as the plane continued over the Atlantic.</p><p>She had been dreaming. . .</p><p>And still, she had the bone-deep feeling that something wasn\u2019t right. That she was being stalked by forces unseen.</p><p>Hunted.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Ragnor faced his brother, his own flesh and blood, and so, it seemed, a horde of demons.</p><p>And it was Nari who had led him to this point. Nari, who through his efforts to save her, had brought about the deaths of so many men. Nari, who had shared his new savage passions and hungers, and the hope that he had found a way to exist.</p><p>She didn\u2019t intend to take part in the carnage; not willing to risk injury to herself, she stood back, keeping her distance.</p><p>\u201cSo you survived,\u201d Ragnor told Hagan, buying time and trying to decide if there was a way to reach his sword.</p><p>\u201cSurvived, yes, brother. With a power greater than yours. The seventh son of the seventh son. The miraculous seventh child of the wolf! You refused to accept the gift of your birth, brother. I would have known what to do with such strengths and abilities. For years I lived in your shadow, knowing that our father\u2019s power lived in you, while I was the greater warrior. Now I have a power even greater than what you knew at birth. And do you know what, little brother? I don\u2019t wish to share this new strength. I know how to use this gift and rule with it. I will not let you hunt down the chosen of my kind, our kind, with your would-be holy but so fragile monks!\u201d Hagan paused to spit on the floor. \u201cThere can be but one of us, brother. And the one who remains, who rules, will be me.\u201d A strange fear, deeper than that for his own existence, wound into Ragnor. \u201cWhat have you done with Peter?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Hagan leaned casually upon his sword. \u201cWell, brother, what do you think? The blood of a holy man ... it was really quite delicious. And when we were done, we roasted the flesh. There is a singular lack of game in these parts, if you haven\u2019t noticed. The blood is the life, but I must say. there remains a tremendous joy in a well-prepared meal. And in our earlier rovings we learned that nothing of the hunt should be wasted.\u201d</p><p>Rage filled him.</p><p>With all the supposed power of his birth, and the disease that now raged within whatever his existence might be, he should have had a sense of reason. At that moment, he did not. He lunged for his brother.</p><p>Hagan\u2019s creatures moved forward.</p><p>Ragnor managed to dive beneath the enemies and roll upon the pallet, making it to the end of the floor.</p><p>He seized his sword, and turned, swinging. Blood sprayed as his weapon sliced into those creatures who had so recently glutted themselves on the weak and the holy; yet blood sprayed from his own flesh as well. He felt the pain, and felt the loss, but knew that he must not go down.</p><p>A dark man emerged from the front, and he lunged low, bringing his sword up through the creature\u2019s gullet; he was aware of the man at his rear, and more aware than anything else that he could endure injury, but not to his throat and neck.</p><p>He had to keep his head. Figuratively? literally.</p><p>A sword shot into his back. He stiffened in his agony, and spun, catching the creature right at the neck.</p><p>The enemy fell, hands at his throat.</p><p>Another flew forward, lifted from the ground, sank.</p><p>Easy target. He had not for nothing learned his battle techniques at the hands of Viking masters.</p><p>More came, more went down.</p><p>But there were too many.</p><p>In the end, he bled from a hundred wounds. And in the end, he fell, and he knew that his brother, the unknown but bitter rival from the minute of his birth, would triumph.</p><p>Hagan stood over him.</p><p>\u201cYou should thank me,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cI have let you the engaged in fierce battle. You will rise to the halls of Valhalla and drink and be merry throughout eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will live in the darkness of the world ruled by Hel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, in life I lived in darkness. Now, I live in the power and light of... Hagan!\u201d He roared with laughter.</p><p>\u201cAnd now little brother ...\u201d</p><p>Ragnor clenched his teeth but kept his eyes open as he watched his brother\u2019s biceps bulge when he lifted his mighty battle sword.</p><p>But when the steel came down, it landed in the dirt by his side.</p><p>\u201cKill him, be done with it!\u201d Nari hissed at his side. \u201cHe is tortured, beaten; you have proven yourself.</p><p>Don\u2019t let him come back!\u201d</p><p>Hagan roared out his wrath, and brought his sword down again. And as he hacked and hacked in fury, the others joined him, but though the blades pierced his flesh, they fell to the earth each time, short in their pursuit of his decapitation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the chain about his neck, the silver chain!\u201d Nari cried.</p><p>\u201cTake it!\u201d Hagan commanded her.</p><p>He could do nothing when Nari fell to his side. She didn\u2019t so much as glance into his eyes. She reached for the silver chain, the relic the monk had placed around his neck so many years ago. But as she touched it, she screamed, backing away in pains, her fingers burning. She sizzled, smoke rising into the air, and she jumped back, astonished and in pain.</p><p>Hagan let out another great roar. He grasped the chain until the burning seemed to snake up his arms.</p><p>He let it go.</p><p>\u201cGet a stake; we\u2019ll pin it through his heart and bury him beneath the ash and stone of his precious church!\u201d Hagan roared out.</p><p>By the time they dragged him into the night, Ragnor could feel nothing. He wasn\u2019t even aware of the shafts of wood being plunged into him.</p><p>He could not open his eyes; he couldn\u2019t feel. Darkness descended, a black void, nothingness ...</p><p>So that, he thought, was death.</p><p>Death then was painless ...</p><p>Life, or existence, was agony.</p><p>As little as he had been unaware of the damage done to him, he knew acutely the moment he came from the void; he felt the removal of each stake with an agony that brought screams tearing from his lungs and throat.</p><p>\u201cThere, look! There is something about this one!\u201d someone cried.</p><p>Ragnor had vision. He looked up at a blond man, tall, looming over him in the decaying remnants of what had once been a village. How long he had slept, or died in his world of darkness, he did not know.</p><p>Trees and vines overgrew the ashen timbers of the old church. Time had passed, days, months ...</p><p>perhaps years. The man who stood over him appeared to be one of his own kind; a Viking, one with an amused grin, a massive sword upon which he leaned, and curious blue eyes.</p><p>Another man moved into his vision, both of them towering over him.</p><p>The second man hunkered down. He was darker, and different in appearance. He wore a tunic with the woven colors of the Scots brooched over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d the fellow demanded.</p><p>\u201cThink it\u2019s him?\u201d the blond man asked.</p><p>\u201cRumor had it that we\u2019d find him, and so it appears he is here,\u201d the Scotsman said. \u201cAre you known as the son of the wolf?\u201d</p><p>Ragnor studied the strange men who seemed to have dug him up with purpose. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now, I asked the question first! There has been a rumor about that the one man who might help us stand against the scourge of the isles and his bloodthirsty mistress had been buried amid the remains of the church within an old abbey. I ask you again?are you the son of the Wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe seventh son,\u201d Ragnor agreed. \u201cAnd who in damnation are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am damnation,\u201d the man replied. \u201cBut damnation with a set of rules, a vengeance of my own, and a will to survive.\u201d He rose, stretching a hand to Ragnor. He took the hand, wincing as he tried to stand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Every wound he had received before the darkness came to life. He could scarce make it to his feet, despite the power of the man helping him up.</p><p>\u201cHe needs sleep; time to heal,\u201d the blond man said.</p><p>\u201cAye, and there\u2019s time,\u201d the other man said. \u201cI am Lucian, self-proclaimed power of what we are, if you will. A monster, perhaps. But there are rules to survival, and I have my reasons for doing so?as do you. I maintain the hungers and lusts of the others, but there is a law, as well, far more ancient than my own meager existence, and those who do not accept that law will doom us all. Do you join us with your strange power, or do we pack you back in a tomb of stone and ash and the crisscross of swords where you should have perished long ago?\u201d</p> <p>Ragnor leaned on him, gritting his teeth. It was night, he realized. The light had seemed so great after the darkness of his entombment that he had thought it day. Now he looked around, and saw that these two were accompanied by something of an army. They were Viking, they were Scot, they were Irish ... they were from the continent as well, he thought He looked back at the one called Lucian. \u201cYou\u2019re not monks,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cFar from it, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Lucian told him. \u201cBut we like to think that we are men?or monsters?of a certain enlightenment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are the rule,\u201d the other offered, and stepped forward, clapping a hand on Ragnor\u2019s back that nearly sent him sprawling once again. \u201cI\u2019m Wulfgar. Do you join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come for me? How did you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the worst of havoc, rumors fly. There is one who acknowledges no rule; yet there are those who say that he lives in his own world of fear as well, knowing that his brother might arise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe thought you should arise,\u201d Wulfgar said.</p><p>Ragnor stared at the one called Lucian. \u201cI have free rein to destroy my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are counting on your knowledge of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be destroyed, completely,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>Lucian shook his head. \u201cEntombed, as you were. But for eternity. We do not destroy our own. Nor do we create more than two per century, lest we create the unbalance in the world that has occurred now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long has he slept, Wulfgar?\u201d Lucian asked.</p><p>\u201cNear to a hundred years, if rumor is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred years ...\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>\u201cHigh time to wake,\u201d Lucian said, watching him. \u201cAh, catch him, there, Wulfgar?he\u2019s about to go down again. He needs sustenance, and proper rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find Hagan?and Nari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA time to heal, my friend,\u201d Wulfgar said.</p><p>\u201cAnd then a time to fight,\u201d Lucian told him.</p><p>Night deepened, but due to the monk\u2019s insistence, they were all within the church, and the door was barricaded with rough hewn pews.</p> <p>Ragnor had eaten. With the woman Nari at his side, he rested near the door to the church, back against the wall, eyes closed. He had learned to sleep in nearly any position and to wake at the first whisper of sound.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a whisper, however, that woke him. There was a terrible noise, like a burst of thunder, a roaring, that went on beyond the church.</p><p>He stood, drawing his sword. Around him, others awoke, and leaped to their feet. The noise faded; then a slow, steady sound grew. A shrill sound, like the call of a hundred birds, or a fluttering of a thousand pairs of wings.</p><p>Ulric strode across the church floor, staring at the door. \u201cWhat in the name of Thor ... ?\u201d Brother Peter was at the altar, on his knees.</p><p>Ragnor strode over to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he demanded, interrupting the monk\u2019s prayer. Calmly, Peter lifted a hand, stopping the interruption. Ragnor waited, knowing that he could not sway Peter from commune with his God even if he were to put his sword to his throat Peter rose after a moment \u201cIt is evil, but we will persevere this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s evil, we will fight it!\u201d Hagan roared.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot fight this evil with your simple methods of brutal violence,\u201d Peter said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can fight it?\u201d Hagan mocked.</p><p>\u201cYes, for I know the face of this evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will know its face if I go forth and see it!\u201d Hagan said angrily.</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cMy faith in my God is stronger than the evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in your god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen pray to your Odin, and if you listen well, he, too, will tell you not to venture forth from these walls.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly as the noise had come, it faded.</p><p>Peter stood still for a long time, listening. \u201cFor tonight it is over. But it will come again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do we do?\u201d Ulric demanded, \u201cCower within these walls night after night? It is not our way, priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a priest; I am a brother,\u201d Peter said calmly. \u201cNo. They have power by day, but not the strength they have at night. They do not turn to ash in the sunlight. They are weakened by it, though, and God knows, there is little enough strength in the sun here in winter. By light, we hunt them out. We find their lair. We hunt them as we would hunt wolves, and we destroy them.\u201d Ulric and the others voiced their disapproval, but there was a strange sound in their tones for men such as they were; there was fear among them.</p><p>They rested.</p><p>By morning, the brother had them cutting trees and preparing pikes, or stakes. Such weapons would bring the evil ones down; then they must be burned or decapitated, or they would heal themselves of the injury, and come back.</p><p>While Ragnor was in the woods, the woman, Nari, brought him water and food. After he had eaten, she sat with him, and told him that she believed the words of the brother, for she had seen the fate of the village.</p><p>She seemed different from the others, and he told her then that he hadn\u2019t known that the chieftain, so recently among the deceased, had had a daughter.</p><p>\u201cThey are good people here. He took me in. I was orphaned when my parents came north to attack the Scots. My father was from Normandy. My mother from the south.\u201d She laughed then and told him, \u201cMy poor father! He worried, wanting a good marriage for me and fearing that I was far too hot-blooded. He knew little about women, for his wife died soon after he married, and he spent his days defending his clan from other chieftains nearby, and from the likes of men such as you. He had no idea that although we may bow our heads and pray, we long for the same excitement that stirs the souls of men.\u201d The suggestion in her tone was obvious. They were fighting a strange and unknown enemy, and might never live to see another sun. He had not dreamed that they would make love that afternoon. They coupled in the forest; she was wild, passionate.</p><p>Later, when the midday sun rose in the sky, they rode out, searching the surrounding countryside. But that day, they found nothing, and by night, the sounds came again, violent as a storm beyond the church that they stayed in. Hagan walked around swearing; Peter prayed. The noises ceased, but later, deep into the night, the howling began.</p><p>Hagan raced for the door to the church in a fury. Peter cried for him to stop; Ragnor and Ulric fought to pull his brother back, and it took half the power of the Viking forces to bring him down.</p><p>\u201cThere is the attack,\u201d Peter said, \u201cwhich these walls, however fragile they may seem to men such as you, will withstand. Then there is the temptation, the cry in the night, the seduction. These walls cannot defend you from that. You must defend yourselves within your own souls.\u201d Hagan was persuaded to remain within the church.</p><p>The next day, they started out again.</p><p>Still, no luck.</p><p>That night, in the church, the noises came and departed. Ragnor slept deeply until something startled him awake.</p><p>He realized that he lay against the wall alone, that Nari was no longer with him.</p><p>He swore violently, rising. The pews had been dragged away from the door. He went to the entrance and found that his brother and a few of the men were ahead of them. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten in!\u201d Hagan told Peter angrily when the monk would have detained them.</p><p>\u201cThey have not gotten in!\u201d Peter said. \u201cNari has fallen to the temptation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was your God?\u201d Hagan demanded angrily.</p><p>\u201cNot in Nari\u2019s soul,\u201d Peter said.</p><p>Ragnor listened, but ignored them. He was sliding his great battle sword into its sheath at his waist and preparing to ride. \u201cGive me what weapons you will, Peter. I am going after them. Give me your crosses, what you call holy, and we will go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fools! Don\u2019t you understand? The cross will aid you only if you believe in its power, just as the creatures cannot come in here, because they have a bloodthirst in their souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give me no aid. I am going,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>Peter ran after them when they departed the church, but to no avail. They rode out, a Viking party of twenty hardened warriors with shields, swords, battle-axes, maces and spikes as their weapons. In the deep of the night, it was hard to find the trail. Ulric found the human footprints, followed by those of a four-footed creature with padded paws and long claws.</p><p>\u201cBah, what monsters!\u201d Hagan cried. \u201cWe are tormented by a pack of wolves.\u201d And he would have spurred his horse to race forward in fury if Ragnor hadn\u2019t stopped him. \u201cWolves don\u2019t make fluttering sounds, like the wings that we have heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are wolves ahead now, and we will stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd take care as we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is your woman they have taken,\u201d Hagan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I will get her back. But we ride with care.\u201d</p><p>Through the darkness, they continued, the moon and the torches they carried gave a little illumination against the night. In time they came to a high tor, and in the forest surrounding it, the entrance to a cave, or shelter.</p><p>Hagan dismounted.</p><p>\u201cBrother, take care!\u201d Ragnor warned.</p><p>But Hagan shouted back, \u201cI am not the seventh son of the seventh son, but I am a child of the great warrior wolf of our people, and I will not fear a fight! Men who would dine in Valhalla, follow me!\u201d They drew their weapons and headed for the cave. Gunther, known as a berserker in battle, strode ahead, and before the others even reached the dark shadows of the entry, he had let out a cry like a man meeting a hundred swords with bare flesh and bone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They came upon them then, the enemy. They were men, and they were not. They had the darker skins of the Mediterraneans and the lighter skins of the Northern peoples. They were not so many?perhaps a dozen, and there were women among them. They didn\u2019t seem to need to stand on solid ground, but could move in the blink of an eye, rise to the air, disappear into smoke, or vapor, or air.</p><p>Ragnor rushed forward in defense of the men. The enemy did not fight with weapons, but with their bare hands.</p><p>And teeth.</p> <p>They were wolves, or could appear as wolves, men one minute, creatures the next. He came into the fray, slashing. Then he remembered the monk\u2019s warning, and he went after the creatures with his sword swinging with a direct purpose, that of beheading the enemy. Two went down, three, but he found that he was fighting ever more alone because the Vikings were so quickly torn asunder by their foes. Four, five, six ... and he stood alone, swinging in every direction, sword in his hand. He saw them coming together, forming a circle around him. Lean, thin, dark-skinned fighters in animal furs, then a tall man with the look of the North, a woman who might have come from somewhere in the East...</p><p>They weren\u2019t speaking, but they were communicating somehow. Closing the circle. He hefted his sword in a tremendous sweeping arc, trying to bring down as many as he could .. .</p><p>Then they were upon them. He felt the agony as his flesh ripped. Blood seemed to rush before his eyes .</p><p>And then darkness.</p><p>He came into consciousness late the next day. He was on the ground, and his first thought was amazement that he could be alive. Then he felt a tremendous pain, and an agony of thirst. Gritting his teeth, he sat up and looked around. His men lay all around him.</p> <p>Mostly in pieces.</p><p>He staggered to his feet.</p><p>He felt some strength. If only he had water, he could pick up his dead. He could burn the remains. He could ...</p><p>Water. He needed water.</p><p>He looked to the cave, and he looked to the sky. The winter\u2019s frail sun now seemed to be merciless. He staggered to the cave, forgetting the enemy, determined to escape the sun. Inside, he found that the enemy was gone. Slumped against the wall he found Nari. She appeared dead, but she had not been torn apart. He looked at her more closely; she wasn\u2019t quite dead.</p><p>He looked for water. For himself, and to revive her. There was none.</p> <p>A rat raced by him. He stunned himself, reaching out with lightning speed, catching the rat, biting into it like a madman ... draining it. He looked at the carcass with horror and threw it across the cave. But his strength and will to live had overcome his disgust He rose and left the cave to gather wood. As he started to build a fire for a mass funeral pyre, he heard the sounds of hoofbeats, and when he stood, waiting, his sword at the ready against whatever enemy came, he saw that the monks were grimly riding to the scene.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t seem surprised to see him standing.</p><p>\u201cThe others?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThey are as you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurn them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find Nari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is in the cave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will see to her.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s words disturbed Ragnor. \u201cYou will leave her be!\u201d he thundered.</p><p>\u201cShe must be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did not kill her. Perhaps she was taken to draw us out.\u201d Peter ignored him. Ragnor went after the monk, catching him by the arm, flinging him around to face him.</p><p>An overwhelming desire to tear into the monk, rip him apart with teeth and bare hands, seized him. He gritted his teeth hard, in agony to stop himself from such brutality. \u201cLeave her be!\u201d he commanded. \u201cWe will burn the dead.\u201d</p><p>With the help of the monks, the fire was quickly built. A deep sorrow seized him as he dragged the body of the great berserker Gunther into the flames. Torsos, limbs and heads were gathered. He could think of no words as the bodies went into the flames. The monks chanted prayers in Latin. He hoped that their supplications would bring the Norse to their own Valhalla. Yet as they smelled the burning flesh and watched the flames snap and crackle and rise to the sky, Ragnor suddenly grabbed Peter\u2019s arm. \u201cMy brother. I did not bring his body to the flame. Did you see him? He must receive this funeral rite as the others . ..\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brothers collected all the bodies,\u201d Peter told him. \u201cExcept that of the woman, Nari.\u201d Ragnor nodded, and when it was done, he went back into the cave for Nari. She stirred, and awakened, and looked at him gravely, shaking as she stretched her arms out to him. \u201cI was so afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so frightened . ..\u201d</p><p>He cradled her in his arms. \u201cI thought you were dead. You were nearly thrown into the flames,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cBut you saved me,\u201d she said, and smiled. \u201cAh, Ragnor, in my father\u2019s defense, you have lost everything.</p><p>But we will build a world between us.\u201d</p><p>He set her upon his horse as they rode back to the church by the sea. Nari wanted to remain in the sun, though it was growing dark by the time they returned.</p><p>She could remember nothing of the night before. She could tell them nothing of their enemies.</p><p>Peter sat with Ragnor, having him relive the battle over and over again.</p><p>The monks brought food, fowl they had killed in the forest. Ragnor was ravenous; the meal did not end the hunger that seemed to be tearing into him. He knew that Peter was watching him, and as he eyed the monk in return, he again found himself seized with the desire to consume the monk.</p><p>They had been in the church; he stood abruptly and went outside. And to his horror, he found Nari down by the water, seated on a rock, the body of one of the brothers dragged over her lap, his throat torn open. Nari looked up at him. Her lips were coated in blood.</p><p>He wanted to lash out at her in horror, put her to death himself at that moment. But more than that...</p><p>He wanted a share of the blood. The scent of it was a power unlike anything he had ever known. He rushed forward and pushed her away; he began to ravage the body himself.</p><p>Covered in the good man\u2019s blood, he staggered to his feet.</p><p>Nari smiled at him. \u201cThere is another world out there. A world of pure power. Greater power than even you have ever known.\u201d</p><p>He jerked her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cNo. We will not live like this.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so strong. You\u2019re weak! You don\u2019t begin to understand the gift you\u2019ve been given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGift?\u201d he said incredulously. \u201cWe are cursed!\u201d</p><p>She came close to him, leaning against him. \u201cHelp me, then. Help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a way ...\u201d he murmured, then he shook his head. \u201cCome.\u201d He drew his sword from its sheath and brought it back to the church.</p><p>Nari cowered at the entrance. \u201cI can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen wait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou intend to destroy us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to give us Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>He entered the church, taking his sword and throwing it at Peter\u2019s feet. \u201cDo it!\u201d he demanded, shaking, his voice a roar. \u201cTake my head, and see that I am burned to ash, and cast to the sea. Damn you, do it now! And Nari .. . you must see to Nari as well. Then set a flame on a dragon boat, and send our remains, together, out to sea.\u201d</p><p>Peter ignored the sword at his feet.</p><p>\u201cI cannot,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPeter, don\u2019t you understand, you fool. I just ate one of your holy men!\u201d Peter shook his head. \u201cLook where you are standing. In God\u2019s holy place. I have seen you with the desire to ravage my neck throughout the day; when we found you, I knew that you were no longer one of us. But you are who you are, and even changed, you still have the power to fight evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou idiot, I am evil!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could not be here, not in my God\u2019s house, if you were.\u201d Ragnor let out a cry of rage and strode from the church, determined to show Peter the truth. He meant to take Nari, but she was not there.</p><p>The stupid monk! He would not believe, he could not comprehend the agony, the hunger, that tore at him. He strode straight amid the monks who worked calmly at their tasks, stoking a fire, chopping more wood. He let out a roar, a cry, a howl, ready to tear into one of them just to prove his own menace. But the monks stared back at him, unshaken.</p><p>He turned and strode into the forest, then ran ...</p><p>And as he ran something happened. He was hunched, he was down, he was a beast, racing through brush and forest and trees. Then he slowed.</p><p>There was a buck ahead of him in a lea. He crouched lower and began a slow, stalking movement through the grass. He attacked the creature.</p><p>His hands had no fingers, just claws. He reveled in the fury of his attack, in the taste of blood.</p><p>And later . . .</p><p>The moon was full again. He rose, and he was himself, and he clutched his head in his hands, and wept.</p><p>Tears did not come. His body shook with the violence of his agony, and in the end, he sat, and watched as the sun fell, and he felt a surge of power coming into him.</p><p>Peter found him there, came to him, not afraid of the night, or of Ragnor.</p><p>\u201cYou must destroy me,\u201d he told Peter. \u201cLook what I have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve eaten a deer,\u201d Peter said with a trace of humor. \u201cI am fond of the meat myself.\u201d Ragnor shook his head. \u201cI am one of them, one of the monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to the church.\u201d</p><p>Ragnor looked at him with amazement and then aggravation. \u201cSo that I can consume another monk?\u201d Peter merely started walking. Ragnor swore and followed him, staying on the monk\u2019s heels, as if in warning that at any moment, he might rip into him. But never once did Peter so much as look back.</p><p>The area of the village and the church smelled of burning flesh. The brothers had cremated their own.</p><p>In the church, Peter took Ragnor\u2019s hands. \u201cYou will swear a vow tonight to answer to a higher power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in your God.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think that you do.

The night sounds did not come. Yet long after midnight, in the darkness of deep midnight, he felt the craving to escape.</p><p>He stood by the doors to the church, and Peter came beside him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it you want of me?\u201d Ragnor cried to him.</p><p>\u201cYou will learn. You will learn to harness the pain.\u201d</p><p>Ragnor did not believe him.</p><p>At dusk the next day, Nari returned. She came to him with bowed head, tears tremulous in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHelp me, they want to hunt me down, destroy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should be destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo .. . they will not harm you. Please, let me stay with you. If there is a way ... I must be with you, I beg of you.\u201d</p><p>He had never felt so alone, or so enraged, and above it all, so helpless. She knew what he felt. And she had discovered the agony within, and the only way to appease it. There was a way. She would stay with him, she would learn.</p><p>The monks built them a place to live while they stayed on at the church. In time, Ragnor discovered that the anguish could be appeased.</p><p>The forest was nearly depleted of deer.</p><p>The most savage boar could be quickly tamed.</p><p>It was a strange living; the monks ever watching, and riding on their own by day. Ragnor at last asked Peter why it was that he stayed, and what he hoped he would find when he rode. The attacks that had come so forcefully had ceased; the creatures had moved on.</p><p>\u201cI will stay as long as you need me,\u201d Peter told him, and Ragnor was surprised, because he was certain that the monks would be much safer elsewhere.</p><p>But Peter would not elaborate.</p> <p>In those days, it didn\u2019t matter. There were discoveries he made on his own. The ability to think, and to be. The strange and awesome power of the mind, and the senses. And then there were the nights, with Nari.</p><p>They had formed a bond. Greater than the horror they shared at what they had become, greater than the knowledge, the acceptance of what they were. She seemed to understand him. At night they ran, felt the wind, the darkness, the power. They feasted on blood; they made love as wildly and savagely as they hunted and hungered.</p><p>At the first light, they slept, and rested.</p><p>The monks watched, and waited.</p><p>In a year\u2019s time, Ragnor grew restless. He talked to Peter and told him that he wanted to go home, or to the isle he had called home for so many years.</p><p>Peter studied him carefully. \u201cYou\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Nari?\u201d Peter asked.</p><p>\u201cShe listens to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter was quiet. \u201cThen go home. But remember, we are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why don\u2019t you just go home as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>Ragnor didn\u2019t believe him. There had been no more disturbances. The few villagers who had survived were rebuilding. In time, the earth would replenish, and the population would grow. Others would come, and the cycle of life would go on.</p><p>\u201cReturn when you feel you should,\u201d Peter told Ragnor.</p><p>He sailed the next day with Nari. They returned to the isle where he had settled with so many of their followers. He created a great story regarding his brother\u2019s death in battle, every warrior deserved such a saga.</p><p>He lived with Nari, and again, sailed the seas with his men. There were wars to fight that were right, and he fought them with a vengeance.</p><p>He feasted on the violence that ruled such savage fighting. Nari was like a Viking queen, awaiting his return, and sharing with him the secret of his ever-greater strength.</p><p>Then, again, after months had passed, he felt the urge to return to the church where Peter stood guard against the evil he was so certain would come again. Nari chose to remain behind, telling him that there was a reason she must stay. A rune-sayer cast the stones, and said that it was fate that she should do so.</p><p>Ragnor returned to the village with a nagging worry that something was wrong. Yet when he arrived, the village was thriving, though the people still slept in the church by night. The fields were rich, the game plentiful, and others had found the village by the sea.</p><p>Ragnor slept alone in the small wooden shelter that had been made for him. He spent days with Peter, talking, arguing, learning.</p><p>Then, at dusk one night, Ragnor found Peter standing on the steps of the church, staring out at the coming of night.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ragnor asked.</p><p>Peter looked at him strangely. \u201cYou don\u2019t know? You don\u2019t feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re out there. Wanting something. Watching. Waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay inside. There is nothing else they can do.\u201d</p><p>But the next day, the church caught fire.</p><p>The blaze began at dusk, and all the desperate measures to keep it standing were useless. By nightfall, it burned still, and the people were left to huddle around the fire in fear.</p><p>Ragnor stood guard, aware now, of the proximity of something ... someone. . .</p><p>A whisper of evil on the air.</p><p>Then they came.</p><p>They came in a flock, like wings of blackness. They shrilled the night air with their cries and the sounds of something beating against the air. They were nothing but shadows, and then they were real. Darkness and sensation, then a blinding vision of light in the flames.</p><p>The monks fought them with swords, strange warriors in brown robes and tonsured heads, battling the demons from above and around. They knew to go for the heads, and the enemy fell all around them.</p><p>Some fell as flesh and bone, and others decayed before their eyes, and were like so much ash from the fire.</p><p>Yet when it was over, though the enemy lay all around them, so did their own. And in the darkness of the night, fire raged again as they cremated all the remains.</p><p>By light, Ragnor had to sleep. The monks and villagers set desperately to work; they built a church again, a sad structure, and the monks prayed and begged that their church be sanctified.</p><p>Ragnor awoke to find that he was not alone. Nari had come to him.</p><p>\u201cI heard the call,\u201d she told him and touched him gently on the cheek. She curled next to him, soothing his brow, then moving against him with an ever greater need until he came fully awake in a storm of hunger to be appeased only by the volatile passion she offered. Yet then, she did not remain beside him.</p><p>She moved suddenly, and he saw what she had done.</p><p>His sword lay across the earthen floor. They surrounded the foot of the pallet that was his bed. Their leader stepped forward into the room, his sword drawn, a snarl of a mocking smile curling his lips.</p><p>Ragnor rose upon his elbows with amazement \u201cBy all the gods ... you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to die, seventh son of the seventh son.\u201d</p><p>Nari slipped around the other man. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Ragnor. But we are not meant to consume the vile blood of rats and boars. You might have been the greatest power among us, but...\u201d Her voice trailed away.</p><p>She had set him up for destruction; she had planned it well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ragnor. In Valhalla, think to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>The man with the sword stepped forward and Ragnor jumped up, naked, unarmed, but desperate to fight however long he could.</p><p>\u201cWho wants to live forever?\u201d</p><p>The sword made a strange silver slash against the twilight shadows haunting the room.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>When she left the plane and cleared customs, Jordan was intent only on reaching the car rental desk.</p><p>As she walked, she tried to shake the feeling that she had been surrounded by beasts on the plane? and that anyone who glanced her way was a monster, intent on her destruction.</p><p>She had just signed her rental agreement when a woman came up to her. She was tall, lean, and attractive, with green eyes, auburn hair and a quick smile. She extended a hand. \u201cMiss Riley, my name is Jade DeVeau. I\u2019m here to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan took the woman\u2019s hand, but as she did so, she felt that someone was behind her again. After her.</p><p>Paranoia!</p><p>But she had come this far. She smiled at the woman, but was afraid. How would this woman have known to meet her? Who was she? The cop who had written the book was named Canady.</p><p>She was probably a friend, a co-worker, someone sent to meet her. . .</p><p>She had no intention of taking such a chance.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do,\u201d Jordan murmured. She looked around. The airport was not very crowded. She felt a terrible unease. She wasn\u2019t going anywhere with this woman.</p><p>\u201cMy car is in the lot, through the parking garage?\u201d the woman began.</p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Jordan interrupted. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me just a moment?\u201d Jordan indicated the ladies room.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d the other woman said.</p><p>Jordan pretended to head for the bathroom door.</p><p>The woman had taken a chair in the waiting area. Jordan just kept walking. She raced outside the airport, breathing heavily with the weight of her laptop and overnight bag. For once in her life, her prayers were answered?there was a taxi waiting. She didn\u2019t dare look for the bus that would take her to the car rental agency.</p><p>Once in the taxi, she sat back, relieved. Then she stiffened, trying to get a look at the driver in the rearview mirror. He was a dignified-looking, middle-aged black man. She still felt a sense of fear snaking into her. Then she saw the rosaries hanging from his mirror. Did that mean he was . .. safe? She had to hope so; she needed to reach her car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trust only yourself!</p><p>The driver took her to the rental agency. She was a wreck as she got into the Honda and checked the map they had given her. She had been to New Orleans before, and she loved the city. But she wasn\u2019t that familiar with the streets.</p><p>And I\u2019m not thinking clearly! I\u2019m exhausted, and I\u2019m frightened, and I may, after all, be really, truly, crazy.</p> <p>She forced herself to concentrate on the road. She had already taken a wrong turn somewhere. She was on the outskirts of the French Quarter, but she needed to find the road to the old plantations.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t drive and read the map; she had to pull over. She tried to find the inside light switch, but could not. She stared around, then realized that she was outside the gates of one of the city\u2019s famed old cemeteries. Looking through the wrought iron, she could see winged angels, crosses, and the glowing shapes of a half dozen mausoleums. Fog was settling around the ground. Swirling, creating strange, eerie shapes.</p><p>She had to get out of here.</p><p>She opened the driver\u2019s door just a hair, and the lights popped on. As she looked at the map, she was startled and then panicked by a knock at her window.</p><p>\u201cHey, lady, you got a dollar? Maybe you got a twenty? A five?\u201d The man holding on to her door was filthy. He was a white man with a thick beard, a horrendous scent, and so much dirt on him that he was the color of an islander. \u201cHey, lady, I know I smell. Hey, just cause there\u2019s whiskey on my breath now, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to go buy more booze. Okay, you got some change?\u201d</p> <p>She saw his teeth. Or what he had of them. They were green and slimy. She had a vision of him changing into something else, with salivating fangs, right before her.</p><p>She screamed. Her scream startled him.</p><p>He screamed and stepped back. She gunned the car. The automobile burst out on to the road with a shriek of tires.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know which direction she was going in. She just drove.</p><p>Rudy Trenton stood on the street, watching the little red Honda drive off into the night. He shook his head, then removed his baseball cap, and scratched his head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, lady, so I do want to buy more whiskey!\u201d he muttered. He shook his head. \u201cCrazy. What the hell is this world coming to? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have asked for the twenty. Some folks just don\u2019t know about inflation.\u201d</p> <p>He stretched, thinking it was time to hop the fence and find himself a nice little nook in one of the mausoleums. Lots of them were locked, but some of them were really old, and the decaying corpses inside had no living relatives left in the vicinity, so it was easy enough to crawl in and get some shelter from the night.</p><p>He grinned. Folks were scared of cemeteries. Dumb. Weren\u2019t no people less dangerous than dead folk.</p><p>Hell, no, dead folks couldn\u2019t hurt you any.</p><p>Rudy turned. To his amazement, there was a man coming out of the cemetery. Or was he a man? How could he have come out of the cemetery? The gates were still locked; he hadn\u2019t jumped over the fence, as Rudy intended to do.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, you got a twenty, a five, a one, a quarter? I need some food, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, so I need a drink.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled, as if amused by Rudy\u2019s request. Rudy smiled back. He was going to get lucky. This fellow looked as if he understood a fellow\u2019s need for a drink now and then.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I really need a drink,\u201d Rudy said.</p> <p>The fellow laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d he told Rudy.</p><p>Rudy started to grin.</p><p>He was still grinning when the man gripped his shoulders. He didn\u2019t stop grinning until he felt something</p><p>... pain. Agony. The bones in his shoulders breaking . ..</p><p>He started to scream, but the sound was broken off almost immediately as his jugular was slit and the sound was drowned out by the flow of his own blood.</p><p>Jordan reached the house at last. At least she thought it was the house. It was a mansion, a beautiful old plantation, kept in top-notch shape. The porch was expansive with traditional columns, and a welcoming, white-painted swing. She glanced at the address she had written down, and at the number on the house again.</p><p>Yes, this was it.</p><p>She got out of the car, fingering the cross at her neck, patting her purse to assure herself she had her vial of holy water handy.</p><p>If this cop is legit, he\u2019s going to think I\u2019m crazy!</p><p>Still, she had come this far.</p><p>Resolutely, she slammed the door of the Honda, strode across the lawn and up the steps, and knocked on the door.</p><p>It was immediately opened by the woman who had been at the airport. \u201cThank God!\u201d she said earnestly.</p><p>Jordan felt herself blush as she stood there awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I\u2019ve just had so many strange things occurring lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, I understand. We were still worried. Come in, come in.\u201d Even then, Jordan hesitated. But she heard the reassuring cry of a young child in the background and she stepped over the threshold of the house. A tall, dark-haired man shook her hand as she came in.</p><p>\u201cMr. Canady?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m Lucian DeVeau,\u201d he told her. \u201cJade\u2019s husband.\u201d He turned, indicating a woman behind him who was holding the toddler. \u201cThis is Maggie Canady, and Sean is right through there in the office. I was about to go out and try to find you. Jade has been very upset since she lost you at the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here?it\u2019s all completely understandable. Come on in, we can all talk.\u201d As she stepped through the foyer, she noted the historic beauty of the house. A grand stairway rose from the entry, and at the landing, there was an exquisite painting of a beautiful woman in mid-nineteenth-century dress.</p><p>\u201cLovely house,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to put this one to bed; I\u2019ll be right with you all. You must be exhausted ... tired, hungry, thirsty. But Jade can get you anything you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>This was very strange. All these people seemed to have been expecting her, and they all seemed to think it was quite normal that she should be here; in fact, they seemed more than relieved that she had come.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cThis is very rude, of course,\u201d Jordan murmured. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the publisher of Sean\u2019s book,\u201d Jade said. \u201cAnd Lucian . ..\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her meet Sean,\u201d Lucian suggested. \u201cAnd then we can begin the explanations that she isn\u2019t going to believe.\u201d</p><p>She had been expecting to tell a story that no one was going to believe.</p><p>Lucian led the way across the room to a library with double doors. As she walked in, she saw a man leaning against a mantel, a drink in his hand, as he spoke to someone across the room.</p><p>\u201cSean, she\u2019s arrived. I didn\u2019t have to look for her,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re Jordan Riley,\u201d Sean Canady said. He was about forty, fit and handsome, with fine, serious eyes. She started across the room, ready to shake his hand.</p><p>Then she saw the man to whom he had been speaking.</p><p>She froze where she stood; Ragnor Wulfsson was standing just across the room from where Canady leaned against the mantel.</p><p>\u201cJordan,\u201d Ragnor began, walking toward her.</p><p>God! This was it! She had traveled through the night, only across the expanse of the Atlantic, to find herself facing the same terror.</p><p>There would be no escape here, she thought. She had run from a place with friends and family, and she was here alone and he was here.</p><p>No escape . . .</p><p>She pictured Tiff\u2019s ashen body, saw her shoulders pull free from her head.</p><p>She turned and ran.</p><p>Ignoring the startled cries of Jade DeVeau, she shoved the woman out of her way and fled from the house, bursting through the front door, racing down the steps. She hopped into the Honda and gunned the motor, realizing that she could mire the car in the unpaved driveway if she didn\u2019t calm down and use some sense. She didn\u2019t even know where she was driving. She peeled out, and shot along the lonely strip of road.</p><p>Suddenly, she slammed on her brakes. There was something in the road ahead of her. A shadow. A shape ...</p><p>A man. Her lights focused on a man standing in her path. Ragnor.</p><p>She hit the button for her window.</p><p>\u201cMove out of the way. I swear, I\u2019ll run you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, stop it, you\u2019re in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, damn you, not from me. Will you come back to the house and talk? We will do our best to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain that you\u2019re monsters, and that you kill people, and that Sean Canady writes about vampires with such knowledge because he is one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean isn\u2019t a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, I have to explain?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him finish. She floored the car, sickened that she was going to hit him, but so panicked that she could do nothing else. Yet as the car sped across the highway, Ragnor seemed to fade into the darkness.</p><p>She slowed when she came to a crossroad, peering through the window, trying desperately to decide which way to go to get back to people?lots of people. Normal people.</p><p>Then she let out a scream of terror. Ragnor was at her window. \u201cJordan, you\u2019ve got to listen to me?\u201d Once again, she hit the gas pedal, shot out into the intersection. A car was coming from the left. He blared his horn.</p><p>Jordan swerved and lost control. The car spun. The next thing she knew, she was flying into the foliage at the side of the road. The car came to a violent halt as she hit a tree stump. She\u2019d neglected to wear a seat belt in her haste to escape. She only kept herself in the car and in one piece with the death grip she had on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d She heard his deep voice as he called to her. In panic she pushed open the door and started to run into the night.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d</p><p>The next thing she knew, he was behind her, his hands on her shoulders. She turned, screaming, kicking, fighting. In her effort to free herself from his grasp, she stumbled backward in a pile of weeds and fell flat, bringing him down with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He braced his hands against her shoulders, sprawled halfway over her. \u201cJordan, stop it, for the love of God, stop it! You have to listen?\u201d</p><p>He broke off so suddenly that she ceased to fight. She stared at him and realized that he was listening to something that she didn\u2019t hear. It had taken his attention from her. If she chose just the right moment ...</p><p>But then she heard it, too. Wings ...</p> <p>Wings in the night.</p><p>A whisper, a hiss, a warning . ..</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to escape him; he was no longer touching her. As she stared into the darkness, she saw a shadow form just feet away. Ragnor leaped to his feet, turning to face the shadow. The darkness took shape. A man, a man in a large black coat. From beneath it, he drew a long and glistening sword.</p><p>Ragnor walked toward the man on the roadway. Jordan lay stunned, watching him. Then, as she saw Ragnor draw some kind of a weapon from his jacket, she got to her feet.</p><p>She watched the two men approaching one another. The sword was swung by the stranger, a man with a face she\u2019d never seen before. Ragnor ducked the swing of the blade, and the sword whistled through the night air.</p> <p>Jordan found the strength to move. Her car was useless. She moved carefully, silently across the road, standing opposite the two men edging back toward the way she had come.</p><p>Then she saw Ragnor strike. He had only a long bladed knife, while the other man wielded a sword, but the stranger had lost his balance. Ragnor sprang forward with a sure, true aim, catching the fellow dead center in his throat.</p><p>Jordan screamed.</p><p>The man dropped his sword, clutching his throat. Blood was spilling from his wound. Ragnor went in mercilessly for the kill.</p><p>She screamed again as the man\u2019s head flopped to his side, and still, Ragnor did not cease. He struck out again, and again, until the man\u2019s head fell from his body, and into the foliage. A second later, the body?which had wobbled even after it had lost its head? went crashing into the bushes after it.</p><p>She had never felt such pure hysteria. She simply stood, screaming and screaming, and then she saw Ragnor stare at her, and she backed away, and she wanted to run, but she couldn\u2019t, she could only stare at him as if she could preserve her own life by keeping him locked in front of her with her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cJordan!\u201d</p><p>Once again, she started backing away, shaking her head in disbelief and horror.</p><p>\u201cJordan, he was sent to? kill you. Or stop you, bring you down. I still don\u2019t completely understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she raised a hand before her, still backing away. She hit soft dirt. Her heel sank, and again, she stumbled backward.</p><p>A second later, he was towering over her.</p><p>\u201cDo it!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cKill me, cut off my head, do ... do ...\u201d He reached a hand down to her. \u201cGet up, scream again if you need to, and then get logical and listen to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogical!\u201d she said, her voice rising again.</p><p>He had a grip on her arm; he pulled her to her feet.</p> <p>The headlights of a car suddenly pinned them both in brilliant light. Jordan looked to the road for help.</p><p>Sean Canady was driving the car.</p><p>Her heart sank.</p><p>\u201cJordan, let\u2019s go,\u201d Ragnor said curtly.</p><p>He drew her to the car. Canady opened the door; Ragnor ushered her in, then took a seat in the back.</p><p>The car made a quick U-turn.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cGive you some clean clothes, by the looks of it,\u201d Canady said lightly. \u201cThen a good stiff drink.\u201d She caught Ragnor\u2019s eyes in the rearview mirror. They were hard blue, cold as ice.</p><p>\u201cImagine being a cop and having to come to grips with all of this,\u201d Canady said lightly.</p><p>\u201cA cop?but not a vampire?\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Almost . .. but never really,\u201d Canady explained.</p><p>She fell silent, thinking that she must be dreaming, as she had been dreaming on the plane. But she wasn\u2019t dreaming. She could feel a pain pulsing in her ankle and her knee hurt. And her back. And catching sight of herself in a dim reflection on the windshield of the car, she saw that twigs and bracken were in her hair.</p><p>The car pulled up to the house. Before she had a chance to move, Ragnor left the rear seat and opened her door. He drew her out, none too gently. \u201cCould we have a discussion now, in the house, please?\u201d She shook off his touch and walked up the front steps. Both the women were waiting for her there.</p><p>\u201cLucian?\u201d Ragnor asked.</p><p>\u201cHe went looking for you, too,\u201d Jade said. \u201cHe was afraid you might have met with trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know him?\u201d she asked. He shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019ve been creating their own little army.</p><p>They\u2019re novices, and can\u2019t fight worth a damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome into the office, please!\u201d Maggie said. Evidently, she had gotten her child to bed in the midst of all this.</p><p>Without looking back at Ragnor, Jordan took a seat on the edge of the antique sofa that faced the mantel.</p><p>There was a fire burning in the hearth. At least that brought a warmth to her that she found she desperately needed.</p><p>They flocked around her, Maggie on one side, Jade on the other, Sean in front of the mantel on one side, and Ragnor?who had just sawed off someone\u2019s head on the other side. He was in a leather jacket, breathing easily for a man who had just engaged in such strenuous exercise; his long blond hair somewhat tousled but his clothing still amazingly, in place. She wanted to run to him; she wanted to run away from him.</p><p>Now she knew why.</p><p>\u201cJordan, first of all, I swear, none of us means to hurt you in any way,\u201d Sean Canady said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect you,\u201d Maggie explained.</p><p>Jordan stared at her. \u201cAre you a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... but I was. That\u2019s a very long story, and I\u2019m not exactly sure what forces gave me a cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a vampire,\u201d Jade said softly. \u201cBy choice.\u201d</p><p>Jordan swung around to stare at her. \u201cAs is Lucian,\u201d Jade explained.</p><p>\u201cSo, you see, we know what we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>She just stared at them, all of them, one by one.</p><p>Then she looked at Ragnor. \u201cGreat. Just great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are more than you might realize,\u201d Maggie said.</p><p>\u201cI think she needs that good stiff drink,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d better get it,\u201d Ragnor said. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll think I\u2019m trying to poison her.\u201d Sean brought her something in a glass. Her fingers wound around it, shaking so badly that she could hardly hold the glass. She decided to down the drink in a single swallow. How could she make things worse?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to explain things to you in a nutshell,\u201d Sean said. \u201cVampires do exist. They have for centuries.</p><p>They\u2019ve survived, usually, by keeping a low profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA low profile,\u201d Jordan repeated woodenly, extending the glass. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have another.\u201d Ragnor hunkered down before her. \u201cIn ancient times, it was easy. There were wars, feuds, deaths ...</p><p>everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no mass media,\u201d Jade said.</p><p>\u201cAnd no forensic detective work,\u201d Sean continued.</p><p>\u201cBut there are legends,\u201d Ragnor said. \u201cSome of them true, some of them exaggerated, some entirely made up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI existed for years, never hurting anyone,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cBut there is ... an instinct. A hunger. And that hunger creates a disregard for human life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich has been shared by many \u2018normal\u2019 men throughout history. There has always been a despot somewhere, a tyrant, a king, a dictator, willing to dispose of hundreds and thousands of people,\u201d Ragnor continued, his eyes hard on hers. \u201cThe Romans conquered and killed throughout Europe and beyond.</p><p>The barbarians swept down on Imperial Rome. England sent armies time and time again to Scotland and Ireland; they were at war with France for years. Peter the Great did a lot for Russia, but he was a ruthless ruler. The Europeans came to America and practically wiped out the native populations.</p><p>Thousands died in the slave trade. Then we entered into the modern world. Hitler attempted to decimate entire populations. Japan savaged China. There has never been a time when wanton and senseless slaughter hasn\u2019t taken place. There\u2019s always been a way for death to take place without being noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then there have been cases of \u2018strange\u2019 murders throughout history,\u201d Jade said. \u201cAnd of course, some have occurred through the sickness of men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd others through the curse of hunger,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a disease.. .a very strange disease,\u201d Maggie explained quickly. \u201cAnd everyone who is a vampire isn\u2019t necessarily a ... a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut those who are, of course, are exceptionally dangerous and lethal, because of their power,\u201d Jade told her.</p><p>\u201cMost of us have done a great deal of which we are not proud,\u201d a voice said from the doorway.</p><p>Jordan turned to see that Lucian DeVeau had returned.</p><p>\u201cThat was the past,\u201d Jade said softly. And she looked at Ragnor with a shrug and an affectionate grin.</p><p>\u201cI really need that second drink,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>This time, Maggie jumped to her feet.</p><p>\u201cIn a nutshell,\u201d Sean continued as his wife went to refill Jordan\u2019s glass. \u201cThere was a time when there was just an order?and rules. Lucian rose to a point where he was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing,\u201d Maggie supplied.</p><p>Jordan was glad of the drink slipped into her hands.</p><p>\u201cKing of the vampires,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cThere was an order,\u201d Lucian explained. \u201cThings that we could do, and things we could not, passed on throughout the ages. I was guided by another, who died. Usually, when someone is turned, there is a certain force that can be felt. From time immemorial, there were laws. For survival. Vampires could not create more than two of their own kind in a century. A form of population control, you might say. We were not to destroy our own kind. We were to dispose of our victims, and not bring attention, and mass destruction, down upon ourselves. Those were the rules, for years and years.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere were always those who rebelled,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cThose who would kill indiscriminately, wantonly, cruelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd those who don\u2019t accept the fact that we are in the twenty-first century, and there are alternatives, so many alternatives!\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cSean wrote the book, Jordan, and Jade, who has a small publishing company, will get it out in the market. Because there is a danger, and has always been a danger. Only in the last few years, because of science and the media, has a clearer line been drawn between those of us who see ourselves merely as predators, and those of us who long for simple survival,\u201d Lucian said.</p> <p>After two drinks, large portions of straight whiskey, Jordan didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. This had to be a masquerade, a charade, an entertainment Here she was in New Orleans with a cop and his publisher and God knew exactly who else and what else. Even after all she had seen, all she knew . .</p><p>\u201cSo, you are the king,\u201d she said, looking at Lucian. She stared at Ragnor. \u201cThen what exactly is your role in all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRagnor is the enforcer,\u201d Lucian said softly. \u201cHe was born the seventh son of the seventh son, and his father had a tremendous strength and power, passed down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your father, then, was the wolf, which made you Wolf\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enforce the decisions we make,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe enforcer,\u201d she repeated, then grew angry with herself. She was beginning to sound like a parrot. \u201cIt was you,\u201d she said coldly, \u201cat the contessa\u2019s ball. The wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been the fucking wolf I\u2019ve seen, in the streets at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of thought, and what\u2019s in the mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what is seen by the eyes, a trick of light, or matter. Yes, I\u2019ve been there. Guarding your room by the window, before you invited me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do have to invite a vampire in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d read the book,\u201d Sean said.</p> <p>\u201cThe contessa was after you?in a personal vendetta,\u201d Ragnor explained. \u201cI had been watching her, through the city. I knew that she and her followers intended to strike the night of her ball.. . I just hadn\u2019t realized quite how large her cult had grown, what she had done. What they had done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNari is never alone,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cThroughout time, she has searched out the most depraved companions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been there, not in the section of the ball where you were,\u201d Ragnor told her. \u201cEven with the belief that she\u2019s a predator, and like a lioness, entitled to the hunt and kill for the simple reason of her being, she\u2019s not usually stupid. She likes a fine and elegant lifestyle, and that can only be achieved when you\u2019re accepted in your chosen community. So to hunt, for her feasts of this type, she seeks out foreigners without relatives in the country. The poor, the lost, prostitutes, known crooks, drug dealers, murderers, and more. The disappearance of a bad seed is seldom researched too diligently; a dead prostitute merely brings about a belief that she asked for what she got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to save me from the carnage,\u201d Jordan murmured. \u201cHow lucky for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went back,\u201d he told her coldly.</p><p>\u201cYou knew it was going to happen; you let all those people die.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know exactly what was going to happen. I had just discovered that she had escaped, and I was afraid that she was with someone in Venice, someone with a greater power than her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscaped?from where?\u201d</p> <p>Ragnor glanced at Lucian, who replied, \u201cShe had been entombed in a lead coffin at the bottom of the Adriatic for two hundred years. Somehow, she escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s a horrible creature,\u201d Jordan said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop her?and then stop the others?\u201d Ragnor shook his head. \u201cNari herself is being used?yes, she\u2019s a horrible creature. But without her, we\u2019ll lose the power behind her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have believed all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw all this!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just walk into an office of the Venetian police and convince them that Nari was a vampire. I have the ability to kill Nari, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that it\u2019s against the ancient rules,\u201d Jordan interrupted. \u201cBut I just saw you attack a man, sever his head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe attacked me,\u201d Ragnor said, glancing at Lucian and shrugging. \u201cOur old order has fallen into a certain chaos. So we have changed the rules. But at first, I thought that you had wandered into the wrong place at the wrong time. I was afraid that you would put yourself into continued danger by insisting that something be done. But that wasn\u2019t the case at all. You were meant to be there; it was planned that you should be there. Either way, I had to try to follow Nari until I found out who was really behind what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it was planned that I should be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin Jared set you up. Why, I don\u2019t know. But he is under Nari\u2019s influence.\u201d She felt a chill. \u201cJared is my closest living relative. He wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally, no. But that\u2019s not the case now,\u201d Ragnor told her.</p><p>She stared into his eyes. \u201cWhy should I believe you? Why should I trust you now, when you lied to me.</p><p>When you let. . . Tiff is dead. I did see her body. Then I saw you.\u201d He shook his head with aggravation. \u201cYes, you saw me. I\u2019ve spent days dogging your path, trying to follow without others knowing I was there. You must understand?Nari never works alone. There\u2019s someone more powerful behind her, and strong enough now that I haven\u2019t been able to find out who.</p><p>Between them, they\u2019ve created a powerful network.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you were using me as bait,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAt first, yes,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>She sat back, having expected him to deny the words. \u201cHow can you be here? Can you travel the Atlantic by \u2018thought\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on your plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in your room when you pulled up reservations on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that Jared is evil, but so far, you haven\u2019t destroyed him?\u201d The silence that followed startled her, and scared her deeply. Maggie cleared her throat and tried to explain. \u201cThere are different things that can happen,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIf a person is drained of their blood and dies, they\u2019ll turn?unless the body is decapitated or destroyed right away. Then there\u2019s a blood ...</p><p>taking. Bit by bit. Sometimes the infection, or whatever you would call it, can be cured then. Blood transfusions can save lives; other factors may enter in. When a vampire chooses to have obedience from a victim, blood is taken very slowly. Then the victim belongs to the vampire, perhaps doing things he might not do normally. Like Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared has been bleeding Cindy,\u201d Ragnor said matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd surely, you know that I\u2019m telling you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy my cousin,\u201d Jordan told Ragnor. \u201cI read a great deal of Sean\u2019s book. I\u2019ll destroy you before I\u2019ll let you get anywhere near Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as Jared lives, there is a possibility that he can be wrested from Nari,\u201d Maggie said, causing both men to stare at her.</p><p>\u201cYou will not harm my cousin. I?I have holy water,\u201d she warned. Of course, she didn\u2019t really. Not now.</p><p>Her purse was back in the rental car. She hadn\u2019t thought to go back after watching Ragnor take the head of the shadow creature.</p><p>Her threat didn\u2019t seem to faze anyone.</p><p>She turned on Ragnor again. \u201cYou let Tiff die!\u201d she accused him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI had no idea Nari would go after Tiff,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI was busy watching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Roberto Capo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto Capo is fine. Or he was fine, when I left. I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d be leaving Venice so abruptly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you follow me, since you knew I was coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew they\u2019d be following you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the computer age,\u201d Ragnor said, aggravated. \u201cAnd there are those throughout the world who are with us?and those who are not. Don\u2019t you understand? All it would take would be one E-mail, and a killer could be waiting for you at the airport. A killer was waiting for you at the airport. Everything has changed in the last few years. Sides have been drawn. Nari and her group have defied all the ancient rules; they have been creating their own followers. They are weak, and foolish, and they haven\u2019t taken the time to learn anything. They die easily. But Nari doesn\u2019t care about that?her creations are all expendable. That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him?I saw him that night under the arches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and he knew something was wrong, so he was warning you the best he could. Nari, and her most recent companion, have created a following in Venice. Like the fellow I killed on the road. I stayed behind long enough to see that Capo was safe, then came following after you as quickly as I could. Capo is really sick?he has a terrible flu.\u201d</p><p>She kept staring at him. \u201cIf all of this is going on, and the rest of you are really such good people, why weren\u2019t you in Venice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNari isn\u2019t the only danger out there,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cIf it had been Nari alone, I could have dealt with her the night of her ball,\u201d Ragnor said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important here is that you\u2019ve been targeted. Why and by whom, we have yet to understand. We need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any vampires,\u201d she told him angrily. \u201cI\u2019ve never had people ripped up in front of me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know about vampires, at the least,\u201d Sean said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him. \u201cWhen you E-mailed me, I looked up the case in Charleston.

I didn\u2019t work with Steven; I listened to him after a day\u2019s work. I don\u2019t have names, or faces. I\u2019m a book critic?he was the cop,\u201d Jordan said.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, try to think of anything. You\u2019ve got to understand. We can all be destroyed ourselves,\u201d Lucian told Jordan. \u201cIn the past, when our kind have stepped beyond the limits that might bring about mass destruction, we\u2019ve found a way to imprison them, be it in a form of containment, or through physically wounding. Now, as we\u2019ve told you, things have changed. There are two sides out there. And we\u2019re on yours.\u201d</p><p>She started to stand, then blinked. The whiskey, the time change, and sheer exhaustion had gotten to her.</p><p>Before she knew it, she was sliding back to the sofa. She tried to stand again and speak, but the effort needed seemed too great.</p><p>She didn\u2019t black out.</p><p>She simply faded away ...</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p> <p>The time to heal took place on a tiny island in the Irish Sea called the Isle of the Dead.</p><p>Both the Scots and the Norse, still debating ownership of many of the islands scattered south of the Hebrides?and often deciding the matter by arms? kept clear of the little island.</p><p>Unless, of course, they had business with the inhabitants there.</p><p>It was not so difficult in those days for the common people to accept the \u2018different.\u2019 Many worshiped in church by day, and left offerings to Mother Earth by night, baked bread for the \u201clittle people,\u201d and accepted that there was surely a god, one God, but creatures as well, not thoroughly known by man.</p><p>There were enough of those \u201cdifferent\u201d who were known in life; the midget, the giant, the blind man who could create incredible work in gold, the hermit in the Highlands who had lived well past a century. There were berserkers who could bring down twenty men who were double their own size, and holy men who could touch a man, and cure his ills and woes.</p><p>The folk on the Isle of the Dead were different, to be avoided . . . unless they were needed.</p><p>Sometimes, it was the spurned who came there? dwarfs who had lost favor with the noblemen they had entertained, wiccans, cursed in their homelands for supposedly bringing about famine, disease, or death.</p><p>There were others there as well?those considered to be touched by the full moon, who ran in the darkness, who howled in the night. Each country claimed that some creature of their legend and lore existed upon the Isle of the Dead, from the Irish selkies, banshees, and wee people to the pixies of the Scots, the fallen gods and mischief-makers of the Norse, and even the lamia of the Middle East.</p> <p>Shape-shifters, ghosts, and demons, all were said to live on the Isle of the Dead. Among them as well were the simple farmers and tradesmen, those who did not fear their neighbors, for in their service they were safe from the savage attacks that came with the fierce struggles between Danes and Norse and the tribes ruling their various sectors of the British Isles.</p><p>Life, and death, were easy in those days, for wars and feuds were constant, and bloodshed was a way of existence. Men of all ilk chose their sides, and barbarism was the rule of war.</p><p>When there were no battles, there were herds of shaggy cows and sheep to tend, their populations always kept at a maximum by the natural inhabitants of the isle.</p><p>There were years in which Ragnor healed, and years in which he learned, for one of the greatest oddities of this damned habitat was the number of holy men who came seeking help in quests for vengeance as well as for peace. Ragnor discovered early on that Lucian had his own demons to destroy, and that he intended to keep a sharp control on the world in which they existed. In his first years among the damned, he was often attended by a strange and beautiful young woman who continually appeared and disappeared, a cursed creature, but unlike themselves, damned to a life in which she must continually return to the sea.</p><p>She was Lucian\u2019s wife, from what had become a distant time and world to them. She never explained herself, or asked for explanations in return.</p><p>In time even the scars from the multitude of sword slashes that had covered his body disappeared, and it was soon after that complete healing that Ragnor awoke with the dusk to a strange feeling of unrest.</p><p>Rising, he realized that he had dreamed of Nari, coming to him, whispering that she was afraid, that she needed him. She had cried, tears of shame and horror and fear. She had begged his forgiveness.</p><p>He rose and came to the wooden structure much like a longhouse where Lucian slept and entertained their guests. There, he found that an exhausted warrior, the remnants of a steel chain about his neck, had come to the isle, telling a tale about a terrible battle that had taken place in the south of England.</p><p>\u201cThe Normans arrived upon the coast of England. Our Saxon king was ready to meet them, and England should not have fallen, but in the terrible clash that took place, King Harold was killed. The Norman lord makes his way north. Comets ride the sky, and the people think that the world is coming to an end,\u201d the man told them. He was dirty and unkempt, his hair long in the Saxon manner, a scraggly beard covering his face.</p><p>\u201cIf the Saxon king has been killed, and a Norman will take the throne of England, bringing with him his own nobility, the world as they know it will come to an end,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>The man turned to him, startled. He then lowered his head. \u201cAye, the world as we have known it is indeed over, and the freedoms we have known are gone with it. But that is not why I have come.\u201d He looked back at Lucian. \u201cAs the Norman army moves north, there is death and destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the way of it, when one people conquer another,\u201d Lucian said. He lifted a hand. \u201cWe were not a part of this war, and were not asked to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t war that brings me here, though the death and devastation are pitiable and tragic. Wars are fought and won and lost. And in this battle, there were those who believed that Harold himself thought that God stood against him, and so a new reign will come to England. But much of the Norman horde was made up of mercenary troops. And it is doubtful that even the great Norman lord knew from where they all came. He came to seize the throne; men such as he seldom count the cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, if you see that this battle has been fought?and lost?\u201d Lucian demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fear death,\u201d the man said. \u201cMy name is Edgar, and I was a thane of the low country, taken, as you see?\u201d he paused, indicating the steel collar around his throat, \u201c?in battle, to become a serf, a slave to their feudal system. I escaped my captors when they ceased to guard us so vigilantly. Death itself is nothing. Not when a man\u2019s soul falls to God\u2019s hands. But in the wake of the Norman army ... there came a terrible sickness. So many of the invaders were left behind to hold the countryside, to subdue the people in the towns and villages surrounding the battle. And then .. . peasants, farmers, artists, warriors, the injured, and the innocent, all began to fall prey to this illness ... it is like a plague. A plague of demons!\u201d Edgar continued, red-rimmed eyes wild. He was worn, exhausted, and probably starving, but he spoke with conviction and a dignity that belied his shabby appearance. He had a straight posture, dark hair and eyes, and the courage to speak his mind. \u201cGod knows if any of the poor souls will be left alive in the south when I return. I told you, I managed my escape because the Norman invaders are afraid themselves; they stay behind walls in confinement, fearing only for themselves. It is a strange evil, seizing victims voraciously. Evil, in a sweep of shadows. They come by the day\u2019s end; the victims don\u2019t even sicken, they fall dead by morning. And there are hauntings where they return to their loved ones, and by morning, the sister, the brother, the mother has fallen dead as well, and the sickness goes on and on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is black death,\u201d Lucian said, watching the man. \u201cA man touches his wife, and her illness is his. A mother tends to her dying child, and loses her life as well.\u201d Edgar shook his head. \u201cNot that kind of a plague? unless the plague can take on human form, and laugh as the priests pray over the dead and dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no plague, Lucian; we both know it,\u201d Ragnor said, striding up to the man. \u201cThe evil you speak of takes human form, you say. And you have seen this. Shadows, forming into solid shapes. Men? or women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman came upon me as I helped a priest tend to a dying man before St. Mary\u2019s, near the battlefield at Hastings. She stood beside me, draped in black, as if she were a mourner. But then she laughed, and told me that the Normans had opened the door to the damned. And?\u201d The man suddenly broke off.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>\u201cThe man whom I prayed over, dying even as I spoke the words, walked the next day. Walked with her when the dusk was falling, and stepped among the others on the field before the church . .. dying as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you come to us?\u201d Lucian asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause it is rumored that you are shape-shifters as well,\u201d Edgar replied after a moment.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not afraid of us?\u201d Ragnor inquired.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you come anyway?\u201d Lucian queried. \u201cWhen your country lies in devastation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWars are won, and wars are lost, but the souls of men are eternal. Aye, I\u2019m afraid. I was afraid on the battlefield. But not as I am now. They say that others have come here. That you can be as brutal as any conquering army ... but when you are done, there is the order of life and death, and even the fallen can pray for salvation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a reputation,\u201d Lucian murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come with you, south to England,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>\u201cI am safe among you.\u201d Edgar said the words strongly, and yet, Ragnor thought, they were a question.</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Lucian said gravely.</p><p>Wulfgar, who had been silent, laughed softly. \u201cWe drink the blood of the conquered and the holy on holidays sacred only to our kind.\u201d</p><p>The man paled, but didn\u2019t falter. \u201cWould there be a church on this island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that there is,\u201d Wulfgar told him.</p><p>The man started out. Then, in front of Ragnor, he paused. He reached out and touched the silver pendant around Ragnor\u2019s neck. He drew his hand back quickly, but studied Ragnor. \u201cYou were meant to be a great ruler; a champion of God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf so,\u201d Ragnor said smoothly, \u201cperhaps God changed his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as evil comes in shadow, so justice can be found in evil,\u201d Edgar said, and went on.</p><p>\u201cSaxons!\u201d Wulfgar muttered, \u201cthey do enjoy speaking in riddles, in seeking answers where there are none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer is the balance,\u201d Ragnor said, and when they stared at him, he shrugged. \u201cWe are all three savage in battle; were before, are now. And there is little guilt, because we were all born into a world where it was right to fight and be savage against equally barbaric enemies. So it remains among men. The Normans came to seize the crown, and they will keep killing to gain it?and the Norman lord will proclaim that God is on his side, the side of right. The Saxons will fight, and they will kill, and be killed. We all believe we are right when it is our enemies we kill. All the different tribes and people fought within England in times past, and now they must fight for it. The Normans won\u2019t slay the populace indiscriminately, or there will be none to till the fields, to herd the livestock, to prepare their meals, make their clothes. It is always the same. The greatest destroyer knows that he will have gained nothing if he has not won those to serve him. As the Saxon has said?he understands battle, dominion, and death. But he believes in a death in which the souls of men will go to their God. Perhaps we are damned ourselves, but we do know that there is balance on the earth, and without it, we all perish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a speech,\u201d Lucian told him skeptically. \u201cSo we will go out?as champions of the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will go out because I know that Nari and my brother are most certainly to blame. And vengeance is the greatest of my concerns. I have healed, and I am ready to meet them again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo be it, then. We\u2019ll sail south with the Saxon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pray that our ships don\u2019t sink!\u201d Wulfgar muttered.</p><p>They sailed south, around the coast of Cornwall, then rode the distance inland. Along the way, they came upon houses etched with the sign of the cross. Bodies had been burned in great piles in the fields.</p><p>At each dwelling and farmstead, they halted, and destroyed the remains of any they found within houses and home, for there were areas where no one remained to see to the dead. They rode mostly by night, and when they stopped, they prowled through the churchyards as well, where Edgar seemed to turn a shade a green as they ripped through the shrouds of the freshly buried, dismembering the bodies, or setting them on great pyres.</p><p>Never, however, did Edgar protest.</p><p>At last they came to the village known as Twickham, where Edgar\u2019s overlord had once ruled. There, the Saxon earl of the region had ruled from the power of a fortress of wood and earth, built high upon a motte.</p><p>As they approached, by moonlight, Edgar begged them to halt. \u201cThe gates were kept securely locked by night when I left. Now, they stand open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d Lucian told Edgar.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather take my chances with you,\u201d Edgar said.</p><p>\u201cBetter to let him enter in flesh, while we take shadow,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>\u201cI will be bait?\u201d Edgar asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be with you,\u201d Ragnor assured him.</p><p>And so they left the horses behind, and concealed themselves in shadow, following as Edgar rode slowly.</p><p>Torches burned from sconces set into the walls once they breeched the main gate. And within, men in armor lay here and there upon the earth, among slaughtered animals, dung, and refuse. Edgar\u2019s horse shied, and would go no further, and so the man dismounted. He walked along, heading for the manor house, and they followed. At one point, the Saxon warrior let out a gutteral cry of fear as a body moved, a mail-clad arm reaching out for his ankle. Ragnor took form, and reached for the newly fallen man. The arm was cold as ice; stone dead. Edgar turned away as Ragnor disposed of the fresh remains of the once mighty Norman knight, removing the head with a powerful twist.</p><p>\u201cKeep moving,\u201d Ragnor murmured, from darkness.</p><p>Edgar walked on.</p><p>The door to the manor stood open as well.</p><p>Within, Hagan sat at the main table before the fire, fur-booted feet upon the rough-hewn table, hands laced behind his head as he eased in a carved oak chair. Before him, a fire burned at the hearth.</p><p>Throughout the hall, the dead and dying lay at odd angles while his fellows bent over them here and there, seeking the living among the dead, hot blood which had not yet turned cold. Nari sat at the end of the table, hands folded in her lap, lips pouting as she stared at Hagan. Ragnor saw the cause of her anger; Hagan had taken one of the Norman slave collars and set it around the throat of a young, light-haired woman dressed in a tunic of fine dyed linen. She was leashed and on her knees by his chair, her eyes downcast.</p><p>\u201cBe done with it, Hagan,\u201d Nari said angrily. \u201cWe are finished here. The others search for scraps! You claimed that you would follow the conquerors, that we could gain position and wealth, as well as a feast of the fallen.\u201d</p><p>Hagan appeared to ignore her at first, drawing on the chain that held his captive to him, catching a strand of the young woman\u2019s hair, twirling it in his fingers. Then he looked up at Nari. \u201cI am amused by this one\u2019s courage. I think she should join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she should not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous, and how silly of you, dear Nari!\u201d</p><p>Nari sighed. \u201cI am weary of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a coward. You were afraid one of those stalwart fellows so quick to slice the throats of peasants would manage to sever your pretty head. You want to run away and hide. No, that\u2019s not it, is it? You\u2019re such a liar, Nari. And such a cheat. You want to go back to Scotland and dig up my dear brother. Leash your hunger, as I have leashed this slave, and enter the world of sotted fools! Why, you\u2019re afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot. You forget who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? Never. You were not the chieftain\u2018 s daughter, Nari, but a child adopted from a raid in the East.</p><p>You had your village completely fooled?the poor naive idiots never knew that it was you, the adored child taken in by a powerful man, who brought hell on earth down upon them! But you never imagined that you would take a warrior with a greater thirst than your own, and so you have found a companion such as you never imagined! But you do still hunger for my brother, so you will allow me play with my captives.\u201d</p><p>Listening, Ragnor nearly lost his concentration and his grip on the shadow world. He had never known ..</p><p>. would have never known. Brother Peter had not known that they had harbored the lamia who had started it all.</p><p>She had come to him in dreams, as if afraid, repelled by the existence she had chosen. And perhaps he had hoped that what he had seen in dreams had been true. He had never suspected that she had been the initial evil to seize upon them all.</p><p>And still .. .</p><p>Hagan\u2019s followers, dark and light, Scot, Norse, and Easterner, had gone still. Hagan himself fell silent.</p><p>They had seen Edgar, standing at the door.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Hagan muttered, standing. He smiled slowly. \u201cWhat have we here? A strayed and beaten Saxon thane, seeking to return to his home! Well, sir Saxon, you should be pleased to see this all?before you perish, of course. There, you see, about the floor, your enemy! Aren\u2019t you pleased to see that those who thrashed you so soundly have fallen as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see only that you are a greater destroyer than any on earth,\u201d Edgar said. \u201cAnd I have come to stop you.\u201d He pulled out his sword.</p><p>Nari stood as well, backing away from the table, her eyes narrowed. Once again, she wanted no part of danger.</p><p>Hagan started to laugh. He lifted his chin. Two of his undead followers strode forward.</p><p>Edgar was no coward; he went to strike one, but the other rose, attempting to fly at him. Ragnor swept forward, hurling his weight against the creature who would seize upon Edgar\u2019s throat, and they hurtled across the room.</p><p>As Hagan became aware that Edgar had not come alone, he reached for his own weapon, striding forward in a fury, roaring out a challenge. \u201cThis is my domain! I honor no law of the ancients and will destroy anyone? living or dead?who challenges my conquest here!\u201d Edgar, in desperation for his life, fought with no thought of squeamishness?swinging with learned swordplay meant to sever heads as more of the demons rushed forward. But by then, Ragnor and the others had thrown off the cloaks of shadow they wore, and the room was pitched into an instant battlefield.</p><p>And while the others dealt with the dark army of Hagan\u2019s making, Ragnor stepped forward to face his brother.</p><p>\u201cYou! I should have known!\u201d Hagan shouted, and seemed glad of the challenge. \u201clittle brother, how many times will I be forced to put you into hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time, Hagan, you have no edge of treachery or surprise to serve you, and you are the one who will lie in hell.\u201d</p><p>Their swords clashed. Steel locked with steel, and their eyes met as each struggled for the upper hand.</p><p>Hagan rushed at Ragnor; he ducked low, butting his brother hard in the midriff, and casting him off with such ferocity that he flew across the room and crashed against the mantel, sending tongs and pokers flying into the blaze, and sparks flying across the room.</p><p>Hagan immediately rose, howling as bits of flame seared his flesh. Enraged, he stared from his scorched and burning arm to his brother, and once again came across the room, a cry like thunder on his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ragnor was ready?stepping aside of the charge, and bringing his sword down on his brother\u2019s shoulders as he raged past. As Hagan fell, Nari suddenly came to life, flying at Ragnor, and catching his arm.</p><p>\u201cRagnor, he\u2019s your brother, and one of... us. You must stop, you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t what, Nari? Both of you took swings at my neck, if you\u2019ll recall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t do this, I know you, and I need your forgiveness, and?\u201d Nari was suddenly drawn from him. Wulfgar was there, shrugging. \u201cNo, no, my dear. The two of them must settle this alone.\u201d Wulfgar had one of the iron collars the Normans had used on their slaves. He chained it around her neck, dragging her back to attach her to the heavy grate by the fire, even as another man snarled, snowing fangs, and leaped for him. Wulfgar was adept, shaking off the fellow until he had secured Nari, grabbing a log from the fire, and spinning with it before the man could attack again.</p><p>But then, Hagan had stumbled back to his feet, bleeding like a sieve, since he had glutted so heavily upon so many victims in the last weeks. Still, he smiled, seeing his brother. \u201cWho wants to live forever, brother? I do.\u201d And he came at Ragnor again, finding an incredible strength and lifting his heavy berserker sword with a vengeance.</p><p>Ragnor dropped his own weapon, ducking under the unstoppable crush of his brother\u2019s sword so that it pinned Hagan to the ground as it fell. As his brother struggled to retrieve the weapon, he caught him from the rear and threw him once again.</p><p>This time, Hagan flew straight into the fire.</p><p>The logs crackled and then roared, and fire spewed everywhere, as if a burning comet had dropped from the heavens.</p> <p>Ragnor stared at the rush of flame.</p><p>A hand fell on his back. Lucian.</p><p>\u201cOut! We\u2019ve got to get out!\u201d</p><p>Wulfgar was there as well, taking his other arm, leading him toward the door.</p><p>Edgar the Saxon was standing by the door. \u201cWait!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThe girl?the prisoner!\u201d He rushed back in. The manor was ablaze then in every direction. Ragnor swore, breaking free of Lucian and Wulfgar to rush after Edgar. Where the room was not alight with fire, he was misted with smoke. He knocked against the table, found the woman by touch, dragged her to her feet, threw her over his shoulder, and rushed from the flames.</p><p>They burst out into the night.</p> <p>As they did so, the roof caved in with a sound of thunder in the night.</p><p>They looked back to an inferno.</p><p>\u201cRagnor!\u201d</p><p>It was Nari\u2019s voice.</p><p>He looked down. He had not found the Saxon girl. He had saved Nari.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Jordan dreamed. This time, it was Jared standing over her in his dottore costume. \u201cSorry Jordan, I\u2019m sorry, so sorry...\u201d</p><p>He pulled off the mask. The sight of him, eyes glowing a strange red, teeth glinting, glimmering, dripping, as if he was half creature from an Alien sequel. She watched the teeth, coming closer and closer ...</p> <p>\u201cNo, Jared, no! They\u2019ll kill you, don\u2019t you understand, they\u2019ll kill you!\u201d The teeth were almost on her.</p><p>She must have screamed then because she was being shaken awake. She opened her eyes. Ragnor was there. Ragnor. A creature of the night. She\u2019d been having a passionate relationship with the undead. She nearly screamed again.</p><p>\u201cJordan, there is no danger. You\u2019re dreaming again.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, blinking. He was beside her, sitting on the edge of the bed. She must be upstairs in the grand old mansion. There were windows that opened to a wraparound balcony.</p><p>They were closed, secured.</p><p>The bed was set in a cherry wood frame. There were matching dressers, a rocker by the windows, a hearth in which a fire burned, the embers low. Someone had given her a flannel nightgown. She didn\u2019t remember changing, and she didn\u2019t remember coming to the bedroom.</p><p>And now, as Ragnor touched her, she drew away, staring at him. He let go of her immediately. \u201cI grew up with my grandmother,\u201d she murmured. \u201cShe warned me about wild guys on motorcycles and dope addicts and married men. She never thought to warn me about vampires.\u201d He ignored that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that you help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that you followed me, to find out what the contessa was up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Then you fell head over heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked you,\u201d he said. \u201cI liked the fight in you. And ...\u201d A small smile curled his lips. \u201cI warned you about the vinyl. You were incredibly attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you needed to be close to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was close to you. I became desperate to save your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so hard to believe you?\u201d she demanded. And why did all this hurt so badly? She\u2019d known all along that something wasn\u2018t quite right. And though she had known that, she\u2019d still wanted him. And still did.</p><p>\u201cI see, because then you fell for me, head over heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re an enforcer. And the seventh son of the seventh son. A good bloodsucker. You know, I asked you again just who exactly you were? what exactly. And you told me that you were a man.\u201d He lifted his hands. \u201cI am a man. What exactly else? I don\u2019t know. When I was young, there was an awe and mystique about the fact that I was the seventh son of the seventh son. That supposedly meant that I had a power. Maybe it was just a power for survival. A monk I met seemed to think that meant that I was innately bound to be merciful?a strange state of being for a Viking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were a Viking?who never pillaged, ravaged, or fought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fought.\u201d He studied his hands for a moment. \u201cI have shed blood, yes. But there was ... that other power the monk claimed I had. When we tried to defend the last of a village against the vampires, it took many of their number to bring me down. When I thought the monk would end it all for me, he forced me to heal. And to take a vow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vow?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a hand in the air. \u201cTo defend the persecuted and the hunted; never to shed innocent blood ...</p><p>that type of thing. I swore to Odin and to the Christian God ... so what am I? In a thousand years of existence, I haven\u2019t quite figured that out. And now, I\u2019ve told you the truth. I\u2019ve admitted to you that I watched you at first because I had to know who was standing behind Nari. I know her, yes, I know her well. She\u2019s a follower. The dottore is the man behind her. But I haven\u2019t been able to get close enough to him yet to know who he is. There was a time when the rule was so strong that we could sense what was going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian being the rule?\u201d</p><p>Ragnor shrugged. \u201cLucian is still incredibly powerful. But ... in the past, more violence, more crimes against humanity were acceptable. Lucian was called the king, for lack of a better description, but he had his days of extreme violence as well. Maggie.. . Maggie was always different. She denied her fate from the beginning ... and she\u2019s much younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive, six-hundred years old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround three hundred. Maggie has always been exceptional. And even if you accept all this, don\u2019t ever deceive yourself that either Lucian or I were ever as pure in spirit as Maggie. We both have blood on our hands. But even in the old days, Lucian kept order, for preservation, for balance. No one man among us can stop all violence or the natural hunger of predators, any more than a pope could make all Catholics good people who regularly go to church. Before . . . the lines were not nearly as clear. So there was a greater order. There were always rebellions, those who defied the rules. But things had to change. And in the last few years, those who jeopardize the entire society that has moved into the twentieth-first century, who have learned new ways of existence other than in terrifying a human populace and killing indiscriminately, have gotten bolder. They want to overthrow the entire order. But it will destroy us all if they succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if so many of your kind are capable of existing without killing, why don\u2019t you come out in the open?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her as if she were crazy. \u201cMany of us remember the burning days?when totally innocent people were burned at the stake. If you were told that vampires?the real thing?were living in your neighborhood, would you just say, \u2018Oh, how nice\u2019? That would be like living by a lake or canal with an alligator in it. Maybe we aren\u2019t man-eating reptiles, but how many people would calmly accept such beasts in their neighborhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could turn into a man-eating beast?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>\u201cI told you?I\u2019ve done my share of damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. That\u2019s always a great, intimate opener. Want to be with me? I don\u2019t have any sexual diseases, but I am a vampire. Honest, I promise I won\u2019t suck any blood while we\u2019re at it?\u201d He stood up suddenly. \u201cYou should get some more sleep.\u201d He walked out of the room then, and closed the door behind him.</p><p>She was tempted to call him back. She wanted to forget all the confessions she had heard here. She wanted the strange man who had checked out her room at the Danieli; then held her through the night.</p><p>No strange sexual diseases.</p><p>He was just a thousand or so years old, and was a vampire.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t sure that it mattered at all. She just wanted him.</p><p>She lay back down. For once, she needed to be intelligent and logical. And keep her safe distance. She curled back into the bed. In time, she slept.</p><p>When she woke the next morning, she found that her purse and overnight bag had been brought into the room. She showered quickly, dressed, and started out the door.</p><p>From the staircase landing, she could hear them talking in the kitchen, and she paused, certain it was in her best interest to hear what they were saying before they were aware of her presence. From the long conversation last night, she could recognize the individual voices.</p><p>\u201cI think that Jared Riley has gotten dangerous.\u201d That?from Ragnor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d came a reply.

They were menacing. He didn\u2019t trust Jared. He thought he should be ...</p><p>Destroyed.</p><p>Biting her lip, she moved back up the stairway. In her room, she found her purse and dug out her phone book.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances, she\u2019d never make an overseas call from a house where she was a guest, but these weren\u2019t ordinary circumstances.</p><p>She dialed the Danieli, and after a moment, she was put through to Jared\u2019s room. The phone rang and rang. She felt a deepening sense of dread.</p> <p>Then Cindy answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cCindy? It\u2019s Jordan.\u201d</p><p>She was greeted by silence. Then suddenly Cindy lashed out at her.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch! You rotten little bitch! We spent half the night looking for you. We finally traced you to the airlines and New Orleans. And by then, Jared was sick, so sick they had to take him to the hospital. I\u2019m going there now. What the hell is the matter with you, taking off without a word like that, telling the cops to say you\u2019d meet us at Harry\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, I had to get out of there. Tiff Henley was murdered. I saw her body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiff Henley is in Paris. The cops said so. And Jared said so, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJared lied to you, Cindy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand me? He\u2019s in the hospital? sick. He may be dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy, I love Jared, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell! Your mind is twisted. You went unhinged when Steven died, and now you\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re simply crazy, and you\u2019ve hurt him ...\u201d</p><p>Cindy\u2019s voice dissolved into a torrent of tears.</p><p>\u201cI have to go. I just came to get some things to stay with him at the hospital. If you give a damn about him, you\u2019ll get your ungrateful ass back here!\u201d</p><p>The phone went dead in Jordan\u2019s hands. She felt someone at the door. Great. Good thing she\u2019d never decided to be either a criminal or a cop. She\u2019d left the door open to make her secret call.</p><p>Ragnor was standing there.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go back to Venice. Immediately. You may not have to destroy Jared. Cindy says he may be dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go back to Venice,\u201d he said, eyeing her coldly. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have called. Phone calls can be traced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey already knew I was in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now they\u2019ll know we\u2019re warned about Jared.\u201d He paused. \u201cThere\u2019s another stop we have to make first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharleston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean has spent the day tracing your Steven Moore. He made a really sudden appearance in Charleston. He\u2019d also disappeared from his last job in New York. Supposedly, he\u2019d been injured and suffered amnesia on his way to recovery. Oddly enough, his family died at the same time. A close friend on the New York force met with a serious accident. No one remembered him very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that your fianc\u00e9 might have been a rather cunning vampire.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo?that\u2019s impossible. You didn\u2019t know him. He was the kindest man, the most compassionate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe a damned good actor. Make yourself a cop. It\u2019s amazing how that could keep a lot of evidence from being found. And amazing how easy it would be to get rid of people who were getting too nosy. And how easy to restrain people when they were trying to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy for you to prove me wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He turned and started out of the room. She ran after him, grabbing his arm. She let it go quickly, having forgotten in the last few hours just how much power lay in his biceps.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have to exhume Steven Moore.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, backing away. \u201cHe was burned! And you can\u2019t just dig him up?an exhumation order could take days ... weeks. More. And I have to get to Venice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be on a plane by midnight,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in Charleston in a matter of hours. And as soon as it\u2019s dusk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to dig him up yourself?\u201d she asked incredulously. \u201cNo, no, we can\u2019t. I\u2019m telling you, he was burned. He\u2019s been buried a year. He\u2019s deep in the ground, in a sealed coffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet your coffin is empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteven was never evil! We\u2019ll be wasting time. You\u2019ll see?he\u2019s going to be in his coffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right; we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to get him out of the ground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have help. Lucian and Sean will be with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the three of you are going to sneak into a cemetery at night and dig up his coffin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe four of us,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re coming too. I don\u2019t intend to let you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>They had entered a new age.</p><p>Maggie Canady arranged for their flight tickets on the way to the airport via her phone and when they arrived at the airport, they arranged for their transportation from Charleston to Rome and on to Venice.</p><p>He never left Maggie alone with their toddler and their infant.</p><p>While waiting for last-minute arrangements to be made, Jordan had a few minutes alone with the two women.</p><p>\u201cYou still look shell-shocked,\u201d Maggie told her.</p><p>\u201cI am still shell-shocked. I read your husband\u2019s book. I knew something was going on, that strange things were happening, but I was looking for logical explanations. I thought there were killers loose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are killers loose,\u201d Jade commented.</p><p>\u201cBut in legend and lore, all vampires are killers,\u201d Jordan insisted.</p><p>\u201cAnd most of us have killed,\u201d Maggie murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not a vampire anymore. I\u2019ve never heard of a vampire being cured, in any legend, television show, movie, book, what have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a very old legend that if the tie between a mortal and a vampire is deep enough, a bloodletting can bring back mortality. In my instance ... this is too long and confusing a story to tell quickly. When I met Sean ... well, I think he lived before. We became involved here, in New Orleans, because an old enemy of mine was active and Sean was the cop on the case. I don\u2019t have all the answers; for us it worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you were a vampire, but now you\u2019re human. And Jade, you were human, but now you\u2019re a vampire. So you weren\u2019t Lucian\u2019s long-lost soul mate.\u201d</p><p>Jade looked at Maggie. \u201cShe sounds so skeptical. Doesn\u2019t this all sound perfectly normal to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember when you thought we were all insane,\u201d Maggie said.</p><p>Jade shrugged. \u201cI came across a group of terrorists in Scotland, chewing up tourists. They tried to finish off the survivors one by one, and there I met Lucian. I think he believes I lived before; I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you say that you are now a vampire,\u201d Jordan reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI was caught in the final episode with the creatures terrorizing the vaults and crypts of Scotland. With the depths of the tainting I received . . . well, it doesn\u2019t matter. Lucian had no desire to become mortal; he was well aware that the upheaval was happening, and he felt responsible to see that . .. that the world changed. He was responsible for his own kind, and to keep a balance and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to protect people,\u201d Maggie said flatly. \u201cJordan, the world is black and white and all shades of gray. But you have to believe us; maybe we\u2019re all trying to make amends now. Maybe all vampires want to believe even they can get to heaven one day. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just that in the last year or so, many of the stricken?the cursed, or the blessed, as you would have it?have formed something of a coalition. They lead fairly ordinary lives, and when such an upheaval occurs, they fight it together. Anyway, here they are</p><p>... coming for you. Take care; trust us, please trust us!\u201d Maggie gave her a hug as Ragnor came for her. \u201cHurry?we\u2019ll just make the plane.\u201d He led her into the airport as Sean and Lucian said good-bye to their wives. He was all business, in a hurry to make sure they didn\u2019t miss their flight.</p><p>She was seated next to him on the short hop from New Orleans to Charleston. She was still worn to a frazzle, and he seemed in no mood for conversation. When the plane landed, they immediately searched for a car rental place.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the car I wrecked yesterday?\u201d she asked Ragnor at the desk.</p><p>\u201cSean took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a cop. He took care of it,\u201d Ragnor said again.</p><p>A few minutes later, they had their car. It wasn\u2019t quite dark.</p><p>\u201cWe can go to my house, if you want,\u201d Jordan suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo ... I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I know a great restaurant in the area,\u201d Sean suggested. \u201cSouthern fried cooking, but then, those two don\u2019t have to worry about high cholesterol.\u201d</p><p>Jordan tried to smile at the joke.</p><p>She knew the place where they stopped. It was an old converted house on the outskirts of town, very near the cemetery.</p><p>Both Sean and Lucian ordered fried chicken, potatoes, succotash, salads and desserts. They ordered wine with dinner.</p><p>She decided that since she was going to dig up the grave of a man she had loved, she needed a large glass of wine as well.</p><p>\u201cAnd to think,\u201d she murmured, halfway through the meal, \u201clegend has it that vampires don\u2019t need normal sustenance, only blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ragnor looked at her seriously. \u201cWe do like our meat rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow have you managed ... the?er?kind of sustenance you do need?\u201d she asked awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cWe often pay visits to the local blood banks,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cAnd animal blood will suffice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuman is better,\u201d Ragnor said flatly.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to make me more nervous?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He leaned close to her. \u201cIf I intended to take your blood, Jordan, I could have done so many times before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a very trusting soul, is she?\u201d Lucian inquired.</p><p>\u201cOh, and I should be?\u201d</p> <p>Ragnor shrugged. \u201cLeft corner table,\u201d he said to Lucian and Sean.</p><p>Jordan started to move her chair back. \u201cNo,\u201d Ragnor warned her softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you telling them?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just keeping an eye out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019m a cop. My eyes are always open.\u201d</p> <p>None of them explained any further. Lucian asked for the check and paid it. It was time to leave.</p><p>When they reached the cemetery, Sean drove the rental car deep into a grove of trees by the side of the very old burial ground.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have the gate open in a minute,\u201d Ragnor told them. He and Lucian started walking toward the entry. They disappeared into the darkness. A moment later, Sean and Jordan heard the creaking of the old gate.</p><p>Sean carried a duffel bag with him as they started in.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the Charleston cops showup here?\u201d Jordan demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be done before anyone shows,\u201d Sean assured her. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Inside the now open ten foot gates, Ragnor and Lucian were waiting for them. As so often occurred at night in the outlands of Charleston, fog sat low on the ground. For a moment, Jordan closed her eyes, thinking of the insanity of what she was doing. On a dark and foggy night, she was wandering around a cemetery with a very strange cop and two self-proclaimed vampires.</p><p>Fog drifted around sculpted burial figures. Cherubs rose above many graves; Madonnas, heads bowed in prayer over folded hands, graced others.</p><p>The fog seemed to swirl with a life of its own. Jordan tripped over a broken old stone as they hurried off the path. Ragnor caught her arm, righting her.</p> <p>\u201cSteven is?just ahead,\u201d she told them.</p><p>He was buried in an open area between two pre-Civil War private mausoleums. She pointed out the grave.</p><p>The stone was black marble, making it hard to read the inscription in the darkness, but Lucian and Ragnor seemed to have no problem with night vision.</p><p>They paused for just a moment. Jordan remembered the day when she had stood here and listened to the prayers as Steven had been interred.</p><p>It had rained.</p><p>The sky had been a leaden gray. She had felt as if they were burying her heart.</p><p>Now she was allowing people to dig him up.</p><p>There would be no way to stop them, she knew.</p><p>Sean carried three spades in the duffel bag. He took them out, and the three men started digging. Jordan watched, standing just a few feet back, amazed at the speed with which the men could move the dirt.</p><p>She swallowed hard, feeling the mist swirl around her. She closed her eyes, imagining them bringing up the coffin. It was sealed in lead. She didn\u2019t know what device Sean had brought for that, or how he\u2019d managed to get this luggage on the plane, but she was sure it had to do with the \u2018last-minute arrangements\u2019 they had made at the airport.</p><p>Soon they would reach the coffin. She was afraid it would be like the old Hammer films she watched on the Movie Channel. They would open it up; there would be a horrible creaking sound. And there would be Steven, restored to health and splendor, sleeping with his arms crossed over his chest. And he would open his eyes, but she wouldn\u2019t see Steven\u2019s eyes, she would see the red glowing orbs of a demon ...</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re down to the vault,\u201d Ragnor said to Sean.</p><p>Sean crawled out of the hole and saw Jordan\u2019s pale face. \u201cIt\u2019s almost over.\u201d He had some kind of a battery-operated welding gun in the bag. He grabbed it and dropped back into the hole. Jordan heard the hoot of an owl and clenched her teeth, looking around the graveyard.</p><p>She stared back at the hole, seeing the sparks that created an eerie red glow within. Then, as she watched and listened to the drone of the gun, she had the feeling that someone was behind her.</p><p>She turned. There was someone there. A young man in tattered jeans and a worn Grateful Dead T-shirt.</p><p>His hair was long and greasy; he looked as if he\u2019d been on his way to a street fight. She didn\u2019t scream; she just stared at him in surprise.</p><p>Then he smiled. She saw the fangs of her dreams. In life, the youth hadn\u2019t kept up his teeth. They were marred and yellowed, and even the glistening fangs seemed almost green.</p><p>She opened her mouth. At first, no sound came. Then she managed to scream while reaching into her purse for the holy water.</p><p>She threw it at him, doubting her ability to do harm.</p><p>To her amazement, he screamed, louder than she. It might have been acid that she had thrown at him, the way he clutched his face, backing away. She heard a sizzling sound... saw flesh on his face began to decompose ...</p><p>He wasn\u2019t alone. A foul-looking young woman with spiked hair came running up from behind him, as if she were a frenzied animal. Jordan tossed more water from her Venetian vial. It was not enough, for the girl was still coming.</p><p>Before she could reach Jordan, a black shadow seemed to fall before her. Jordan saw Ragnor\u2019s bulk take shape. He swung a fist, knocking the girl from her intent, sending her flying back against a tree. The youth remained on the ground, rolling in pain. The girl sat stunned, slumped against the tree for one moment; then she rose again, as insanely as a rabid dog, and came running forward.</p><p>By then, Ragnor had taken up a discarded spade. He swung as she ran. Jordan cried out with a sick sound as she heard the spade strike against the girl\u2019s throat. She turned away, knowing that the head was flying free from the body.</p><p>Lucian, too, had come from the grave. He walked over to the rolling youth. Jordan turned away, not wanting to see the end.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more coming,\u201d Lucian said, walking back to Ragnor.</p><p>\u201cThe businessman from the restaurant,\u201d Ragnor said. He inclined his head toward Jordan. \u201cI think that Buffy the Vampire Slayer here is out of holy water.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded, taking a stance by the grave. The other two slipped back in. A moment later, she heard a groaning, like nails pulling hard against a board. They had the leaden sarcophagus off. Then she heard the wrenching of wood.</p><p>Then . ..</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jordan demanded tersely.</p><p>Sean Canady walked around the grave, leading her carefully. Ragnor had a flashlight in the hole.</p><p>He shone it into the coffin.</p><p>Jordan nearly retched. There was a body in the coffin. Burned and decomposed. Hair gone; features hardly recognizable as human.</p><p>\u201cI told you!\u201d she breathed. \u201cI told you!\u201d She backed away. \u201cPut the cover back; fix the lead shield. For the love of God, let him rest in peace!\u201d She turned, ready to walk away from the coffin. She stopped instantly.</p><p>There was a man in front of her now, in a business suit. Pleasant looking. Dusty blond hair, nice eyes, easy smile.</p><p>Except that he smiled with long teeth. \u201cCome!\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Ragnor rose from the grave; floated from it, as if he were on an invisible elevator platform. Jordan realized she was suddenly more afraid of him than of the strange businessman.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d the man beckoned again. \u201cThis man doesn\u2019t know what a woman is for. I can show you.\u201d</p><p>Ragnor stepped forward. Jordan turned away, covered her ears with her hands. Sean came to her, holding her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cA lot to take in, huh?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cPlease ... let\u2019s finish and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Later, in the car on the way to the airport, she asked, \u201cWhat about the people we\u2019ve now left in the graveyard? And the freshly dug earth around Steven\u2019s remains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police will have a bad time with that,\u201d Sean mused.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it... ?\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing else we could do tonight,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>Jordan had chosen not to sit by him. She was in the front with Sean, who drove. \u201cWhat do you make of our visitors?\u201d Lucian asked Ragnor.</p><p>\u201cRank amateurs,\u201d Ragnor murmured.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they were sent to delay us, no more. Or make us believe we weren\u2019t up against much power or strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose young people were someone\u2019s children,\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cThey had lost their children already,\u201d Sean told her quietly. He looked her way. \u201cMaybe that will help you understand. This has to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>Ragnor touched her shoulder. \u201cYou are handy with a vial of holy water. And it will work against enemies such as those. But you should know as well, seawater is deadly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeawater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeawater. It\u2019s absolutely deadly. To all of us. And Venice is full of canals. Remember that, if...\u201d The \u2018if\u2019 scared her. As traumatized as she had been, she realized that she was suddenly afraid for him rather than of him.</p><p>At a gas station outside the airport, they cleaned up. They arrived in plenty of time to board early, and Jordan realized that whoever had put out the money for the tickets must have some real income.</p><p>Last minute, first class tickets. The plane was a 777. Jordan felt almost as unreal boarding the plane calmly with them as she had felt standing in the cemetery.</p><p>She found herself taking the seat beside Ragnor. She indulged in champagne.</p><p>He read a magazine. U.S. News and World Report.</p><p>Somewhere over the Atlantic, she knew that she was tired enough to sleep. But before she extended her nearly horizontal seat, she turned to him, studying his features again.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe that I lived before?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI never gave it any thought. Why?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head. \u201cJust curious.

That you were one of her ... kind. Well, you are one of her kind. That you were with her. I mean, part of her ... following.\u201d He had leaned toward her, but he didn\u2019t press his point.</p><p>\u201cI will destroy her,\u201d he told her softly.</p> <p>\u201cCan you, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout blinking. Someday soon, I\u2019ll tell you why.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to get any more out of him than that. She twisted in her comfortable chair, trying to sleep.</p><p>He pulled her little pillow against his shoulder.</p><p>She slept until the cabin lights came on, and the flight attendant offered breakfast before landing in Rome.</p><p>They transferred to their last flight.</p><p>And it was mid-morning when they at last reached Venice again.</p><p>They walked to the dock where the water taxis waited. Jordan didn\u2019t have to remind Ragnor why they were back. He asked the driver to take them to the hospital as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Seawater! She remembered.</p><p>Seawater could destroy the beasts.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>For years, Nari was the perfect companion. She so nearly perished that night; whether he had chosen to obey the ancient rules or not, Edgar had survived the carnage, and he would have gladly taken a sword to Nari\u2019s throat. But she had cried so pathetically, begged forgiveness, and pleaded in such a way that even Lucian and Wulfgar had shrugged, saying that by their law, they could not simply take her head, or throw her with premeditation into the flames, or cut out her heart.</p><p>And so she had lived. And spent the next weeks, months, years, decades, trying to prove that she had learned loyalty, control, and moderation. Ragnor preferred to spend his time in the very far north; she seemed, for those years, to want nothing more than to be with him.</p><p>Wars came and wars ended. The world was ruled by the sane and merciful, and by the cruel. Every rebellion from a new lord brought about another new lord much the same.</p><p>But when King Philip of France sent out his call to arms in a great Crusade, Ragnor decided to leave the northern isle they had called home for so many years and ride to battle. Nari encouraged him and came with him on the Holy Crusade. The journey fascinated him; he loved the different places they went?France, Spain, and Italy?on the way to meet the Infidels. Italy especially fascinated him; the Romans had left behind such magnificent masterpieces in sculpture and architecture. It often amazed him that the ancient civilization had come so far, only to perish in the wealth of excess, with, of course, a little help from barbarian tribes. Nari was amused by his wonder at everything they saw. She was familiar with Italy and the days of the Roman Empire. It was as they traveled that she told him that it was a homecoming for her, in a way, since she had come from the East as a child, and lived in Italy for many years.</p><p>The Infidels were intriguing as well; they were exceptionally learned, and as dedicated to their Allah as the Christians were to their one true God.</p><p>But the desert sands were hot, the fighting was fierce, and in such a world, sides must be taken. There were gains, and there were losses, and Ragnor fought with as great an ardor as any man, and he killed, as death was the duty of a knight in battle. A man such as he needed enemies.</p><p>There were times as well when the enemies negotiated, and he was often with the leaders of the great Crusade when they met with the representatives of the great Arab leader Saladin. The tents of the enemy were exotic and rich, the fabrics of the draperies were exceptionally fine. During one such meeting, he met a man he quickly recognized as one of his own kind. When the talks had finished on a discordant note, he met with the swarthy fellow outside. \u201cYour Christians will perish here,\u201d he told Ragnor, as they stood by their horses, ready to mount. \u201cI am eager for this battle; there is nothing like the taste of a holy warrior who is in the midst of an effort to seize the homeland of my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing like the taste of a man who believes his god will honor him for the death and destruction of others,\u201d Ragnor replied.</p><p>The Arab shrugged, a grin on his strong, swarthy, face. \u201cIndeed, for the two of us, there is simply the love of the taste of battle, and what better excuse than a war for ideals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will always be wars over ideals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Thank both Allah and your God for that!\u201d said the Arab.</p><p>His name was Ali Eban, and in the battles to come, he excelled, and was noted by the Christian warriors with great respect. And as even the leaders of men, King Richard of England among them, were excessive in their slaughter, whatever rampant tastes he allowed himself went unnoticed.</p><p>One night, returning to the scene of a battle with Nari, Ragnor found that he was not the only man to slip back to the battlefield. The Arab Ali Eban was there, ripping into the injured with a wanton and careless abandon. He and Ragnor came face to face, and when Ali realized that he was not up against an easily taken opponent, he backed away, sharply reminding Ragnor of the law of the ancients.</p><p>\u201cSeize upon your own dying then, and leave those who will walk again,\u201d Ragnor told him.</p><p>Ali motioned to him, indicating that he would bow to that term. Nari stood at Ragnor\u2019s side and was with him when they parted. She feasted upon those who were near to death, speaking gently, easing them on to their Heaven. She returned with Ragnor to the Christian camp that night, and she was more exotic and passionate than ever in her lovemaking.</p><p>In the morning, she was gone.</p><p>He hunted her through the months that followed. And when he came upon her and Ali again in the aftermath of a cataclysmic battle, he stole her back.</p><p>When she cried that time, he wrapped her in a shroud with a stake in her heart, found one of the oldest churches in the ancient town, and paid a somehow knowing priest to see that she was encased in stone, and buried deeply.</p><p>Nari would always be a child of her nature. On her own, she did not practice the wanton excesses that would see them all destroyed. But she would always betray him when she saw another pack with which to run.</p><p>Ragnor saw Nari once again in later years.</p><p>He was dividing his time between England and France in those days, having taken up company with a young French countess who had determined to help her countrymen escape the excess of the machine invented by Dr. Guillotine. The French royalty had certainly shown disdain for the masses, but the machine of the revolution rolled into a heinous persecution of so many innocents, it was impossible to stop the flow of cruelty.</p><p>Ragnor was glad of the challenge of stealing the innocent from the jails, and seeing the consternation of the powerful when their victims disappeared by night.</p><p>He had slipped into the Bastille one night to take the keys from the jailors and to take enough blood from the guards to leave them unconscious. He entered a cell to find that his old lover was among the broken and fallen on the floor. He hadn\u2019t recognized her at first, but one of the other prisoners?a girl huddled against a wall as far as possible from her? told him that the woman was Countess Arabella?and that she was going to the guillotine for her abuse of her servants.</p><p>\u201cAbuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was married to the Lord d\u2019Argentin. He was rumored to be a monster of a man, but he was killed when the father of a peasant girl he had taken went mad and sliced him to ribbons with a sickle. That did not stop the countess; she was the wife of royalty and protected by the crown. The law pretended that she did not entertain herself with the deaths of her servants,\u201d the girl told him. \u201cI beg of you! Save me. I have been in terror here! The guillotine would be a blessing over having her awaken in this cell and find me! As yet, she has not harmed me, for she was sorely injured when she was seized. If you must save her, then, good sir, leave me, for I would die happily rather than live with her near.\u201d Ragnor paused there for a very long time. He had heard rumors about the Lord d\u2019Argentin and the Countess Arabella, the nobleman\u2019s lady who had caused the disappearance of many young maids and servant boys.</p><p>Hundreds of years had passed. He still felt something of an old pain.</p><p>Still, he turned away. He knew that it would be right for Nari to go to the guillotine.</p><p>\u201cCome, we head for England tonight,\u201d he told the girl.</p><p>He reached for the young girl, and left the cell.</p><p>In the days ahead, he waited, certain that he would know, that he would feel something when the time came, when the blade fell, and Nari\u2019s existence was at last ended forever.</p><p>The feeling never came.</p><p>Then, years and years later ...</p><p>He awoke. And he knew.</p><p>She was back.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Ragnor asked the questions at the desk when they arrived, explaining that Jordan was Jared Riley\u2019s closest living relative.</p><p>He didn\u2019t, however, come up with her. He said that he and Lucian had to start moving, but that she shouldn\u2019t be worried; Sean would be there with her. He fingered the cross she wore around her neck, smiling.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work against you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m partial to nice pieces like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually, it does. One of the best friends I ever had was an abbot, and he taught me the safety of a church?and his faith. But keep it on, at all costs. It can help to keep you safe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill it stop someone like Nari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the least, it would delay her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I should know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Someone like Nari cannot enter a building that is consecrated. If you\u2019re ever in trouble in the streets, get into a church. Thankfully, in Venice, remember, there are over two hundred.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p><p>Sean took her hand in support as they went up to Jared\u2019s room. He told her he\u2019d be just outside, waiting, if she needed him.</p><p>She gave a little cry at the door when she looked in at Jared. He was beyond ashen. IVs pumped blood into him through a needle in his arm. He looked as if he was dead already.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>She started, turning to see that Cindy was slumped into a chair at the rear of the room.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t look much better than Jared. She had almost no coloring; her beautiful hair had taken on a lusterless hue. Her sweater was buttoned wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d She came over to Cindy, wondering if her cousin-in-law was going to throw off her touch when she tried to hug her.</p><p>But Cindy\u2019s malice hadn\u2019t remained. She broke into a flood of tears. \u201cI love him so much!\u201d She looked at Jared with wild eyes. \u201cI thought that ... oh, God, Jordan! I was ... no, I am ... certain that he was having an affair with that woman. The contessa. But ... I love him.\u201d She gripped Jordan\u2019s arm, and her pupils seemed large and distorted.</p><p>She was on a tranquilizer, Jordan realized.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that woman. That\u2019s why he\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to die,\u201d Jordan said, wishing that she was certain.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve called the police. They\u2019re going to come and talk to me. I\u2019ve hated to leave him . .. but you\u2019re here now. You?if I\u2019m out of the room, and he takes a turn ... you\u2019ll come get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Jordan gently disentangled herself from Cindy\u2019s frantic hold and went to sit by her cousin\u2019s side.</p><p>He had been dead still. He moved his head then, from side to side. His lips started moving. She leaned low. \u201cJared, it\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d she said firmly. Tears rushed to her eyes. \u201cJared, they\u2019re giving you blood. It\u2019s going to make you live. It\u2019s going to cure you.\u201d She was amazed when he suddenly gripped her wrist. His eyes opened on her. \u201cJordan!\u201d He gave her a weak smile. \u201cForgive me. Cindy .. . never forgive me. Police, no, the police, too late, God, no ... God can\u2019t forgive me.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed his brow. \u201cJared, it\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. You\u2019re not going to die.\u201d</p><p>Cindy had heard him and had risen. Jordan shifted aside so that she could reach him. She was crying again. \u201cJared, don\u2019t you dare die, I love you, I forgive you, I\u2019ll see that she dies, that evil, evil woman .. .\u201d Jordan watched as she leaned over Jared, holding him tight. He had stopped speaking. For a moment, it felt to Jordan as if her own heart stopped. Then she looked at the machines that were monitoring him. His pulse was slow, but steady.</p> <p>He was still breathing.</p><p>There was a soft tap at the door. She looked to it. Roberto Capo was standing there. She gasped with surprise and pleasure, and walked out. He was alive and well. On second thought, not too well. He looked thin and pinched, and before she could hug him, he lifted a hand, warning her away, and sneezed.</p><p>She ignored the hand and gave him a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon troppo bene!\u201d he said. \u201cNot all right, but hopefully ... soon. I\u2019m so sorry you were worried.\u201d She saw that Sean was there, just as he had said he would be. \u201cSean, I\u2019d like you to meet?\u201d she began.</p><p>But Sean stopped her. \u201cWe\u2019ve introduced ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerican cop,\u201d Roberto said sagely, indicating Sean.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWe will find out the truth behind the contessa, eh?\u201d Roberto said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He held both of her hands for a minute, then sighed. \u201cI have come to talk to Cindy. She called ... very upset She doesn\u2019t know how, but she thinks the contessa made Signore Jared sick. I have come so that she can talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God it\u2019s you, and not Alfredo,\u201d Jordan murmured.</p><p>Roberto shrugged. \u201cAlfredo is here, too. In the waiting room.\u201d Cindy wasn\u2019t up to handling such a skeptic at the moment, Jordan thought. She looked at Sean.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could go introduce yourself to another Italian. And explain ...\u201d Sean arched a brow to her.</p><p>\u201cExplain about some of the murders in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Except that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfredo speaks English perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded with relief. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Jordan whispered. He walked down the hall to the waiting room.</p><p>\u201cRoberto, maybe you could talk to Cindy here, away from Alfredo. She\u2019s . . . she\u2019s on medication, I\u2019m sure. And not making much sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Jordan went back into the room. \u201cCindy, Roberto is here.\u201d</p><p>Cindy jumped up. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him. They have to arrest that woman.\u201d Cindy went out of the room with Roberto, and Jordan took a seat next to Jared again. She watched the machines. She looked at his face again, stroked his cheek. Don\u2019t die, don\u2019t die! I know that you\u2018re not evil, and you might have been under the influence of a monster, but in truth, you \u2019re not one yourself, you can\u2019t become one yourself!</p><p>Was his color just a little bit better?</p><p>The door suddenly opened again. It was Roberto. \u201cShe\u2019s . . . crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cShe ran out?I will follow.\u201d</p><p>Jordan looked at Jared, then shook her head. Sean was still here, just down the hall with Alfredo.</p><p>She ran out, after Roberto, down the hall, and to the elevators. He watched the numbers, then started for the stairs. Jordan ran after him. They reached the bottom of the stairs after the elevator, despite the speed with which they had descended. \u201cShe was so ... wild. I\u2019m afraid .. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019ll hurt herself ?\u201d Jordan queried. Why in hell had Cindy run out of the hospital?</p><p>\u201cThere .. . there\u2019s ... Cindy.\u201d</p><p>She was hurrying for the docks. Hailing a water taxi.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Roberto shouted.</p><p>Too late; Cindy had hopped in.</p><p>\u201cWe have to follow her!\u201d Jordan said, grabbing his hand. They ran to the docks. Tourists strolled into the line right ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jordan whispered.</p><p>Roberto pulled out his badge. \u201cPolizia!\u201d he said firmly, and this time, he took Jordan\u2019s hand, dragging her along.</p><p>They hopped on to the next water taxi that came along. Roberto spoke to the driver.</p><p>They sped over the open water, then slowed as they followed the taxi ahead through various narrow canals.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she going?\u201d Jordan murmured.</p><p>\u201cI know this place . . . it\u2019s near the trattoria. She\u2019s going to the church,\u201d Roberto said.</p><p>She glanced at him, and suddenly something stirred in her mind.</p><p>Mistrust!</p><p>The water taxi came to the dock. While Roberto spoke with the driver in Italian, Jordan made a run for it. Skirting one piazza, she raced down a narrow alley, studying the buildings around her. She saw an arrow directing a left turn with the words Campo di Fratelli. Campo ... it meant a square with a church.</p><p>She followed the sign and sighed with relief when she saw a notice board in front, listing the times for Mass. She started for it, passing an outdoor cafe where a few people were sharing drinks.</p><p>There was a wine decanter on a table right by the street. She deftly swept it from the table, and poured out the wine as she raced for the church, praying that no one had seen her.</p><p>She ran into the church. There were a number of people in it, their heads bowed in prayer. One or two looked up.</p><p>She looked around for an urn of holy water, found it, and filled her carafe. As she was doing so, she saw that a frowning priest was walking toward her. She flipped out her cross as she filled the carafe.</p><p>\u201cCatholic, father. Honestly. I swear to you!\u201d</p><p>With her carafe half full, she started to run out of the church?and ran straight into a man. As she started to apologize, she gave a nervous laugh instead.</p><p>She had crashed straight into Raphael.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d he said with pleasure. \u201cI had heard that you left Italy. I heard that your cousin is sick as well, I\u2019m so sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. But you have to help me. Cindy is in danger.\u201d She grabbed his arm. \u201cRaphael, there are vampires, and I\u2019m not crazy. The contessa is part of an awful group of?of?bloodsuckers, and I\u2019m afraid that even the cops may be in on it. Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on?\u201d He tugged back a little as she dragged him. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deconsecrated church. Please, help me!\u201d</p><p>He let out a deep sigh, but allowed her to drag him along.</p><p>\u201cThis street is shorter,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNo ... I need .. . first. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d</p><p>She saw a small trash can just outside the door to an office building. It would do. \u201cI need water, canal water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan, please. Let me buy you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need canal water. Hold this!\u201d She handed him the holy water, dumped the trash, and filled the can with water from the canal.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as easy to run with the trash can, but Jordan moved as quickly as she could. Raphael followed.</p><p>When they reached the church, she hesitated at the door. Shadows seemed to be all around the church.</p><p>She felt a strange, very cold, breeze. She closed her eyes, and imagined the sounds of whispers ...</p><p>Wings in the night.</p><p>Cindy was in there; she was certain.</p><p>She went up the steps, Raphael behind her.</p><p>There were no candles lit within the church. There was no light.</p><p>Suddenly, light flashed from behind her, illuminating the aisle. \u201cYou carry buckets of icy cold water. I am the one really prepared, with something useful? like a flashlight,\u201d Raphael said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood, shine it up ahead.\u201d</p><p>He did so.</p><p>Jordan started for the coffin that stood in front of the altar. She reached it, knelt down, and looked.</p> <p>Cindy was within it.</p><p>She was afraid. She would touch Cindy and see that her head was no longer attached ...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get her out of here.\u201d</p><p>But before either of them could move, there was a voice from the entry.</p> <p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>Roberto Capo. And he sounded angry.</p><p>Jordan snatched the holy water from Raphael. As Roberto came striding toward her, she tossed a portion of the water at him.</p><p>It splashed against his face. He stopped, stunned, and wiped his face. He swore in Italian, something that ended with, \u201cAmericana!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberto, I\u2019m so sorry! I thought that?\u201d</p><p>She broke off, suddenly chilled to the bone. Someone .. . something else was here. She turned slowly to look at Raphael. He was staring at her.</p> <p>She tossed some of the water at him.</p><p>\u201cJordan!\u201d he said indignantly, wiping his face as well.</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy, and must?stop!\u201d Roberto said firmly. He reached into his pocket; for a moment, Jordan thought he was going for a gun.</p><p>He pulled out a cell phone.</p><p>\u201cI am calling headquarters. You are all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, will you? Cindy is in a coffin!\u201d Jordan said.</p><p>\u201cI am calling headquarters,\u201d Roberto repeated, flipping the phone open.</p><p>But before he could dial, they were all startled by a sudden flurry of wings, a cacophony of sound that grew louder and louder. Shadows seemed to loom over them, even in the darkness.</p> <p>\u201cBats!\u201d Roberto murmured, looking at the phone again.</p><p>A shadow descended.</p><p>The phone seemed to fly from his hand.</p><p>He spun around, facing the entry.</p><p>Nari Contessa della Trieste was walking down the aisle toward them, wearing a black Carnevale cape, her hair flowing free behind her, a smile of pure amusement on her face. She stopped several feet in front of them.</p><p>\u201cSilly, silly, man! As if you can call the police against me!\u201d When she reached Roberto, she swatted him, as if he were a fly.</p><p>That simple touch was enough to send him flying far across the church and smashing into one of the pillars.</p><p>\u201cYou, you, you ...\u201d Raphael sputtered.</p><p>\u201cCat got your tongue? Or just your tongue in English?\u201d Nari teased.</p><p>Raphael looked petrified. He reached toward Jordan, wanting the holy water. She let him have it. He was so nervous that the carafe fell.</p><p>And spilled against the floor.</p><p>Again, the contessa laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you!\u201d she said, and another step brought her to Raphael. With the barest effort, she flicked him aside.</p><p>He crashed to the floor, hard. Jordan watched as he tried to lift his head, groaned, and fell back to the floor again.</p><p>\u201cAnd dear, dear, Jordan! Here we are at last! A day of reckoning after all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a bitch you are! \u201dJordan said. She still had her final weapon?the can of seawater.</p><p>Nari shrugged. \u201cI am Diana, goddess of the hunt!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you, dear girl, are the hunted.\u201d She lifted her arms, stretching them to the rafters.</p><p>The flurry of wings began again.</p><p>Then a dozen shadows descended. They came to the floor and slowly took shape, encircling Jordan.</p><p>The figures wore masks and capes. Carnevale masks. Some, the expressionless theater faces of Venice.</p><p>Some, creations that were more like Halloween masks ... wolves, aliens, monsters, among them.</p><p>As Jordan spun around, looking at them all, the circle tightened.</p><p>They came closer .. .</p><p>She waited, then picked up the trash can with its seawater. She tossed it out.</p><p>To her amazement, the monster-faced creature she hit started to scream. It stopped, swirling around in horror.</p><p>It began to fall, to melt . . . with a sizzling sound.</p><p>She stared.</p><p>They all stared as the creature kept melting, and melting, spilling out over the ground in a black ooze.</p><p>The eyes of the monsters, and the contessa, moved from the black ooze to Jordan\u2019s face. She saw the amazement in them, and then the anger.</p><p>\u201cTake her,\u201d the contessa said softly.</p><p>The group hesitated.</p><p>\u201cTake her!\u201d the contessa screamed.</p><p>Jordan began tossing the water again, but there wasn\u2019t enough. The creatures screamed and beat at themselves where the water touched them, but they came on.</p><p>As they moved in on her, they pulled off their masks.</p><p>They were people. Old, young, male, female. No. Not people. They were smiling at her now, smiling angrily, snarling ... growling, moving in.</p><p>She threw the last of the water. Another creature went down.</p><p>But the rest were upon her.</p><p>She screamed as rough hands reached for her. She waited to feel the pain as the gleaming fangs sank in.</p><p>But none of them broke her skin. She was lifted, struggling frantically, and thrown upon the altar. She kept screaming, kicking, shouting, flailing, as she found herself tied down. Then, to her amazement, the creatures moved away.</p><p>She was to be the contessa\u2019s supper! she thought.</p><p>But Nari merely came near the altar, standing in front of the coffin where Cindy lay in her deep, deep sleep, oblivious to it all.</p><p>Then, twisting her head, Jordan saw him.</p><p>The dottare.</p><p>The man who had appeared all around Venice. The man she had followed.</p><p>The man who had followed her.</p><p>He walked slowly toward her along the aisle, and as he came, she felt a fetid coldness unlike anything she had ever known before, a fear that went beneath her skin, a terror that was far deeper than any dread of death.</p><p>He came, closer and closer ...</p><p>And with him, the feel of darkness. A haunting of the grave. Cold, black ...</p><p>Evil.</p><p>He moved Nari aside and came to Jordan. He reached out gloved hands, and stroked her face, and she shrank inside, horrified. She would have screamed with revulsion and the deepest horror in her soul, but the sound would not come .. .</p><p>\u201cHello, Jordan!\u201d he said softly.</p><p>And he pulled off the dottore mask.</p><p>She gasped, so stunned that for a moment, the fear left her.</p><p>\u201cSteven!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Yes, Steven, and not Steven. Steven had laughed; he\u2019d been kind, his features had been touched with life and color and ...</p><p>His eyes now seemed to glow red, and his face was taut; his mouth, so prone to a smile, was caustic and cruel.</p><p>\u201cIn the?flesh, shall we say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible. I?we?they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dug up my grave, and there I was. Jordan! Come now! Another corpse, burned to a total crisp, easily passed as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... no!\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou were ... a cop! You were compassionate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d he inquired. \u201cNot at all. I was bored, and I was afraid that my wanderings in Europe?since my release?might be noticed. I didn\u2019t want to be noticed. Not then. Oh, there was a Steven Moore. And he was a right decent fellow, as they might say. I enjoyed him?and his very moral and righteous family?very much. Then I took his name and came to New Orleans. And met you. You really were incredible. So much passion and love of life and humanity all rolled into such a perfect little package. Of course, you turned out to be more of a pain than I had imagined but... well, all\u2019s well that ends well, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does it end, Steven?\u201d she asked coldly. She realized then that he had been the end; she had been shocked beyond belief. And now . ..</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fight him.</p><p>Only hate him.</p><p>\u201cWell, the only way possible, of course. You will join us. Us! The true strength within our kind. You\u2019ll become a hunter. Stronger, better, than you ever were before. You\u2019ll join me now. Ah, Jordan, remember what was? It will be better. You little fool! Falling for my wretched, pathetic enemies! They are nothing, nothing against the kind of feast, and satiation, and thrill that you can know. We are the masters. The predators. And you will join me. They had me imprisoned in a steel vault in Yugoslavia for the longest time. Then there was an earthquake. The kindest people came to rescue me. I was starving.</p><p>My rescuers provided the most delicious meal. I wandered, met up with dear Nari again . . . and found you. It seemed so easy. Nari got to Jared. Jared has nearly killed Cindy. And though you eluded me at the party?and in your room, and through the streets?you\u2019ll not elude me this time. I have missed you, my love, and now. . . now we\u2019ll be together.\u201d</p><p>He started to lean toward her, as tender a lover as he had ever been.</p><p>But his mouth opened. His fangs dripped, oozed with saliva. They were immense, longer, ridiculously long, and sharp. She watched them. She closed her eyes, clenching her teeth, waiting, praying ...</p><p>He gave out a startled sound, ripped back from her. Jordan\u2019s eyes flew open.</p><p>Another shadow had descended, a shadow so large, winged and menacing, it seemed to cover all the church.</p><p>Ragnor.</p><p>He had drawn Steven from her but now the two faced one another.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her,\u201d Ragnor said.</p><p>\u201cIt is Steven,\u201d Jordan got out. \u201cYou were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteven, yes, and no. Hagan, get the hell away from her.\u201d</p><p>Steven laughed. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t know it was me? I\u2019ve gotten good. You couldn\u2019t get into my mind.</p><p>You thought I was still deeply buried from the last time we warred. No, I\u2019ve been drinking blood?so much of it! I have a power even you can\u2019t imagine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you one last time?get away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, brother, this one is mine. I\u2019ve always been able to take your women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother?\u201d Jordan whispered, working furiously at the knots binding her to the altar as the two men stared one another down.</p><p>\u201cHalf brother,\u201d Ragnor said. \u201cI should have known. He has spent the last thousand years trying to destroy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has no interest in you, brother. I\u2019m telling you?I\u2019ve always had the ability to take your woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Nari? Well, she didn\u2019t prove to be such a treasure. But this woman, Hagan? No, you\u2019ll never take her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ragnor smiled at her. She felt something flood within her at the sign of assurance, and of faith. With a shrug, he extended his wry grin to the man he called Hagan?the man she had known as Steven.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spent your existence being jealous of me. This time, it\u2019s going to send you on. Not to Valhalla, but to the Hel, or Hell, or whichever in truth you care to call it, after all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. The old rules have been broken too many times. This time, you will die your second death, and it will be over.\u201d</p><p>Jordan shrieked in both pain and surprise as Hagan reached for her, his grip so strong that it broke the ropes tied around her wrists and ankles, burning her flesh, nearly breaking bone. He drew her to stand before him. He lifted her hair. She felt the heat of his breath. His teeth were lowering. \u201cWatch brother,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAs I take her .. . for eternity.\u201d</p><p>She saw, just below her, a small puddle of the holy water that had fallen before. It had pooled between two tiles in the ancient floor.</p><p>She slammed her elbow back into his ribs and ducked for the water. Not enough! Still, as he roared, ready to restrain her again, she splashed the little droplets into his eyes.</p><p>He roared with pain.</p> <p>She was free.</p><p>She raced forward, straight into Ragnor\u2019s arms. He caught her shoulders, met her eyes. He moved her carefully aside.</p><p>Ragnor walked toward Hagan. He sensed the movement, and went flying upward toward the ceiling, landing on the rafters. Ragnor followed him. With a sudden, fierce shriek Nari went flying after Ragnor.</p><p>He threw her back down. She landed hard on the floor. A massive wave seemed to move across the ceiling as Hagan cried out to the others. \u201cSeize him, kill him, take him, you fools! I am half blinded.\u201d Before the others could rise, Ragnor had returned to the floor. As Hagan\u2019s followers came after him, he caught them one by one. He took them by their heads and shoulders ...</p><p>Twisted.</p><p>Dropped the pieces.</p> <p>Someone came flying out from a side altar after him, brandishing a sword. The creature never reached Ragnor.</p><p>Lucian slipped down from the rafters, seized the attacker by the neck, took the sword, and ended him quickly.</p><p>Others suddenly began to appear. Jordan ducked down, for it seemed as if the ancient church was filled with bats.</p><p>Bats, wings, noises ... a chattering, soft at first, then growing in a crescendo.</p><p>The door to the church was suddenly flung open.</p><p>Sean Canady came in, vials strapped to his chest, a sword at his waist, and buckets in both hands.</p><p>He threw water in a swinging, upward, arc.</p><p>Screams of agony echoed so loudly that Jordan covered her ears, praying. She looked up just in time to see a shadow forming, coming for her ...</p> <p>She turned and fled toward Sean, ripping one of the vials from the holder on his chest. She tossed the holy water at her would-be attacker. She watched, still amazed, as he shrieked ...</p><p>And decomposed.</p><p>The noise suddenly died away.</p><p>The floor was littered.</p><p>With freshly dead ...</p><p>And decaying bones. Then a massive flutter, like wings, seemed to vibrate the entire structure. She looked up. The massive shadows of Ragnor and his brother met again and again. Sean started to move forward.</p><p>Lucian was suddenly at his side, holding his arm.</p><p>\u201cNo. Ragnor must finish this himself.\u201d</p><p>The shadows came back to the ground.</p><p>The two men stared at one another in fury.</p><p>\u201cWho wants to live forever?\u201d Ragnor inquired quietly.</p><p>Hagan let out a roar and rushed him. It was a mistake. Ragnor was ready. He bowed his frame and caught his brother by the head as he would have butted him into the wall.</p><p>There was a twisting sound. Sickening. Horrible.</p><p>Then all that Ragnor held was bone that fell from his hands to the floor, becoming dust. He stared at his hands.</p><p>There was a sudden motion at the side of the church.</p><p>Jordan turned to see Nari, ready to slip away. She raced to the door, breathing heavily, ready to face the woman.</p><p>She realized she had no weapons.</p><p>Ragnor had come down the aisle. Nari turned to him. \u201cRagnor! How can you forget what we were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime, my dear, has had a wonderful effect on that. Then again, there was the fact that you betrayed me? with my brother?trapped me, and tried to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRagnor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThroughout history, Nari, every time you\u2019ve escaped ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ragnor, you can\u2019t!\u201d she whispered. She walked to him, placing her hands on his chest, looking up into his eyes. \u201cRagnor ...\u201d</p><p>He lifted his arm and wrapped it around her. like the others in the room, he had worn a Carnevale cape.</p><p>It covered Nari as he cradled her to him.</p><p>Then he dropped his arm.</p><p>A great pile of dust fell to the floor.</p><p>Ragnor turned to Lucian. \u201cIt is over,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Lucian nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with the local law enforcement,\u201d Sean said, indicating Roberto where he lay on the floor, just coming to.</p><p>Ragnor inclined his head in agreement. He kept walking down the aisle. He reached out a hand to Jordan, just far enough away so that she would have to take a step forward to accept.</p><p>\u201cYou are different, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand years worth of different,\u201d he said softly. \u201cTake my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019ve wanted the truth. Confessions. There are lots of them I can give you now.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cAt the least, it must be interesting listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to talk all night.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and reached for his hand, then hesitated.</p><p>\u201cCindy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her back to the hospital,\u201d Lucian assured her.</p><p>\u201cAnd Raphael, he may be hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all go to the hospital,\u201d Lucian said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Ragnor offered his hand again.</p><p>She took his hand and smiled.</p><p>\u201cJust so long as you don\u2019t talk all night...\u201d</p><p>They left together.</p><p>He could talk... and talk. And she wanted explanations. Lots of them.</p><p>But...</p><p>Only time would really tell. </p> </body></html>"]
