I was standing in front of the large windows in my new office, watching the busy street below. Hundreds of people passing by, barely acknowledging each other. Soon forgotten. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, something was always happening. I could feel their rush of excitement, the dread, the stress, the anticipation, and their uncertainty whether a particular day would turn into an episode of a comedy, a tragedy, or anything in between. I liked the idea of them chasing their dreams and their futures. Just the way I had once been. Ever since I was hired by Jett Mayfield, I had entered a whirlwind of chaos. I had met the man of my dreams in the city of my dreams. New York, the city that never sleeps, was my home; Jett was the man I wanted to be with, and while everything seemed perfect, I felt something was missing: the answers to my questions about the Lucazzone estate I was about to inherit. Even though I had promised Jett I\u2019d stay in NY with him, because it was the only way he could protect me from them, I felt no peace knowing that people were after me.</p><p>A soft knock on the door made me flinch. A second later, Emma\u2019s head appeared in the doorway. Her cagey glance told me she hadn\u2019t yet fully digested the fact that I had been promoted from mere assistant to a higher position than hers. We had been close to becoming friends when I started working at Mayfield Realties. Now she was distancing herself, which I attributed to my change in position. The past two weeks she had been eyeing me with suspicion, her previous friendliness replaced by badly disguised arrogance.</p> <p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not interrupting anything important, Brooke?\u201d Her voice was cold and sarcastic as her glance swept over me standing at the window. She was holding a huge bouquet of red roses decorated with pearls in between their velvet petals. I gaped at the rich burgundy color and the exquisite perfection of the petals.</p><p>She placed the rose bouquet on my desk. \u201cMr. Mayfield asked me to personally take these to you.\u201d</p><p>Emphasis on \u201cpersonally,\u201d as if the word on its own conveyed a secret meaning.</p><p>I felt myself blushing at hearing Jett\u2019s name.</p><p>I wondered if she knew I was dating the CEO of Mayfield Realties. As if sensing my thoughts, she turned, her light blue eyes piercing through me with disdain and something else.</p> <p>Envy.</p><p>Pure, undiluted envy.</p><p>The kind that could turn melting lava into ice. If looks could kill.</p><p>I groaned inwardly. Of course Emma knew. She wasn\u2019t stupid, just like the rest of the company\u2019s NY headquarters. In the last two weeks, Jett and I had tried to keep our contact at work limited to a strictly professional level, but of course there were subtle signs: the way he touched the small of my back when he led me out of the room or the way his fingertips grazed my arm too long whenever he tried to get my attention during a meeting. Or maybe it was the way we had been sitting together\u2014too close, too intimate\u2014my frantic heart threatening to burst out of my chest with each beat. Surely, if I could hear it, then others might as well.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, and watched her leave. The door closed behind her, and I was alone again. I retrieved the card tucked in between the roses, and opened it, my glance sweeping over Jett\u2019s harried handwriting.</p><p>For my beautiful, pregnant girlfriend,</p> <p>Jett</p><p>P.s. Thanks for the wild ride yesterday.</p><p>I smiled and turned the card around.</p><p>I\u2019m in my office. We have a deal to go over.</p><p>Join me if you\u2019re not too busy.</p><p>Ever since starting this position, Jett had involved me in various company deals, telling me he trusted my judgment. I had learned the ins and outs of his company, the projects they had been working on, dealing with the top clients and seeking out the most desirable properties. So, naturally, when Jett inquired if I wanted to go over a new deal, I was ready to jump at the opportunity. Not only did I enjoy working with him, to me this was another excuse to see him.</p><p>It had been hours since I last saw him, and already I missed him like crazy. Big needy girlfriend alert, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I fished my mirror and lipstick out of my handbag to fix my makeup, and tucked a few stray strands of hair out of my face. Happy with the result, I grabbed my smartphone and acquisitions folder, and left my office. The folder contained all my research, notes on past and current deals, my schedule, and daily to-do list\u2014in case Jett needed anything. I carried it with me at all times, not least because Jett wasn\u2019t known for his patience. My stomach twisted into knots, and my knees began to shake with apprehension as I knocked on his door.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d his deep voice called out, betraying his irritation the way it always did at work. I had yet to get used to his briskness and one-syllable commands.</p> <p>I opened his door and stepped in, catching my breath. He was sitting in his leather chair, his dark hair framing his face, the newspaper in his hands hiding his green eyes. His jacket was thrown carelessly on a visitor chair, and the sleeves of his white shirt were rolled up, exposing his strong forearms. His shirt clung to his broad chest, leaving little to the imagination.</p><p>Sexy.</p><p>He looked like the kind of man you could be obsessed about. I never knew the meaning of the word \u201csexy\u201d until I met Jett Mayfield.</p><p>Just looking at him, I had to force myself not to smile.</p><p>\u201cClose the door.\u201d</p><p>I followed his command. \u201cThank you for the flowers. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Regarding him, I inched closer and placed the folder on his desk. He remained silent so I continued, filling the silence. \u201cI\u2019m done with the Colton estate deal. It\u2019s all in the folder, ready for you to sign.\u201d I pointed at the folder needlessly, waiting for him to look inside. Jett folded the newspaper and placed it on his desk, and stood, his intense gaze finally fixing on me. His expression was unreadable as usual, but there was something in his eyes. He was watching me, taking in my every movement, which made me nervous.</p><p>How could he remain so cool when my heart was fluttering in my chest, and I wasn\u2019t unsure whether to jump into his arms or leap out the door?</p><p>\u201cAnything specific you wanted to talk about?\u201d I prompted.</p><p>Jett\u2019s gaze remained glued to me.</p><p>Unreadable.</p><p>Unfazed.</p><p>Ever so slowly, he walked around his desk, his height both intimidating and arousing me. His lips curled into a dazzling smile. His green eyes sparkled, reminding me of a dark wild forest. I could stare into them forever and lose myself in their depths.</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you have for me?\u201d His deep voice was barely more than a whisper, caressing my senses like silk. His fingers clasped my chin, forcing my head up. I drew a shaky breath and held it, both mesmerized and terrified by his proximity. His thumb brushed my chin while his other hand traced my hips. His body moved against me, pinning me against the closed door, knocking the air out of my lungs. \u201cI hope it\u2019s more interesting than the deals I had to take care of when all I wanted to think about was all the different ways I\u2019d like to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>He was doing his sexy thing again without even trying.</p><p>\u201cThe file\u2019s all I have for you,\u201d I whispered, mortified by my sudden arousal. My body was like a button for him\u2014easy to press, and the heat was on. Every cell of my body wanted him and protested whenever my brain tried to keep at bay the cascade of lust wreaking havoc within me.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Because I think you\u2019re missing something.\u201d His hand traveled south, past my abdomen.</p><p>\u201cI recall a deal,\u201d Jett whispered in my ear, sensing my confusion. And then his lips were on my neck, biting, nibbling, turning millions of my sense buds into sparks. His hands cupped my ass. \u201cOr should I say a bet? Someone\u2019s about to lose and I want to claim my prize.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flamed.</p><p>Oh, God!</p><p>I\u2019d completely forgotten that.</p><p>Ever since challenging me to a game of Spades in Italy, Jett had been delaying the inevitable. The most likely explanation I had was that he was afraid I\u2019d win, because I was the best Spades player I knew, and I made no secret of it.</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about our arrangement?\u201d I pushed him away, but he didn\u2019t budge. His touch became more focused. His hot breath continued to caress my skin as one hand traced the contours of my breasts over the thin fabric of my shirt. His mouth was so close to my lips, I could smell the faint aroma of coffee, mint, and his intoxicating scent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about our bet, Brooke. Whoever wins the game gets to have whatever they want, and right now I\u2019d love to tame you.\u201d</p><p>A rush of excitement washed over me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tame me, because taming would imply I\u2019ve surrendered, and as far as I know you haven\u2019t won yet,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready to lose, I\u2019m challenging you today after work. Even though we\u2019re dating and women are supposed to let their boyfriends have the upper hand, I\u2019m not going to let you win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after work...I want it now.\u201d He laughed quietly into my ear. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019ve set up a table outside. In the open, where I can be sure there\u2019s no cheating.\u201d</p><p>I slapped his arm in mock annoyance, ignoring the sudden urge to run my fingertips over his stubble. \u201cI\u2019d never cheat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He winked. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, and his grin widened. He knew how I felt about cheating.</p><p>\u201cI was talking about gaming, Brooke.\u201d He laughed at my scowl, revealing perfect white teeth. \u201cI\u2019d cheat...to let you win, baby.\u201d</p><p>I scowled again. \u201cNo cheating, Jett.\u201d</p><p>He ignored my statement. His teeth grazed the sensitive spot behind my ear, then moved down my neck. Stifling a low moan, I waited a few seconds, and when no reply came, I added, \u201cI\u2019m serious, Jett. If you cheat\u2014in any way\u2014I\u2019ll be pissed. I want you to give your best because it won\u2019t be enough. I\u2019ll still win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He laughed, and his hand tucked my shirt out of my skirt.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I stopped his impudent movement before he reached my bra and shot him my most menacing glare, hoping my heavy breathing wasn\u2019t giving away my excitement at the prospect of his hands roaming over my body. \u201cYou haven\u2019t won yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just giving you a taste of foreplay.\u201d Jett removed his hand and grimaced, almost disappointed. \u201cA game of Spades, then. Are you really up for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you think.\u201d I shot him my most self-assured grin. Soon the guy wouldn\u2019t know what hit him. \u201cYou say when and where, and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen grab your stuff, Miss Stewart. Because we\u2019re doing this now.\u201d He picked up his jacket from his chair and a black leather bag from the couch, and ushered me out of his office.</p><p>Within minutes, we stepped into the cold afternoon air. Visitors and co-workers were gathered in groups, turning as we walked past. I smiled but paid them no attention because I couldn\u2019t peel my eyes off the only person who mattered.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked Jett as he ushered me into a waiting taxi and communicated to the driver an unfamiliar address. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise. It always is.\u201d</p><p>I smirked at his mysterious smile.</p><p>Oh, God. I hated surprises.</p><p>Jett knew this little fact, and yet he was still trying to get his way. I could only hope he wasn\u2019t aiming for crazy.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M NOT GETTING on that thing. Sorry,\u201d I said. Jett and I were standing on a narrow landing strip in front of the tiniest helicopter I had ever seen. Okay, I had never seen one in real life so I couldn\u2019t really judge it based on its size, but it looked horribly fragile, with barely an inch of metal standing between me and a deep plunge into sure death. Jett knew how much I liked solid ground beneath my feet. \u201cI don\u2019t want to crash and die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s dying, Brooke.\u201d His brows shot up, amused. In fact, he was having a hard time not to laugh, which I could tell from the way his lips kept jerking at the corners. My temper boiled just a little bit. I had issues with height. No big deal. A lot of people did. And I was ready to tell him just that when he interrupted me.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to remind you that you also went on board with me? What\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a boat, Jett. There was water all around us, and I can swim. I cannot fly. I don\u2019t want to get on a helicopter, thousands of miles up in the air with no ground under my feet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll like it, I promise.\u201d He wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me close. Glaring, I inhaled his scent, fighting with the voice inside my head that kept telling me to give it a shot.</p><p>Try everything once.</p><p>No frickin\u2019 way in hell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done this a thousand times, and as you can see, I\u2019m still alive. Just close your eyes and hold on to my arm while I get us to our destination\u2014safe. I\u2019ll help you overcome your fear of heights,\u201d Jett said, soothing me with that deep voice of his that could probably persuade a grizzly to give up his half-eaten prey.</p><p>\u201cTell that to my subconscious. Even if I closed my eyes, I\u2019d still know you were flying. I\u2019d feel it in my bones that I\u2019m high up in the sky with no way but down.\u201d The thought made me shiver with dread, and a trickle of sweat ran down my spine.</p><p>Jett took a half-step back, regarding me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me flying?\u201d</p> <p>Oh, God. Was that the only thing he was worried about? That I might be questioning his competence and abilities? I groaned inwardly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re an awesome pilot.\u201d How could I explain to a man who loved taking risks and who had once been addicted to adrenaline, that I was scared of a lot of things, including flying, and that I harbored absolutely no wish to overcome this particular fear\u2014and especially not in a helicopter, which was more prone to crashing than an airplane.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Jett drew out the word, prodding. Why couldn\u2019t he just drop it?</p><p>Okay, I admit, maybe I couldn\u2019t pay him the same level of confidence I might give a professional pilot. The way I saw it, would I rather have surgery performed on me in a hospital ER by the person I had hot sex with, or by a person who was unbiased, with plenty of experience and a resume to demonstrate his skills? As much as I loved Jett, the decision was a no-brainer.</p><p>\u201cLook. I know I\u2019m being unreasonable.\u201d I heaved an exaggerated sigh. \u201cBut I\u2019m not like you.\u201d It was true. The guy had no fears. He\u2019d jump headfirst into any situation just so he could demonstrate he wasn\u2019t scared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that different from a plane. It just feels more real.\u201d His eyes glimmered with pride. I could hear it in his voice. I could see it in his confident stance, and I was once again reminded he did all kinds of crazy stuff, thanks to his father\u2019s competitive upbringing and bank account. And what did he mean by \u201creal?\u201d</p><p>My fear was instantly magnified at the thought of sensations up in the air being more intense. I didn\u2019t want intense. I wanted earth\u2014or at least a working parachute.</p><p>Taking one step back, I shook my head and crossed my arms over my chest. I was not getting on a helicopter where I could feel every jolt, jerk, and shaking. Not when the tiniest possibility existed that a bird might collide with us, or something dropped from the sky, making us crash. And particularly not when Jett might be tempted to show off with some impressive aerobatic maneuver in midair such as loops and spins. I had seen those on TV, and while the crowd usually cheered, I preferred to stare, horrified, thankful for choosing my profession wisely.</p> <p>\u201cMy point is, I\u2019m not keen on being strapped to a seat with no option to exit. I want to be able to jump.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his lips twitched again at my choice of words. Jumping off a plane\u2014why was it so easy to imagine him suggesting just that?</p><p>Because it\u2019s probably one of his favorite hobbies? Do not even go there, Stewart!</p><p>I felt sick already. Holding onto Jett\u2019s arm for support, I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Jett began to rub my back, but the movement didn\u2019t manage to soothe me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. We\u2019re not flying far,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing it in NY. It will be fun.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right!</p><p>Fun for him to fly. Nightmare for me. But fun for him, nevertheless, to see me sweating a river.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just take a taxi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019d spoil your surprise.\u201d</p><p>I covered my eyes and groaned, hating the fact that I had to disappoint him, hating the fact that he kept persisting. \u201cAs much as I want to, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face and placed a soft kiss on my lips. \u201cI want you to see your hometown the way you\u2019ve never seen it before. And don\u2019t say you can watch it all on TV, because that\u2019s not the same and you know it.\u201d He forced my gaze up to meet his, and his voice softened. \u201cI know you\u2019re scared, but do you know why I want to show you everything? The boat, the sea, Italy?\u201d I shook my head, not knowing where he was heading. \u201cI want to be on your side when you experience things for the first time. I want to be the first one in everything you do.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched in my throat. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you taught me that first moments matter. We don\u2019t forget them. Like our first kiss or our first date. Or the way I\u2019m going to kiss you, right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>In one swift movement, he pulled me to him. His lips found mine with a hunger I had never seen from him before. It was delicate yet possessive, soft yet determined. A delicious shiver tore through me with warmth that radiated from inside out, filling me, calming me a little, persuading me that I was ready. My head was spinning when he pulled back, and for a fraction of a moment I forgot he was still waiting for my decision.</p><p>There was so much hope and warmth in his gesture and expression that I knew I had lost the battle with myself. For him I was going to face my fears.</p><p>As if sensing my crumbling resolution, Jett said, \u201cYou were right when you said that no matter how many years may pass or how many good or bad experiences you have in life, first memories are priceless. From now on, I want to be in all of yours, so no one can take them from you. From us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still afraid.\u201d</p><p>The wind blew a strand of hair in my face. Gently, he pushed it back, his eyes focused on me.</p><p>\u201cAll beginnings are scary, like all endings are sad, but that\u2019s the journey and everything in between is worth experiencing. He gestured at the helicopter. \u201cI was joking about me flying. I want to sit next to you and enjoy the tour. I want to hold your hand, help you get over your acrophobia, so I\u2019ve hired a professional who\u2019ll show us the view. If you see it through, you take the fear out of flying. You know, fear is nothing but a trick of your mind, because we both know you\u2019ve never been in a helicopter. You\u2019ve never crashed. The odds are one in a billion.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and nodded slowly before I could change my mind. I figured in the event we crashed, at least I\u2019d die with a sexy guy on my side and plenty of happy memories. And nobody could say I hadn\u2019t tried to talk him out of this madness.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I whispered. \u201cBut if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ifs,\u201d Jett said, determined. \u201cEverything will turn out fine. It always does. You\u2019ll see this entire experience is good for our baby, too.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not even born yet, I wanted to point out like I had several times during our heated conversation when he mentioned his rigid beliefs on prenatal education. Jett supported the belief that the majority of neurons in an adult\u2019s brain were formed during the first five months inside the mother\u2019s womb. Soon after our arrival from Italy, he had started to implement his belief by giving me more responsibilities and tasks at work so our unborn could learn. Not that I complained, but claiming conquering my fears would benefit my baby was ridiculous.</p><p>Shortly after, our pilot arrived. His reassuring smile calmed me a little, and after we went through the usual precautionary safety and emergency instructions, I decided he seemed competent enough. I didn\u2019t know if my fear was written across my forehead or whether Jett had mentioned something to him, but he assured me he had thirty years of flying experience. And then my decision was made.</p><p>Jett helped me to get into the helicopter and the pilot handed us both aviation headsets. As he switched on a few buttons, my head started to hurt and my heart began to beat so hard I feared it might be about to burst. Being afraid was an understatement. I was paralyzed to the spot, barely able to suck in one shaky breath after another. Sitting next to Jett, with him smiling at me in that confident way of his, I realized that agreeing to give this a try was pure madness. I opened my mouth to tell him I had changed my mind when the machine whirred to life and we began to take off. My nails dug into the seat because it was the only thing that felt real\u2014until Jett grabbed my hand. The warmth of his fingers seeped into my skin, soothing me, reminding me that he was here for me. Whether I wanted it or not, I had to trust his word that everything would be okay.</p><p>Jett had promised that the trip would be over in twenty minutes. And it was, down to the exact minute, even though it felt like an eternity. During our flight, the pilot showed us the breathtaking scenery New York City\u2019s skyline had to offer. As we soared above the Hudson River and flew right by the magnificent Statue of Liberty, my awe, eventually, grew bigger than my fear. Looking down at the high buildings, the lines of vehicles, and the small dots that I assumed were people, I couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that we had been transferred to a different dimension where reality had become fantasy, and the ordinary had turned into the extraordinary.</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyes connected with mine. \u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d he whispered, the deep baritone of his voice barely audible over the engine\u2019s whirring. Only then did I notice that I had tightened my grip on his arm. I let go quickly and placed my hands on the armrests, my knuckles turning white as I clutched at them for support.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I nodded just in case my thin voice betrayed my lie.</p><p>The helicopter dipped low over the beach. Gazing out the window, I realized that, being rich, Jett had probably seen it all before, and that everything he did\u2014he was doing it for me. To our left stretched out the city. To our right was nothing but sparkling water. The sun was shining, heating my frozen insides and melting my core. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t the heat, but the way Jett kept regarding me, his thumb stroking my skin, his fingers interlacing with mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jett\u2019s arm wrapped around my shoulders, and he pulled me to his chest. Too late did I realize why. My pulse pounded hard and my stomach turned as the helicopter hit a downdraft, and then the pilot descended. I closed my eyes, sending a short prayer to any higher power out there. Jett laughed, but the sound barely registered with me. My back was slick with sweat and my legs felt so weak I thought I might faint on the spot. And then the helicopter hit the ground with a soft thud, and the pilot switched off the engine.</p><p>I opened my eyes warily, not quite trusting the sudden silence. Jett was staring at me with an irritating grin on his lips. I glared at him and grabbed his outstretched hand as he helped me up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say a word,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to.\u201d He laughed, which was worse than words.</p> <p>My limbs continued to shake, and I felt oddly lightheaded as he helped me out of the helicopter. With a sigh of relief, I stepped foot onto solid ground, thankful that it was over. We were still alive, and for that I was tempted to kiss the ground beneath my feet. The pilot said his goodbye and took off, leaving Jett and me alone.</p><p>\u201cYou did great.\u201d Jett grabbed his bag from the floor and hung it around his shoulder. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live so I guess\u2014\u201d I shrugged. Maybe it was the happiness at the prospect of having made it out alive that urged me to tell the truth, or maybe it was the adrenaline coursing through my veins, but for some reason I felt at the top of the world. \u201cTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>Jett cocked a brow. \u201cYou\u2019d do it again?\u201d</p><p>I snorted.</p> <p>Hell, no.</p><p>Reading my mortified expression, he let out a deep rumble that resembled a laugh. \u201cI know you, and you\u2019re changed, baby. Do it again, and you\u2019ll never want to step foot out of this thing.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, fighting hard to come up with a kickass comeback. But Jett was right. Something in me had changed. I was proud of myself. And while I\u2019d be scared to get into a helicopter again, deep down I knew I\u2019d do it.</p><p>Who would have thought that I, the most responsible person I knew, had a danger-seeking bone in my body? I had to take a picture, because Sylvie would never believe it otherwise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that different from a plane, right?\u201d Jett said, grilling me, winding me up, waiting to drop the \u201cI told you so\u201d bomb. I ignored the amused look on his face and shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you can\u2019t compare them. When we hit the turbulence, I felt like I was the one holding up the chopper by the armrest.\u201d I scanned the area of the heliport. \u201cBy the way, where are we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the Hamptons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d What the heck where we doing there? I opened my mouth to ask when Jett held up his hand to silence me.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Miss Stewart. I have big plans for us.\u201d Touching the small of my back, Jett guided me across the platform to a door and down the stairs until we reached the lower level and a reception area, where a man in his thirties was waiting.</p><p>\u201cSir. Ma\u2019am.\u201d He held out his hand as he saw us approaching.</p><p>Jett shook it and whispered to me, \u201cHe\u2019s our driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he taking us?\u201d</p><p>Jett winked. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I grumbled but didn\u2019t comment as I followed him to our waiting limousine.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>TEN MINUTES LATER, the driver let us out in front of a huge Renaissance property with Greek-style columns and a stone pavement leading to an arched front door. The kind of mansion that screamed high society and celebrities, luxury and buying stuff no one needs. The kind of mansion that can only be found portrayed in magazines alongside a multi-million-dollar price tag. While I had seen it all before during my visit to the Lucazzone estate, this was different. Even though I loved the estate in Italy, with its magnificent backyard and the vastness of its rooms, it paled in comparison to the cream-colored building in front of us.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMagnificent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to one of our clients.\u201d Jett held out his hand and I placed my palm in his, our fingers connecting. \u201cMay I invite you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I stifled the giggle forming at the back of my throat at hearing his Southern accent so pronounced. It was strange, because usually he tried his best to hide it.</p><p>He pulled a set of keys out of his pocket and dangled it in front of my face. \u201cIt\u2019s ours for the night.\u201d</p><p>Ah, the night. I swallowed hard at the sudden blast of heat running through my body.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what made me ask such a question.</p><p>\u201cYou mean \u2018she\u2019? No, she doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s been empty for months because the price she\u2019s asking is ridiculously high and no one wants to buy it. I told her, but she won\u2019t listen.\u201d He trailed off for a moment, as though annoyed that someone would not listen to his expert opinion. He was an expert when it came to prime real estate, so the owner was probably an idiot. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Jett continued, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we take a tour around this place?\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand to stop him before he unlocked the door. \u201cJett, we can\u2019t stay in a property that we\u2019re supposed to sell. It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>His intent gaze fixed on me, and for a moment I thought I caught a hint of amusement in his eyes. \u201cWhy not? We\u2019re here to get a feel for it so we can come up with the right sales pitch. How else are we supposed to flock it off if we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>Jett unlocked the door and entered to switch off the silent alarm. I didn\u2019t move from the spot until he peered out again with a quizzical look. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable with this. What if she finds out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives in Florida and asked me to personally take care of it.\u201d He winked. \u201cWhich I\u2019m doing\u2014literally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the neighbors see us?\u201d</p><p>He pulled me inside and closed the door behind me. It closed with a loud bang. I regarded him, shocked by his boldness. Jett dropped the bag and turned to face me.</p><p>\u201cWho says we can\u2019t?\u201d His eyes had that dangerous look I had first glimpsed the day we had sex on the beach. The one that always promised a sizzling time. The one that didn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. \u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re her realtors, Brooke, and it\u2019s in her contract that we enter the house in her absence at our convenience. And second, what are you afraid of?\u201d He raised my chin, and his lips came so close I could feel his sexy breath as his voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cAfter I win, I get to choose where and how I take you. What if I want it here? Will you deny me?\u201d</p><p>His finger curled around the buttons of my business jacket as he opened them one by one. One button and then another until my thin blouse was exposed. \u201cWhat if I told you that the only reason I brought you here is to have sex in the pool, on the beach, in the backyard, or on the pool table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your honesty. But it doesn\u2019t matter, Jett, because you haven\u2019t won yet.\u201d It took all my willpower to push his hand from under my blouse.</p><p>\u201cHaving you twenty-four hours just for myself sounds too tempting to let you win. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople who reach too far are the ones who fall from the greatest height.\u201d My smile matched his cocky grin, when all I wanted was to get this over and done with so we could have sex, anywhere, everywhere.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant people like me never fail.\u201d</p><p>Seriously, his ego was so inflated it was beyond me how he could possibly squeeze it through the door. I rolled my eyes at his arrogance and walked past him, taking the place in. We were standing in an opulent foyer with candelabras and a marble floor. In the middle was a staircase leading to the upper story. Behind it was an open door, through which I glimpsed the living room. Or what I assumed was the living room, because it was huge\u2014probably as large as an entire apartment floor in Brooklyn, with arched bay windows and a fireplace dominating the entire right wall. Jett showed me the upper floor with its five oversized bedrooms and bathrooms, and yet another lounge. Then we returned downstairs to inspect the landscaped backyard, the outdoor BBQ area, the in-house cinema, the 850-foot fitness area, the open-plan kitchen, and another leisure room. I had never seen so much opulence.</p><p>\u201cThis place is amazing. Why does she want to sell it?\u201d I said, back in the living room. We were sitting on the cream-colored leather couch facing the fireplace, drinking a glass of non-alcoholic red wine. The glass doors covered the entire wall, through which we could see the landscaped yard with its perfectly sculpted shrubs and blooming magnolias. It was so serene, the world outside forgotten. A tiny paradise just for us. Only it wasn\u2019t our paradise, and the poor owner didn\u2019t know we were intruding. I put the glass on the table and sat up straight, my back not touching the soft leather.</p><p>Jett shrugged. \u201cPeople change their opinion all the time. What they want isn\u2019t always what they need. And the moment they get what they want, it loses its spark.\u201d Jett shrugged again. \u201cShe bought the place when she was dating some musician, instantly assuming they would live here forever. When things didn\u2019t work out and she met someone else, she moved to Florida and forgot about the charm of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying she never lived here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe complained about the lack of space.\u201d</p><p>I almost choked on my breath. Lack of space?</p><p>Holy cow. Our entire neighborhood could live in here and barely see each other. I didn\u2019t want to be inquisitive, but my curiosity got the upper hand. I honestly needed to put a face to this place.</p><p>\u201cWho is she? Is it someone I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. It depends. Do you know Kim Dessen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim Dessen?\u201d My jaw dropped. \u201cWow. You have her as a client?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t just one of the biggest singer-songwriters in the word; she was a celebrity famous for going through guys like some people go through their underwear. Scratch that. She had more guys than people had underwear. A pang of jealousy hit me as I realized that someone as successful, well-known and beautiful as Kim knew Jett. Kim was stunning, and so was Jett. Two beautiful people born into wealth\u2014there had to be some sort of attraction because they both weren\u2019t blind.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know her personally? Like, met her?\u201d I tried to hide the tremor in my voice by forcing cheeriness into it, but I only ended up making it worse.</p><p>\u201cA couple of times. It\u2019s her fourth property I\u2019m selling.\u201d He shrugged as if it didn\u2019t matter. My heart dropped at the way he seemed to find the hardwood floor more interesting than me. He met with her at least four times. A lot could happen during four meetings. Like having drinks and ending up in a hotel room, their perfect bodies entangled in sweat-soaked sheets.</p><p>Uncomfortable silence ensued between us, during which I picked up a sparkling Swarovski crystal centerpiece from the coffee table and turned it to watch the sunlight catching in the delicate red roses. My gaze kept skidding back to Jett as my hands glided over the smooth glass. So fragile. So easily shattered. Just like my heart. One tumble was all it\u2019d take. Such as finding out he had slept with her. Even if it happened before we met, I had no idea how to deal with it. Women like Kim Dessen with Playboy model looks got what they wanted. I never knew how much I loved Jett until I realized the thought of him with someone else was enough to break my heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swallowed past the lump in my throat and put the centerpiece back in place.</p><p>\u201cDid you two\u2014\u201d My words trailed off, filling the void between us with unspoken indictment. It hadn\u2019t been my intention to make it sound like an accusation, but somehow it came off as such because, if Jett confirmed my suspicions, I couldn\u2019t stay in a house where he once had sex with someone else.</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyes narrowed on me and his jaw set. \u201cFuck, Brooke. She\u2019s just a client. I don\u2019t sleep with my clients.\u201d</p><p>I averted my gaze to hide my disbelief. He signed deals\u2014and a lot of them; he whisked off his clients to expensive restaurants and stunning vacation destinations. Did he really expect me to believe he and Kim never got intimate on such an occasion?</p> <p>He walked over to me. I could feel his hands on my shoulders as he turned me around so that I faced him, but I didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, just because I\u2019m a guy doesn\u2019t mean I sleep with anything walking on two legs. Kim\u2019s not even my type. No one is, except you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a question, Jett.\u201d</p><p>A question I would probably ask myself every time he met someone.</p><p>A question I would always be afraid to ask because I knew in my heart I didn\u2019t have the strength to handle the kind of answer I feared. As much as I wanted to believe every word he said, and as much as I loved him, I didn\u2019t trust life wouldn\u2019t send another woman his way\u2014someone more beautiful, better suited to his social status and lifestyle. Someone able to change his feelings for me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d I lied. My eyes met his gaze, imploring him to drop the topic because I didn\u2019t want to sound insecure. Insecurity wasn\u2019t an attractive trait.</p><p>\u201cI just wondered. That\u2019s all,\u201d I mumbled when he kept staring at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d His question was unexpected. I narrowed my eyes in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDo you, Brooke?\u201d</p><p>He moved closer, towering over me. Peering into my heart, his gaze lingered on me too long, making me nervous. He was so tall I had to lean all the way back to look into his green gaze. Green like a haunted forest reflecting the morning sun. So deep and dark I would have dipped my fingers in it to stain my soul. Because haunted he was\u2014we both were by our pasts\u2014only he knew better how to deal with it.</p> <p>As Jett regarded me, I could see the color of his eyes shifting\u2014the way it often did, depending on his mood. Lighter when he was tired. Darker when he was agitated or infuriated. I realized I was getting to know him. The real Jett. And right now he was downright angry.</p><p>\u201cDo you really trust me?\u201d His fingertips lingered on my cheek, cold as ice.</p><p>\u201cIn some way,\u201d I whispered. But did I? His expression challenged me to tell to truth. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know you\u2019re interested in me, and not in the estate. I also know you wouldn\u2019t betray my trust, but I feel there\u2019s a lot more to you. Hidden layers that I still have to get to know.\u201d</p><p>His face betrayed no emotions as he moistened his lips, carefully preparing his words. \u201cBrooke, I\u2019m not just into you...I\u2019m in this for the long haul. I dated others, but I always knew they weren\u2019t the real deal. That whatever attracted me to them would pass. With you, it\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I asked breathlessly.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou make me want to be a better person, and I cannot imagine a future without you.\u201d His voice lowered to a whisper. \u201cWe haven\u2019t known each other for long, but deep inside I feel like we understand each other. I feel like I\u2019ve been waiting for someone like you all my life. Besides, you make me think of sex nonstop and that\u2019s always a good sign.\u201d</p><p>I could feel myself blushing, my insides turning all warm and fuzzy. He wasn\u2019t the only one who couldn\u2019t stop thinking about sex.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your libido talking,\u201d I pointed out.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. You turn me on like I know I\u2019m turning you on. Your wet panties are proof enough.\u201d</p><p>His fingers brushed my neck, and then his lips gently touched the sensitive skin. His hot breath sent a delicious shiver through me. \u201cIf we\u2019re both honest with each another, if we trust one another and we mention whatever is on our mind rather than keep things buried, then nothing can go wrong in this relationship. We won\u2019t lose this.\u201d He pointed to the air between us. \u201cI won\u2019t let it happen. It doesn\u2019t matter what we once did and who we slept with, because they didn\u2019t matter and the knowledge is all that counts. That\u2019s all you, or I, ever need to know.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Of course. The mere mentioning of my ex was enough to make him jealous. If it upset him seeing me with others and he was ready to never ask, then it was time for me to let go of my dark thoughts. I couldn\u2019t expect from him something that I couldn\u2019t give in return.</p><p>\u201cI brought us here to spend time alone.\u201d His tone dropped to a sexy whisper again. \u201cAre you ready for our game?\u201d</p><p>I put on my poker face. \u201cYou bet. If I win, I want to go back to our apartment, and I want to torture you in your own walls. I\u2019ll tease you all night and drive you crazy until you beg for mercy.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNow, that sounds tempting, Miss Stewart. I like the idea of you punishing me. But to be honest, right now I like the idea of fucking you, in every possible position, even more. We\u2019re not going home today.\u201d</p><p>Holy cow. He looked like he meant it.</p><p>I laughed as he walked over to his black bag to retrieve a set of cards. And for the first time I wondered why he had brought such a huge bag. What was he hiding in there?</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>DAMN!</p><p>I was losing big time.</p><p>\u201cThis game sucks,\u201d I said. As much as I wanted to cross my arms over my chest to express my frustration, I first needed them to hide as much skin as possible. It wasn\u2019t because I was ashamed of my body. It was Jett\u2019s hungry stare that made me want to hide behind a curtain. I didn\u2019t need to ask him about his thoughts. I could see them written all over his face as he pondered all the things he wanted to do\u2014with me, to me.</p><p>Sitting inside the open pavilion in the backyard with barely any clothes on, I felt more exposed than ever.</p><p>Jett hadn\u2019t been kidding when he demanded we play our little game outside. I just didn\u2019t expect him to want it outside on private property\u2014he didn\u2019t own. In the yard, where anyone could see us lounging, laughing, and being competitive half-naked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sexy when you\u2019re pissed, Brooke.\u201d He grinned, and my heart melted a few inches. \u201cI promise when I win the last round, I\u2019ll consider going inside. If you ask nicely.\u201d</p><p>So far, he had won five rounds straight in a row, each time giving me a chance to \u201credeem myself and get a chance to win the twenty-four hours of pure sex\u201d by winning the next round, which he ended up winning...again.</p><p>If I could have wiped the smug smile off his face, I would have. With every loss, Jett requested that I remove one piece of clothing, and with every protective layer removed, his smug grin widened. He had already removed my shoes, socks, business suit, and bra...oh, God. Was he sniffing my blouse?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I asked, mortified, fighting the urge to snag my blouse from his hands.</p><p>\u201cSmelling the scent of success. I\u2019m giving you one more chance, baby. You know six is my favorite number. It\u2019s my lucky number.\u201d He winked, just in case I didn\u2019t get his drift. \u201cIf I win one more time, I have to remove your panties and get to do what I want to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop bragging, Mayfield.\u201d I pulled up my legs to my chest so I could rest my head on my knees and hide my smile. To call my pink sheer thong \u201cpanties\u201d was ridiculous when it was so tiny and see-through you could see all the way to Alaska.</p><p>He sniffed my blouse again.</p><p>\u201cGive me that.\u201d I leaped up to snag my top out of his hands, covering my exposed breasts in the process. Jett evaded my assault, laughing, as his gaze focused on the sides of my breasts where they seemed to spill out of my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou smell amazing, baby. Like a summer dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called perfume.\u201d</p><p>He took another sniff, then pointed to my tiny thong. \u201cWhatever it is, I\u2019m sure what I\u2019m going to smell next is even better.\u201d</p><p>I scowled. \u201cI can still win.\u201d</p><p>He laughed out loud as he shuffled the cards. \u201cYou keep saying that after each lost round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this nonsense over and done with,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it used to be your favorite game?\u201d He could barely hide his wicked grin as he pulled playfully at one of my curls. \u201cSounds like someone is a sore loser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d I protested.</p><p>I was. Big time.</p><p>But I was nowhere near ready to admit that to him, and particularly not when I didn\u2019t expect him to win. My father used to say I was the best Spades player. I hadn\u2019t lost in years. I knew I was being childish, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. That annoying grin of his was driving me nuts, which in turn managed to make me bold and careless, taking risks I wouldn\u2019t usually have taken. What drove me even more crazy was the fact that he always seemed to know my next move. The idea of having sex with him in a stranger\u2019s house filled me with shame because it was immoral. I had to win, just for the sake of stopping him from turning me into a mirror image of his wanton, sex-starved self. I wasn\u2019t going to lose my morals.</p><p>\u201cYou have one more chance.\u201d He kissed my shoulders, his hot breath both arousing and irritating me. \u201cI\u2019ll let you win if it makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, no cheating. I\u2019ll beat you fair and square. And then we\u2019ll go back to your apartment. Because there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever sleep with you in a stranger\u2019s house. But let me guess, you\u2019d only let me win if I agreed to do it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case, I\u2019m not changing my plans.\u201d I drew a long breath and let it out slowly, imploring my mind to focus on the game rather than Jett\u2019s presence and his lips on my skin.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d He winked. \u201cLuckily, I won\u2019t have to, which makes this round even hotter.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at his inflated ego.</p><p>Maybe this time I was lucky. Nobody could win six times in a row. It was impossible. Right?</p><p>One win was all it\u2019d take to have my say and take control of the situation.</p><p>Just one out of seven. The odds weren\u2019t so bad.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Jett asked. He was sitting in a wicker chair, relaxed, as he surveyed me the way someone would look at potential prey. His gaze brushed over my neck, my exposed breasts, then moved up to my lips. He was clearly relishing his pre-coital fantasies, unleashing roaring chaos inside me with just a glance. So sure of himself, which made me nervous and unable to think.</p><p>Damn, I needed my brain to work\u2014and fast\u2014before it was too late.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be great if you were naked, too,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI can\u2019t focus.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ll be able to focus once I\u2019m naked?\u201d He laughed. \u201cSure, baby.

Then let me help you feel more at ease.\u201d He grinned and undid the top button of his shirt. My eyes followed his fingers, drinking in each movement, as he unbuttoned his shirt all the way down\u2014slowly as if he had all the time in the world, revealing rows of toned muscle. My gaze lingered on the tribal tattoo on his upper arm before moving to his chiseled chest and the narrow trail of hair on his abdomen.</p><p>He was pure perfection.</p> <p>Forget perfection\u2014he was a god, sent into the world to mentally torture women with his impossibly sexy body.</p><p>I swallowed hard and clenched my legs together to hide the betraying signs of my arousal. It took every ounce of my willpower to fight the need to close my eyes for a second, just to escape the film playing inside my mind. His lips on mine. Our bodies entwined, moving in accord, pleasuring the other as we sought our own release. I groaned inwardly. Why did I have to tell him to take off his clothes? I should have known better.</p><p>He dropped the shirt on the floor.</p><p>Not your brightest idea, Stewart.</p><p>Knowing too well the effect he had on me, Jett sat back in his chair, his gaze lingering on me, and I could\u2019ve sworn I could see the sex movie playing before his eyes, too. A sharp electric shock ran down my spine and gathered in my abdomen, sending delicious jolts through my private parts.</p> <p>Focus, Stewart. He wants you to lose. That\u2019s why he\u2019s piling on the sex appeal. Why the hell did you give him the idea?</p><p>\u201cYou know there are many ways we could play this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Pure awesomeness came to my mind.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I asked casually. It was my turn to draw a card. Two of spades. I decided to keep it.</p><p>\u201cYou could give up, and I\u2019d take it easy on you. I\u2019d even agree to spending half a day here and the other half back in NY. Deal?\u201d</p><p>He was about to lose. For some reason I could feel it. This was my chance. I peered at my cards, confident.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, but no.\u201d I looked up, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou sure, baby? It\u2019s your last chance,\u201d Jett said, grinning back.</p><p>I could see right through his bluff.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no way you could possibly win this one.\u201d</p><p>He did win. A couple of minutes later, I tossed my cards on the table.</p><p>Crap!</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what went wrong. It might be the way Jett was sitting, so confident and sexy with half his body exposed. Or maybe it was the way he looked at me, his eyes already making plans what he\u2019d do to me. Or maybe\u2014and I\u2019d never admit that to him\u2014he was the better player. Luckier, too. Whatever it was, I was screwed.</p><p>Jett stretched out his long legs, obviously enjoying every second of his glory. I figured I\u2019d never get men and their competitive alpha behavior.</p> <p>I shook my head in disbelief. \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called motivation\u201d\u2014his eyes sparkled\u2014\u201cto get laid. Seems I want it more than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up. \u201cYou doubt I want to sleep with you more than you want with me?\u201d</p><p>Heat shot up my neck and face. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He began to laugh, and I clamped my mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cI know you were talking about my strategy,\u201d Jett said. \u201cI could teach you my technique. In fact, I can teach a lot of things, Miss Stewart. Things you never experienced before.\u201d</p><p>Holy mother of double meanings.</p><p>My heart jumped in my chest as I watched Jett get up and reach me in one step.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re mine for the night and I get to do whatever I want with you?\u201d he continued in that unfazed voice of his.</p><p>Too cool. Too confident. Too much of everything.</p><p>Why the heck did I think I could ever deal with a man like him? If it wasn\u2019t for our unborn child, I might have run.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>Because he was like a drug, and I was addicted to him.</p><p>I nodded, barely able to peel my gaze off his sculpted and very naked chest.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what\u2019s in store tonight?\u201d He kneeled before me, hands resting on both sides of me, and our eyes connected. I pressed a hand against my pounding heart. Did I have an idea? No, but it sounded sexy and forbidden. Whatever it was, I\u2019d take it.</p><p>\u201cMay I have the pleasure?\u201d Without waiting for my approval, his fingers moved up my legs, putting just the right amount of pressure. A whiplash of electric pulses rushed through me. Gently he pushed my legs apart. My breath came heavy as he started to kiss my knees, then his way up the inside of my legs.</p><p>His lips caressed my sensitive skin, working upward closer and closer to the growing wetness between my legs. I could feel the need inside me growing as he kissed my thong, his tongue running over the damp spot.</p><p>In spite of the layer of fabric separating his hot lips from my pulsating clit, the sensation was stronger than I ever imagined it to be. I closed my eyes and a soft moan escaped my throat...when he stopped. Opening my eyes, I glanced down, confused. Jett opened his bag but held it away from me so I couldn\u2019t glimpse what was inside. He caught my interested glance but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>Excitement rushed through me at the though of him taking charge. He had done it before. Only, the bag made me nervous because, for some reason, it kick-started my imagination, pushing it to run wild with images of sex toys and kinky lingerie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a masochist, are you?\u201d I tried to read his cryptic expression and failed. \u201cBecause if you are, we need a safe word. And you should know in advance that I\u2019m not into spanking, choking, in fact anything that involves unbearable pain.\u201d</p><p>He looked up, his green eyes full of mischief. \u201cPain wasn\u2019t quite part of my plans.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit!</p><p>What did he mean with \u201cquite\u201d and \u201cplans?\u201d</p><p>I would have given anything to know his plans, yet his reply was as cryptic as his expression. I grimaced but didn\u2019t pursue the issue. Eventually, he retrieved a timer from his bag and placed it on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Jett pressed a red button, and the timer started to count backward.</p><p>Twenty-three hours. Fifty-nine minutes. Fifty-nine seconds.</p><p>The seconds began to tick by as my nerves began to fray. I clasped my hands in my lap, unsure what to do.</p><p>\u201cBack inside you said you trusted me.\u201d Jett\u2019s statement took me by surprise.</p><p>\u201cI did. Why are you asking?\u201d I frowned as I watched him pull out a sheet of paper from his bag and pass it on to me.</p><p>\u201cThose are the rules.\u201d</p><p>I almost choked on my breath. \u201cSeriously? You have sex rules?\u201d Why was I even surprised? This was the same guy who demanded a nondisclosure contract before sleeping with me.</p><p>\u201cI do because I\u2019ve won you for the night, which is why I\u2019m setting the rules. So consider yourself obligatorily at my mercy.\u201d His smile was gone now, replaced by a dead-seriousness. I had never been at a man\u2019s mercy, and I didn\u2019t know how to feel about it.</p><p>I swallowed past the lump in my throat as my eyes began to scan the computer printout.</p><p>RULES</p><p>1. The losing party agrees to keep the phone switched off at all times.</p><p>2. The losing party agrees to shower and dress in the winner\u2019s preferred outfit to look most enticing in accordance with the winning party\u2019s wishes.</p><p>3. The losing party agrees to be willing to experiment with new things in accordance with the winning party\u2019s wishes.</p><p>4. The losing party agrees to pay maximum effort to both reaching and causing physical pleasure.</p><p>5. The losing party agrees not to discuss the events happening on this day with any third party.</p><p>6. A change in Terms is to be suggested in written form through a recognized lawyer. The winning party reserves the right to decline any and all suggestions made by the losing party.</p><p>7. The winning party can\u2019t be held responsible for any strong reactions experienced as a result of this game and its rules and implications.</p><p>My eyes widened at the words losing...enticing...commands...not to be discussed...strong reactions.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I repeated for the second time. \u201cYou know, this looks kind of formal, not to mention creepy.\u201d</p><p>On the bright side it wasn\u2019t an agreement to having some kind of depraved sex that might\u2019ve scared the hell out of me. It was short and to the point\u2014and absolutely non-descriptive. I was as clueless as I had been before.</p><p>I pointed to paragraph six. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for me to suggest anything in written form because there\u2019s no lawyer around and I\u2019m bound to the house. By the time we get back to New York, your twenty-four hours might be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI thought I should make it sound like you had any say in the matter.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced again. \u201cHow kind of you to think of me. Why don\u2019t you also throw in some feedback form? You know, the kind I could submit after you\u2019re done with me.\u201d My voice dripped with sarcasm, and he laughed out loud.</p><p>As I handed the rule sheet back to him, his finger touched mine and a spark ignited between us, traveling all the way down my spine and into my abdomen. I flinched and my eyes connected with his, searching for a clue that he had felt it as well. His expression remained as composed as always.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to sign over my soul?\u201d I asked, joking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tempting offer, Brooke. I might indeed take you up on it later to make sure you\u2019ll always be mine. But for now all I want is the chase.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the shirt next to me, and I threw it to him. He caught it in midair and I watched him pull it on again, almost regretful.</p><p>\u201cGo take a shower and get dressed.\u201d Jett opened his bag again, and this time I caught a glimpse of a white gift box, which he handed to me. \u201cI want you to wear that.\u201d</p><p>The box was surprisingly light for its size. Curious, I opened it and retrieved a sexy red and black set of lingerie, a pair of matching high heels, a satin robe that\u2019d barely cover my ass, and...were those stockings?</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d I held up the narrow strip of fabric I assumed was a thong but I couldn\u2019t be sure because it was the skimpiest I had ever seen. It was sexy, made of mesh and chiffon, and left nothing to the imagination. \u201cYou expect me to wear this?\u201d Somehow the thought made me excited.</p><p>Jett nodded slowly. \u201cAs I said, yes. My game, my rules.\u201d The corners of his lips curled into a lazy smile. \u201cEver since I set my eyes on you in that bar, I\u2019ve been wanting to see you in something like this. Can you blame a man for living out his fantasy?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t. I just wished it didn\u2019t involve prancing around a stranger\u2019s home half naked.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>AS PER JETT\u2019S request, I first took a shower. Under the hot water running down my body, the tension in my muscles slowly subsided, but my thoughts of being an uninvited guest in this mansion weren\u2019t so easy to switch off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bathroom was as large as a bedroom, and pure luxury, with a huge Jacuzzi to fit several people and a TV set mounted on the wall. The tiny lights in the ceiling reflected in the black marble tiles, making them sparkle like huge diamonds. I stepped out of the shower and wrapped a towel around my naked body, then went about cleaning up after myself to restore the bathroom\u2019s previous pristine condition. Sylvie used to call it OCD, but whenever something bothered me, I cleaned. And right now what bothered me was the prospect of having sex in a stranger\u2019s house.</p><p>By the time I changed into Jett\u2019s idea of lingerie, the thought of having sex with him in this mansion both scared and excited me. Even though I didn\u2019t want to admit it, my body was wet and ready for him. It wasn\u2019t just the prospect of doing something illegal. It was the idea of doing another first with him. Letting him be in control the way I had never surrendered to him before. Having to trust Jett knew what he was doing, when I had a strong feeling the house had at least one or two hidden cameras installed.</p><p>I slipped into the bra and barely there thong, rolled up the stockings, and tried to get a feel for the high heels. The robe hugged my figure in all the right places and, as expected, barely covered my modesty. The black high heels with straps made my legs look a mile high. I ran my hands through my hair to give my curls some definition and applied a tiny bit of lipstick. Pleased with the result, I regarded myself in the huge mirror. I looked sexy and felt just the same. This was the kind of outfit that would make any woman look hot. Whoever advised Jett on what to buy sure knew their way around lingerie. Only, walking in those heels required some skill. Right in front of the window was a narrow strip of white sand\u2014prime private beach. I wondered if Jett would insist on taking a walk? If so, I hoped I didn\u2019t have to wear the heels, because they were so high I doubted I could take more than a few strides in them, let alone enjoy an evening stroll. With a last glance, I left the bathroom and joined Jett in the master bedroom, where he\u2019d said he\u2019d be waiting.</p><p>As I stepped inside, partly nervous, partly excited, my breath caught in my throat. He had spread a black satin cover on the sheets and red candles were arranged on the nightstand, their soft glow giving the room a romantic flair. The delicate scent of roses hung heavy in the air.</p> <p>\u201cYou look stunning.\u201d Jett\u2019s voice was hoarse. I turned sharply and found him standing to my right, obscured by a massive dresser. His hands were buried in his pockets, his sleeves rolled up to reveal his strong forearms. His eyes scanned my high heels, my stockings, my half-exposed breasts, wandering farther up until his gaze met mine, and a smile lit up his face. There was something in his eyes\u2014a glimmer I had seen before, only I couldn\u2019t remember where.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered, unsure what to do with myself. \u201cYou have good taste, albeit a bit kinky.\u201d I pointed down my front.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head and walked over to me. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Brooke. Everything would look amazing on you.\u201d</p><p>My glance swept back over the candles, to their soft flickering glow, the king sized bed, then back to Jett, all the while ignoring the one thing that scared the hell out of me. I had never done tying up and we barely knew each other. While I trusted him, I didn\u2019t know whether I trusted him that much. His previous questioning of my level of trust made so much more sense now.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t strike me as this kind of guy.\u201d I shrugged and pointed around me, as though it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI thought you would go for outdoor, daring. I don\u2019t know. I just thought you would be more\u2014\u201d I trailed off, looking for the right words. He regarded me intently, but didn\u2019t help me out.</p><p>Romantic? Daring? He had been all of those things so far, including the exhibitionistic outdoorsy type. I just didn\u2019t expect\u2014</p><p>Bondage.</p><p>Being tied and at someone else\u2019s mercy. Holy cow. When I had made that joke on the need of establishing a \u201csafe word\u201d I couldn\u2019t have been closer to the truth.</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyes narrowed on me. \u201cNothing wrong with variety. At least I\u2019m experiencing it with one and the same woman. I can\u2019t claim the same thing for many men.\u201d His tone was half accusing, half amused. \u201cBut I guess you\u2019re right to some extent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know half of the things you should know about me. This\u2014\u201d he pointed to the candles \u201c\u2014is meant to set the mood and relax you. Nothing more and nothing less.\u201d</p><p>What the heck did that even mean? That it wasn\u2019t his style? That he wouldn\u2019t have done it, if he didn\u2019t feel a need to make me feel comfortable?</p><p>My stomach fluttered and my mouth went dry as I watched him walk across the room with slow measured steps. His feet were naked, barely making a sound on the hardwood floor. His eyes remained focused on me, and for the umpteenth time I felt like his prey, scared but hypnotized, waiting for him capture or release me. Tonight I harbored no false hope that it would be the latter.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here for the night. We could get in big trouble,\u201d I protested weakly.</p><p>He stopped in front of me, and his arm wrapped around my waist. At first I thought it was to caress my back. Only when his fingers trailed up my spine and gathered in my hair did I feel the gentle pull, urging me to raise my head and meet his burning lips.</p><p>It was a gentle kiss, his lips barely grazing mine.</p><p>\u201cMy rules.\u201d He spun me around slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here. I\u2019m teaching you to break a few rules.\u201d His gaze brushed my lips with such hunger it sent a tingle through them. \u201cI\u2019ll love you in any way I want. I\u2019ll love you in any way you need. As long as we stay here, baby, you\u2019re mine.\u201d He grinned as he pulled me down on the bed. \u201cYou had your chance to win. Not my fault you didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>I had wanted to, but I had been too weak to make it happen. Or maybe, on an unconscious level, I had wanted to surrender to him. Either way, I was at his mercy, and he knew it.</p> <p>\u201cStop rubbing it in, Mayfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you admit you like when I\u2019m in charge?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not into all that submission crap,\u201d I muttered. Giving up control was kind of nice every now and then, but he didn\u2019t need to know that, or I\u2019d live to regret it. Jett had the unnerving tendency to get a little too intense, like with this game. He couldn\u2019t just establish that he was the better player by winning and shutting up about it; he had to translate his dominance into our lovemaking and risk criminal charges by breaking a few laws in the process.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you\u2019d do it without putting up a good fight.\u201d He raised my leg and started to trail soft kisses on the inside, the movement sending a delicious shiver through me.</p><p>I suppressed a moan as his lips kissed my inner thigh. His tongue started to draw small swirls on my skin, inch by inch moving down toward my knee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be your best, Brooke,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I had no doubt about that.</p><p>Slowly, he peeled off my high heel and dropped it near the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo one will ever love you more than I do,\u201d Jett continued. The second high heel hit the floor with a thud.</p><p>Intense? Yes, but I loved it.</p><p>My heart raced as his attention shifted to my other thigh and he proceeded to torture my body. His teeth grated my skin gently and turned into soft bites.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I followed his command, anticipating his next move. Something silky tickled my skin. I opened my eyes and looked down at the ties in Jett\u2019s hand and the naughty glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre those yours from the apartment?\u201d I asked, sitting up. He pressed me back down.</p><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re just right for this particular purpose.\u201d He stretched the material, conjuring images of punishment, whipping, and bondage inside my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hot mouth stifled my protest and his hands pulled my arms over my head. I could feel the silky fabric first on my left wrist, then around the right. I pulled gently, and then with a little more fervor as I realized I was being bound to the bedpost.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cI\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, even though my heart was beating a million miles an hour, and not from the sexual tension in the air. The smooth material felt cool against my skin. Sexy. Erotic. Menacing.</p><p>\u201cThis was actually my idea. You realize that, right?\u201d I laughed nervously. \u201cI told you what I\u2019d do to you if I won, and now you\u2019re claiming it as your own.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up in mock offence. \u201cAre you implying I\u2019m stealing your ideas, Miss Stewart?\u201d He shifted his weight off of me and moved to my ankles. My breath caught in my throat as I realized what he was about to do.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m implying I have no free hand to help you.\u201d I hoped he got the hint and untied me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing just fine but thanks for offering.\u201d</p><p>He grinned with the kind of glint in his eyes that said he harbored no intentions to follow my unspoken request. In fact, he was going to tease me and tease me hard. I wondered where he was heading. The tie brushed my skin, the cold satin against my ankles sending shivers of delight up my body.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep on talking?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause right now I\u2019m thinking of shutting your sexy little mouth so I can follow through with my plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat plans?\u201d At his displeased expression, I halted the hundreds of questions inside my head. I had been talking again. I always was when I was nervous. \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>He shifted back on top of me and propped up on his elbows, his mouth so close to mine I wanted to reach up and suck his lower lip between my teeth.</p><p>\u201cDirty plans. I\u2019m going to ravish you until you can\u2019t get me out of your system. There are a million ways to make you come and I\u2019m planning on testing each and every one of them. But first you\u2019ll need to be\u2014\u201d He lifted the last tie to show me.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>I lifted my head so he could blindfold me.</p><p>The sudden darkness, his hot breath on my neck, and the weight of his body on me made my heart pound harder. It was so dark I couldn\u2019t see a damn thing and the idea both scared and aroused me. My legs were spread wide open, inviting him to do whatever he wanted to me. What was he doing? Why didn\u2019t he move? I bit my lip hard to stop the need to ask.</p><p>I could feel his gaze on me, caressing my body, making my skin tingle all over. I could sense the smile on his lips but couldn\u2019t read his intentions.</p><p>\u201cI want to fuck you,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cSlowly. Recklessly. Teasingly. However I feel like doing it. In all possible ways. Scream as loud as you want because no one will hear you. And I want you to scream, baby.\u201d</p><p>His fingers began to trail my abdomen, gathering between my legs. I felt him prodding me, spreading my gathering juices. Tied and in a stranger\u2019s house, I was open for him. My senses heightened, my primal instincts asking to be filled. His finger slipped inside me slowly. I moaned and lifted my hips, welcoming the sensation, drawing him deeper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he whispered.

I frowned as I listened to his footsteps walking across the room, Jett picking something up, then laying back down on the bed.</p><p>Something rustled.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d His sharp tone left no room for discussion. My heart pounded frantically against my ribcage. I swallowed hard but didn\u2019t follow his command.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Brooke.\u201d His deep voice dripped with impatience.</p> <p>This was his chance to prove he loved me and would never hurt me\u2014his chance to earn my trust. I had to take the plunge to see it for myself. So I opened my mouth and in that instant I knew I did far more than trust him. My passion for him was big, but my love for him was bigger. I wanted to please him because when I lost my heart to him, I also gave away my vulnerability. I surrendered to him and he conquered me\u2014body and soul. Trust was the only thing left to give freely. The only thing we could earn, the only thing we are still learning.</p><p>Something sticky hit my tongue. Sweet, soft and creamy like chocolate.</p><p>\u201cBite,\u201d Jett instructed.</p><p>I bit and sucked, then swallowed and opened my mouth again, realizing it was chocolate transitioning from a rich cocoa flavor to an intense, sweet hazelnut cream. His mouth descended upon mine again, the chocolate melting between our tongues.</p><p>I moaned because it was delicious.</p> <p>His kiss was heavenly chocolate melting delicious.</p><p>Heat gathered between my legs and my clit began to pulse gently, silently demanding attention. As though reading my thoughts, Jett\u2019s mouth left me and began to move down my chest and abdomen as something cold and sticky poured between my legs, trickling down my entry.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cChocolate.\u201d I could hear his amusement and it drove me nuts that I couldn\u2019t see his expression. His hot breath traveled down my abdomen, and then his tongue touched the right spot, the sensation of licking and sucking sending my pulse into a frenzy. My nipples peaked for him, urging him to touch them, but his attention was focused elsewhere.</p><p>More chocolate dripped down my skin\u2014so much I was sure he was using the whole tube, smearing it all over the bed, when I remembered the spread. He had thought of everything. I made a mental note to give him credit for that, but the thought was short-lived because his tongue began to swirl in a circular motion, and his finger found my entry, filling and stretching.</p><p>Oh, God.</p> <p>I was dying.</p><p>Scratch that.</p><p>I was dying and going straight to heaven.</p><p>Or maybe he was my downfall and I was going to hell.</p><p>I moaned and switched off my brain as heat began to pool into my abdomen. His finger thrust inside me, twisting and circling as his lips sucked my clit so hard my whole body reacted. Moisture gathered between my legs, spread by his fingers thrusting rhythmically until I reached the brink of lust. From there it was a mere step into total surrender.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good,\u201d I moaned. \u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love when you demand,\u201d he whispered. \u201cChocolate and your juices. It\u2019s my favorite combination.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks caught fire, but I had no time to feel mortified because his teeth began to graze my clit, sucking gently.</p> <p>And then his mouth was back on my lips. One hand squeezed beneath the nape of my neck, the other lifted my leg. In one swift movement he slammed inside me, his thick erection burning its way deep into my core. The bed shook, or maybe it was my body as he began to crash into me. I didn\u2019t care that we were spreading chocolate all over the sheets. I wanted him. I wanted every bit of what he had to offer. I moved my hips to meet his thrusts, listened to the sexy noises coming out of his hot mouth as his thrusts became deeper and faster. Hot waves of heat rocked my abdomen, promising to erupt in a raging fire.</p><p>I lifted my hips to give him deeper access, and more he took. Feeling every hard inch impaling my flesh, I lost reason, consumed by his passion for me. The hot flames of a nearing orgasm began to build inside my womb, and my body rocked with the first tremors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn addicting. Like a narcotic.\u201d His hips pushed his erection deep into me in fast short thrusts. He was close. I could feel his shudders, and my clit ached in response, desperate for relief.</p><p>In darkness, I moaned and lifted off the bed as far as my restraints would allow, my mouth searching his. Our tongues connected in a fast erotic dance mirroring the movement of his hips, sending electrical shards of pleasure through my heart and soul. Jett\u2019s fingers pressed against my clit hard, the sudden sensation unbearable. I gasped against his mouth. My soft flesh tightened around his hard shaft, and I came undone around him, faintly aware of Jett\u2019s groan of fulfillment tearing from his chest.</p><p>My skin sizzled with electricity as our bodies merged into one, over and over again, until there was nothing more to give. Exhausted, I slumped against the sheets and closed my eyes. Fingers removed my restraints and blindfold. Jett pulled me against his hot body and wrapped his arms around me. The intoxicating scent of chocolate and our lovemaking was my last conscious thought.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>AN HOUR LATER, my fingers traced the contours of his tribal tattoo. It was a gang thing, he once explained, and part of his former life. He had done so many things, seen the world from different perspectives, and in some way touching it was my chance to connect with some aspect of it.</p><p>I watched the light of the candles reflected on his bronze skin and wondered for the umpteenth time whether I might ever know him\u2014the real him, the parts he so carefully kept hidden.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sleeping beauty?\u201d Jett asked, sensing my emotional undercurrents.</p><p>I shook my head and took a deep breath to clear my thoughts. \u201cNothing.\u201d I knew he wouldn\u2019t drop it, so I said the first thing that came to my mind. \u201cI just realized I never had sex in a puddle of chocolate before. It\u2019s kind of strange to wake up surrounded by the scent of chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way, and I\u2019m glad you were the one to experience it with.\u201d He kissed the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cHope I\u2019ll get to return the favor one day. That\u2019s if I ever win one of your games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>I hated to be away from him, but some needs couldn\u2019t be ignored. \u201cI need to visit a certain room,\u201d I said with an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He moved aside, but his grip didn\u2019t let go of me immediately. \u201cBe back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I whispered, and left for the bathroom. After a quick shower, I wrapped myself in an oversized towel and decided to borrow Kim\u2019s hairdryer. It usually took me a while to get my hair dry, courtesy of my unruly curls, so I left it half damp before Jett got bored and kicked in the door. Not that he had ever done that, but he was on a schedule, so I figured he might have a few more plans lined up before his twenty-four hours were up.</p><p>I shrugged into the robe again, ignoring just how short it was in the bathroom light. Knowing Jett\u2019s appetite, I reckoned we probably wouldn\u2019t venture far from the bedroom, so no one beside Jett would ever see my ass. With a last glance in the mirror, I stepped out of the bathroom and stopped dead.</p><p>The first thing I noticed was the light streaming in through the windows. Jett must have pulled back the curtains, bathing the room in glaring brightness. The next thing I noticed was that, in my absence, he had removed the candles, and the sheet covering the bed was gone, together with his bag.</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d Calling his name, I walked downstairs and stopped. His voice carried over from the living room. I strained to listen but couldn\u2019t make out any words, so I inched closer as a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu gripped me. On the last day in Italy, Jett had almost shot two intruders who got away with all evidence we had gathered on the Lucazzone estate. The fear of having someone watching us, waiting to strike when we least expected it, had caused me a few nightmares and never quite left me. And now it was coming back full force.</p><p>Ignoring the frantic drumming of my heart, I sucked in air a few times, forcing oxygen into my lungs. Unlike back in Italy, no one knew we were here, so my sudden pang of fear was unreasonable. Still, I couldn\u2019t stop the beads of sweat gathering at the nape of my neck. I took another lungful of air and stepped into the living room. Jett was standing near the windows overlooking the backyard; his back was turned to me, and his phone was glued to his ear.</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d His voice sounded strangely anxious and strained, which managed to worry me even more.</p><p>I knocked softly on the doorframe to get his attention, and he turned to signal he had acknowledged my presence before turning away again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of things...Okay.\u201d He hung up, his hand clutching at his phone, his gaze fixed on a point outside the window.</p><p>Hesitating, I inched closer and stopped next to him. His eyes were distant, and his face was a mask of fury. From the way he was standing, motionless, with his shoulders slouched, I couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that something bad had happened. Something felt horribly wrong. My fingers itched to touch him, but I didn\u2019t dare. Not before he told me what had happened.</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d I probed softly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stir, didn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cJett? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>A few seconds passed in silence. His troubled gaze brushed our feet, as if recalling where he was, or maybe he just fought for strength.</p><p>\u201cMy father died,\u201d he said at last. His voice was so low, strained and choked, I wasn\u2019t sure I heard right.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whispered. I shook my head, unable to comprehend the meaning of his words. It couldn\u2019t be. I clasped my hand over my mouth in shock. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>Jett turned to me, his eyes meeting mine. They were filled with pain.</p><p>\u201cMy brother was called to the morgue this morning. He phoned to say my father had been on his boat when it blew up yesterday.\u201d I watched him walk over to the couch and slump down. \u201cHe didn\u2019t survive it.\u201d</p><p>I sat down next to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jett.\u201d I squeezed his hand in the hope the gesture would convey more meaning than the probably most overused phrase in the world. Even though they had not been close and Robert Mayfield used to belong to Alessandro\u2019s secret club, he was still Jett\u2019s father. I watched the way Jett sat, defeated with his head buried in his hands, and couldn\u2019t stop my tears from falling. We never got the chance to tell his father we were expecting. I had never even met him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Jett looked up, his eyes meeting mine, searching for the confirmation I wouldn\u2019t give him. I inhaled a sharp breath and let it out slowly. It killed me to see him suffering like that.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jett. You can\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is, and we both know it.\u201d He pulled his hand out of my grip and got up, his face turning into a mask of anger. He punched the wall and I jerked back in shock. \u201cHe called two weeks ago, right after we returned from Italy. I didn\u2019t want to talk with him because I was angry. If only I\u2019d met with him, maybe this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d I asked, shocked. \u201cYou think it wasn\u2019t an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Brooke, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d He glanced back to me with so much anger I flinched. \u201cA boat doesn\u2019t blow up. He would\u2019ve noticed a fire and called for help. Maybe whoever did this shot him first before setting fire to get rid of any evidence. It was arson, I\u2019m sure of that.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what was more frightening: that I had never seen him so upset, or the fact there wasn\u2019t a single thing I could do to help him. I regarded Jett\u2019s angry face, afraid of his next move. Afraid of what this could mean for us.</p><p>Seconds passed, which turned into minutes, and Jett didn\u2019t budge from the spot.</p> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Jett mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI wish there was something I could do,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d His tone softened, and for a moment the anger in his voice disappeared, only to come back directed at himself. \u201cI should have known.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in confusion, unable to follow his changes in mood. \u201cKnown what?\u201d</p><p>His eyes glazed over, lost in thoughts. He walked back to the couch and sat down. Another minute passed, and no reply came.</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you think he was killed, Jett?\u201d I asked cautiously. \u201cYour brother would have said something. The police would be all over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the five people on the list?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded, thinking back to the little black book we had found in Alessandro\u2019s basement. Jett had mentioned five names, and one of them was Robert Mayfield.</p><p>\u201cI think that was a hit list,\u201d Jett continued in a tone that made shiver.</p><p>I sat down next to him on the couch, watching him in silence, as his words slowly sank in.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way the five names were the only club members. It\u2019s impossible. My father said\u2014\u201d Jett\u2019s voice faltered with emotion \u201c\u2014he said there were seventy-eight members before he left. Maybe the other four decided to opt out as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think he was killed because he wanted out?\u201d I asked needlessly. I hadn\u2019t seen this perspective before and it certainly didn\u2019t make a hell of a lot of sense to me, but I couldn\u2019t rule it out. A club like that probably thrived on wealthy members and their dedication for life. Maybe someone had taken the \u201csilence to the grave\u201d oath a little too literally. Possible. I thought back to Jett\u2019s words.</p><p>I don\u2019t think your way is the way they\u2019re working. They\u2019re not as peaceful.</p><p>Even I had known at that point that no one was let in easily, and definitely not out with a mere handshake.</p><p>\u201cMy father said it was a mistake to join the club,\u201d Jett said. \u201cThey probably wanted to get rid of him. If I had mentioned the book and the list, I could have prevented his death. I know he would have listened to me.\u201d His voice sounded choked. \u201cI would have been able to save his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jett.\u201d I shook my head, my heart hurting because Jett blamed himself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that,\u201d I whispered and shook my head again, my hand clutching at his arm to force him to listen to me. His eyes bored into me and for the first time his anger wasn\u2019t directed at himself, but at me.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the truth. The fucking truth, Brooke. Why won\u2019t you accept that I made a mistake?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p> <p>LIFE HAS A way of throwing everything around. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t stop the feeling that we were all trapped inside a cup called life, and like dice shaken around and thrown out. Ready to be tested and played. Ready to risk and face the unthinkable. Ready to lose and get hurt. And it didn\u2019t matter how high the social status was or how much money a person had, it could affect everyone, anytime and anywhere. We were all at the mercy of the shaking cup called life.</p><p>Watching the various emotions crossing Jett\u2019s features, I realized how much I loved him and that I\u2019d do anything for him. However, whatever I did or said, there was no recipe for taking away the pain. Nothing to ease his mind or guilt. Nothing to rid his conscience of the demons haunting him. As much as I loved him, love was not enough to release him from the guilt he\u2019d probably carry with him for the rest of his life. It was as if guilt had become his companion and I had become his shadow\u2014one trying to heal him and the other causing as much havoc as possible. And I knew all about guilt and the dirty tricks it played so it could haunt you forever.</p><p>The moment Jett found out about his father\u2019s death, I felt him distancing himself from me. We packed up quickly and drove back to his apartment in freezing silence. The moment he unlocked the door, I felt like an intruder in his world.</p><p>\u201cGotta go to work,\u201d Jett mumbled, and disappeared again, leaving me alone in the perfection of his place.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said weakly, but he was gone already.</p><p>Work had to be an excuse to bury himself in his grief\u2014or why else would he leave without giving me a kiss goodbye? That night he didn\u2019t come home. And the following night, he was there with me and yet not there. Listened to me, and yet none of my words reached him through the shield he had built around himself. I knew this would happen. I almost expected it. What I didn\u2019t expect was for him to shut me out of his world. To not let me get close, refusing to talk, refusing to listen. He had become emotionally distant and at times unavailable, but the worst was that I could feel him changing.</p><p>It was as if guilt had created an invisible barrier that began to separate us, harming our relationship, his playful nature replaced by something that scared the hell out of me. Like sickness, leaving a bitter aftertaste in its wake.</p><p>With each day, the walls grew higher, distancing him from me. And no matter how hard I pounded and shook at the gates, they seemed to be stronger than I, my love for him, or anything that used to matter to him.</p><p>Maybe I hadn\u2019t known him as well as I thought I did. The silence and determined continuation of his rituals consisting of nothing but work and sleeping was his way of coping. However, the way he was shutting me out\u2014physically and emotionally\u2014made me feel as though he was shutting me out in his heart, too.</p><p>I preferred tears. They were good. They would purify, cleanse, and help him heal. I preferred anger because it would draw out the poison of guilt. But they never came. I wanted an outburst; I wanted something to show me that he wasn\u2019t too broken to heal, the way my mother had been after my father\u2019s death: motionless, her body living and breathing, but her soul dead within the physical carcass of herself. That was a lot worse than the anger I wanted Jett to let loose so he could eventually move on.</p><p>With Robert Mayfield dead, my thoughts kept circling back to the break-in, the black book, and Alessandro Lucazzone. I could feel the connection, and it scared me. Maybe someone had panicked, and our discoveries were the reason why Jett\u2019s father was murdered in the first place. I couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that if Jett and I had never begun to date, we would never have broken through the wall and found the black book that was so important people were ready to kill for it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why secrets should stay buried forever,\u201d I muttered to myself as I slipped into a demure black dress for Robert Mayfield\u2019s funeral.</p><p>If Jett heard me, he didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>I drew in a shaky breath and closed my eyes to get rid of the stinging sensation as a new thought entered my mind.</p><p>How terrible would it be if not Jett but I were to blame for his father\u2019s death?</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>THE SKY RESEMBLED a looming dark pit carrying the heavy promise of rain. A strong gust of wind tugged at my black dress, its cold caress keeping me strangely grounded and reminding me that amidst all the graves we were alive, continuing to swim in the river called life while the rest would be soon forgotten, whether we wanted it or not.</p><p>I glanced at Jett who was standing in front of Robert Mayfield\u2019s grave, his eyes focused on a spot on the horizon only he could see. The people around us listened to the reverend\u2019s empty words in silence. A few were crying, their souls tormented by the loss of someone they believed to have known. Most of them barely blinked, locked in a state of memories and self-reflection, their minds full of promises to re-evaluate their own life and make it better. I knew because I had been one of them after my sister and father died. I could see it in the mourners\u2019 guilty expressions and the determination in their eyes. I also knew from experience that whatever promises they made to themselves would rarely last. In the end, the stupid things we did didn\u2019t matter anyway; what mattered was appreciating the people in our life, spending enough time with them.</p><p>Material belongings always waste away, while memories never fade.</p><p>I blinked away the tears gathering at the corner of my eyes and peered around me. I\u2019d never seen so many people at one funeral. Then again, I had never been rich or famous, while Jett\u2019s father had been both.</p><p>The drive to the funeral service was short and silent. By the time we reached the penthouse Jett\u2019s father had inhabited during his stays in New York, hundreds of people had already gathered and more were flooding in by the minute, all hurrying to offer Jett their condolences.</p><p>I listened to countless speeches, all praising Robert Mayfield as a good man who had brought many great changes to those who had entered his life. I listened to recalled fond memories while my gaze brushed the pictures on the walls and mantelpiece. Most were hidden behind countless flower bouquets and goodbye letters, but a few stood out\u2014mostly of Robert Mayfield and women. One or two showed him with two young boys I assumed were Jett and Jonathan, and it made me wonder how many of the funeral visitors actually knew the kind of man Robert Mayfield had been hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of normality and perfection.</p><p>Biting my lip hard, I peered at Jett\u2019s stony expression and the hardness in his eyes, and I recalled the way he had known his father. As a hard man. As a terrible role model who neither acknowledged his mistakes nor apologized. But no one seemed to want to mention any of that.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay here? I have to see some people,\u201d Jett said, jerking me out of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll go check out the buffet.\u201d I pointed in the direction of the open-plan kitchen area, which I had spied upon entering. The large assortment of finger food would have done a wedding reception justice. \u201cWant anything?\u201d</p><p>Jett shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d He shot me a tender smile, and then he was gone.</p><p>I walked over to the buffet and grabbed a plate, then got in line, unable to decide whether to get the oysters or the salmon rolls. Everything looked delicious, and the baby inside me knew it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Brooke, right?\u201d A voice behind me startled me. I turned sharply to regard a tall guy with dark hair and blue eyes. The first thing I noticed about him was the tailored black designer suit; the second was the confidence in his eyes. His lips were curved into just a hint of a friendly smile\u2014not too much and not too little, given the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nodded. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jonathan, Jett\u2019s brother. Call me Nate. Everyone does.\u201d He shook my hand. \u201cJett\u2019s told me everything about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d Nate\u2019s smile didn\u2019t shift, but I caught the sudden glance at the floor. I remembered a time when I had to smile and pretend the world was all right when all I wanted was to crawl into a corner and bawl my eyes out. Maybe finding common ground was what made me like Nate instantly.</p><p>\u201cIt was a terrible accident,\u201d Nate murmured and for the first time I noticed the dark circles framing his eyes. I swallowed down the lump in my throat and nodded.</p><p>\u201cTerrible and sad.\u201d Unaware of my gesture, I brushed a hand over my flat abdomen. A brief moment of awkward silence ensued between us, during which a waiter carrying glasses of champagne walked past. Nate picked up two, handing me one glass, then pointed to a couch in the corner of the huge living room. I nodded and followed him, my hands clutching the glass of alcohol. He sat down and invited me to do the same.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jett holding up?\u201d he asked. His voice was strained. A shudder ran down my spine at the thought that he was the one who\u2019d been called to the morgue in order to identify his father\u2019s body, scorched beyond recognition. I couldn\u2019t imagine how difficult it must have been for him. I was glad it wasn\u2019t Jett.</p><p>\u201cAs okay as the circumstances allow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s a tough guy. If something\u2019s troubling him, he works hard to get rid of it.\u201d He took a sip from his glass and watched me for a moment before continuing. \u201cAfter our mother left, he took charge. It\u2019s the way my little brother copes.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back, hiding my surprise. Of course Nate knew his brother well. They had grown up together. But talking about him so intimately jarred me. As though sensing my thoughts, Nate smiled and took another sip of his drink. \u201cJust be there for him, and he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two used to be very close,\u201d I said matter-of-factly, remembering the few stories Jett had told me back in Italy. Two boys watching the Lucazzone estate in secret, their imagination thriving with theories of mystery and conspiracy. Back then they didn\u2019t know just how spot-on they were.</p> <p>\u201cCorrection. We still are.\u201d Nate\u2019s eyes bored into me. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. We\u2019ve always been. Too bad we\u2019re living in different states.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJett said you work in Austin?\u201d I asked.</p><p>His eyes moved to my glass. I fought the urge to take an obligatory sip.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m managing the southern division of Mayfield Realties. Not missing New York a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, a little stunned. It was one of the best cities in the world. So many people moved to New York to follow their dreams, I almost expected everyone to love the city, the magic of the holidays, the best shopping strips, and the spirit in general. He pointed at the gray sky outside the wall-to-ceiling window. In spite of the rainy weather and the crowded skyline, it was still a stunning view.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a southern guy, and to me New York is touristy. I\u2019m not saying Texas is better\u2014I just prefer it due to its weather, good schools, the best steaks in the world, low crime, the high employment rate, to name just a few thing.\u201d He laughed, and I found myself laughing with him. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to sell anything to you, but you should come visit. You might end up wanting to persuade Jett to move down there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI might,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIn which case I\u2019ll have to insist you do it sooner rather than later. We could use someone like Jett. Not least because I want to go on a vacation every now and then. We sure miss him.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward, listening intently as I sensed my opportunity to find out more about my boyfriend\u2019s past. \u201cJett used to live in Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were raised in Smithville on a huge ranch. When our mother got sick\u2014\u201d he paused, and I knew he meant her addiction to various substances \u201c\u2014our father decided that the South wasn\u2019t good for us, so we moved to New York. I was sixteen and Jett was just ten when we moved from countless horses and lazy afternoons to smog and concrete buildings. It wasn\u2019t easy. When I saw my chance to go back to attend college, I took it, but Jett stayed behind with Dad.\u201d</p><p>Nate paused long enough to help himself to another glass of champagne before resuming his smalltalk.</p><p>\u201cSo, Brooke, this is probably one of those clich\u00e9 questions, but how did you two meet? Were you doing your catwalk and he happened to sit in the front row?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, actually. It was in a bar, and we were supposed to have a business meeting, which never took place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposed?\u201d His blue gaze bored into me again with a strange interest.</p> <p>\u201cSupposed, yes, because I didn\u2019t know who Jett was, and his style didn\u2019t exactly scream business meeting, so I brushed him off.\u201d I smiled uncomfortably at the memories in my head. I hadn\u2019t just brushed Jett off; I had been downright rude, which was justified, given Jett\u2019s intentions at that time. I wondered whether Nate knew of those. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say Jett told you everything?\u201d I asked, eager to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cAh, you caught me. I know the story, actually. I just wanted to hear your version.\u201d He held up his hands in mock resignation. \u201cUnfortunately, Jett forgot to mention you were this\u2014\u201d he gestured with his hand and laughed \u201c\u2014beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer to me, invading my personal space, as he whispered in my ear, \u201cI\u2019m not surprised my little brother fell for you. We\u2019ve always shared the same taste. If I had been the one to meet you, Brooke, I would have asked you out, too.\u201d He leaned back again, watching my reaction with the kind of self-assured expression I knew well from his brother. It seemed being cocky and full of oneself ran in the family.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy my brother met you,\u201d Nate said. \u201cIt was about time.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, unsure how to react to his statement.</p><p>\u201cI should get going,\u201d I said, standing. \u201cJett might be looking for me and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Nate reached into his blazer and handed me a business card. \u201cHere\u2019s my number. Call me if my brother needs anything or, you know, if you need someone to talk to. You\u2019re part of the family now. I\u2019m sure my father would have loved to meet you.\u201d His expression seemed pained but disappeared quickly. \u201cMaybe you could convince Jett to visit us for a weekend. It\u2019d be great to have you guys around. Bring back some normality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I fiddled with my glass. Nate\u2019s brows shot up. I frowned and followed his line of vision to the hot dark-haired guy who seemed to be a head taller than everyone else making a beeline for us, and my heart jumped in my throat. I had yet to get used to the idea that I was actually dating him.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve met my girlfriend,\u201d Jett said to Nate, a grin lighting up his face\u2014the first I had seen since his father\u2019s death. His arm locked around my waist, and he pulled me just a little bit closer, as though to establish his territory, which made me smile.</p><p>\u201cLook at you. You\u2019re a changed man. How have you been doing, little brother?\u201d Nate patted Jett\u2019s shoulder a little harder than I would\u2019ve expected. I regarded them as they briefly hugged each other, their eyes locked in something I couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint\u2014until I remembered something Jett once told me.</p><p>Competition.</p><p>His childhood and teenage years had been full of battles to be the better, the stronger, the more daring out of the two of them.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the lovely Natalia?\u201d Jett asked.</p><p>\u201cGood. She\u2019s been bugging me to make you come visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to. In a few weeks, maybe, when everything\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully still this year.\u201d Nate chuckled and shot me a meaningful look, which I took for an invitation to persuade Jett to change his plans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought the company records you wanted to see,\u201d Nate said. \u201cDo you want to go over them now or later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me two minutes with Brooke, and then we can talk.\u201d Jett glanced over at me. I said a hurried goodbye to his brother, and then Nate was gone.</p><p>\u201cHas he always been this\u2014?\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cConfident, yet complex?\u201d Jett cut me off. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s like the center of a hurricane. You\u2019ll never know what you get before it hits you.\u201d His eyes met mine, and for a moment I wanted to wrap my arms around him and kiss him like there was no tomorrow. I missed the old Jett, when he wasn\u2019t angry at the world and plagued by guilt. \u201cYou can also easily push his buttons. You don\u2019t want to see him explode when he\u2019s drunk. Natalia has seen her fair share of him in that state, which is why I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s still with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Natalia?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHis fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>Nate was engaged. I didn\u2019t expect that, just as much as I didn\u2019t expect him to have a possible drinking problem.</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyes fell on my full glass and he took it from my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to drink that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>I wanted to know more about Nate and his life but there were more important questions that needed an immediate answer.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jett frowned.</p><p>\u201cAbout the estate?\u201d</p><p>Jett hesitated, pondering whether to tell the truth. I scowled in the hope he wouldn\u2019t dare lying because we had sworn each other to honesty.</p><p>\u201cI told him, but\u2014\u201d he heaved a sigh \u201c\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to believe it. In his eyes our father could do no wrong, maybe because they were so much alike. Unlike Robert, Nate\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys talk often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as often as I wished. The distance isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should head down there for a few days,\u201d I said. It might do you good. But that I didn\u2019t add. \u201cWe could tell everyone about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He glanced at his watch impatiently, signaling that my time with him was up. \u201cI need to go over some papers. It won\u2019t take long, Brooke. Will you be okay?\u201d I nodded, and Jett\u2019s eyes filled with worry. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired, I could have someone drive you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jett.\u201d I squeezed his hand and shot him a dazzling smile. \u201cYou guys do whatever you need to do. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really won\u2019t take long.\u201d He kissed me and hurried out.</p><p>I watched him disappear in the crowd and then returned to the buffet. Ever since I\u2019d found out about the pregnancy, I\u2019d felt hungrier than usual, so I grabbed a plate when my phone rang. A look at the display showed me it was Sylvie. She had called several times in the past few days, and in all the turmoil I had failed to get back to her.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She sounded nervous. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe funeral\u2019s today,\u201d I said to remind her in case she had missed my texts.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She paused, hesitating. I could almost hear her nervousness through the line, which turned me instantly anxious. \u201cI was wondering if we could meet tomorrow. I haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She hesitated again. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied, then changed my mind. As best friends, it was my duty to tell her the truth. \u201cActually, no. Jett\u2019s been blaming himself for his father\u2019s death, and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s huge, but he has to accept all the bad things that happened, and that\u2019s something you can\u2019t do for him. It\u2019s a natural process, Brooke.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, because every now and then Sylvie opened her mouth and something amazing came out of it. It was rare but it happened, and right now was one of those times. Somewhere at the back of my mind I registered that someone had started to talk into the microphone again, and a few guests had begun to eye me up and down with disdain.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t really talk right now,\u201d I whispered. \u201cLet\u2019s meet tomorrow. Three p.m. Same place as always?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>THE BISTRO WAS situated in a tiny cul-de-sac, shielded from the busy midday traffic. I pushed the door open and headed directly for our usual spot in the far corner. Since she was hidden by a huge plant, I spotted Sylvie\u2019s stilettos long before I spied her. As usual, they were mile-high and matched the rest of her. Her blonde hair was glossy, her nails were done, her makeup impeccable. Dressed in a blue fitted dress that matched her sapphire eyes, she looked stunning. I kissed her on the cheek and slid into the seat opposite hers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you like crazy.\u201d Sylvie smiled, scanning me up and down, which was never a good sign. Either there was something wrong with my outfit, or she thought I looked exhausted, or both. Whatever was the matter, she kept her thoughts to herself and would only start dropping hints when she thought I wouldn\u2019t notice. \u201cThe apartment feels lonely without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I realized we had never been separated this long. \u201cI feel terrible I neglected you. So much has happened that I didn\u2019t realize we haven\u2019t seen each other for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen days and nine hours.\u201d She pointed at her sleek cell phone. \u201cI\u2019ve kept track in case Jett locks you up forever and I have to sue his ass to get five minutes with you.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest when a waitress appeared to bring us two lattes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve ordered the usual,\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind. The decaf is for you. Because of the\u2014\u201d She was so scared of kids, she couldn\u2019t even bring herself to say the word.</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d Smiling, I rolled my eyes and took a sip of my coffee. It was delicious though I could taste the lack of caffeine. Even though I was still in my first term, I couldn\u2019t wait to get this pregnancy over and done with so I could return to my usual knockout caffeine dose.</p> <p>\u201cHave you told your mother yet?\u201d Sylvie asked, playing with the spoon in her cup.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie frowned. I held up my hand before she could start her interrogation and persuaded me into making a decision I didn\u2019t want to make.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting to see whether it\u2019s serious between Jett and me. Knowing her, the moment I mention a boyfriend or baby, she\u2019ll go all traditional on me, you know\u2014\u201d I waved my hand, ignoring the urge to roll my eyes again \u201c\u2014insist that we get married and all. I don\u2019t want to scare Jett.\u201d The mere thought of mentioning marriage and scaring the hell out of him almost caused me a panic attack. \u201cGod, Sylvie, I feel like a shitty friend not getting in touch with you sooner. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m good. To be honest, I have been busy, too.\u201d She shot me a dazzling smile, which usually screamed one of two things: she\u2019d snagged up a designer handbag people usually waited for months, or she was in relationship bliss. I took a sip of my coffee again, thinking I knew her well enough to guess whatever she had to say. \u201cI got a job offer from Delta &amp; Warren, and I\u2019m still deciding whether to take it.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at her. \u201cWow. Sylvie, that\u2019s huge. That\u2019s been your dream job forever. What are you waiting for? A few weeks ago you said you\u2019d do anything to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Sylvie heaved an exaggerated sigh. I narrowed my eyes in the hope I\u2019d make sense of her cryptic expression. The way her fingers couldn\u2019t stop playing with the hem of her dress instantly raised my suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I prompted.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing some thinking these past few days.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie never thought. She acted on impulse, doing whatever her little heart and hot body desired.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. This is your dream job. You worked hard for it, and now you tell me you\u2019ve been thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how this sounds.\u201d She avoided my gaze again, and in that instant I knew my initial instinct had been right. \u201cKenny wants to show me Arkansas. This could be my first try at a real relationship. I don\u2019t want to mess it up. Besides, he\u2019s seen so many places, I feel like I\u2019ve been missing out.\u201d</p><p>I blinked several times, unable to comprehend the meaning of her words. \u201cYou want to go on a road trip with Kenny?\u201d I asked, shocked. \u201cWhat happened to \u2018never put a guy first\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just for two months, after which I\u2019d be back to my usual boring life.\u201d</p><p>Boring? Sylvie wouldn\u2019t know what boring was if it came knocking on her door.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a city girl, Sylvie. You hate sitting in a car, or sitting anywhere, for longer than an hour. You say it makes you itchy.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m converted. Life changes people. I\u2019ve been studying and working my butt off my whole life. Maybe I\u2019m sick of it all. Maybe I need something new.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes on her again, assessing her. Something else must have happened, because the Sylvie I knew did stupid things, but they weren\u2019t monumentally stupid. Had Jett\u2019s father\u2019s death affected her in any way? She hadn\u2019t known him, but maybe his passing away made her aware of just how fleeting life was. Deep in my heart, I could accept that Sylvie sought something new, because I wanted to see her happy and support her, no matter how crazy it all was. I just wanted her to be aware of any consequences.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you planning to go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cKenny wants to leave as soon as I\u2019m ready. I thought maybe before the month\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019ll support you,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to please anyone. And you love vacations.\u201d Of the five-star catered kind, which I didn\u2019t add. \u201cBut before you decide, I just want to remind you this job was your big dream. It might be a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she wailed, \u201cwhich is why it\u2019s so hard to decide. And then there\u2019s you and the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t want to leave you on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about us. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be back before it\u2019s born. We still have a few more months to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d She sounded doubtful. \u201cMaybe Jett and you need a break. If you want, you can come with us.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I had watched Sylvie for the past minutes and somehow from the way she behaved, I just knew she was hiding something. She was nervous, more than usual. And what was she saying anyway? That I end my relationship and leave Jett alone in his grief?</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I break up with him?\u201d I tried to keep my voice low and casual but didn\u2019t succeed.</p><p>She leaned over the table and grabbed my hand to stop the sudden wave of anger washing over me. \u201cNo, Brooke. I was thinking he might need some time alone to deal with his grief. People aren\u2019t themselves when they suffer loss. I don\u2019t want things to take their toll on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Sylvie.\u201d My voice came out more agitated than necessary. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cHe needs me more than ever. Even when he shuts me out of his life, it\u2019s like a part of me is with him, feeling what he feels. It literally pains me to see him like that.\u201d</p><p>The mere idea of not seeing Jett daily and not waking up to the rough stubble of his cheeks grating my skin made me anxious to call him just to hear his voice.</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetie, but I honestly feel you should think about it.\u201d She took my hand again, her voice changing to a whisper. \u201cThere are other things you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>My whole body stiffened. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, her eyes avoiding mine. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been calling, but you were never available. I would\u2019ve texted you, but when Jett\u2019s father died, you were busy, and it\u2019s not something you should ever put in a text message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you had the kind of surprise I had back in Italy.\u201d I laughed nervously. An unwanted pregnancy was Sylvie\u2019s nightmare. \u201cThere has already been so much drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d She looked down, stalling, avoiding my gaze on purpose, which wasn\u2019t a good sign. Worry set in. Was Kenny abusive? Those things happened. You heard it every day, read about them in the newspaper. I didn\u2019t want Sylvie to be a victim. \u201cIs it Kenny? Whatever\u2019s wrong, you can tell me. Just because Jett needs me doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are fine with him. We\u2019re dating. He\u2019s great,\u201d Sylvie said. I opened my mouth to push for an answer when she held up a hand. \u201cPlease stop, Brooke. It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about you and Jett, and it\u2019s bad.... God, this is so hard to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad?\u201d My fingers clenched around my cup so tight, I feared it might snap as hundreds of thoughts raced through my mind.</p><p>What could Sylvie know that I didn\u2019t? Was he having an affair, and she didn\u2019t know how to break it to me?</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t kill me,\u201d she said, squeezing my hand. \u201cI need you to promise, because I swear otherwise I\u2019m not telling you anything.\u201d</p><p>My heart started to race. All of a sudden, I didn\u2019t want to know. I felt like I should just run out of the door and not look back, pretend this conversation never happened. But my feet were glued to the floor while, inside, the chains of my heart were about to unleash a tornado of chaos.</p><p>What could be so terrible that Sylvie was too worried to tell me? I knew my best friend. She was never afraid to share her honest opinion. And then it dawned on me that an affair was the only reason why Sylvie might have been so jumpy.</p><p>Jett was having an affair. I knew it because he\u2019d been working long hours lately, often arriving home past midnight.</p><p>What did you expect, Stewart? He\u2019s a guy with an oversized ego and the kind of looks no man should possess. What woman would ever say \u201cno\u201d to that?</p><p>\u201cI know what you want to tell me,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI should have known all along.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about the same thing here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you talking about cheating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, the book. It\u2019s been with me all along.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me, anxiously awaiting my reaction. Her eyes shimmered with something and now I understood. Her jumpiness didn\u2019t stem from frayed nerves.</p><p>It was caused by fear. Pure raw fear.</p> <p>The kind that makes you want to join the witness protection program. The kind of fear that makes you want to buy a gun, and then barricade everyone you love inside a panic room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What book?\u201d I asked, but even before she confirmed my biggest nightmare, I felt physically sick. \u201cHow is that even possible? It was stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She smirked. \u201cI found it inside my bag. Somehow I must have grabbed it with the rest of my stuff before we drove back to Bellagio to buy the pregnancy tests.\u201d She squeezed my hand apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Brooke. My bag is like a tiny Bermuda Triangle that swallows up everything. I swear whatever I put in there, it\u2019s either lost or forgotten, only to resurface when it wants to. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it\u2019s been with us all along?\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the disk?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cThe book, the disk, they\u2019re all here. The only thing they took are the financial reports and the sheets of paper you found in the basement.\u201d</p><p>My mind began to spin. \u201cOh, God. You realize this could be the reason why they killed Jett\u2019s father, right?\u201d I closed my eyes, wishing I could hide forever.</p><p>Descend into darkness, but into darkness I was already descending, and it seemed worse than I ever imagined it to be.</p><p>Jett\u2019s father did not die because Jett didn\u2019t warn him. He didn\u2019t die because someone had put him on some hit list. He was killed because the people involved never got what they came for, and they were dangerous enough to commit murder.</p><p>\u201cRobert Mayfield was a potential witness,\u201d I said slowly, the words echoing in my brain with the intensity of drumrolls. \u201cHe knew the club inside and out. He held all the information we could have wanted. Being Jett\u2019s father, they feared he might say too much to us. Add his statement to the book and the disk, and we could\u2019ve had real evidence against whatever\u2019s going on in there.\u201d</p> <p>My head pounded hard, reinforcing the sense of sickness inside me at the thought of what this might mean for us.</p><p>\u201cI feel sick.\u201d</p><p>I ran for the bathroom, faintly aware of Sylvie\u2019s presence as I stormed into a cubicle. I lingered over the bowl until my stomach was empty. Sylvie\u2019s hand brushed my back, but she remained quiet as I washed my face. The cold water cooled my hot skin and helped clear my head. And then I broke down. Like a bursting dam, the tears began to spill before I could stop them.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to tell Jett?\u201d I asked. \u201cAfter what happened to his father, he might think I\u2019m not worth the risk and end things with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tell him, Brooke.\u201d Sylvie\u2019s eyes met mine, and for a moment I was left speechless by the calculation and determination I glimpsed in them. \u201cYou just pretend nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil shit hits the fan?\u201d I snorted. \u201cAre you fucking nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell him. It\u2019s my fault, not yours, so I\u2019ll deal with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s your fault?\u201d I thought back to the day I found out I was pregnant. My memories were a blurry mess because of the huge news I thought would break my world apart. I remembered a handbag and papers and us hurrying out, but who grabbed what? \u201cIt could just as well have been me. You always forget stuff, and I always make sure to remember to retrieve whatever you leave behind. Besides, I tend to shove my stuff inside your bag because yours is always larger than mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who did what. I honestly don\u2019t think you should tell him.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>A cold feeling settled in the pit of my stomach. We had promised each other honesty. Technically, not telling him wasn\u2019t lying, but keeping secrets sure felt like it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I grabbed her shoulders in a weak attempt to make her understand my dilemma. \u201cWhat if they hurt more people? He has to know.\u201d</p><p>I looked into her eyes and saw my own fear reflected in them. Was that the reason why she was so hell-bent on going on a road trip, far away from the drama and the danger I seemed to attract like a magnet?</p><p>\u201cIf he breaks up with me, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said, my mind made up. \u201cIt\u2019ll break my heart probably even more than before and it\u2019ll take a long time to heal, but at least I\u2019d have come clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that? It\u2019d be stupid. Jett might be many things, but he\u2019s not an idiot.\u201d She smiled, but I knew it was fake and meant to make me feel better from the way it didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. The slight tremor in her voice signaled she was just as unsure of what the future held in store for us as I was. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for him, and he knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>I had been kidding myself.</p><p>After the break-in, Jett had assured me that it was over. I could still remember his exact words.</p><p>They have everything they wanted, so there is no need for them to come back.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t have what they wanted. Maybe they had intended to send out a message by killing Robert Mayfield. If that was the case, no one was safe. Not I, nor Sylvie, Jett, or Nate. But that wasn\u2019t my biggest fear. Jett\u2019s guilt kept nagging at him, and I couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that everything had happened because of me. For the umpteenth time since Sylvie\u2019s confession I wondered how Jett would react once I disclosed the truth. What if he started to blame me for his father\u2019s demise? And, most importantly, would he be able to forgive me? Because as sure as the sun comes down after a beautiful day, promising a cold night, he would be mad and I didn\u2019t know what a full confession might mean for us. Would we stay together? Would he continue loving me?</p><p>And to think of all the times I had expected Jett would let me down; of all the times I had mistrusted him. Ever since I found out Jett had lied to me, I had been worried about him hurting me, which seemed ludicrous in light of the disaster that was about to unfold. For weeks I had watched him and tried to read every gesture and word while the thought never occurred to me that I might be the one to make a mistake so grave it would cost a life. I never realized I might be the one who failed, and I hated myself for it.</p><p>If Jett loved me truly, he\u2019d forgive the unforgivable. But even if he did, would I be able to forgive myself for killing his father? My sister was one thing. Her death had been my fault and it still haunted me in my dreams. But what about Jett\u2019s father? Could I live with a second death on my conscience?</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>NONE OF US spoke during the taxi ride to Sylvie\u2019s apartment, which we had shared for years until two weeks ago. After our arrival from Italy, Jett and I had decided that it might be safer for the baby and me to move in with him. I had agreed reluctantly because he had a point, but, standing in my former living room painted the color of lavender and decorated with way too much fluff, I couldn\u2019t help the nostalgia washing over me. Maybe my memories were what prevented me from returning the key or from taking all my belongings with me, but I realized I wasn\u2019t yet ready to close the door on this part of my past.</p><p>In silence, I watched Sylvie drop her handbag on the coffee table and shrug out of her jacket, tossing it on top of the bag, before she turned to me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I cut her off. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the now and worry later. Show me the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d go anywhere,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>Waiting for Sylvie, I figured I might as well make myself comfortable, so I got us two cans of soda from the kitchen and slumped on the couch, then opened one and took a sip. I put it down on the couch table and seriously considered checking on Sylvie when she finally returned. The tension was so thick I could almost taste it. I peered nervously at the bundle Sylvie handed me.</p><p>The black leather-bound book seemed light in my hands, but it looked just as ominous as I remembered it. There was still a chance that Sylvie had somehow gotten her hands on someone\u2019s journal with yellowed pages carrying the joy of a new relationship or maybe the secrets of a love affair\u2014anything but five names and a few strings of numbers. I opened the first page, and my last morsel of hope that it might all be a misunderstanding dissolved into thin air. I wished it was just a nightmare from which I couldn\u2019t wake up, but no matter how many times I pinched myself, I knew I wasn\u2019t dreaming. No dream could be so terrible and shattering. No dream could ever evoke the kind of devastation those five names caused inside me.</p><p>I stared at them as they circled before my eyes like a record on replay:</p><p>David McMuldrow</p><p>Eric Statham</p><p>Clarence Holton</p><p>Robert Mayfield</p><p>Troy Bradley Wilson</p><p>\u201cHave you told Kenny?\u201d I finally said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sylvie shook her head, her blue eyes meeting mine. \u201cI wanted to show you first. What\u2019s the big deal with the names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJett thinks it\u2019s a hit list. He believes they tried to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucked up.\u201d Sylvie let out a deep breath. \u201cActually, I Googled them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d I sat up, interested. \u201cDid you find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Clarence Holton. Not personally, but he\u2019s friends with my father. They used to go golfing together. Owns half the gossip magazines in Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I tapped my fingers on the book. I didn\u2019t like the fact that Clarence Holton was acquainted with Sylvie\u2019s family. \u201cWhat about the others?\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward conspiratorially and began to whisper, \u201cThere\u2019s a semi-famous Troy Bradley Wilson in Canada. He\u2019s teaching physics in Montreal, has won a few awards, and is a household name in various journals. But he didn\u2019t strike me as the guy we\u2019re looking for, so I dug further and I found another Troy guy. He\u2019s a successful public speaker and the co-founder of a company in San Diego called\u2014wait!\u201d</p><p>She disappeared down the hall and returned with a notebook, then began to read out loud. \u201cLatrix. They specialize in, now listen, importing sex products.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex products and a club. Much of a coincidence?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She raised her eyebrows meaningfully. \u201cMoving on to the next. Googling Eric Statham brought too many hits but, assuming he\u2019s rich, which seems to be a prerequisite, he\u2019s either a successful entrepreneur or a famous football player from Illinois. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a football player because the guy\u2019s hot. Like, seriously hot. He probably doesn\u2019t need that sort of club to get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the entrepreneur it is.\u201d I glanced at the last two names on the list. \u201cNo need to establish who Robert Mayfield is. What about David McMuldrow? Did you dig up anything on him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I read his name out loud again and then looked up. Sylvie was staring at me. Her sudden hesitation wasn\u2019t a good thing.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d I prompted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a murderer. He killed his wife and two children. Psychologists declared him as mentally unstable, but he was allowed to walk free due to a lack of evidence.\u201d</p><p>My blood froze in my veins.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so cruel,\u201d Sylvie whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures of his children and the abuse they endured. It is too horrible to even imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a harsh and unfair world,\u201d I said bitterly. \u201cEven if you fight for justice, expect to lose and maybe even be ridiculed for trying.\u201d I looked at the black book in my hands. \u201cMy sister\u2019s boyfriend Danny walked free because the judge was swayed by personal biases and failed to see that behind Danny\u2019s smiling face and charming words hid a monster. No law in the world will help if justice is swayed by a human inability to judge between right and wrong, good and evil, and that beautiful doesn\u2019t equal good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sylvie said weakly.</p><p>I closed the book, wishing it\u2019d be as easy for me to shut off evil. Put it away. Hide it. Burn it. Do whatever was necessary to make the world a safer place.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wish I could kill him. There were nights I wanted to see him dead for all the torture and pain he caused my sister.\u201d I laughed\u2014not because it was funny but because the thought hurt.</p> <p>I wiped a stray tear from my face, the reminder of loss too heavy, and watched the moisture on my finger. \u201cThey granted him protection. While my parents and I were threatened by Danny\u2019s friends and feared for our lives, that piece of shit spent his days cozy in a safe house. No matter how many years pass, I can\u2019t stop thinking about her and all the things I could have done to save her. People keep saying shit happens for a reason. I\u2019d love to know what that reason is.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie\u2019s arms wrapped around me in a tight hug. In the silence of the room I knew she understood me. That she was there for me\u2014she always was. As simple and straightforward as her touch seemed, it meant a lot more than words, which were cheap and worthless, spoken with no real intention behind them, except maybe to put an uncomfortable conversation to rest. Besides, there were no words Sylvie could say to ease the pain inside me. She knew it. I knew it. Saying sorry was simply not enough.</p><p>Time couldn\u2019t erase my memories. Time couldn\u2019t make them hurt less, but made me appreciate them more. With every day, with every breath I took, I could feel myself growing, becoming stronger\u2014a braver me who accepted that this world wasn\u2019t just beautiful. It was cruel. It was heartbreaking, and only the strongest survived. The kind of world that had taught me the need to keep going, to continue fighting, to keep learning. To get up after falling and keep going some more, without relying on anyone, without looking back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for laying this on you. My head\u2019s a horrible place to be in right now. I don\u2019t know when it all turned so serious,\u201d I said, feeling guilty for my emotional rollercoaster ride. I forced a smile on my face and peeled myself out of Sylvie\u2019s embrace.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d talk about it,\u201d Sylvie said gently.</p><p>I shook my head. Now wasn\u2019t the time. \u201cThe point I wanted to make is that we can\u2019t be sure whether the guy we\u2019re looking for, Eric Statham, isn\u2019t the football player. No matter how hot he is, don\u2019t let his appearance sway you, because evil people look just like you and me. An evil mind isn\u2019t always the result of bad upbringing. It\u2019s the result of bad character, and it can happen without any outside influence. There are attractive bad people, not because they were created that way. It\u2019s a matter of choice, one we\u2019ll never understand no matter how hard we try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI always thought the bad guys look insane.\u201d Her lips twitched. Her feeble attempt at infusing humor into a tense situation was more than welcome.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been watching too many horror movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me think twice about inviting the pizza delivery boy in. Makes me want to hide inside a room like a loony bin and trust no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs finding the book the reason why you want to go on a road trip?\u201d I had been wanting to ask the question since Sylvie told me about her discovery. \u201cIs running away from it all your solution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought about that,\u201d she admitted. \u201cKenny asked me before I found it. But in some way, yes. I thought if I physically distanced myself from it all, I could escape. Maybe when I return everything will be over, because right now I feel like I\u2019m being watched. I know that\u2019s paranoia talking, but still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning\u2019s not the answer to our problems.\u201d I glanced at my watch. In less than an hour, Jett would finish work, and I wanted to be home before he was back. I pushed the book and disk inside my handbag. \u201cGotta go.\u201d I stood and headed for the door, then stopped midway, remembering I hadn\u2019t asked about the disk. \u201cDid you check out the disk as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, but it requires a password.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to talk to Kenny, then. By the way, he\u2019s awesome.\u201d I shrugged into my jacket. \u201cIt took me a while to figure him out, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re dating.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, me, too. Who knew Italy would turn out the way it did?\u201d Her cheeks flushed a little bit, which never happened when Sylvie talked about a guy. \u201cSpeaking of Italy, I forgot to ask. Have you by any chance seen my tennis bracelet? I remember I still had it when we came back.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. The tennis bracelet was one of Sylvie\u2019s favorite pieces of jewelry. \u201cIt\u2019s probably in the bathroom. If it\u2019s not there, I\u2019ll stop by later this week to help you find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. For all I know it might be somewhere inside the suitcase. I haven\u2019t unpacked yet.\u201d She laughed and accompanied me to the door, hesitating. \u201cWant me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I hugged her briefly.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I heaved an exaggerated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. I stopped being afraid of bad people a long time ago because I don\u2019t care what happens to me. What scares me is disappointing Jett, so right now I really want to get this over and done with.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the doorframe and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s called being in love, I guess. You simply treasure what you want to keep. If he doesn\u2019t forgive you, he doesn\u2019t feel the same way about you. You deserve someone who stands by you in every possible way. If he truly loves you, he\u2019ll walk the extra mile just for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the insight, Oprah.\u201d It was our favorite line. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later with an update on the Jett situation. Wish me luck, and make sure to lock up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I always do.\u201d Which was a lie. She always forgot.</p><p>Sylvie didn\u2019t move out of the way, and in spite of her encouraging smile, her gaze implored me to stay. I wanted to so badly I almost caved in. But I needed to talk with Jett.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you when I see you.\u201d I walked past her, eager for some alone time to sort through my thoughts.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>OUTSIDE, THE RAIN had stopped, but the sky was still a palette of gray. The air carried the scent of fumes and damp earth, and a faint promise that fall would soon be coming, coloring the streets in hues of copper and orange. I forced oxygen into my lungs and headed down the road in search of a taxi, minding the puddles at every corner.</p><p>I reached a crossing and stopped. A black limousine passed by and turned a corner, heading for Sylvie\u2019s building.</p><p>The lights changed to green. I was about to cross the street when I noticed a guy walking toward me, waving.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he said in a strong foreign accent I wasn\u2019t able to place. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d Dressed in jeans and a T-shirt with the logo \u201cI love NY\u201d slapped across his chest, he looked like a tourist. And a lost one at that. I smiled.</p><p>\u201cSure. Where are you heading?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He inched closer. His arms brushed mine casually as he showed me the map. He didn\u2019t seem to mind, but I leaned away to put some inches between us. It happened before. People who didn\u2019t know when they were in my personal space.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He smiled apologetically and pointed to a spot on the map. \u201cI need to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should get a taxi. It\u2019s way too far to walk.\u201d I had looked up to make sure he understood when someone grabbed me from behind and covered my mouth with such force it knocked my breath out of my lungs. My handbag was yanked off my shoulder. For a moment my mind went blank, unable to put a meaning to the situation, and then awareness kicked in. My heart almost froze in my chest as I struggled against the iron grip dragging me to a nearby car I realized was the black limousine.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d I screamed, but no sound escaped my throat. I bit as hard as I could on the hand clamping my mouth shut, my teeth piercing through skin.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d a male voice hissed a moment before I was pushed flat on my knees and the car door slammed, bathing me in pitch-black. In spite of the sharp pang of pain shooting through my left knee and carrying through my thigh, I dashed for the door and yanked at the handle. It didn\u2019t open.</p><p>I was trapped.</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>My breath quickened as countless thoughts began to race through my head. I was being abducted, and nobody knew where I was. If I didn\u2019t alert someone now, I might never make it out alive. Slamming my fists against the window, I screamed for help. My voice echoed in my ears, but nothing stirred and no one came to my aid. The windows weren\u2019t just tinted, making it impossible to peer inside\u2014or out; the car was probably also soundproof. The engine whirred to life, and then we began to move.</p><p>Think, Stewart.</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly to calm my frayed nerves. Maybe if I were lucky enough, my abductors might make do with my handbag and the valuables inside, and dump me back on the street. I knew I was holding on to foolish hope, but I couldn\u2019t let reality kick in just yet.</p><p>I figured I could write a note and throw it out\u2014if the window opened. Someone might find it and call for help. I always carried paper and pen in my handbag, and my mind already came up with a message: Help me. I was abducted in a black limousine by two guys, one with an accent. Thanks and don\u2019t always trust a tourist.</p><p>I laughed bitterly at my own horrid joke as I sank back to my knees and brushed my palms across the floor in search of my handbag and a miracle. If only I could get my hands on my cell, the first thing I\u2019d do was call 911, and they\u2019d track the car. Or send a text to alert Jett of the situation.</p><p>And then someone switched on the lights. I blinked several times until my eyes adjusted and I took in the figure sitting on the other side.</p><p>No shit!</p><p>My mind placed a name to the face, but it couldn\u2019t be. I was either hallucinating or going crazy. But he looked pretty real and there was no mistake he was the same guy I had seen in all the pictures at the funeral. In front of me, his fingers interlaced, bent forward to regard me intently, was Robert Mayfield. And he was very much alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE PROBABLY looking for this.\u201d Robert Mayfield tossed my handbag my way, and it landed at my feet. I snagged it, thankful he hadn\u2019t opened it to check its contents. While I didn\u2019t know for sure what he wanted from me, or why he was alive, I had a pretty good idea. For a moment, I was tempted to retrieve my cell, but I couldn\u2019t risk him discovering the black book and disk. I needed those in case I had to haggle for my life.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a cell phone in there. Don\u2019t even think about trying to call anyone,\u201d he continued, reading my thoughts. \u201cIn fact, hand it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to call anyone,\u201d I muttered. I opened the zipper just enough to squeeze my hand through and rummage for the phone. When I found it, I passed it on to him, making sure he didn\u2019t glimpse the side compartment where I had hidden the book and disk.</p> <p>He motioned for me to sit down opposite from him. \u201cCan I offer you a drink, Brooke?\u201d Without waiting for my answer, he poured whisky into two glasses and handed me one. I sat down in the leather seat and took the glass from his outstretched hand but didn\u2019t drink. \u201cI have to apologize for the way my two guards treated you. It\u2019s not standard procedure with our employees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d he finished for me. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody\u2019s thinking. It\u2019s what I want them to believe.\u201d</p><p>He pointed at my drink invitingly. I watched the golden liquid like it was poison because I didn\u2019t trust him. People who want a friendly chat don\u2019t abduct you. They usually invite you over for coffee instead of making you think you might be about to be smuggled to Mexico.</p><p>Alarm bells began to ring in the back of my head, and my throat felt parched.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why would you want your sons to believe you were dead?\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhy would anyone put their children through so much pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink. It\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t follow his command. My fingers clutched at the glass as I watched him for a few seconds, waiting for his explanation. It never came.</p><p>Robert Mayfield raised his eyebrows and gestured at the glass again. He wanted me to drink up. I figured it was some sordid power game, and if I wanted to survive and escape, I had to play along. Judging from the expression on his face, he knew it just as well as I did. Maybe if he thought I was being cooperative, he might consider letting me go. I lifted the glass to my lips and took a sip, then let the whiskey burn its way down my throat.</p><p>Pleased with my action, he took a sip and leaned back with a smile, swirling the golden liquid in his glass.</p><p>\u201cTo answer your question, it\u2019s complicated,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI\u2019m doing them a favor.\u201d</p> <p>I hoped he\u2019d elaborate. When he didn\u2019t reply, I realized that was all I\u2019d get out of him. As much as I wanted to probe, a more important question lingered in my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many questions, Brooke.\u201d He shook his head slowly, as if he had to educate an ignorant child. \u201cJett didn\u2019t exaggerate when he said we should hire you because you were feisty.\u201d He refilled his glass and leaned back again, his green eyes assessing me. Even though they were the same shade as Jett\u2019s, I didn\u2019t see any warmth in them.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to hurt me? Is that what you want?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>His smile disappeared. I couldn\u2019t suppress a light tremble as a cold shudder ran down my spine. Whatever he had to say, I was sure I wouldn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cQuite the opposite. I have a proposition for you. Let\u2019s call it a chance to start over. A new life, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>His fingers moved inside his pocket to pull out a check he slid over toward me. Seeing all the zeroes, I almost toppled off my seat.</p><p>Holy hell!</p> <p>Two million!</p><p>\u201cMove to Portland, Oregon, and the money shall be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I narrowed my eyes. No one gifted so much money unless they received something in return. Robert Mayfield wanted something. Guys like him always did.</p><p>\u201cI want the book. You still have it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Deep inside of me, I\u2019d seen it coming.</p><p>Of course he wanted the book. The fact that it had laid buried in a basement showed its true value. I pressed the bag to my chest.</p><p>\u201cIt depends,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay out of my son\u2019s life.\u201d His voice was cold, just like his icy stare that never shifted from me as he spoke.</p><p>I blinked several times, unable to grasp the meaning of his words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d My voice failed me.</p><p>\u201cYou understood right, Brooke,\u201d Robert Mayfield said calmly. \u201cTomorrow you\u2019ll leave New York and Jett. You\u2019ll disappear\u2014just like me. You won\u2019t get in touch with my son, nor with your family or friends. Everybody you ever knew will believe you disappeared without a trace.\u201d His voice dropped to a whisper as he leaned so close I could smell the alcohol on his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about running or not accepting my offer. I\u2019ll make sure no one will ever find you. My people will watch you to see if you follow the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want the money.\u201d I shook my head vehemently. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going anywhere. You can\u2019t stop me from seeing Jett or my family. People mean more to me than financial gain.\u201d The thought of losing Jett, my family, my old life, scared and angered me. \u201cYou can have the book, but I\u2019m not leaving my old life behind. I\u2019m declining your offer.\u201d My legs were shaking so badly I feared they might buckle beneath me, but my voice was surprisingly composed.</p><p>\u201cYou will want it.\u201d His voice was so forceful I flinched. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Brooke. If your family, friends, or Jett mean anything to you, anything at all, you\u2019d better do what I say, or I\u2019ll make them go away. Just like that.\u201d He snapped his fingers. His lips curled into a smile, but his eyes betrayed his real emotions. \u201cYou have no choice. If you want them alive and safe, you\u2019ll bring me the book and leave your life behind without telling anyone.\u201d</p><p>I interlaced my hands in my lap to stop them from shaking.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d For some reason I felt the urge to appeal to the human part of him because, in my stupidity, I thought there had to be one.</p><p>\u201cLeave me no choice, and I will,\u201d he said, misinterpreting my gesture, and retrieved a jewelry box the size of his palm from a compartment, then opened it and handed it to me. I stared at the piece of jewelry in silence. Of course it could be anyone\u2019s but I knew it was Sylvie\u2019s missing tennis bracelet, and the thought scared the crap out of me.</p><p>\u201cShe was asleep. Didn\u2019t even notice the two men breaking in and unclasping it from her wrist. I know everything about her. The places she visits, the people she meets. Let\u2019s say, one Thursday evening she visits Vixen\u2019s into the early morning hours, the way she always does, but this time she\u2019s not making it home, and no one will ever know what happened to her.\u2019</p><p>The threat hung heavy in the air. I swallowed hard to get rid of the bile rising in my throat. My head felt heavy and tired, and my lungs burned, as though I had been underwater for too long and couldn\u2019t come up for air.</p><p>\u201cIf I do what you say, what guarantee do I have that you\u2019ll keep your word and not harm them?\u201d I raised my brows. \u201cOr me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. My word should suffice.\u201d His eyes were probing mine, challenging me, observing. They reminded me of a hawk\u2014ready to catch his prey. The limousine came to a halt, but the engine continued to whirr softly. A traffic light, I assumed. People and cars all around us. And yet no one could peek inside, no one could be alerted to this most bizarre situation.</p><p>The car began to move again, rolling slowly, then picking up speed. In the silence of the car, I watched him adjust his tie. It was just a tiny movement but enough to tell me he was getting annoyed with me.</p><p>\u201cA rented apartment\u2019s waiting for you in Oregon,\u201d Robert Mayfield said. \u201cTomorrow my driver will pick you up from the underground parking garage at eleven a.m. Don\u2019t take anything with you except for your handbag with the book. You\u2019ll be provided with everything you need for your new life, your flight tickets, and your new passport. The money will be in your new bank account. I\u2019ll get in touch with you once you\u2019re in Oregon. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep you away from Jett. If you break one rule, your friend is the first one to go.\u201d</p><p>His tone was serious. Something rose within in me\u2014despair; hopelessness at the prospect of abandoning Jett, my family and Sylvie; fury that Robert Mayfield hated the idea of Jett dating me. This was my last chance to change his mind. If I didn\u2019t try, I\u2019d regret it.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want me out of Jett\u2019s life?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat if I break up with him and give you the book? I could still stay in New York but keep away from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you listening?\u201d He cut me off. I stared at him in shock. \u201cLet me make it clear to you, Brooke. You have no choice.\u201d</p><p>He wiped imaginary lint from his slacks before crossing his legs and leaning back, self-satisfied. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019d hate to see you suffer more than necessary. Your sister was a pretty hard loss.\u201d I swallowed down the knot in my throat. So he knew about my family and my past. No big news. Nothing to scare me there. What scared me was the fact I didn\u2019t know him and consequently didn\u2019t know what he was capable of. He pressed a button. The passenger\u2019s door opened, but I didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t call for help. Never before was freedom so close and yet so far away.</p><p>\u201cThis meeting never happened. If any word gets out or you try to seek help, I\u2019ll make you and all the people in your life pay. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking you can outwit me because you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><p>Pleased with my reply, his smile widened. \u201cGood. I\u2019m happy we\u2019ve come to an agreement. This might be hard to believe at this point, but I\u2019m doing you and your child a favor.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped.</p><p>How the hell did he know about the pregnancy?</p><p>The only people I had talked with were Jett and Sylvie who probably told Kenny.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say I have my own resources,\u201d Robert Mayfield said, as if sensing my shock. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watched ever since you entered Jett\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>How?</p><p>And then the answer dawned on me. Emma. How could I forget her? She was always there, listening, watching. She had brought Jett\u2019s bouquet of roses and had probably read the card tucked inside. And she had dated Robert. She told me so herself when I commenced my initial position with Mayfield Realties. She was more inconspicuous than a private investigator.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. Eleven a.m. sharp.\u201d He pointed at the door. \u201cWe\u2019re done for today.\u201d He nodded meaningfully, waiting for me to leave. Without a look back, I exited the limousine. With my heart pounding in my chest and my mind a blurry mess, I slammed the door shut and stood glued to the spot. The reality of what happened hit me so hard I couldn\u2019t form a coherent thought. Long after the limousine drove away, I didn\u2019t move. Minutes passed. People walked past, some cursing, some simply dodging me. A few cast curious glances my way, and still I remained frozen in place, locked in time and space\u2014until someone stepped in front of me and squeezed my arm gently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou okay, miss?\u201d</p><p>I raised my gaze to peer at a guy, late fifties, dressed in dirty pants and a jacket that had seen better days. A guitar dangled on his back, kept in place by a frayed leather strap. I nodded and he raised a plastic bottle, offering me what looked like orange juice. I shook my head and opened my bag to pull out my wallet, the way I always did when I saw a person in need.</p><p>\u201cI have no need for it,\u201d I said, pushing all the banknotes into his hand. It was the truth. Soon I would live a different life with a new identity and spend money I didn\u2019t earn. Robert Mayfield could buy me a new identity, but he couldn\u2019t buy me love. He couldn\u2019t buy me happiness. A family or a place that felt like home.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill yourself.\u201d He held my arm, his warm hand not able to penetrate the cold blanket covering my heart. Even though I hadn\u2019t been thinking of committing suicide, I knew I had been close to forming the thought. So very close to it, because I felt like jumping off a cliff. Step in front of a car. Drown to stop the pictures of the happy and familiar faces flickering before my eyes.</p> <p>I would raise a child on my own while Jett wouldn\u2019t stop searching for us. Eventually he\u2019d believe I had left him, or that we were dead. I knew what death brought upon people and didn\u2019t want anyone who cared about me to go through so much pain. The guilt would kill me slowly.</p><p>Where lay the difference between starting a new life\u2014full of emptiness and loneliness, knowing that my absence caused pain to those who loved me\u2014or stopping it right now to enter complete darkness? A place where I could rest and forget, where something like a conscience might not exist.</p><p>I swallowed hard as I considered my options.</p><p>The outlook of forgetting was pleasing. Much more than a new life with happy memories haunting me, reminding me of all the things I had lost. Living a life that was forced upon me, rather than chosen by me, was senseless. I didn\u2019t want to go through that kind of agony.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill yourself,\u201d he repeated, his pale gray eyes interlocking with mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t entirely my intention,\u201d I whispered, \u201cbut thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case new cannot always replace the old.\u201d He let go of my arm.</p><p>I frowned. Did he think I was involved in a love triangle and couldn\u2019t decide? I opened my mouth to set things straight when he cut me off. \u201cWhatever you decide, never choose the most straightforward option. Believe me when I tell you this: the easiest choice is always the wrong one. Choose the path that matters in the long term, the choice that would never hurt others. It might seem difficult at this point, but the right choice is the one that takes the most courage. It\u2019s the one that seems impossible at first.\u201d</p><p>He pressed my money into my palms and then he cupped my hands in his, the roughness of his fingertips chafing my skin.</p><p>\u201cPlease, keep it,\u201d I said, weakly.</p><p>He shook his head but didn\u2019t let go. \u201cEven the best of us have bad days. We fall, we climb. That\u2019s life. I can promise you, your worst day is never your worst. Your worst day\u2019s the day you realize you gave up too soon and you can no longer rectify your mistake.\u201d He scanned my face, waiting for his words to sink in. My throat was tight from the knowledge he was right despite not knowing me. He was so close to the truth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I have no choice?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat if that choice was taken from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice. Maybe not now. Maybe not tomorrow. But life never stays the same. Sooner or later, maybe in a few days or a few weeks, something you never thought possible will happen. That\u2019s the beauty of fate.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, overwhelmed by the fact that of all the people who had walked past me, it was the poor and probably homeless man who showed compassion still existed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, kid.\u201d He smiled gently. \u201cGod would never give you a situation you didn\u2019t possess the strength to handle. You have everything you need to deal with that situation within you. The only thing missing is courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered, meaning every word. \u201cPlease take the money.\u201d I gently pulled my hands away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head again.</p><p>\u201cBut I insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me play a song for you so your generosity makes sense.\u201d He sat down on the pavement, back pressed against the dirty wall of a building, and began to strum the chords. I recognized the song. Tears formed in my eyes as I listened in silence to the old man\u2019s soft voice as he sang Tears in Heaven. When he finished, I realized I knew what to do.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a gift,\u201d I whispered. \u201cYou touch people.\u201d</p><p>With a last smile at him, I started to walk slowly as my mind kept circling around his words.</p><p>We were two random strangers, and yet he decided to listen. Even when he had no idea what I was talking about, he was right. I couldn\u2019t do what I wanted. I couldn\u2019t stay with Jett just because I loved him and couldn\u2019t bear to be without him. I had to stop thinking about myself and to start caring for the safety of those who mattered. It would be hard to leave them behind, but it would also be selfish of me not to.</p><p>Maybe Robert Mayfield was bluffing, but at this point I couldn\u2019t risk not believing him.</p><p>It would be the hardest decision I had ever made, but it was the right choice. It would be the choice that would come with the smallest risk\u2014a broken heart. I could deal with that, but I wouldn\u2019t cope with fear and regret keeping me awake at night, knowing their lives might be at risk because of me. And if this man was right, maybe sooner or later, hopefully not too late, the tides of life might turn in my favor.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>THE WALK TO Jett\u2019s expensive neighborhood was long but gave me enough time to understand what had just happened. By the time I arrived at Jett\u2019s apartment, the sun was long gone and my mind had settled, accepting that fate had made my decision for me, which meant this would be my last day with Jett.</p><p>I greeted the concierge in the foyer and rode the elevator up to Jett\u2019s penthouse, my gaze shying away from the mirror. I couldn\u2019t bear to look at myself because my image reminded me that soon I wouldn\u2019t be Brooke anymore. I pulled the keys out of my handbag and let myself in. For the umpteenth time, I wondered how Jett would react if he knew his father was still alive and that he was the threat Jett feared. Would he believe me?</p><p>Feeling tired and defeated, I opened the door, expecting an empty apartment since Jett spent much of his time at the office lately\u2014until I saw the lights switched on.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Jett was standing in the doorway, his hands buried in his pockets, a frown on his face.</p><p>\u201cI grabbed a coffee with Sylvie.\u201d I avoided his gaze as I kicked off my high heels. \u201cWe had a girl talk. You know Sylvie. She couldn\u2019t wait to tell me all about her relationship with Kenny and her new job offer, so I stayed a little longer than anticipated.\u201d</p><p>I peered up at him and instantly noticed the dark shadows under his eyes and the soft line on his forehead. As much as I wished to hug him, I couldn\u2019t because I was afraid I\u2019d break down in tears if I did.</p><p>Change the topic. Don\u2019t think of tomorrow. Don\u2019t go there.</p><p>\u201cHow did your business meeting go?\u201d I asked casually. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be back this early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been delayed.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cNate has decided to stay with us for a while to help me go over the data. If we\u2019re lucky, we won\u2019t have to sell shares in the company. As soon as everything\u2019s sorted out, I hope we\u2019ll have more time for ourselves.\u201d He walked over and wrapped his arms around my waist, pulling me against him.</p><p>My heart felt as though it was being ripped apart. I cast my eyes down and leaned my head against his chest, the reminder we would not spend any more time together too painful.</p><p>\u201cToday all I could think of was you. Naked. In my bed. I\u2019ve missed that. I\u2019ve missed you. Like fucking crazy,\u201d he whispered and kissed my neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful my brother\u2019s staying because it makes things so much easier. I\u2019m looking forward to spending more time with you, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help myself. Tears started to roll down my cheeks. I buried my face against his chest in the hope he wouldn\u2019t see them as I fought against the tornado threatening to rip my chest apart. My fingertips brushed his neck. Hearing the sound of his voice and the steady rhythm of his breathing, smelling his scent and feeling the warmth of his body\u2014was just too much. I couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>They reminded me too much that in a little more than sixteen hours, our time was up. I swallowed hard to get rid of the bile in my throat, which only made my tears fall harder. I could feel the first wave of sobs rippling through my chest. If he kept going like that, I\u2019d break down. I couldn\u2019t afford that, so I stepped back and turned away hastily, heading straight for the bathroom as fast as I could and locking the door behind me. Pounding steps followed right behind. A moment later, he knocked.</p><p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d His tone sharpened with a layer of worry. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>My heart pounded painfully hard, the tiny movements piercing me like knives. I wiped the tears away with my sleeve and drew slow, measured breaths to calm myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d My voice shook.</p><p>\u201cDid I say something wrong? I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>How could I tell him that, yes, he had done something wrong by saying all the right things?</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s me.\u201d I inhaled and held my breath as my heartbeat spiked again. \u201cI\u2019m tired, emotional, and a little bit sick. My hormones are acting up, which is normal.\u201d</p><p>That part was true. My gynecologist had told me when I went to see him to confirm the pregnancy upon my return from Italy.</p><p>\u201cWant me to get you anything? Maybe order dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head even though he couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to keep anything down.\u201d</p><p>God, it was so hard to pretend in front of him but so much easier to lie behind closed doors. I\u2019d never let him see how broken I was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath and go to bed early.\u201d I paused for his answer. When it didn\u2019t come, I continued, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Just give me a little time alone, Jett. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>We fell silent, but I knew he lingered outside. Inches separated us, and yet they felt like miles of sand-covered dunes ready to pull us apart if we tried to near each other. He might not know me well enough, but he was an expert in reading body language. If I opened the door, I feared I might confess. I had to stay strong, for myself, for him, for our baby\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cBrooke.\u201d His voice was like silk caressing my senses.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I held my breath.</p><p>He let out a sharp breath. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been neglecting you\u2014us\u2014those past few days.\u201d His hand brushed over the door. Or maybe he was leaning against it. I couldn\u2019t tell, but I imagined him out there, sensing something, worrying, and my heart broke just a little bit more. \u201dI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t spend as much time with you as usual. I just didn\u2019t want to stress you out with my problems.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes moistened again. I wanted to assure him that I understood because I knew that losing his father had been hard on him, but didn\u2019t. Instead I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out for dinner tomorrow after work. I\u2019ll book us a table wherever you want. You pick.\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>By tomorrow evening, I\u2019d be in Oregon and Jett would be waiting for me, wondering where I was. He\u2019d call my cell, then Sylvie\u2019s, after which his worry would magnify. How long would he wait before filing a missing person report? Would he hire Kenny again to find me? Probably, only this time there would be no credit card purchases and no flight tickets to show me boarding a plane. Tears ran down my face. There would be many more in a future that seemed blank and depressing without him.</p> <p>\u201cBaby?\u201d Jett said, jerking me out of my depressing thoughts. His tone was pleading, and I realized he had misinterpreted my silence. \u201cI want to make it up to you. Maybe this weekend. No phones. No work. Just you and me, white beaches, and good food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d I smiled bitterly, meaning every word. Now was the time to tell him all the things I wouldn\u2019t get the chance to say to him in the future. I thought of the one thing I could say without raising his suspicion. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wish for a better boyfriend than you, Jett. Thank you for always being here for me and for loving me the way I am.\u201d</p><p>Thanks for everything.</p><p>I walked over to the huge corner bathtub and turned on the cold-water stream, and shrugged out of my clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in my office,\u201d Jett said softly. \u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d</p> <p>I waited until he walked away. Only when I was completely sure he was gone did I step into the freezing water, knowing that not even the cold could numb the pain. Pulling myself under until my body was submerged with the only sound the beating of my heart drumming hard in my ears, I let my tears flow freely.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>I CONSIDERED MYSELF blessed. I truly did. I had experienced love. I had met that someone special who made my heart flutter and, most importantly, reciprocated my feelings. I had a best friend who\u2019d always be there for me. I was blessed, because I had lived.</p><p>Better love and lose than never love at all.</p><p>I kept telling myself that every single second of every hour that passed. So why was it so hard to let go when time demanded that we part? Life didn\u2019t always warn us when we had to say goodbye. If we knew when it was time to leave, maybe we\u2019d make more of an effort to spend as many moments as possible with the people we loved. And there lay my problem\u2014even though I knew my moments were counted, I couldn\u2019t deal with it.</p><p>I sat in a dark place, on an unknown road, with absolutely no clue where I was headed. Desperation washed over me as I realized I might never experience this kind of happiness again. I\u2019d never meet someone as great as Jett. Knowing I\u2019d lose him brought out the worst in me. A part of me wanted to write a letter to tell him how truly happy I had been with him. I wanted him to know just how much I had looked forward to a future full of happiness. And yet I couldn\u2019t. If Jett thought I had died, this letter would never bring him consolation; it would bring him guilt. I decided to do it the hard way\u2014no letters, no hints, nothing to trace back to this one moment.</p> <p>By the time Jett finished up work, it was past midnight. Apart from a sliver of moonlight falling in through the pulled curtains, the bedroom was bathed in darkness. The mattress groaned under Jett\u2019s weight, as he lay down gently, careful not to wake me. My eyes remained closed, but I could sense his gaze on me. His arm wrapped around me, barely touching my skin, and his warm breath tickled the nape of my neck. Eventually his breathing slowed down.</p><p>Even in the darkness of the room with nothing but the feeling of his arms around me, my mind continued to seek him, as if he was already far away. I lay awake facing the digital watch. With every minute that passed, with every hour that went by, my dread intensified. At 3.15 a.m., Jett stirred and I turned to regard his sleeping features. My heart broke at the sight. Careful not to wake him, I let my fingers trace the contours of his face. But Jett had always been a light sleeper. He opened his eyes groggily and pulled me to his chest.</p><p>\u201cTrouble sleeping?\u201d</p><p>My throat was so choked with emotion I couldn\u2019t reply. Instead, I just nodded. There were no more words to say, so my lips touched his mouth gently. It was just a brief kiss, but enough to wake him up instantly.</p><p>I smiled. It was a bitter kind of smile as my fingers touched his naked chest, marveling at the smoothness of his skin and the warmth seeping into my body. It took him only a second to process where I was heading, and then his hands slid around my head as I kissed him again. I thought crushing my lips against his would help subdue the pain. That it\u2019d bring me relief by stealing that one last kiss. Instead it ate me up from the inside. Breaking me apart.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d I whispered against his lips, and climbed on top of him. \u201cDeeply. Whatever you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it? In the middle of the night?\u201d He sounded unconvinced. In the moonlight his green eyes shimmered dark, every trace of sleep gone.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>I had been wrong. The pain wasn\u2019t breaking my heart; it was killing me. I wanted to have it ripped out of my body. Fucked out of my system. Tomorrow had become today, and I didn\u2019t want to think about it anymore.</p><p>\u201cI want it rough,\u201d I said. \u201cI want you to fuck me like you don\u2019t care about me. Like I\u2019m just a stranger.\u201d</p><p>The air between us was charged with questions unspoken. I could feel Jett\u2019s hesitation, his doubts, his confusion.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d He sat up and pushed me away gently but definitely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Rejecting me when I needed it the most was the last thing I expected.</p><p>I was so furious, I slapped him. Not hard, but hard enough to make him look up. I tried slapping him again, but this time he caught my wrists, pulling me close to him.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, no,\u201d he said, determined. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of person.\u201d</p><p>I yanked my arms away, but he didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Jett. I need you right now,\u201d I whispered. I bent forward to kiss him again but he withdrew with a confused expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cBack in the Hamptons you said you\u2019re not into rough sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s what I need now. Please. Don\u2019t you see that I\u2019m asking you? I want you to fuck me hard.\u201d I rocked my hips against his groin, not wanting to give up. \u201cPlease.\u201d He didn\u2019t pull back, which showed me his resolution was weakening.</p><p>I inched closer again to kiss him, and this time he responded the way I expected him to. He let go of my hand and flipped me back on the bed, positioning himself on top of me. His mouth hit mine with such ferocity, it knocked all the air out of me. I looked up, suddenly scared. His eyes shimmered with a dangerous glint, and there was just the hint of a smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou want it rough, baby? If that\u2019s what you need, you\u2019ll get it.\u201d His knees squeezed between my legs, parting them. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have it my way.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>JETT MAYFIELD WAS the first one to reciprocate my love and set my heart on fire. He was my summer love, and my feelings for him were real. I knew because I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of him being with someone else. My mind kept seeking him whenever he wasn\u2019t with me, and my heart trembled just hearing the sound of his name. Intermingled with my love and the happiness I felt around him, there was sadness\u2014a black heavy sadness coming from a sudden but ugly awareness that not everything in life is meant to last. To taste happiness in pieces and then have it taken from you, leaving behind nothing but jaded memories that are like bullets, tearing you open, wounding you, scattering you into a million fragments\u2014I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready for that just yet.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I could face a future without him.</p><p>I stood in front of the bathroom mirror and stroked my hand over my belly, as if the motion could protect my unborn child from the knowledge that I was about to break the trust of the one I loved. I was doing it for us. It was better for us. If he knew what I was about to do today, that I\u2019d break my promise and leave him, he\u2019d try to stop me. I just knew. I couldn\u2019t risk anyone hurting him. I\u2019d rather it was me who ended up hurt.</p><p>At five a.m., I dressed in the bathroom, grabbed my bag, and left. I didn\u2019t even bother to take a shower or put on makeup. Fuck my appearance. There were more important things to take care of.</p><p>It was a new dawn\u2014a dark dawn\u2014as I took a taxi to Mayfield Realties and told the driver to stop a block away. He wasn\u2019t thrilled to let me walk the distance but didn\u2019t argue. I paid and stepped out into the chilly morning air, wrapping my jacket around me as I headed in the opposite direction. In a little more than five hours I\u2019d be driving to the airport. If I wanted to initiate changes, I had to do it before anyone noticed.</p><p>Maybe Robert Mayfield thought he could remove me from Jett\u2019s life, but he couldn\u2019t take away my dignity or sense of justice. He\u2019d get the book he desperately wanted, but I had no intention of giving him the disk, and I sure had no intention of making him aware of its existence.</p><p>I stepped into the self-service kiosk of a hotel lobby and jotted down Sylvie\u2019s address on a prepaid flat-rate envelope and sealed the disk inside. Angered by the ugly awareness that I could never tell Sylvie what really happened, nor include a letter, I paid with the only prepaid credit card I owned and left the kiosk, hoping the envelope would arrive safely; hoping that somehow Sylvie would understand the silent message. I knew she\u2019d feel the urgency. She\u2019d know what to do. They might never find me, but with Kenny by her side, maybe they could still unravel the secret of the Lucazzone estate.</p><p>Leaning against the cold wall of the building, I felt better. Hopeful almost. Not about my future, but about the fact that Robert Mayfield hadn\u2019t won. I wondered what would happen to the beautiful Italian mansion once the lawyer realized the heiress was gone. Would Alessandro Lucazzone sell? Would Jett still be inclined to buy?</p><p>With the sun rising, the streets began to fill with life. I walked the short distance to my office and let myself into the foyer. The morning security guards exchanged glances as I showed them my ID.</p><p>\u201cBusy day,\u201d I mumbled by means of explanation. I ignored their chatter and headed for the elevator, ready for the second part of my plan.</p><p>I had every intention to make my last day in my job as painless to everyone as possible\u2014even if that involved keeping people at a safe distance and, in Jett\u2019s case, breaking up with him. It was a necessity, and the only way he\u2019d move on with his life sooner rather than later. If only I could find a way to make him believe I didn\u2019t care about him, I knew I\u2019d feel better knowing he wouldn\u2019t be hurt by the way I\u2019d suddenly disappeared from his life forever.</p><p>I was about to finish sorting through the papers for the first conference meeting and placing files back in the cabinet when I heard Jett\u2019s voice down the hall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs Brooke inside?\u201d</p><p>Someone answered, and within seconds the door was thrown open without so much as a knock. He was angry, and he made no secret of it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d</p><p>I remained silent. He moved around the desk and stood in front of me, arms pressed against the cabinet, inches away from my face. His impressive stature blocking my sight, I had no choice but to meet his gaze and answer his question.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, so I came to work early.\u201d I pretended to search through the folders, trying to find the one I needed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d His eyes scanned me up and down, noticing, analyzing. I had been stupid to think Jett wouldn\u2019t pick up on my emotional undercurrents.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a big deal. You were asleep, and I didn\u2019t want to wake you. Don\u2019t blow it all out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cDid I hurt you last night? Is that why you\u2019re mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I frowned, thinking back to our lovemaking session. He had been rough but not to the point of hurting me. \u201cI wanted it. Remember?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes continued to scan my face, my business suit, and then he noticed the dark bruise on my arm\u2014the result of my unfortunate encounter with Jett\u2019s father. I almost stopped breathing when he grabbed my wrist and held it up. I had seen it the previous night while soaking in the bathtub, but he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI fell. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed on me as he considered whether to believe me. Something flickered in them, and I knew I had to come up with a better lie.</p><p>Damn!</p><p>He was being suspicious, and I had never been a good liar. I walked over to the window, putting as much distance as possible between us, and turned away. In a little more than half an hour I was expected to get into a car and leave everything behind. Now was the time to release him.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working, Jett. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea we\u2019re dating.\u201d The words flowed so fast from my lips, I could barely think. I held my breath and bit my lip hard to keep myself from looking at him. The room was so quiet my heartbeat sounded like a drum counting down the seconds in my ears.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he finally asked. His tone was cold, any trace of his love for me gone. I shuddered and pushed my hesitation to the back of my mind.</p><p>\u201cWe rushed into this and I\u2014\u201d My voice failed me. Even though we weren\u2019t touching, I could feel him all around me. He was beautiful and so very angry. The pressure behind my eyes grew stronger. I lowered my head so I wouldn\u2019t give in to the magnetic pull urging me to look at him just one more time. \u201cI think we should take a break.\u201d</p><p>He inched closer. His fingers clasped around my shoulder, and I had no choice but to turn and face him. I expected anger, sadness, indifference, anything but\u2014</p><p>Gentleness.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of, Brooke?\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with unshed tears before I could stop them. I didn\u2019t see this reaction coming and had no idea what to say to him. That I worried for everyone\u2019s safety because I wasn\u2019t welcome in his family?</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m afraid of the fact that you mean more to me than any other person ever will,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not used to having such feelings. They scare the hell out of me.\u201d</p> <p>His fingers settled beneath my chin and pushed lightly, forcing me to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not why you\u2019d break up. What\u2019s the real reason?\u201d</p><p>His words didn\u2019t manage to settle the storm inside me\u2014they made it worse because they reminded me just how much I believed him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d I said before I could stop myself. \u201cMaybe I want to, but that\u2019s not an option for me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me confused. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? We always have a choice, Brooke.\u201d I had heard it all before. Everyone seemed to mention choices lately. I should never have started, because Jett wouldn\u2019t understand. No one could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of loving you, Jett. I\u2019m afraid of what it might mean for us...and my child.\u201d His eyes narrowed on me, and the glint of anger from before resurfaced. I swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t think what we have is healthy. I just think\u2014\u201dI stopped in mid sentence, for a moment lost in the magic of his green eyes rimmed by dark, long lashes. \u201cThere\u2019s no assurance in life that\u2019ll last. I want to get away from you before we collide. Just because we were meant to meet doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re meant to last.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me with a look that said he couldn\u2019t understand me, that I was crazy. Maybe I was crazy to give it all up, but he didn\u2019t know my dilemma, and his drawing at straws and trying to understand when I was running out of time made me desperate.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Brooke!\u201d Glowering, he wiped his hand over his face in fury. The intensity in his eyes made me flinch. \u201dI thought we had left all those fears and insecurities behind us. I thought you had learned to trust me that I\u2019m not going anywhere after the baby\u2019s born\u2014if that\u2019s even what you\u2019re so worried about. Obviously, I don\u2019t know, because I\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d His shoulders slumped, the tense expression on his way giving away his disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. There\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019ll last. But there\u2019s one truth, Brooke. A simple naked truth that I\u2019d do anything for you. Do you know why? Because I don\u2019t care about anyone but you. I don\u2019t care that you have issues. I don\u2019t care that you don\u2019t trust me. My feelings for you will never change.\u201d</p><p>The heaviness in the air was oppressing\u2014the sea was about to crash upon me. I smiled to hide my tears. He didn\u2019t return my smile, and his voice was cold as he spoke. \u201cThe baby\u2019s not yours, it\u2019s ours. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d let you raise her alone. Maybe we\u2019ll collide someday, but you know what? We\u2019ll make up, because what we have isn\u2019t something that will crumble easily.\u201d</p><p>A knock on the door, and Emma\u2019s head popped in. Jett\u2019s expression changed to an angry frown at the disruption.</p><p>\u201cMiss Stewart? Your meeting\u2019s about to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us five minutes,\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d I turned my head from Emma to Jett and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Gotta go.\u201d</p><p>The door closed behind Emma. Grabbing my handbag, I stopped and shot Jett a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s talk over dinner.\u201d</p><p>A dinner that will never take place.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He hesitated. My body burned to touch him one last time. Run my fingers through his hair. Kiss him so I\u2019d remember the taste of his lips forever. Instead, I bit my lip hard until I drew blood, grabbed my handbag and a folder, and walked past. His hand gripped my arm, stopping me.</p><p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d</p><p>I froze to the spot, unable to respond, unable to turn around as an electric shock ran down my spine. There was no point in saying anything else. No point in trying when I had failed. He wasn\u2019t released. He wouldn\u2019t be for a long time.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t break up with me. I won\u2019t let it happen,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me, I understand, and you\u2019re free to go because I want to see you happy. But if you love me the way I love you, I won\u2019t let you go. I\u2019m not giving up on us. I can\u2019t force you to love me just as you can\u2019t force me to stop loving you.\u201d</p><p>And then he let me go. I walked out of the door, away from him, away from his promises and the future I had looked forward to. My feet carried me so fast I barely acknowledged the people in the corridor and in the elevator.</p><p>Walk. Walk. Walk. Do not think. Do not feel. Do not look back. Just walk.</p><p>Never in my life did I force myself so hard to get away from the one person I loved the most.</p><p>My cheeks were damp with tears, and I wiped at them angrily. Life sucked. Absorbed in my thoughts, I didn\u2019t notice the guy around the corner\u2014until I bumped into him and his soda can dropped to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Nate\u2019s arm went around my waist, steadying me.</p><p>He was standing in front of a vending machine. I picked up his soda can from the floor and gave it back to him. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He pointed at my lip. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I wiped away the blood with the back of my hand and ran the tip of my tongue over my lip to stop the flow. \u201cJust having a bad day. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>The excuse came out effortlessly, probably because it wasn\u2019t much of a lie. I wasn\u2019t just having a bad day; I was having the day from hell.</p><p>As I met his gaze and smiled, something passed between us.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all.\u201d He smirked. \u201cWant to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, wishing I could tell him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure my brother told you, but I\u2019m staying for a few weeks to sort out the issues my father\u2019s death caused,\u201d Nate said. \u201cWe\u2019re researching a new brand image.\u201d</p><p>My brows shot up. Mayfield Realties was huge and successful already. Why would anyone want to change anything about the that? \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the company as it is?\u201d</p><p>He shot me a quizzical look and lowered his voice. \u201cI assumed you already knew we\u2019ve been in trouble for a while. Internal changes have been initiated.\u201d He opened his can and took a sip, his eyes never leaving mine. \u201cJett\u2019s been working around the clock the past few days to save what\u2019s left before the media get hold of it. We\u2019ve been looking into ways to transfer all our employees and their positions to other branches, but\u2014\u201d He clicked his tongue, leaving the rest open to interpretation.</p><p>He took another sip and then pointed at the vending machine. I shook my head, declining his silent offer. Too many thoughts kept swirling inside my head: Jett working around the clock...new company...people being transferred.</p><p>His eyes focused on my lips, and I wondered whether I was still bleeding.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to talk about it?\u201d Nate\u2019s voice pulled me out of my trance. I peered at the analog clock above his head. It was almost eleven a.m. The red pointer scared me the most, because with every second that passed it kept making a ticking sound reminding me of TNT ready to blow up.</p><p>\u201cMaybe another time.\u201d The words stumbled out all mumbled. \u201cNate, my conference meeting is starting in a few minutes. Do you mind taking notes for me? Just for a few minutes. I need to use the restroom. Everything you might need is in there.\u201d I pressed my folder into his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo prob.\u201d He smiled, the smooth skin beneath his eyes crinkling a little. \u201cYou can repay me later.\u201d</p><p>I pointed at Conference Room 1, and we walked the short distance together. Through the glass partition I saw my team had already gathered and were chatting animatedly.</p><p>I squeezed Nate\u2019s arm. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nate entered and waved, then said something and the meeting started, the voices of my colleagues not able to penetrate the chaos of thoughts flooding my mind. They were an effective team, and I was thankful for the opportunity to have worked with them.</p><p>With a twisting sensation in the pit of my stomach, I checked that the book was still inside my handbag, just as ominous as before, and just as cursed for ruining my life.</p><p>The clock ticked.</p> <p>It was time.</p><p>Fighting the nausea bubbling up inside me, I made my way to the underground parking garage. The air was cold down here and a shiver ran down my spine, but my mind spun in a feverish trance, my stomach twisting like an evil snake. I reached the first level and stopped, realizing Robert Mayfield had never told me where to meet him. That\u2019s when I recognized the guy with the \u201cI love NY\u201d T-shirt peering from under a suit jacket. His blond hair was combed back in a slick style, revealing the smooth face and stony features of someone who I guessed never smiled. When he noticed me, he gestured at a black sedan with tinted windows.</p><p>I scanned the area even though I hadn\u2019t really expected Robert Mayfield to turn up.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d tourist guy said.</p><p>My heart pounded hard against my chest as I slipped into the back seat and he slammed the door shut, locking me inside. He jumped into the driver\u2019s seat and started the engine, but didn\u2019t drive off.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have the book?\u201d His English was perfect, not even a hint of an accent to suggest he had ever lived anywhere but in New York. I had been an idiot to fall for his trick, believing he was a foreigner. My glance met his in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I reached into my handbag and retrieved what he wanted, then handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell anyone about this?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept my part of the bargain,\u201d I replied through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cDo you see the black leather briefcase?\u201d</p> <p>It was at my feet\u2014a huge ugly thing\u2014the sort you see in movies with money in it.</p><p>\u201cEverything you need is in there,\u201d he said. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>I lifted it. It was heavy and locked, and something I didn\u2019t want to touch. \u201cI don\u2019t know the number combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut in the zip code of the Empire State Building.\u201d He smiled, self-assured, probably thinking I wouldn\u2019t know the zip codes of the only five buildings that were large enough to have their own codes.</p><p>My jaw jutted up. \u201cThat would be 10118.\u201d I typed in the number, and the case opened with a click. Robert Mayfield hadn\u2019t lied. Stacked inside were documents and a new passport, as well as cash and a few credit cards. I opened the passport and stared at the photograph I had provided to get my staff ID card. The name read Carol Laura Harley.</p><p>Was that supposed to be my new name? I scanned the rest. Even my birthdate and birthplace were different. In my new identity I was two years younger and born in Oregon. I turned the passport around. It looked old and genuine, and the corners were slightly flaked as though it used to belong to someone else and my picture had somehow been inserted inside. Robert Mayfield wasn\u2019t the clean and genuine guy everyone made him out to be.</p><p>Judging from the driver\u2019s impatient glance, we were on a schedule. I put the passport away and folded my hands in my lap, unsure what to do. The driver kept watching me, and for a second I thought I detected pity in his expression. Maybe his job was more demanding than I thought. Being Robert Mayfield\u2019s driver probably also included the duty of beating the crap out of people\u2014or worse.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there. Don\u2019t even think what this guy could do to you.</p> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked. \u201cYour flight leaves soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I buckled up the seatbelt. He started the engine and pulled out of the parking lot.</p><p>That\u2019s it, Stewart. Say goodbye to your life.</p><p>From the periphery of my eye I caught a dark blur heading toward us. I turned but too late. The car hit us sideways with a loud thud. My head banged against the window. In the same moment the seatbelt tightened across my chest, crushing all the air out of my lungs.</p><p>It all happened too fast. I peered around me, too shocked to fully grasp the situation, when the front door was yanked open. Hands pulled out the driver, and a stifled gunshot echoed. I froze, unsure whether to jump out of the car or hide. In the two seconds it took me to decide a guy slumped into the driver\u2019s seat. Our eyes connected in the rearview mirror. In his oversized sweater and ripped jeans, he didn\u2019t look like anyone Robert Mayfield would employ.</p><p>I snorted. Seriously? I was being car-jacked? I opened my mouth to scream for help when the front passenger door opened and a guy jumped into the passenger seat, pointing a gun with a silencer at me. I whimpered, but the sound remained trapped in my throat.</p><p>\u201cWe got her,\u201d he said slowly into his phone.</p><p>My heart began to race against my ribcage at the realization this wasn\u2019t a random car-jacking, or an accident. They were after me. Judging from the guy\u2019s smug grin, they had planned this move.</p><p>PART 2</p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>Jett</p><p>IT ALL SEEMED like a memory, a dream, hard to grasp and to explain, and so difficult for her to accept, as if she couldn\u2019t allow happiness to happen to her. Right from the start, I knew Brooke would have trouble trusting me. But breaking up with me when things were going well made no sense.</p><p>For the past few hours I had been trying to focus on the spreadsheets on my computer screen. At some point they had become nothing but a big smudge of unrelated numbers because my mind kept circling around the thought that Brooke was hiding something. I had seen it in her face, heard it in her voice. She wasn\u2019t a particularly good liar. In fact, she couldn\u2019t lie if her life depended on it. She might fool the people around her, but she couldn\u2019t fool me, and I had every intention of making it clear tonight at dinner. I\u2019d put a stop to her nonsensical fears because she was my woman, and if that meant literally forcing her to sit down and talk, then so be it.</p><p>\u201cPlease take a seat, sir. Mr. Mayfield will be with you shortly,\u201d one of my assistants said to a board member in the hall. \u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>I glowered and wished I had closed the damn door and pretended I wasn\u2019t available instead of having to deal with yet another client who was afraid he\u2019d lose his money once the shares crashed and burned. Ever since the news broke about my father\u2019s death, people had started to question the credibility of the company, as though it hadn\u2019t been I who\u2019d brought in most of the major deals ever since I joined Mayfield Realties.</p><p>In the past few weeks I had been working on setting up my own company. I had invested everything I had\u2014my money, my apartments, my shares in Mayfield Realties\u2014and was ready to start transferring the staff I wanted on board when a routine check came back with devastating news that could cost me both the new business venture and my credibility. Infusing confidence into the new company and my abilities to build an empire away from my father\u2019s influence would have been an easy task, were it not for the fifty million dollars missing from the Mayfield Realties accounts.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut and rubbed my forehead to get rid of the pressure building inside my head. The last thing we needed was board members and shareholders panicking and demanding to see the financial reports. I couldn\u2019t make the books public until I figured out what was happening. The spreadsheets on my screen were supposed to shed light on where the money had disappeared, only I couldn\u2019t focus with Brooke occupying my mind.</p><p>\u201cMr. Mayfield? You\u2014\u201d My receptionist\u2019s voice echoed through the intercom. I pressed the response button to cut her off.</p><p>\u201cSend him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away, sir.\u201d</p><p>A knock on the door, and a man in his fifties entered. One of the assistants placed a file on my desk and then closed the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cTake a seat.\u201d I pointed at the seat opposite from me and read the name on the file:</p><p>Clarence Holton</p><p>The name sounded oddly familiar. I pondered for a moment, and then it hit me. I had read the same name on the hit list in the black book. There had been a Holton, no doubt about it. I just couldn\u2019t remember the first name.</p><p>My gaze brushed his salt-and-pepper hair and tanned face before settling on the sleeves of his tailored suit. My father had told me that all members of the elite club wore special cufflinks to recognize each other. They were silver round buttons engraved with a symbol that looked like leaves growing over circles and ended in a sharp \u201cV\u201d-split tail in the form of a lizard\u2019s tongue\u2014the symbol of parasitic animalistic power growing over physical matter.</p><p>\u201cThank you for seeing me,\u201d Holton said. He lifted his hands, then crossed them on the desk. My gaze fell on the cuffs. They were smaller than I remembered, but the spitting image of those my father showed me.</p><p>I looked into his eyes, my face a stony mask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a busy man.\u201d My voice betrayed a mixture of boredom and annoyance\u2014a winning combination in the business world. It was the kind of voice I had learned to use during my time in a gang; the kind of voice that always earned respect and let people know they couldn\u2019t mess with me.</p><p>\u201cI never got the chance to tell you how sorry I am about your father\u2019s demise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I drew a sharp breath and let it out slowly\u2014another one of my tactics to signal to get to the point. The spreadsheets were waiting, and then there was also my tiny problem with Brooke. I had no time for small talk, and particularly not with someone like Holton.</p><p>\u201cYour father and I were very close,\u201d Holton said. \u201cNow that he\u2019s no longer with us and you\u2019re in charge, I hope we\u2019ll become friends.\u201d</p><p>The way he said the word \u201cfriends\u201d made me recoil with disgust. I had no intention of being his friend, not even an acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I said. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else\u2014\u201d The invitation to leave hung heavy in the air. I knew he could feel it by the way his eyes narrowed a bit, which he downplayed with laughter.</p><p>\u201cLike father, like son. Triad magazine\u2019s having its annual September issue party.\u201d He raised a brow meaningfully, like I was supposed to know what the hell he was talking about. When I remained silent, he continued, \u201cWe\u2019d love to have you as a guest of honor. You\u2019re single, as far as the world knows. Plenty of attractive models will be attending. Maybe one will catch your eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a magazine, not an escort service.\u201d</p><p>My statement caught him off-guard. His eyes shimmered with annoyance, and in that instance I realized Clarence Holton wasn\u2019t here because he was worried about the company or his shares; he had been instructed to recruit me. Maybe my father had left the club, but Holton was still an active member.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I said, standing. He followed suit, and I accompanied him to the door. For obvious reasons, I couldn\u2019t kick his ass out of my office. The shareholders couldn\u2019t sell or the shares would plummet to an all-time low. His connections to the media prevented me from making rash decisions. And I hated it, because it felt as though I supported his dark and twisted secrets and lifestyle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks for stopping by.\u201d I held the door open and gestured for an assistant to accompany him to the lobby.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing, Jett.\u201d He turned to face me, his face an ugly mask of pretense. \u201cPlease stop by. You\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>I closed the door before I smashed his face in. For the hundredth time a surge of anger pulsed through me as to why my father had brought this mess upon us. I shouldn\u2019t have refused to talk to him before he died. If I had listened to what he had to say, maybe I\u2019d know what was going on and figure a way out.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I sat in my chair and retrieved the spreadsheet files. I had too much on my plate, and I couldn\u2019t afford another distraction. The company and my relationship with Brooke came first. I\u2019d deal with the club later.</p> <p>Brooke was late and a workaholic. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if she had forgotten about our date. My phone cradled between my shoulder and my ear, I waited for her to pick up her cell phone. The line went straight to voicemail\u2014like it had for the last few hours. I should\u2019ve checked on her after her conference, but shareholder calls kept trickling in and I had no time. Besides, I figured she\u2019d be busy and we\u2019d talk over dinner anyway.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I slammed my phone on my desk and turned to look out the window. Clearly she was pissed, and I had no idea why. I\u2019d probably gone too far by telling her she couldn\u2019t break up with me. Brooke didn\u2019t like to be told what she could or couldn\u2019t do. But damn it! The woman had issues.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything before I head home?\u201d Emma asked from the doorway. I turned, realizing I hadn\u2019t even heard her walk in. She was dressed in a fitted trench coat and was holding a briefcase in one hand. A handbag dangled from the other arm. I wondered how much they had cost her. My father hadn\u2019t been known for his generosity with his mistresses. Maybe he had been more smitten with this one than the rest, even though they all sure looked the same, albeit they were getting younger with each new conquest.</p><p>\u201cNo. You can go,\u201d I said. \u201cOn second thought, have you seen Brooke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left during her meeting. I haven\u2019t seen her since.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned. \u201cWhich meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that started at eleven a.m. She didn\u2019t return for the afternoon acquisitions talks. Your brother jumped in.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWant me to call him? He might still be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said to get her to leave. Even if I called Nate, he probably wouldn\u2019t know more than I did.</p><p>Emma\u2019s gaze lingered on me as if she wanted to say something else, and then she settled on, \u201cHave a good weekend.\u201d</p><p>I mumbled a \u201cyeah, have a good one, too\u201d and turned my attention back to my cell phone. After she closed the door behind her, I sank in my chair, my fingers tapping on the huge desk in annoyance as I recalled my conversation with Brooke. I was sure I\u2019d heard her correctly when she agreed to talk over dinner. Why would she do that and then leave without telling me? I always thought of her as responsible, which made me assume whatever issues she had wouldn\u2019t encourage her to run from me. It wasn\u2019t like her. Or maybe I didn\u2019t know her as well as I thought I did.</p><p>At 7:30 p.m. and countless calls later, I realized she wasn\u2019t going to pick up, and I dialed Sylvie\u2019s number. The line rang a few times before she replied.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Brooke?\u201d I asked by means of introduction. The television was blasting in the background. A brief pause ensued, during which she lowered the volume.</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d She sounded surprised, probably not expecting to hear from me. \u201cI saw her yesterday.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cIs everything okay between you guys?\u201d</p><p>Sylvie probably knew we weren\u2019t okay, but I wasn\u2019t ready to go into that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good. She told me you met,\u201d I said. \u201cApparently she left work early, and I thought she might be with you. We were supposed to meet for an early dinner. I got us a table at Le Bernardin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That place is booked months in advance. Wish I could come along.\u201d Sylvie let out a sigh of relief. \u201cI\u2019m so glad things worked out. I was worried she might be too scared to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Tell me what? I frowned, realizing I was missing a part of the picture. Brooke hadn\u2019t been particularly talkative the night before. In fact, I had never seen her so quiet. The following morning she had been even more cryptic.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I asked cautiously.</p> <p>\u201cAbout how I found the book with the disk tucked inside my handbag,\u201d she said. I froze. \u201cI swear it was an accident, but I\u2019m taking the blame even though Brooke\u2019s adamant she put them inside my bag. Don\u2019t listen to her, though.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d I rubbed my temples as I tried to make sense of her drivel. \u201cWhat book?\u201d</p><p>The line remained silent for a moment.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you, did she?\u201d Sylvie whispered eventually. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d The line went dead. Without a second thought, I redialed her number because no one hung up on me. This time Sylvie picked up on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Jett. I got disconnected. Bad signal.\u201d She laughed. What was it with people and laughing when they were lying? \u201cSo, Brooke\u2019s not there?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her question, I decided not to beat around the bush. \u201cAre we talking about the same book and disk that were stolen in Bellagio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on the way you see it. They were not stolen, just\u2014\u201d she paused \u201c\u2014misplaced.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly as I sorted through my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they now, Sylvie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Brooke, of course,\u201d she said, and then she started to chat away. Her words flew so fast it felt like a sledgehammer was pounding inside my head. \u201cHonestly, I thought she had told you already. She wanted to do it last night because she knew you\u2019d be angry and she wanted to get it off her chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, slow down.\u201d I pinched the bridge of my nose. \u201cFirst, why did Brooke assume I\u2019d be angry? That\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe because you could blame her for your father\u2019s death?\u201d She made the question sound like a statement.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d I was so angry I felt like I could hit a wall. \u201cI\u2019d never blame her for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooke told me how guilty you feel about your father\u2019s death. She thinks that since the book was never stolen, she might have caused his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d For someone so clever, Brooke\u2019s reasoning sucked. \u201cThat\u2019s the most fucked-up thing I\u2019ve ever heard. She knows Robert and I never had a close relationship. I stopped grieving about my father a week ago.\u201d Right after I found out about the missing fifty million dollars.</p><p>\u201cRight. The way you say it makes it all sound really stupid. Brooke was convinced you blamed yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d My voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cBut for different reasons than you think.\u201d I stood and began pacing the room up and down, my anger coursing through me. \u201cLook, I\u2019m worried about the company. I\u2019ve kept us from drowning for years, but my father\u2019s legacy is a huge financial hole that could swallow half New York City. The books don\u2019t make sense, and I can\u2019t tell anyone about it without risking the shares taking a dive. I know you have a business degree, so you can imagine what that would mean.\u201d My glance fell on the clock on the wall. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now. I need to talk to Brooke. Do you have an idea where she might be? Coffee shops she frequents? I\u2019m not comfortable with her being alone. Not when she has that damn book and she\u2019s in a conflicted state of mind thinking I\u2019m the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried calling her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I cringed inwardly, not stating the obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s switched off. I wouldn\u2019t have called you if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwitched off as in \u2018you can\u2019t reach her because she\u2019s blocking your calls\u2019 or switched off as in \u2018switched off\u2019?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Sylvie continued in her annoying \u201csorry for even asking\u201d voice. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe she would switch off her cell. She never does. Maybe the battery\u2019s dead or she left it somewhere. Did you guys have a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d I breathed out. \u201cBut, like I said, the only thing that matters is finding her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a couple of places she could be. Are you at work?\u201d</p><p>Finally.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the way, Jett, I\u2019m really sorry about your father. Not just because he\u2019s dead, but also...you know...\u201d She trailed off.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and looked out the window at the last rays of the setting sun coloring the sky in dark copper. I didn\u2019t like the fact that Brooke hadn\u2019t told me about the book. I could deal with the fact that she had tried to break up with me because I could see her possible motivations. Maybe she thought she was protecting me; maybe even protecting herself from whatever she thought I\u2019d say to her. I could deal with that, but I couldn\u2019t deal with the fact that she kept secrets from me that might risk her life.</p><p>I peered at my cell phone for the hundredth time. The whole story sounded too far-fetched. My gut feeling told me I was missing something. Even though Brooke didn\u2019t trust me, she had promised she\u2019d stay, so what made her change her mind?</p><p>Speed-dialing the one person I knew would never fail me, I pressed the cell to my ear and whispered, \u201cKenny, I need you to track down Brooke\u2019s phone right now. I need to know where she is and who\u2019s with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalking her much?\u201d Kenny laughed. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Brooke</p><p>SOMEONE SLAPPING ME was the first sensation I had upon waking up. The second was the overpowering smell of decay and excrement. Bile rose in my throat and my stomach turned, urging me to vomit. I bit my tongue hard to fight it and tried to pry my eyes open, but everything around me remained dark. At some point a chill must have crept into my limbs because my legs and arms felt numb, and I couldn\u2019t stop shivering. I was so cold, it felt as if I had been shivering for a long time in the darkness where I had resided.</p><p>Another slap\u2014this time it was so hard I knew it was across my face. A pang of anger flickered to life inside me, giving me enough strength to stir from my uncomfortable position. The left side of my face tingled and burned, as if someone had used a whip on me. I pried my eyes open groggily, and a strangled gasp escaped my throat. The cold sensation I had assumed was inside me actually came from the cement floor underneath me, penetrating my business suit. Through the hazy curtain before my eyes, the picture before me didn\u2019t make much sense. The whole room seemed cloudy and filled with light mist that was spinning so fast it took my eyes several seconds to adjust, but I could smell the putrid, sickeningly sweet air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sitting up, I tried to kneel and stumbled forward. My palms caught my fall, and I realized both hands were bound in front of me in some kind of praying position. I waited until the spinning slowed to a bearable level and opened my eyes again to take in my surroundings.</p><p>I was in a room the size of a cell with dirty gray walls and a naked light bulb hanging from the low ceiling. The floor was cold and showed brown spots I assumed were dried dirt and God knows what. Behind me was a dirty mattress with yet more brownish stains. My head hurt like a bitch, but that wasn\u2019t my primary concern. All I remembered was the car-jacking, Robert Mayfield\u2019s driver being shot, and a guy pointing his gun into my face. Another guy got into the back seat and pressed a cloth against my mouth, the sickening sweet smell of chloroform still embedded in my mind. Nothing after that.</p><p>Where was I? What had happened?</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re awake,\u201d someone said. His voice was familiar. I turned toward the door and narrowed my eyes to focus on his height, age, or anything I might catch through my blurred vision and use to help me identify him later.</p> <p>He walked in, and the door closed behind him. As he inched toward me, his features became clearer. It was only when he squatted that I recognized him.</p><p>Years had changed his face and body. He had put on weight. His nose had been broken and there were scars on his cheek and on his left eyebrow, but the resemblance was uncanny. It was the face that still haunted my dreams.</p><p>\u201cDanny?\u201d My question was barely more than a hiss, or maybe I couldn\u2019t hear my own voice through the drumming in my ears. My heart pounded so hard against my chest I was sure he could hear it. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d His voice was nonchalant, unaffected, lightly mocking. He licked his lips as his dark brown eyes assessed me.</p><p>Seeing him brought back the memories I had been trying to bury for more than ten years: the time my sister fell in love with him, the days after she died, and the way he smiled when he was allowed to walk free. Danny must have seen my shock and felt my thoughts because he started to smile, and a shiver ran down my spine.</p> <p>\u201cYou thought I forgot the troubles you caused me?\u201d His tone had a warning undertone to it. \u201cYou really thought you could get away?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, barely able to swallow the bile in my throat. My mind was chaos, completely overwhelmed by his presence. I thought I had put enough distance between us, both physically and emotionally. Of all the people in the world, how could I meet Danny and under those circumstances? My body was burning with repulsion and hate. So much hate and disgust. In spite of the cold, I was burning inside\u2014burning so hot I wanted to push aside anything that stood in my way of hurting him. I wanted to claw at his face and eyes. I wanted to see him bleed, like Jenna had bled\u2014slowly and with no compassion.</p><p>\u201cYou seem surprised I still remember Jenna,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to forget a pretty girl like her. She was a gold mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch, you killed her,\u201d I spat out. I pushed up on my elbow to kick him, smash his face in, but the ropes kept me bound in place. Angrily, I spat in his face. \u201cI wish I could kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I deserved that.\u201d He wiped his face, amused. \u201cBut it\u2019s not my fault she was weak and took more than she could handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hooked her on your shit,\u201d I whispered. Jenna was drugged that fateful night, but the coroner report clearly stated she died of internal bleeding, not of an overdose. \u201cYou shared her, you piece of filth. You passed her along like merchandise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBusiness is business. Besides, it\u2019s in the past now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I have to thank you. Without you, I\u2019d never have met your sister. I wouldn\u2019t have received good money for a good time. For old time\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll make you a gift, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>I flinched at hearing my name roll off his tongue. He leaned forward, and his voice dropped to a whisper dripping with fake secrecy. \u201cDo you want to know what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself. I don\u2019t want anything from you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again, only this time his expression betrayed his feelings. My words had displeased him. I tried to move a few inches back, but it was too late. He moved so fast I barely had time to blink or flinch. He grabbed my bound arms and twisted with such force I feared my bones would break. Pain shot through me, and I winced as his other hand forced my chin up hard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually take secondhands but on the off chance you\u2019re lucky and make it out alive, I\u2019ll make an exception. I\u2019ll even be generous and grant you release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather die than\u2014\u201d</p><p>He twisted my arm again. My words died in my throat as my vision blurred from the excruciating pain shooting through my shoulder and spine.</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s done with you,\u201d Danny whispered, \u201cyou\u2019ll wish I were your first.\u201d He let go of me, and I stumbled forward, tumbling to the floor. I turned warily, watching his every move. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a good fuck, Brooke. One you\u2019ll never forget. I will fuck your brains hard until you break\u2014just like I did with your sister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d I fought to sort through my thoughts, picking out all the things I wanted to say to him, but my hate blinded me, rendering me unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cSave that for the one who wants you first.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the door and knocked, then turned back to me as he waited. His smile was gone, and I realized his eyes shimmered with pity as he stared me down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why they wanted you. You\u2019re far too old,\u201d he said. \u201cI can only imagine that it\u2019s either a personal preference, or they want the sister of the one they had.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps echoed in the corridor outside the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked, his words swirling in my mind.</p><p>\u201cAre you really this stupid?\u201d he mocked me. His lips curled upward and all traces of pity disappeared. \u201cI was paid well to provide Jenna, and they were very happy with her. Even if you\u2019d testified against me, you\u2019d never have won. People appreciate my services. Or how else do you think I walked out innocent? Think about it.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and Danny left without so much as a look back. Then the door closed again, and I was alone in the room with his voice ringing in my head. My mind recalled the events after Jenna\u2019s death and ventured to the man who let Danny walk free.</p><p>Danny lured my sister into a world of drugs and sold her to others for sex. I had known that for a long time; what I never understood was why a judge would let him go free. I could only imagine the reason now. It had not been Danny\u2019s charms or the way he had lied that swayed the judge in his favor. It was probably the judge\u2019s personal interest in Jenna or him playing a part in what happened to her. I was ready to bet on the latter.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>THE LIGHT BULB above my head cast a glaring light on the dirty floor and the ropes around my wrists. The stale, putrid scent lingered in the air. At some point my sense of smell got used to it, and I dared to draw deeper breaths. I didn\u2019t know when I fell asleep, but that was all I wanted. Not thinking. Not feeling. Just sleeping\u2014until I could forget where I was and what I\u2019d heard. Even my nightmares were better than reality. Waking was like falling straight into hell with no escape, where the pain from the tight ropes cutting into my skin provided more relief than discomfort.</p><p>\u201cYou should deal with it, you know?\u201d a female voice whispered. I spun slowly in a circle to scan my surroundings. There were no windows\u2014just walls and one closed door, behind which Danny had disappeared. My only escape route was that door, only my ropes were too short to reach it. A shudder ran down my spine as I realized nobody but I was in the room. Was I going crazy?</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m talking to you,\u201d the same voice said. I scanned the room again, and this time my glance fell on a small vent in the wall I must\u2019ve missed before. Pale skin shimmered through the grids, but the holes were too small to see behind. Craning my neck to get a better look, I ignored the nausea in the pit of my stomach and walked a few steps forward. As if sensing my curiosity, whoever was on the other side shifted and squeezed their fingertips through the openings. The nails were long and dirty, and definitely belonged to a female. \u201cI\u2019m in the room next to yours. Can you walk over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My eyes remained fixed on the vent. The fingers disappeared, and finally I could see the eyes and lips of a woman. I couldn\u2019t tell her age, but from the sound of her voice, she was young, maybe younger than I was. \u201cI\u2019m bound.\u201d I lifted my hands to show her.</p><p>She let out a groan. \u201cYou need to stop crying, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name? They mentioned it outside,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you need to stop sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you make it easy for them to inject you with drugs, and you won\u2019t even notice. Trust me, you\u2019ll want to keep control over your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I crawled closer to the vent as far as the rope around my wrist allowed until I was six feet away from the opening. Up close, I could see her face more clearly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Liz. And before you ask, I don\u2019t know where we are.\u201d She was slightly chubby and in her late teens\u2014maybe around seventeen or eighteen years old, with a blonde bob and bangs. Even with the vent obstructing my view, I could see just how pretty she was. A normal girl\u2014were it not for the caked dirt on her face. I held my breath as I realized it probably wasn\u2019t dirt\u2014more like dried blood.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost three months. I stopped counting a while back.\u201d She smiled nervously, but her eyes looked at me with such intensity I knew she\u2019d gone through a lot. My chest felt heavy with dread. Three months was a long time. Clearly, whoever held her hostage harbored no intention of letting her go. I realized the eyes looking at me were the eyes of someone who had seen horrible things. \u201cYou have a better chance to survive if you\u2019re strong but compliant. If you want to live, you have to play along and do whatever they ask you to do\u2014and they\u2019ll always ask just once. If you struggle or don\u2019t follow their commands, they\u2019ll ask for permission to kill you.\u201d She paused before adding. \u201cAnd some of them love doing that.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and forced air into my lungs as I tried to memorize every single word.</p><p>\u201cThey bring food once, sometimes twice a day,\u201d Liz continued. \u201cIt\u2019s usually the same thing: bread with one dish consisting of rice with meat, or steak with fries, and a glass of water. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll also get two blue pills and one little white pill. Eat the bread, drink the water, and always take the blue pills as soon as you can. But don\u2019t eat the rest of the food because it\u2019s spiked. Whatever you don\u2019t eat, find a way to get rid of it without them knowing. And remember, the better you get at playing along, the higher your chances of staying alive. Better yet, try to exceed their expectations.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are the blue pills for?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll keep you awake and numb the pain. I always take them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the white pills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the white ones only when you\u2019re ready to abort.\u201d She raised her eyebrows knowingly. \u201cThey tend to give Misoprostol. It\u2019s for stomach ulcers and abortion, and should not be used with the blue ones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you in your sleep. You were loud. Talking weird stuff about a disk\u2014and more.\u201d</p><p>The disk and the baby were a secret. I couldn\u2019t blurt it all out in my sleep. Waves of panic rushed through me as I realized what would happen if whoever held us captive found out.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know everything?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDanny made me work on the streets until his employer noticed me and asked him to bring me here.\u201d She was cut short by the sound of a car horn. I figured we were near a street or a highway, but I wasn\u2019t sure. We kept silent for a few seconds. When nothing stirred, she continued in a hushed tone. \u201cYou can\u2019t act like this, you know? The way you did with Danny. He isn\u2019t the worst one. I mean, there are worse.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced down at my hands, at the way the rope cut into my skin, the pain keeping me focused and grounded in reality while my fear paralyzed me. The whole situation seemed hard to grasp, but I knew I had to listen to Liz\u2019s advice to get out of here. It was hard to imagine that Danny wasn\u2019t the worst. He had fooled my whole family by pretending he loved my sister. He knew what would happen to her and still let her come to harm, which demonstrated he had no heart, no soul, and surely no conscience or compassion. To me he had none of the qualities that make us human.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I said. \u201cHe killed my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making excuses for him,\u201d Liz whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the suppliers. Basically, he provides girls in exchange for drugs and money. But he doesn\u2019t take part in\u2014\u201d She drew in her breath and let it out slowly. The way she defended Danny, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what their relationship was.</p><p>\u201cAre there others like us?\u201d I asked, almost hopeful. If there were more women, maybe we could work together and escape. There had to be a way, or else I didn\u2019t know how I could get out on my own.</p><p>\u201cThere were,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey get a new supply twice a month. The first two weeks are crucial. After that, depending on how well you behave, you have only one worth.\u201d She fell silent. Our gazes connected through the grids, and her eyes filled with fear and something else: hopelessness. Her voice dropped to a whisper, which in a way filled me with more terror than the things she had disclosed so far. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to mess with them, or else you\u2019ll be punished. If you hope that someone will help you, don\u2019t. It won\u2019t happen. It\u2019s never happened. We\u2019re on private property. No one\u2019s going to come looking for us here because the people who own it are rich. It\u2019s like the extreme wing of a club, or something. Danny told me, and I believe him. And honestly, it\u2019d be a stupid idea to try to run away. Two have tried, and look where it got them.\u201d</p><p>A club?</p> <p>I stopped breathing for a moment as the pieces of the puzzle slowly fell into place. Robert Mayfield had tried to protect his interests by getting rid of me. And then someone else stepped in. That was the reason why I was here, even though, according to Danny, I was older than the girls they usually went for.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you tell me all of this? If no escape\u2019s possible, then\u2014\u201d I shook my head as I struggled to make sense of my thoughts. If Liz knew no one made it out, why was she still trying to help me? The life she was living was no life at all. I realized I was spiraling into a dark abyss of emotions, and I hadn\u2019t even found out what was really going on.</p><p>\u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. Her voice sounded choked as she continued. \u201cI want to keep you safe, even though I probably won\u2019t be able to.\u201d She moved away from the vent, out of my view. I waited for her to come back, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLiz?\u201d</p><p>When no reply came, I understood. Without hope and faith, she had done all she had thought she could. Why get attached to the \u201cnew girl\u201d who probably wouldn\u2019t make it past the two-week mark anyway?</p><p>I sat down on the cold floor. For the umpteenth time I wondered what it must\u2019ve been like for her all alone in her cell, being at other people\u2019s mercy with no one to talk to. Three months might not seem like a long time, but it was long enough to need someone near her to remind her that she was still human rather than a worthless object, someone who understood the hell she was living, someone who was there to share the pain rather than inflict it upon her.</p><p>Maybe she had found that someone.</p><p>When my limbs began to stiffen, I crawled back to my sleeping place, which consisted of a dirty mattress on the floor, and sat down. I buried my face in my hands, unable to avoid the feelings of dismay washing over me.</p> <p>Jett hadn\u2019t exaggerated when he said the club was dangerous. He also hadn\u2019t lied with his statement that we were connected through a similar past. I just never realized how close he had been to the truth. How horrible would it be for him to discover his father\u2019s club kept me hostage? He\u2019d never find out, not least because he\u2019d probably never come looking for me after I ended our relationship, giving him a good reason to believe I had walked out on him. It had been a bad mistake. I knew it now; I had sensed it then. And I had no one else to blame but myself.</p><p>The hours ticked by, and Liz\u2019s cell remained quiet as a tomb. The light above my head kept burning relentlessly, making it impossible to sleep for longer than a few minutes at a time. It was hard to tell whether it was day or night, if one day had passed or several, but sure enough, it felt like an eternity. By the time I heard footsteps again, the fear in my mind and cold in my limbs had turned me into a shell of nothingness: functioning without reacting, or thinking. It was only when the door opened that I lifted my head and sat up, unsure what to expect.</p><p>A short guy holding a tray entered. He placed the tray on the floor and pushed it toward me with his boot, then took a step back. I looked from the tray to the gun in the holster around his waist. He remained quiet, but his dark eyes didn\u2019t stray from me. There was no warning in his eyes. Just amusement. I couldn\u2019t help but think of a caged animal in a glass house\u2014a sick experiment, during which I wasn\u2019t considered an equal because I didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I muttered, remembering Liz\u2019s advice to be compliant, even though I wanted to charge at him to get to that gun.</p><p>It seemed to do the trick because he turned away and left, locking the door behind him.</p><p>I neared the tray warily. Just like Liz predicted, the food consisted of a main course dish\u2014chicken with rice and white sauce\u2014and bread. Next to the glass of water were three pills: two blue and one white. What I didn\u2019t expect was that the bread was covered in a thin layer of blue mold, and the water inside the glass looked dirty. Even if Liz was right, I couldn\u2019t possibly eat any of it in my condition.</p><p>Besides, my nerves were too frayed to keep anything down. The prospect of starving to death sounded more appealing than dying by violence or drugs because at least I\u2019d keep my self-respect. I could eat another time, once I escaped. I had to believe that a miracle was possible. But I was too thirsty to abstain from drinking the water. I took a sip and grimaced. It tasted just like it looked.</p><p>I grabbed the tray and scanned the cell to find a hiding place. On the farthest side of the door was a ventilation shaft in the floor. It was wider than the one in the wall and in the middle was a hole, which I assumed served as an open toilet. The smell of excrement wafting from it was so strong I almost threw up. I kneeled down and discarded my meal and white pill.</p><p>The thick slice of bread was too large, so I tore it into bits and threw it into the hole along with the water. I held up the blue pills, considering my next move. Liz was right. If I wanted to escape, I had to stay awake. But not like this. My mind had to remain clear, without the need of whatever those pills were.</p><p>I returned the tray to the same spot where the guard had left it, pushed the pills inside my pockets in case I needed them later, and smashed the water glass against the concrete floor. The noise of breaking glass echoed from the walls unnaturally loudly, and for a moment I was convinced someone would barge in to demand an explanation. As quickly as I could, I picked up the largest shard. It was small, but a small weapon was better than no weapon at all. If it was sharp enough to cut through skin, then it would do its job.</p><p>There was just enough time to hide it in a small hole of the mattress before footsteps approached and the door swung open, just like I knew it would.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d one of the two guards commanded. My heart hammering hard, I pretended to finish chewing as I watched one of them clean up the shards.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, right?\u201d the other one said. I nodded but didn\u2019t dare look up\u2014or breathe. He stood so close it gave me the creeps. He held up my hands to check them before stepping away again. \u201cYou might be new, but let me tell you this. If it happens again, you won\u2019t get our fancy treatment anymore.\u201d</p><p>As if I cared.</p><p>I could feel his intent stare and almost smiled with relief when they retreated, and the door finally closed. Listening for any sounds, I waited until I was sure they wouldn\u2019t return, then retrieved the shard from the mattress and cut a hole in the inseam of my business suit, then tucked it inside.</p><p>A glance at Liz\u2019s vent told me she was there, watching in silence.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I had no intention to get her involved or endanger her life, but I wasn\u2019t going to accept my new circumstances and do nothing about them, either. Ignoring her, I sat down on the mattress and began to rock back and forth in an attempt to keep myself awake.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>WHATEVER HAD BEEN in that water began to kick in almost immediately and an odd sense of floating and being weightless filled me. My body began to shake slightly, and then the tremors intensified and my breathing quickened. It was very similar to a panic attack, and I realized whatever was happening to me might take a long time to subside. Maybe the water had been spiked and Liz didn\u2019t know, or maybe I was indeed having a panic attack. Either way, I had to get a grip on myself.</p><p>For a long time, I just kept staring at the walls. I was exhausted, but my mind was too active to sleep, even if I wanted to. A guard checked on me at regular intervals, but he never spoke.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how much time had passed when a click outside my cell made me sit up, alerted. Another click followed, and I realized Liz\u2019s door had been opened. Several people entered her room. The hushed voices were too low to understand.</p><p>Someone laughed.</p><p>And then a sound that made my blood freeze in my veins. I knew that sound. Maybe not knew as in having experienced it before, but knew as in knowing what was happening. I couldn\u2019t tell how many men were in Liz\u2019s cell, but I could hear their laughter, the slapping, the grunting\u2014their bodies slamming against hers as they each took their turn. Shaking, I pressed my hands against my mouth to stop any sounds from forming at the back of my throat. That\u2019s when the whimpering and screaming began. Whatever they were doing to her didn\u2019t leave much to my imagination. A sense of powerlessness washed over me as I realized there was nothing I could do to help her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you filming?\u201d somebody asked.</p><p>\u201cNo shit, man.

It was the same guy who had threatened me after I broke the glass.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the new one in here. What do you think?\u201d the third guy said. His voice was deep and hoarse.

But who was Dante? Danny\u2019s words that someone wanted me first crossed my mind, and a shudder ran down my spine. Maybe he had been talking about the same guy\u2014Dante.</p> <p>\u201cIf we drug her, she won\u2019t remember. Problem solved,\u201d the smoker voice said. \u201cNo one would believe her anyway.\u201d</p><p>Shit!</p><p>My heart began to pound against my ribcage, and I forced myself to take slow, measured breaths. Panicking wasn\u2019t going to help anyone.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d the first one said. He sounded tense, anxious even. \u201cDante wants her in the condition she\u2019s in now. He was clear on that.\u201d</p><p>Laughter, then a clicking sound, like a belt buckle.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it,\u201d the guy with the smoker voice said. \u201cBut I want my fun. You in, Stu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount me in,\u201d the second voice replied. \u201cBut take her to the wheel room.\u201d</p><p>The wheel room? What kind of room was that? Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t want to find out. The voices continued to speak, their words no longer reaching me because the sound of my blood rushing in my ears drowned out all noise. I scanned my cell for a place to hide and escape but, like before, there was no secret entrance. No hole in the wall I could fit through.</p><p>With trembling hands I made sure the glass shard was still hidden in the inseam of my suit. My breathing made a whistling sound as I sat down on the mattress, waiting to see how events would unfold.</p><p>Life or death. Because if I failed, I was sure I wouldn\u2019t survive the night.</p><p>The door slammed open, and in walked two men. They were big, their expressions relentless. Both carried a gun, and I realized my chances were pretty slim. But maybe that was what the guns were for: to intimidate so a woman wouldn\u2019t put up a good fight. The blond one\u2014the one who had picked up the glass shards\u2014had the sunken cheeks, mottled skin, and hollow eyes of a meth addict. The other one with the smoky voice, who didn\u2019t seem to care about Dante\u2019s rules, was broad with a cropped military hairstyle and a crooked nose. I recognized him as the guy who had held the gun in my face in the parking garage.</p> <p>My mouth opened to scream and closed shut because there was no purpose in screaming when no one would hear me. I wanted to fight, scratch their faces, even though I probably stood no chance against two males with guns.</p><p>The dark-haired guy pulled me up, removed the ropes, and shoved me. Weak from a lack of food, water, and sleep, I stumbled forward. But my mind was sharp enough to take in my surroundings.</p><p>The corridor was long and narrow, with doors on either side. It looked like an empty storage building with locked cells, from which a corridor led into an open space with two doors. The sound of my kitten heels resonated from the walls as I was led through one door into an adjoining parking garage with three parked trucks. On the eastern side, almost hidden by the largest truck, were a dozen adjustable shelves lining the wall. Stashed on the shelves were boxes. I craned my neck, but they were too far to peek inside.</p><p>\u201cYou go in\u2014I\u2019ll bring the rest,\u201d the dark-haired guy said. I peered over my shoulder to see him walking over to the shelves and rummaging through the boxes.</p><p>The blond guy\u2019s hand clasped around my upper arm and urged me forward to the truck in the farthest corner, then pressed a button. A ramp descended and he gave me another shove, urging me to walk up.</p><p>Inside, the light was dimmed, but I could see that the truck had been decorated to resemble a plain room with white walls and a double bed. Cuffs and belts dangled from each bedpost, and a brown rug covered the floor. My mouth went dry as realization kicked in.</p><p>This was the wheel room\u2014a moveable transporter serving the sick purpose of holding women captive, and probably worse.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to die in here.</p> <p>This was my chance.</p><p>Probably the only chance I\u2019d get.</p><p>Damn it, I wasn\u2019t going to let it go to waste.</p><p>Slowly, I squeezed my hand into the seam at my waist and grabbed the end of the glass shard so tight the sharp edge cut into my skin, sending a pang of piercing pain through my nerve endings. But I didn\u2019t care. Without thinking, I turned and plunged the tip as hard as I could into the man\u2019s throat and sliced to the right, cutting through skin, flesh, and nerves. His body instantly doubled over, and his hands moved to his throat. A gush of blood covered his skin and trickled down his arm onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cStu!\u201d His voice was muffled by the gurgling sound of blood. His widened eyes betrayed his panic as he raised his hands to his face.</p><p>I left the shard in his throat and ran down the ramp, in the direction we had come from\u2014and the only door I had seen.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d I heard the dark-haired guy let out a long string of expletives, which were quickly replaced by approaching footsteps. But I didn\u2019t care and didn\u2019t turn. All I cared about was escaping. Get out of this place as fast as I could.</p><p>Through the door, I reached the open space, but instead of heading in the direction of my cell, I dashed for the other door. It was a risk. A gamble I didn\u2019t want to take, but I had no other choice. The drumming of my heart stifled all other sounds, which only made me run faster. I charged through the door, thankful that it wasn\u2019t locked, and realized I was in a stairwell. I yanked at the emergency exit door. It was locked. A curse escaped my lips.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t retrace my steps because I had no idea where the other guy\u2014Stu\u2014was, so I ran up the stairs, trying each door as I passed. By the time the door opened again, I had reached the third floor and my lungs were burning from the lack of oxygen. I had no idea how long I hadn\u2019t eaten anything, but I knew I couldn\u2019t go on much farther. To my right was a door leading into the third-floor corridor. This one was unlocked. I walked through and closed it behind me as silently as I could.</p><p>The corridor looked just like the one with the cells, only the doors stood ajar. I quickly scanned one of the cells as I ran past and realized they were storage boxes, just like the ones downstairs. Whoever ran this business clearly thought big. I headed for the last door to my left, almost expecting another parking garage. Instead I entered a large open space with lockers.</p><p>The door leading from the stairwell into the corridor opened, and the pounding steps told me I had no time to lose, so I opened a locker door and squeezed in. The space was tiny but big enough for me to fit inside.</p><p>My breathing came labored. Loud, even. Trying to slow down my thumping heart, I pressed a hand against my chest. Footsteps thudded down the corridor, heading for me.</p><p>I held my breath as the room fell silent. Through the tiny slits in the locker, I could see Stu\u2019s shape. And then the footsteps departed again, and the door to the stairwell slammed shut.</p><p>As much as I was tempted to stay hidden, it was only a matter of time until Stu came back. The thought of him opening the locker and finding me after what I had done to his friend terrified me. So I stepped out of the locker, and had just headed for the other end of the corridor when someone grabbed my waist and something pressed against my mouth.</p><p>I kicked and punched as hard as I could, fighting the iron grip.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Stu hissed. His breathing came heavy as he punched the side of my head, sending me against the wall. Instinctively, I curved into a ball to protect my baby, but his hands curled in my hair, pulling me back to my feet. My eyes fell on a guy I hadn\u2019t seen before and on the syringe in his hand. As if sensing my sudden panic, he smiled, and I realized there were only two outcomes.</p><p>I\u2019d be punished by paying dearly for my out-of-order behavior. And, judging by the look on his face, he no longer cared to follow Dante\u2019s commands and leave me unscathed.</p><p>The second outcome was even bleaker than the first, so I pushed it to the back of my mind, not wanting to think about it.</p><p>My scalp burned, but the pain didn\u2019t stop me from fighting and punching the space around me. My foot connected with something soft, and Stu let out another string of curses. His hand let go of my hair, and for a moment I relished the sensation of being free. Then my legs were kicked from beneath me and I collapsed, knocking my head against the floor in the process.</p><p>My vision blurred. I struggled to get up but fingers moved around my throat, cutting off my air supply. Pinned to the ground, unable to move or breathe, I peered into cold dark eyes. Stu\u2019s face was a mask of fury and arousal as he cut off my air supply. The other guy kneeled next to him. I winced when a needle pierced through my skin.</p><p>Within seconds, the anesthetic drug coursing through my veins made my body weak. I fought and kicked hard, until I realized there was nothing I could do. The realization didn\u2019t come from fear. My body was ready to give up, slowly turning into a shell of numbness. It was as if my body had no choice. I accepted that anything could happen now\u2014that everything was my fault and I\u2019d brought this upon myself.</p><p>Stu\u2019s hand pulled up my business skirt and tore away my panties. I felt the air between my legs and heard the sound of his zipper. I closed my eyes to hide behind my eyelids\u2014inside my mind. Whatever happened, I didn\u2019t want to witness it.</p><p>Not even the loud gunshot made me open my eyes. Nor the thudding footsteps around me. Nor hearing Jett\u2019s name and someone shouting, \u201cThis is how it\u2019s done, Jett. You seem to have forgotten.\u201d Then another gunshot, followed by another. It was only when I heard Jett\u2019s deep voice that I forced my heavy eyes open, and my lips curled into a weak smile. He was so beautiful. A beautiful dream. At least I wouldn\u2019t feel the pain because I was dreaming of him.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, baby.\u201d His green eyes were filled with so much worry that I wanted to assure him I\u2019d be okay just to take away his pain. I wanted to touch him, to see if he was here or whether his beautiful face was just an illusion, but my fingers wouldn\u2019t follow my brain\u2019s command.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brooke.\u201d He lifted me in his arms and pressed me against his chest. Through the pain inside my head and abdomen, I inhaled the scent of his aftershave as he kept repeating, \u201cWe\u2019ll get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a girl downstairs,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPlease help her. And Jett, your father\u2014\u201d I fought against the overwhelming feeling of losing control. Every word was a struggle. I tried to keep my eyes open, but all I saw was darkness. \u201cHe\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>The last thing I heard was Jett shouting, \u201cCall for an ambulance, Brian.\u201d</p><p>And then darkness descended upon me, swallowing me up whole.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>I WOKE UP in a bed with Jett sleeping in a recliner to my right. I watched the deep worry lines on his forehead, the way his stubble cast a shadow on his face, darkening his features. He was dressed in blue jeans and a black shirt that built a strong contrast to the pristine whiteness of the bedsheets and the walls. His hair was a knotted mess, reminding me of the many times I had run my fingers through it, but the memories quickly dissolved in favor of reality. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dark circles beneath his eyes painted a good picture of what he must\u2019ve gone through in my absence. Even though he looked as though he hadn\u2019t slept for days, my heart fluttered. He was beautiful. I didn\u2019t dare touch him, fearing he might just be a dream from which I could wake up any moment.</p><p>To convince myself that it wasn\u2019t just a dream, I looked around the room and realized we were in a hospital. Bright rays of sunlight were spilling through the windows. The door was closed, and apart from Jett\u2019s soft breathing, no other sound disturbed the serenity around us. The pain inside my head made it all feel real, but was it real?</p><p>The room was decorated in white and muted yellow. The only splash of color came in the form of a pink calla lily bouquet in a vase on the nightstand. I could smell their faint scent and remembered they were Sylvie\u2019s favorite flowers. And then the memories slowly started to pour in. A heavy weight pinning me to the floor. A shot, followed by Jett\u2019s face and his arms around my body. People speaking animatedly. Oh, God, and the pain. I realized this couldn\u2019t possibly be a dream. I was here\u2014for real\u2014in a hospital bed because Jett had saved me.</p><p>Again.</p> <p>I smiled in spite of the pain shooting through my temples.</p><p>Somehow he had found me. We were reunited and the baby\u2014</p><p>My heart dropped as more memories began to take shape.</p><p>Jett\u2019s father. The arrangement. Liz. The rape. The dark-haired guy punching me repeatedly, my head hitting the floor, and the way the other guy plunged a needle into my arm, injecting some drug that rendered me unable to move and eventually unconscious. I swallowed the lump in my throat. Even if my nightmare was over, it wasn\u2019t quite over. I had no clue if Liz survived the rape. I didn\u2019t know whether my baby survived the beating and whatever happened after that.</p><p>Jett had been ready to be a father. Carrying his child inside me and then losing it would feel almost like a betrayal toward him. I had to find out if I was still pregnant, and I had to do it alone, before Jett woke up.</p> <p>As I moved, I nearly tore out the IV needle stuck in my vein. I winced, and Jett opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d He stood and touched my shoulder gently. \u201cI\u2019m here. Everything\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>His eyes assessed me as if he wasn\u2019t sure whether I suffered from amnesia and wouldn\u2019t remember him. I smiled in spite of the tears trickling down my cheeks. I was overwhelmed. Just seeing him, feeling him, hearing him\u2014when I thought I never would again\u2014was more amazing than I had ever envisioned. I had forgotten how beautiful his eyes were, and the way he awakened butterflies inside my stomach when he just looked at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whispered and let him hug me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you found me.\u201d My throat hurt, but I didn\u2019t care. \u201cThanks for coming for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never give up on you, you know that.\u201d He sat down on the bed, pulling me with him, and gently kissed my forehead, my temples, the bridge of my nose, the corners of my lips, and finally settled on my lips.</p><p>The scent of him, his warm body\u2014everything was overwhelming. It was too good to be true. We rested in each other\u2019s arms for a long time. Jett pulled back first and tucked a stray strand of hair behind my ear as he looked deep into my eyes. \u201cI could\u2019ve been too late, though, in which case I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>His words touched me to the point tears began to cloud my vision again. I smiled bitterly. \u201cYou would have moved on eventually.\u201d I knew my attempt to lighten up the conversation sucked, but I had to give it a shot anyway. \u201cYou would have met another girl to replace me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed darkly. I looked up, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Maybe I don\u2019t want another girl. When I fell in love with you, I knew I\u2019d love you at your worst. Most of all, I knew you had the power to destroy me in your absence.\u201d His dark green eyes probed mine. \u201cYou\u2019re not just any girl for me, Brooke. You\u2019re the only one who matters to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if the baby\u2019s lost?\u201d I whispered. Admitting it to him was painful, but it was a possibility.</p><p>His eyes reflected his emotions as he cupped my face and drew me to him. \u201cThe baby\u2019s okay, Brooke. I talked with the doctor.\u201d His voice trailed off, leaving the magnitude of it hanging between us. I breathed out, relieved, and nodded as Jett continued, \u201cThose men won\u2019t hurt you again. They deserved what they got.\u201d His serious tone sent a shiver down my spine. I didn\u2019t need to ask if they were still alive. I\u2019d heard the gunshots, and I knew what they meant. I didn\u2019t even care who shot them. I looked through his eyes into the depths of his soul, and that was enough for me.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Liz?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll make it. The nurses put her in room 122.\u201d</p><p>A dark shadow crossed his features. He was withholding something. I watched him rub the nape of his neck, a habit he had acquired following his father\u2019s feigned death, which in turn reminded me Jett still might not know the truth. I almost didn\u2019t want to break our moment, but I had to tell him.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to talk, Jett,\u201d I began, adding softly, \u201cabout your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive. I know.\u201d He avoided my gaze. \u201cYou told me two days ago.\u201d</p><p>Two days ago? Had I slept that long?</p><p>\u201cMy father will pay for what he did to you.\u201d A nerve twitched below his left eye. \u201cI promise you he won\u2019t harm you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jett.\u201d I shook my head vehemently. Strangely, I felt defensive of his father, despite all he had done. Compared to the men, Robert hadn\u2019t tried to kill me, but then again, maybe our meeting had been nothing but the stunt of a good liar. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it was him. The men who captured me killed his driver before taking me to that building. It wouldn\u2019t make sense. Your father wanted me out of your life but promised to keep me safe. He knew about our baby. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d break his promise.\u201d</p><p>Jett nodded, but I could tell by his skeptical expression he wasn\u2019t convinced. I was about to recount the meeting with his father when someone knocked, and a physician walked in holding a chart. Jett stood and they both exchanged glances, before the doctor turned to me.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re awake, Miss Stewart.\u201d He stepped closer, and I realized he was young, maybe five or six years older than Jett. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Barn. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d I returned his smile hesitantly.</p><p>He retrieved a penlight from his pocket and shone the beam into my eyes. \u201cIs your head hurting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>It hurt a lot, but acknowledging it would only alarm Jett.</p><p>Dr. Barn pushed the penlight inside the pocket of his robe and checked my vitals. Eventually his attention focused on the chart in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou received a blow to the occipital lobe, which is the cause of your headache. Results show no signs of swelling, though. You have no internal bleeding and no signs of trauma.\u201d He peered from me to Jett, who hadn\u2019t moved from the spot, and then back at me. \u201cYour blood test shows you\u2019re pregnant. Were you aware of your condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nodded. \u201cFirst term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you were lucky, but I would strongly suggest you see your gynecologist upon your release,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jett asked. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly, ignoring the sudden need to groan and slap his arm. I was alive, the baby was okay, Jett and I were reunited. Basically, in spite of the bruises on my arms and the thudding inside my head, I was having the best day of my life. Yet he looked like he was about to strap the physician to a chair and commence an interrogation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a precaution.\u201d I squeezed Jett\u2019s arm gently, silently begging him to stop his intimidation tactic, but his intense gaze remained fixed on the doctor, staring the poor man down.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Dr. Barn shifted uncomfortably as he considered his words. \u201cAs far as I can see from the tests we\u2019ve run, nothing\u2019s wrong, but of course the drugs\u2014even the brief exposure\u2014could have influenced fetal development. The chance of damage is possible but minimal. To know for sure, we strongly suggest regular checkups.\u201d He let out a breath, as though he had been holding it.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Barn.\u201d I shot Jett a confident smile. His face remained a stony mask.</p><p>Intense.</p><p>Possessive.</p><p>Overprotective.</p><p>My smile widened at the words my brain chose to describe Jett. Even though he drove me crazy at times, I was thankful for the fact he never gave up. It was one of the many things I loved about him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Dr. Barn shook my hand and then turned to Jett. \u201cShe\u2019ll be released today. Take her home, and make sure she sleeps off the headache. Brian is expecting you tonight. Same place as usual.\u201d</p><p>There was something strange in the way the doctor\u2019s tone had become more intimate, not to mention it was an odd thing to say. Besides, the name \u201cBrian\u201d rang familiar. And then I remembered someone had shouted it before I blacked out.</p><p>Dr. Barn wished me well and left.</p><p>\u201cWhat was he talking about when he said Brian would be waiting for you? What place?\u201d I asked as soon as the door closed.</p><p>\u201cLong story.\u201d Jett sighed and dropped into the recliner, facing me with an expression that told me he wasn\u2019t keen on elucidating.</p><p>I inclined my head, my eyes matching his stubbornness. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I have all the time in the world, Mayfield. So start spilling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2014Dr. Barn\u2014and I go way back. He\u2019s the only doctor I trust, which is why I brought you here.\u201d He gestured around him. \u201cIt\u2019s his private clinic, where no one would find you.\u201d His eyes shimmered with hesitation, signaling there was more than he let on.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but who\u2019s Brian? What does this have to do with Sam?\u201d</p><p>Jett remained silent. I wasn\u2019t going to drop it, and he knew it. Finally, he caved in.</p><p>\u201cWhen Kenny couldn\u2019t track your GPS, we had no other choice but to ask my old gang for help to find your whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened. I opened my mouth to ask the million questions ambushing my mind like wildfire, but Jett\u2019s fingers pressed against my lips, stopping me. \u201cIt was the only way. Either that or giving up. So I struck a deal with Brian, the leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat deal?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat I return.\u201d He looked away, hesitating.</p><p>I took a deep breath, and then another, unable to speak. I remembered the few stories he had told me and knew that part of his life hadn\u2019t been a pleasant experience. After he had left, he had vowed to never return. Now he would\u2014because of me.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do, Brooke. It was the only way to find you. Do you understand?\u201d He took my hands in his, his eyes meeting mine. \u201cRight now you\u2019re not safe. It\u2019s only a matter of time until whoever\u2019s responsible for your abduction finds you. Hiding with the people I once trusted is the only way I can be sure no one will find you, until I can take care of everything. So tonight I\u2019m fulfilling part the deal.\u201d He ran a fingertip across my cheek and let out a deep breath. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a race. Brian wants to see whether I still have what it takes. Whether I\u2019m worthy of his crew. It\u2019s part of the deal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d I whispered</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut that\u2019s not important. I don\u2019t care about anyone but you, and for you I\u2019d do anything. Going back is worth whatever Brian will put me through to earn his trust back.\u201d His expression softened, but he couldn\u2019t hide the glint of anger in his eyes. \u201cIf we\u2019d lost the baby, I\u2019d have mourned. But your loss would have broken me into pieces. It would have been even worse than you walking away or finding out that my father tricked us. I would\u2019ve ripped apart everything and everyone, even though it wouldn\u2019t have stopped the pain. I\u2019d hunt down anyone responsible for hurting you. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do. With the right resources at my disposal, I\u2019ll let them bleed to death slowly.\u201d He looked so resolute I knew there was no point in arguing.</p><p>Jett bent forward and kissed me. \u201cNow, I want you to tell me everything, Brooke. I want to know exactly what happened.\u201d His gaze glinted with fury. \u201cI\u2019ll make them all pay. I promise. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019ll let you down again. I won\u2019t repeat that mistake. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t let me down, I wanted to whisper, but didn\u2019t because his impatience and urgency were clear. And for a change, I was ready to listen to his reasoning and follow his plans rather than mine.</p> <p>Chapter 20</p><p>WE STAYED IN the hospital until late afternoon. Jett ordered lunch while I took a shower, visited Liz, and then joined him dressed in the jeans and shirt Sylvie had brought the day before. Jett insisted that I eat first. Given that I looked like shit, with dark circles beneath my eyes, and purple bruises on my body, I didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>I sat down at the tiny table and ate in silence, after which I took the painkillers a nurse brought in, even though my headache had slowly begun to clear. And then we talked for two hours straight, during which I recalled the pertinent: the day Sylvie found the book and disk, how I met his father, the car-jacking, and then finally the building. The smell of excrement and dirt lingered at the back of my mind, and for a moment it took me all my might not to break down. Jett listened quietly, his fingers clenching until the white of his knuckles shimmered through his skin when I described the three men and what they did to Liz and me.</p><p>As more memories started to flood my mind, I realized I had forgotten one very important thing that happened to me on the first day.</p><p>Danny.</p> <p>How the hell could I forget about him?</p><p>Maybe my mind had the bizarre ability to erase him or I was suffering from selective memory, as if forgetting was the only coping mechanism it knew to stop me from thinking of my sister. Like someone living their entire existence in darkness and one day experiencing light for the first time, I felt the raw pain, but I couldn\u2019t evade it. So I started to remember all the things I\u2019d rather forget again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d I whispered. My hands were shaking so badly I had to hide them under the tablecloth as anger rippled through me. \u201cI saw Danny. He\u2019s working for them.\u201d</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyes flickered and a flash of recognition crossed his face. I didn\u2019t need to elaborate because he knew the person who frequented my nightmares, even though they had never met.</p><p>\u201cThe guy responsible for Jenna\u2019s death.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question but a statement. \u201cThe one who walked free and whose friends threatened you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to look straight at him. \u201cAfter all those years, it was the last place I thought I\u2019d find him.\u201d</p> <p>Jett\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWas he one of the three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean to ask whether he was shot, no. I only saw him once\u2014the day I arrived. He\u2019s a supplier but doesn\u2019t participate in\u2014\u201d I trailed off, unable to speak the terrifying truth.</p><p>\u201cDid he touch you?\u201d His brow creased. Even though I couldn\u2019t tell whether with worry or anger, the dangerous glint in his eyes didn\u2019t escape me. I remembered the way Danny had slapped me. It had hurt, but it was nothing compared to the pain he had inflicted upon me by talking about my sister the way he had. Would Jett understand? Probably. But this wasn\u2019t the time to burden him. He had enough on his plate already.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m telling you this.\u201d I cast my eyes down to hide the shame and humiliation burning inside me. My throat tightened with hate for Danny, which brought on more shame. I hated the men who hurt Liz, but the hate I felt for Danny was different.</p><p>It consumed me.</p><p>I\u2019d never forget his words. His face. That he seemed to think he was untouchable.</p><p>Another flicker of anger crossed Jett\u2019s face. He took my hand in his and his thumb began to draw circles on my skin, encouraging me. I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cDanny said he would\u2019ve walked free regardless. That it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if I had testified or found proof. Somehow, I believe him, Jett. I believe he was protected by the club.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d Jett\u2019s eyes resembled a charge of force with so much power and determination I knew that if the opportunity presented itself, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to hurt Danny. I had seen the scars under his tattoo on and beneath his upper arm, and they surely hadn\u2019t magically appeared. He\u2019d fight for me. And I didn\u2019t want that. The risk of him getting hurt was too big\u2014a risk I\u2019d never take. I felt a glimmer of hope in knowing that I was safe with Jett and wished I had trusted him instead of taking off, but at the same time I feared for his safety, now more than ever.</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyes glazed over as if his thoughts were far away. I decided to change the topic and ask him the one question that had lingered on my mind since I woke up.</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d I touched his arm to draw his attention back to me. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>He pushed his chair closer to me until his leg brushed my jeans. \u201cWe checked the surveillance cameras in the garage and saw that you were dragged out of the car into a van. The license plate\u2019s registered to an old lady outside the state, so I figured it must be fake, like the one in Italy. We went to Brian, and he put us in touch with the guy who creates the best fake license plates in the state.\u201d He paused, and I leaned forward, interested. \u201cTurns out he issued the plates a few weeks ago to a guy known for doing the odd driver job, and not of the legal kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tracked him down, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I didn\u2019t know whether to be mortified or thankful.</p><p>\u201cYeah. We beat the crap out of him to find out your whereabouts.\u201d Jett smirked. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it took us several hours to get him talking and find out where he brought you. He was a tough SOB, I have to give him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d All words failed me.</p><p>He cocked a brow. \u201cImpressive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say \u201cscary\u201d but yeah, \u201cimpressive\u201d will do.\u201d I laughed, figuring Jett definitely deserved the praise for his ego after all he\u2019d done for me. \u201cWhat about your father\u2019s driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead, baby,\u201d Jett said calmly. \u201cWe found him inside the van. They didn\u2019t get to dispose of the body.\u201d</p><p>There was no \u201cprobably,\u201d no \u201cmaybe,\u201d just a definite answer. I didn\u2019t know the guy, but for some reason I thought he didn\u2019t deserve his fate.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why they had to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you have this huge heart and tend to feel guilty a lot. But don\u2019t. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Jett kissed my palm gently. \u201cThey want the book, just like my father, and they\u2019ll do anything to get it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>I hesitated, unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jett probed.</p><p>\u201cThey never asked for it,\u201d I said. Worry set in as I realized I had no idea where the book was. \u201cI gave it to the driver. It was still in the car when the van hit us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We also found your handbag and a briefcase,\u201d he said and shook his head. \u201cThey were amateurs. Professionals would never have closed the car doors and driven off, leaving behind evidence. Like Sam said, we were lucky.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Yes, we were, indeed. Would we be next time? I didn\u2019t know but I was sure I wouldn\u2019t get myself into such a mess again.</p><p>\u201cSylvie brought the disk,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I mumbled. I had been so stupid to risk that piece of evidence by sending it via snail mail. What the hell had I been thinking? I thought Jett didn\u2019t hear me, but his lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cAre you singing heavenly praise because the disk arrived safely or because Sylvie and I worked together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d My jaw dropped. \u201cYou did? So you\u2019ve tamed the dragon?\u201d Sylvie had made it perfectly clear she wouldn\u2019t forgive Jett for the few days of heartache he had caused me, while deep in my heart, I honestly hoped they\u2019d be friends one day.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a tough one. Anyway\u2014\u201d He grimaced, and his electric green gaze bored into me. The serious undertones in his voice made me fear the question before it came. \u201cI have to ask you something and I want you to be honest with me.\u201d</p><p>My heart started to hammer hard against my ribcage. I wasn\u2019t terrified of him, but the thought of whatever was going on in his mind was frightening in the word\u2019s truest sense.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you run, Brooke?\u201d he asked, quietly.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2014\u201d Struggling for words, I moistened my lips.</p><p>\u201cMy father offered you a deal?\u201d At my shocked expression, he smirked. \u201cYeah, you talked in your sleep, and we found the briefcase. It was open.\u201d</p><p>I realized I had never closed it because we were car-jacked, meaning he must have found the fake passport, the cash, and the bank account statement. A terrible thought occurred to me\u2014that he might think material gain was more important to me than our relationship.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted his money, Jett. He threatened to hurt Sylvie and everyone else in my life. I feared for them,\u201d I said, slowly. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded but took his time to reply. \u201cI wish you had trusted me enough to tell me rather than run away. I could\u2019ve taken care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His fingers kept stroking my hand, and I relaxed against his touch. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, even after finding the briefcase I didn\u2019t believe you\u2019d take off because of two mill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my father\u2019s club buddies showed up at my office to invite me to some party,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. How nice of him,\u201d I said, dryly.</p><p>\u201cMy point is that after he stopped by, I called Sylvie,\u201d Jett said. \u201cAfter she told me what happened, I knew someone must\u2019ve come after the book. In return, I figured it must be the reason why you had been acting strange and wanted to break up with me.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, and Jett laughed out loud. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby, but I didn\u2019t believe you when you said you wanted to break up with me.\u201d</p><p>My lips twitched. \u201cYou have a big ego, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I\u2019m perfect, and I can give you two examples.\u201d He paused to think. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wow, only two?</p><p>\u201cFirst, I was wrong, Brooke,\u201d he said. \u201cThe book is not a hit list. I still have to figure out what the names and numbers are all about, but we didn\u2019t get the chance to skim through the hard drive\u2019s contents. And second, I never apologized.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always asked what the big deal was about this club. I told you that it\u2019s a gathering that caters to those looking for extreme sexual encounters,\u201d Jett said, slowly. \u201cWhat I left out is that some members kidnap and drug women to rape them.\u201d He took a deep breath and let it out slowly\u2014almost as if the secret had been too heavy to carry, and he was relieved to share it with me. \u201cAccording to my father\u2019s account, some members are pretty harmless, but a few thrive on power. They prey on fear.\u201d I opened my mouth to speak but he held up a hand, stopping me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t proud of my father being part of it, and I was too ashamed to tell you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize. Even if you had told me, it wouldn\u2019t have stopped them from\u2014\u201d I stopped because the shock sat deep.</p><p>Getting me.</p><p>Such a stupid mistake to think I could have taken care of it myself. I pushed my thoughts to the back of my mind, where I couldn\u2019t reach them and ponder over the past.</p><p>Jett interlaced his fingers with mine and for a moment I stared at them, admiring the beauty of his hands. Strong hands. Capable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to admit it was a bold move, Brooke. Sending the disk in an envelope, that is,\u201d he whispered. I could tell he was trying to ease the tension by being playful. I decided to play along.</p> <p>\u201cYou taught me bold well.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched with amusement. \u201cGood. Then you\u2019re ready for step two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d I raised my brows. We were back to our playful nature, how things used to be...and I loved it.</p><p>\u201cLiving fast and dangerous. Since we\u2019re staying with the gang for a while, you\u2019d better get used to living in the fast lane, Miss Stewart.\u201d</p><p>After what I\u2019d gone through, I could handle whatever life threw my way. Joining his gang seemed to be the least of our troubles.</p><p>\u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re in? Just like that?\u201c He seemed surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I jutted my chin out. \u201cYour old gang can\u2019t possibly be worse than your father\u2019s club. No offence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d A glint of amusement lit up his eyes. \u201cLet me guess, you\u2019re thinking a few boys hanging out, drinking bears, talking about their \u2018biaches.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Had I been that obvious?</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cI know they\u2019re carrying guns and stuff.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, the delicate skin beneath his eyes crinkling, and for the first time I couldn\u2019t help but think how stupid I had been to leave him. No day would\u2019ve been complete without him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to warn you, Brooke. They\u2019re insane. I hope I won\u2019t have to tell you twice.\u201d His eyes never left mine as he lifted my hand to his mouth. I watched him kiss the tip of my fingers\u2014slow and sensual, the motion strangely arousing.</p><p>\u201cInsane...how?\u201d I asked, a little short of breath. The temperature was soaring, and surely not because someone had turned up the heating.</p> <p>His soft touch trailing up my arm sent a shiver through me. There was nothing more delicious than the mix of shock, lust, and the vibe of mystery and possible danger.</p><p>Yep, Jett was definitely rubbing off on me.</p><p>The possibility of seeing his bad boy past for the first time was like an aphrodisiac.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out tonight.\u201d He gave me a wry smile. \u201cIf anything goes wrong, we\u2019re leaving. Deal?\u201d I nodded, wide-eyed, and his voice softened. \u201cI want you to know that if you fall, I\u2019ll fall. You belong with me, and everything we do, we\u2019re doing together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Liz?\u201d I couldn\u2019t just go and leave her behind without protection. Not that I was much protection, but still.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Jett smiled gently as he cupped my face and kissed me, his lips barely brushing mine. His breath smelled of chocolate and coffee. Together with his mouth, it was a heady combination. \u201cShe\u2019ll be staying at the clinic for a few more days until we find the right place for her to stay. Sam Barn will take care of her even though I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the club\u2019s target, but you never know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS I felt at the prospect of leaving the safety of the private hospital behind, I also felt a strong urgency to get back to normality. Jett\u2019s silence during the drive stifled some of my enthusiasm, though, replacing it with the growing awareness that I was about to find out more about his past.</p><p>The good, the bad, and the scary. Or maybe the sexy.</p><p>The sun was streaking the sky in shades of orange and copper when we finally left the highway and turned toward what looked like an industrial estate with warehouses. The car skidded to a halt in front of a high barbed-wire fence, behind which I could see a string of buildings. It wasn\u2019t at all how I imagined the place to be. The three-story warehouses built a cluster of rundown walls that seemed abandoned. The yard looked deserted und unkempt. And some windows were smashed in. I would\u2019ve doubted Jett had the right address, were it not for the high-tech security cameras at the top of the fence, their tiny black lenses flickering. I peered into one, unable to shake off the feeling that I was being watched.</p><p>We reached a gate with an intercom. I almost expected Jett to press a button and the gate to open, but instead a tall guy with the arms of a bodybuilder appeared from somewhere to our right. He nodded at Jett and opened the gate to let us through, his glance a mixture of mistrust and resentment.</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d I asked as we drove through the gate into a yard the size of a football field.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jett stared ahead, his hands clutching at the steering wheel so tightly I feared it might snap in two. Maybe he had personal issues with the guard, in which case it was none of my business.</p><p>Jett navigated to the back, and I realized the buildings were arranged in a \u201cU\u201d shape with a strip the size of a two-car lane in between and with parking spaces on either side. Some of the parked cars looked just like mine at home: old and battered. I counted them: twenty-three. Jett pulled into an empty space near the front and killed the engine.</p><p>\u201cWhy are there so many cars?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for us,\u201d Jett said gravely. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and we exited. Walking past the first two buildings, I scanned the dark windows. Movement on the rooftop caught my attention, and I craned my neck to get a better view. Something\u2014I guessed a piece of fabric\u2014fluttered in the evening breeze. Someone was up there, no doubt about it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look, Brooke,\u201d Jett said. \u201cThis is their territory, and we have to show respect. They don\u2019t take snooping around kindly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said they\u2019re expecting us.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, the movement of his head barely noticeable. \u201cThey are. But there are rules.\u201d</p><p>I turned back to Jett but kept watching the buildings from the periphery of my eyes. Jett did the same\u2014I could tell from the way his eyes scanned the area without him turning his head.</p><p>\u201cDo they have anything to hide that they keep guards?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThey all do.\u201d</p><p>I waited for Jett to elaborate. He kept quiet. From the corner of my eyes I caught someone on the rooftop signaling something.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being careful,\u201d Jett said eventually. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rivalry going on.\u201d</p><p>Rival gangs\u2014I knew the stories from newspapers, though they always seemed to belong to a different world. Being here made it all seem real, and scarier than I imagined.</p><p>Jett stopped in front of the fourth building. I looked up at the dirty windows. Behind them stretched darkness. No movement. No light. No life. Just shabby old walls in dire need of renovation.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we\u2019re at the right place?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like anybody could possibly live in here.\u201d</p><p>Jett shot me a sarcastic smile but didn\u2019t comment. Instead he said, \u201cThe people you\u2019re about to meet used to be my friends. Some of them still are, but don\u2019t trust them until I say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke a few rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome rules are meant to be broken,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d Grimacing, he opened the door and, pressing his hand against the small of my back, he guided me inside. It was one of his overprotective gestures\u2014a gesture that was both meant to mark his territory and keep me close. I snorted inwardly. Like anyone would start hitting on me when they had more pressing issues to deal with.</p><p>We walked through a large empty hall and reached a staircase. Hushed voices carried over from downstairs. Jett instructed me to keep quiet as we headed for them, a million questions circling through my mind.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re down here,\u201d a male voice echoed. Jett gave me a knowing look and tilted his head to the left. Only then did I notice the security camera and intercom installed in the wall.</p><p>We climbed down the last flight of stairs and reached what I believed to be the basement. It was freezing cold and dark; the air smelled of chemicals. With sure steps, Jett led me through a corridor, and we turned another corner before we finally reached an open space with a bar and sitting opportunities.</p><p>At least forty people had gathered\u2014most of them male. The moment we appeared all conversations stopped, or maybe it felt like it because it all seemed so quiet and tense. I scanned the accusatory faces and noticed Sylvie and Kenny among them. She waved at me, and I fought the urge to wave back. This was Jett\u2019s world. To fit in, I had to behave accordingly. My heart dropped when I noticed some of the people carried weapons.</p><p>We were intruders.</p><p>They didn\u2019t like intruders.</p><p>In fact, with their hard stares they looked as if they didn\u2019t like anyone. Period.</p><p>Jett let go of my hand and motioned for me to stay. At the same time, a guy stepped forward. He wore a snug, short-sleeved shirt\u2014the kind that did nothing to hide his strong, tattooed arms. But that\u2019s not why I stared. On his left arm, reaching up to his neck, he carried the same tattoo as Jett.</p><p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d live to see the day you came back, bro. That took guts.\u201d His voice sounded strangely familiar, and then it dawned on me. He was the one who had called out to Jett right before gunshots rippled through the air and Jett rescued me.</p><p>Brian.</p><p>That was his name.</p><p>Jett snorted. \u201cNeither did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your girl?\u201d Brian inclined his head toward me, his gaze scanning me up and down and lingering a bit too long on the bruises on my neck.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Brooke.\u201d Jett\u2019s answer was barely more than an irritated grunt.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know the rules?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. What rules? Jett hadn\u2019t clued me in on any rules.</p><p>\u201cNone of your concern,\u201d Jett replied. Yet another irritated grunt, and I realized I was seeing a new side to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust asking.\u201d Brian raised his hands in defense before he turned to me, a smile on his lips. \u201cCome closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, Brooke,\u201d Jett commanded. His irritation was now replaced by annoyance. I decided to listen and didn\u2019t move from the spot.</p><p>Brian laughed. \u201cProtective of her, huh? What do you think I\u2019d do? If I wanted to touch her, I would have done so already.\u201d His eyes wandered back to me. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of guy, right?\u201d He was enjoying the show because he loved being in control. He liked to be the center of attention. I could tell that much from the way his attention kept shifting between me and his friends, as though he sought to be admired for his show.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Brian said to no one in particular. \u201cDuring the race I want her to ride with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, man. Leave her out of this,\u201d someone shouted from the back. My head turned in the voice\u2019s direction. It was Kenny.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either my way, or nothing,\u201d Brian said, ignoring him. His voice carried a warning that sent a chill down my spine. The room fell silent. Some began to nod, and more joined in.</p><p>Mob mentality.</p><p>If Brian snapped, others would follow. I didn\u2019t like that, not least because many carried weapons and made no secret of it. The cave of my mouth went dry.</p><p>\u201cShe stays,\u201d Jett said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t part of our arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think you can march in and make demands?\u201d Brian stepped forward and stopped barely a few inches from Jett. \u201cWhen I helped you find her, I settled my debt. Now we\u2019re even. Seeing that you need my help to hide her ass, you either bend to my rules or you get the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not risking her life.\u201d</p><p>Brian shrugged and squeezed his hands inside his pockets. \u201cToo bad.\u201d He turned to his friends and tilted his head toward Jett and me, which I assumed was his way of instructing them to throw us out. Jett walked back to me, his hand clasping mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d I said to Brian. The room fell silent, and countless gazes focused on me. Were it not for the surreality of the situation, I would\u2019ve applauded myself for faking the kind of confidence I didn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Jett hissed. I whipped my hand away from him.</p><p>\u201cThis is my decision,\u201d I said, emphasizing each word. With a glance back at Brian, I repeated, \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p> <p>Our eyes met.</p><p>\u201cBrave!\u201d Brian nodded once, though I couldn\u2019t tell whether he was impressed or just mocking me. He walked over slowly, his blue eyes piercing mine as he looked at me for what seemed like an eternity, probably waiting for me to change my mind. When I didn\u2019t, the tension in his face eased just enough to signal me I had almost won whatever battle he was fighting. \u201cSam said you were discharged from the hospital earlier today. Are you sure you want to drive with Jett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Brooke,\u201d Jett said. I ignored him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time I saw Jett race. He\u2019s the best.\u201d</p><p>Brian smiled, but it wasn\u2019t humor I saw in his eyes; I could swear it was surprise, with just a little hint of respect.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get on well.\u201d At last he broke eye contact and addressed the guys around us. \u201cYou heard her. What are you waiting for? Help them get started.\u201d</p><p>The crowd broke. Jett stared at me accusingly with a look that said what the fuck? I shrugged and shot him my most confident smile, even though I didn\u2019t feel particularly confident. Truth be told, I had only seen him race once\u2014back in Italy\u2014and it wasn\u2019t so much of a race but a fight between life and death. Even then, I had been scared out of my mind and couldn\u2019t get out of the car fast enough.</p><p>I was led off into the adjacent hall, leaving Jett with Brian.</p> <p>You\u2019re doing great, Stewart.</p><p>So far no one had seen through my blatant pretense. I convinced myself that it was the right choice. The only choice we had. Jett needed my support, and I would sit with him to show it. I had to establish my place just as he would establish his, because it was the only place where we could hide.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>WHAT I HAD thought to be the basement was an open space too large to belong to just one warehouse. I assumed they were all connected, making it one giant subterranean maze. As we passed through another hall, I noticed training areas complete with numerous punching bags, weight-lifting machines, four full-sized boxing rings, and various training equipment. Jett had told me this was where he learned to fight. A smile spread across my lips as I imagined him working out all sweaty\u2014his strong biceps flexing as he punched a punching bag. How hot was that? If we stayed for a while, maybe I could get him to work out\u2014not that he needed it. His body was nothing but perfection. His scars, the tattoo on his shoulder, his sinfully dark green eyes\u2014he was nothing but a god to me. However, I wanted to see this perfection in action.</p><p>The picture of us lying on the red training mattress flickered inside my mind, his sweaty hot body making love to me on the hard floor. A pang of heat gathered between my legs as I imagined all the naughty things I\u2019d do with him. To him. Let him do to me.</p><p>Someone touched my arm, pulling me out of my daydreams. I looked up at a young woman about my age, and she pointed to a door on the left.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed. The changing rooms are through there. When you\u2019re done, meet me outside.\u201d She pointed to another door. \u201cEveryone\u2019s waiting, so don\u2019t take too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jett?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see your boyfriend soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Figuring she might need some time to warm up to me, I ignored her snide remark and shot her a friendly smile. Until I realized she might be an ex, in which case she\u2019d never warm up to me\u2014or I to her.</p><p>I could feel her interested gaze on my back as I headed for the changing rooms. I closed the door behind me and pressed my body against the smooth wood. I closed my eyes, fighting the urge to sit on the floor and never come out again. In all honesty, I didn\u2019t do hostility well\u2014especially when it involved a large group of armed people. In fact, if I could hide from it forever, I would. But as a highly supportive girlfriend, that wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes to the voice startling me and realized it was Sylvie and Kenny. She jumped up from a bench and wrapped her arms around me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea how worried I was when Jett said you were gone,\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cMy first thought was that you broke up with him then went undercover to hide, which is understandable, given the fact that he can be a bit of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSylvie,\u201d I cut her off. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand and laughed. \u201cApparently, Jett being here is a huge deal, so Kenny dragged me along. Anyway, your disappearing act was more scary than everything we went through back in Italy.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. She hadn\u2019t even seen half of it. Like the car chase up the mountain. How the heck was I supposed to stay calm, living and breathing, during another one of those?</p><p>\u201cYou were close enough,\u201d I said. \u201cI broke up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen someone\u2019s threatening you, you don\u2019t really have a choice,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks for telling him about the book.\u201d I let go of her and turned to Kenny, who had been standing like Sylvie\u2019s shadow in the background. \u201cAnd thanks for helping out, Kenny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d He squeezed his hands into his pockets and exchanged a strange look with Sylvie. I didn\u2019t need to be told how I looked to others. The small purple bruise just above my left eyelid and more bruises around my neck said it all. And there was the fact that Sylvie had seen me in the hospital, while I was sedated and out of it.</p><p>\u201cAre you really okay to race with Jett, Brooke?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou were discharged from the hospital after just two days.\u201d</p><p>And you don\u2019t look okay.</p><p>The words lingered in the air, unspoken.</p><p>I smiled reassuringly, even though I was slowly beginning to doubt the sanity of the idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. The baby\u2019s fine. Those are nothing.\u201d I pointed at my bruises, evading her worried gaze. It was the truth. A few bruises didn\u2019t bother me when I had more important things to worry about. \u201cStop looking at me like I\u2019m a victim, because I\u2019m not. I got myself into that situation, and now it\u2019s my choice to ride with Jett. And just so you know, I didn\u2019t go down without a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never doubted that,\u201d Sylvie whispered.</p><p>Were those tears in her eyes? Because Sylvie almost never cried, which could only mean I had caused her the shock of a lifetime.</p><p>Squeezing her hand, I looked around. On the far east side was a long rack with auto racing suits in various colors and sizes. Two benches and a table lined the opposite wall. Stacked on top of the table were several cardboard boxes. The lockers were straight ahead. I walked over. Jett\u2019s name was on the third one from left. My fingertips brushed over the faded handwriting\u2014Jett\u2019s handwriting, which I\u2019d recognize anywhere because it always looked hurried, as though he never had time to lose, and yet so poised and elegant.</p><p>\u201cWe never saw it coming,\u201d Kenny said behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019d leave his friends. It might be hard to imagine, but this is the place where Jett grew as a person. The place he called home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did Brian ask him to race, then?\u201d I turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tradition.\u201d His tone was defensive.</p><p>\u201cSounds personal to me,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Brooke,\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cBesides, why would they allow her to race in her condition? It\u2019s not like she wants to join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo them, Jett is a changed man. He grew up rich, but after joining us he proved his worth. He was happy with who he was.\u201d Kenny\u2019s eyes fixed on me, his expression torn. \u201cEveryone knew he despised his father and that we were his family. His choice to leave the gang in favor of his father\u2019s company came as a shock to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d I frowned and crossed my arms. \u201cI thought you left with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, slowly. \u201cWe stayed friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou helped him without Brian\u2019s knowing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His reply was barely more than a whisper. \u201cNo one knows, and it\u2019s better if it stays that way. They think he came to Brian alone, when in fact Jett and I have been in touch for years. We both have built our careers benefiting from each other\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Sylvie whispered. \u201cEmotional stuff.\u201d</p><p>Either she was being sarcastic or genuinely touched\u2014with her, it could go either way. Kenny smiled at her and checked his watch. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d He walked over to the rack with the suits and began to comb through them. I could tell from his stony expression that he was hiding something. As much as I wanted to ask why the others never kept in touch with Jett, I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Kenny picked a suit and handed it to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow listen, today\u2019s a test,\u201d he began. \u201cNot for you, but for Jett to see if he\u2019s gone all soft. They want to see if he still has what it takes. The best you can do is keep quiet and trust what he\u2019s doing, because Jett\u2014\u201d he drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly \u201c\u2014was our best driver, and many of us want him back.\u201d</p><p>There was more to the story. It was all over Kenny\u2019s face. It was in his eyes and the way he considered his words carefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sylvie asked, as though reading my mind.</p><p>Kenny pointed to a box on the table. \u201cMake sure you wear gloves, just in case.\u201d</p> <p>It was an obvious maneuver to avoid answering Sylvie\u2019s question. I decided to rephrase.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he wins and we stay? Will there be any problems?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter what happened, maybe,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cBetter ask Jett.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, wondering what he meant. So much of Jett\u2019s past was in the dark, and while it didn\u2019t bother me because I knew he\u2019d open up to me eventually, I sensed the magnitude of the situation.</p><p>\u201cYou have five minutes left,\u201d Kenny said and then walked out, leaving Sylvie and me alone. In the privacy of the room, my walls of confidence began to crumble.</p> <p>\u201cThis is such a mess. What if we lose?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>She clicked her tongue and sat down beside me. \u201cBack in Italy you said he was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were chased and made it out alive. Everything is a big blur infused by panic.\u201d I shuddered as I remembered the winding mountain roads. \u201cI was scared out of my mind, Sylvie, and can\u2019t remember much. This is different, but just as scary. God knows I hate when people speed, particularly when I\u2019m inside the vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it strange that I have faith in him?\u201d Sylvie asked. \u201cI know he wouldn\u2019t do anything reckless and risk your life.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if her words were meant to reassure me, or if she meant them. It didn\u2019t matter either way.</p><p>\u201cThanks. But I\u2019m not worried about Jett doing anything reckless,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019m worried that if we lose, he won\u2019t be able to accept failure.\u201d</p> <p>I could see my own fear reflected in Sylvie\u2019s eyes. Truth be told, I had never seen Jett losing at anything. So how would he deal with it?</p><p>\u201cJust believe in him, Brooke,\u201d Sylvie whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, anyway? It\u2019s probably just a stupid race on some training ground, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no clue.\u201d She checked her watch. \u201cBut Kenny said have only five minutes left, so get dressed before someone barges in here and drags you out there. That Brian guy looks like he\u2019s capable of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d I closed the door behind her and changed into the suit. It was loose on me, but not to the point of being unwearable. I grabbed some gloves, and left the sanctuary of the changing rooms.</p><p>The woman from before wasn\u2019t outside, but the door to my left was open and animated voices carried over from inside. I walked in and stopped in my tracks. In front of us were eight sports cars, four on each side\u2014the kind of vehicles I only knew from car magazines. My jaw almost dropped as my eyes swept over one luxury model after another. They looked like they had just been imported from the manufacturer, and if it wasn\u2019t for their registration numbers, I would have believed they were.</p><p>Some of the drivers had already taken their places behind the wheel. Jett hadn\u2019t arrived yet, and the agitated murmurs showed his arrival was highly anticipated.</p><p>I spied Brian leaning against a shiny blue Ferrari, and he smiled when our eyes connected. His confidence was overpowering, and while he wasn\u2019t my type, I couldn\u2019t help but be aware of his masculinity from the way his probing glance lingered on me. He was assessing me, probably wondering why Jett would return for me to the place he once left. I raised my chin and smiled back. But it was a cold smile, one that was supposed to say, You don\u2019t know me, and you\u2019ll never figure me out.</p> <p>The door opened, and Jett entered trailed by a dark skinned guy. The room fell silent. Like me, he was dressed in a black racing suit. I had no idea when or where he had changed, but he looked so hot my knees turned weak in spite of my better judgment. The fabric sat snug around his broad shoulders and narrow hips. The zipper at the front wasn\u2019t fully zipped up, revealing a bronze patch of skin just below his neck. I fought the urge to rise on my toes and place a kiss on it just to see whether he tasted as delicious as he looked.</p><p>His gaze barely brushed me as he inched closer. I knew when he was angry\u2014and right now he was fuming.</p><p>Brian threw Jett the keys, and Jett caught them in midair.</p><p>\u201cWe kept your baby. Thought you might feel more at home,\u201d Brian said. \u201cIf you need time, you know, to check your tires or whatever, let me know and I\u2019ll tell Doug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. My guys know how I like her,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>Her?</p><p>His car was a \u201cshe\u201d?</p><p>What did you expect, Stewart?</p><p>I suppressed the urge to smile. It was a male thing\u2014like getting all worked up about a bunch of guys running across a football field for hours\u2014but the knowledge didn\u2019t make it less sexy.</p><p>Jett\u2019s fingers settled firmly on my lower back as he guided me to the dark red sports car to our left. He opened the passenger door and motioned for me to get in. I followed his unspoken command and watched him drop into the driver\u2019s seat, then fasten his seatbelt.</p><p>Engines began to roar, and the crowd dissipated. The wall opposite from us shifted and slowly opened, giving a view of the street and the parking lots. Most of the people got into their cars, and I realized they were spectators.</p><p>Jett pushed the key into the ignition and turned on the engine, then drove outside slowly, past the parked vehicles and onto the main road. Hundreds of questions swirled around in my head. Who was Doug? Was he the guy who\u2019d be racing against Jett? Where were we heading, and what exactly was going to happen?</p><p>I stole a glance at Jett. His eyes were focused on the road, and I decided to postpone my interrogation. His strained expression worried me even more than not knowing what to expect.</p><p>In the rearview mirror, I saw several cars trailing us. Jett changed lanes. A blue car cut in front of the others and drove next to us. I didn\u2019t need to look at the driver to know it was Brian. Jett\u2019s foot remained on the accelerator, and for a moment I thought he wouldn\u2019t let Brian pass. And then our car slowed down, and Brian cut in front of us, and his taillights blinked once.</p><p>He was mocking us. Putting on a show.</p><p>Seemingly unaffected, Jett followed the blue Ferrari at a leisurely speed to God knows where.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>THROUGHOUT THE DRIVE Jett kept quiet, and I didn\u2019t speak in case he was tapping into his inner powers, or planning his strategy, or whatever professional drivers did. It was only after we\u2019d left the city behind that Jett broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you have to intervene, Brooke?\u201d His voice was calm but angry.</p><p>Holy cow.</p><p>That hint of a southern accent of his was even more sexy when he was angry.</p><p>So he had been giving me the silent treatment. I raised my chin defiantly and turned to look at him. The way his elbow rested against the window, and his other hand was relaxed on the steering wheel, he gave the impression of being bored\u2014were it not for the pulsing nerve in his temple and the way his eyes stared ahead at Brian\u2019s taillights.</p><p>\u201cWe need to hide somewhere,\u201d I stated the obvious.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Brooke. You have no idea how dangerous this is.\u201d All the anger he been hiding seeped through\u2014gradually, like a rivulet turning into a river. \u201cBrian and I had an arrangement. If Brian wanted to bend the situation, to hell with that!\u201d His fingers clenched at the steering wheel until his knuckles shimmered white beneath his bronze skin. \u201cThis is exactly what I\u2019ve been trying to avoid. I had it under control until you intervened.\u201d</p><p>Talk about accusing.</p><p>His sudden need to play the blame game made me angry.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t look like you had anything under control,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cIt looked like you were about to get us kicked out.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips in a tight line. Had I gone too far? I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect, Jett? That you could come back and pretend you never left them?\u201d His silence told me that I had hit a soft spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea what the big deal with you guys is, but they don\u2019t trust you, just like you don\u2019t trust them,\u201d I continued, softer. \u201cBut they want you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you?\u201d he asked. I met his glance before he turned his eyes back on the road.</p><p>\u201cKenny. And the fact that they kept your car and the name on your locker.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I haven\u2019t told you about my past.\u201d The ominous tone in his voice sent a chill down my spine. I straightened in my seat and turned to him until the seatbelt tightened around me. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason Brian wants me to race. Last time I did, there was an accident and somebody got killed. It was the reason why I left. Did Kenny tell you that, too?\u201d</p><p>My heart dropped in my chest.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Someone died?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much time to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he left it out on purpose.\u201d</p><p>I held my breath as I waited for him to go on and explain, but when Jett didn\u2019t continue, I realized he wasn\u2019t going to say more.</p><p>Either he still wasn\u2019t ready to disclose the whole story, or he didn\u2019t want to be distracted. The past was nothing but a shadow with the ability to create emotional upheaval. Maybe Jett didn\u2019t want to talk about it because it was too upsetting. I made a mental reminder to ask him later\u2014if we survived the race\u2014and decided to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jett said, flatly. \u201cBrian chooses the location.\u201d</p><p>For a few minutes we drove in silence. Finally, Brian\u2019s brake lights lit up and the vehicle slowed down to take a right onto open terrain. We stopped\u2014in the middle of nowhere. Jett\u2019s face was emotionless as he switched off the engine and we exited the car. A half dozen other vehicles followed and parked behind us. I was sure more would arrive soon.</p><p>The moon hid behind thick rainclouds that promised a heavy shower. The only light came from Brian\u2019s taillights. A gust of wind whipped my hair against my face. I wrapped my arms around me as I watched the scene unfold.</p><p>This is it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to ask. My gut feeling told me.</p><p>Jett\u2019s face remained an impenetrable mask as we waited for the games to begin.</p><p>\u201cHow does this work?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThree rounds with various checkpoints to make sure no one\u2019s bluffing,\u201d Jett whispered back. \u201cThe first round\u2019s always bumpy. The second is all about speed. The third\u2019s unpredictable. Whoever makes it back first wins. That\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, even though I hadn\u2019t caught half of what he said. Judging from the tense lines around his mouth, he was nervous. I didn\u2019t like it, because Jett was never nervous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A guy approached and began to talk so fast I barely caught more than a few words. Something about speed points and variation in road conditions. And then he departed again, and Jett opened my car door so I could enter.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jett, good luck, man,\u201d someone yelled before Jett slammed the door and I felt suffocated by the smell of the expensive leather seats and blinded by the dashboard lights I would have admired under different circumstances.</p><p>Slumping into his seat, Jett closed the door and leaned forward to whisper in my ear, his fingers fastening my seatbelt. \u201cIf we crash or the car flips, you try to get out as soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>He opened the passenger seat drawer and showed me a safety emergency hammer. \u201cIf the door\u2019s stuck, smash in the windows. Under no circumstances stay inside, or near the car. Do you understand? You have exactly twenty seconds to leave. Now repeat.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes probed mine with an intensity that scared me.</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens, I\u2019ll get out of the car as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>But how could I possibly leave him inside? That was when I realized what he was actually saying.</p><p>Save myself, leave him to his fate.</p> <p>I grimaced. \u201cIn other words, if something happens to you, I\u2019m to leave you behind? I can\u2019t do that, Jett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d he said, quietly. His eyes shimmered with a silent plea. \u201cThis car is fueled with high-explosive gas. If we crash and any of it leaks, it\u2019ll explode. There won\u2019t be time to save me. You do whatever saves you and our baby.\u201d</p><p>Hell, no!</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way, you know?\u201d I said. If anything happened, I knew I wouldn\u2019t leave. I\u2019d stay with him, no matter what.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying. We have to take the worst into account,\u201d Jett said, misunderstanding me. He peered out the window as more cars arrived.</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d I touched his arm gently, trying my best to infuse confidence in him. \u201cYou\u2019re the best driver I\u2019ve ever met. We\u2019ll be all right. I know it because I saw it in Italy. There\u2019s no reason to think about risks and what could happen when I know what you\u2019re capable of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is a risk, Brooke,\u201d Jett said, slowly. \u201cWhen I made that deal with Brian, I agreed to compete against his best man, but the truth is I haven\u2019t been involved in this kind of driving for years. And he knows it. Compared to Italy, this is nothing.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound at all like Jett. His doubts about himself didn\u2019t make sense to me.</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t unlearn their talents,\u201d I said, softly.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d He let out a long impatient sigh. \u201cI know you mean well, Brooke, but you don\u2019t know Doug. Everything he knows, he learned from me. He knows all my tricks, my moves. And the fact he wasn\u2019t retired these past few years gives him an advantage over me. Do you now understand why I didn\u2019t want you to come along?\u201d I nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d I protested. Jett was the best. Kenny had said so himself, and even without Kenny, I knew it in my heart. \u201cBesides, it doesn\u2019t matter. I still would have wanted to ride with you.\u201d</p><p>No matter what.</p><p>He shook his head. He hadn\u2019t just inherited the hotness gene; he had also inherited the stubbornness one.</p><p>\u201cEven if I were the best, I wouldn\u2019t want you in here. Your safety isn\u2019t worth taking the risk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about my opinion?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou never asked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has to make choices at some point,\u201d Jett said. \u201cI do what has to be done, not what I feel you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, this has nothing to do with want.\u201d I raised my chin defiantly at the stubborn glint in his gaze.</p><p>We weren\u2019t going to see eye to eye on this one, and that was fine. I didn\u2019t have to agree on everything. But it would\u2019ve been so nice.</p><p>\u201cFor me coming with you is the right choice, because it means we\u2019re creating a new memory together regardless of the outcome.\u201d I sucked in a deep breath as I struggled to find the right words. \u201cLike you, I need to stay by your side because you mean everything to me. If you fall, I fall,\u201d I whispered, repeating his words. \u201cAnd if we fall, I\u2019d rather we do it together. No exceptions, no regrets, and that\u2019s a whole lot better than taking a chance and having to live without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember?\u201d He turned slowly, his eyes penetrating my soul, absorbing my words. The love in his gaze reached my heart, coursed through my blood, and swirled inside my mind.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d I nodded. \u201cYou asked me if I trusted you, and I can tell you in all honesty that I do now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes twinkled brighter than the stars dotting the night sky.</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem trusting my dedication to you, but you trust me in a life-and-death situation?\u201d he asked in disbelief. His delicious lips twitched at the corners. I couldn\u2019t help but smile because it was the truth.</p><p>I wanted to reply when his brows shot up. I followed his line of vision and saw Brian signaling something before heading back to his car.</p><p>\u201cThree minutes left,\u201d Jett said, his attention turning back to me. His hand lingered on my face as he brushed a strand of hair out of my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re like no one I\u2019ve met before,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure is.\u201d He smiled, revealing a pair of gorgeous dimples to die for. \u201cI like that you trust me. I can work with that.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face, his thumb stroking my skin as he leaned in to kiss me, his tongue meeting mine in a tender embrace. It barely lasted a few seconds, and yet it was the best kiss of my life.</p><p>\u201cI truly believe you\u2019re the greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d Jett said softly, \u201cand there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d ever change about you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>He kissed me again. It was only when he leaned back to pull on his gloves and turn the key that I realized our kiss might have been our last.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>IT WASN\u2019T THE roar of Jett\u2019s car, nor the fired shot signaling the start of the race what sent my intestines into icy knots. It was the moment a black car pulled up next to us that I knew the time had come.</p><p>The passenger window rolled down, and Doug\u2019s gaze met mine. He was in his early twenties, with blond curly hair that fell into his blue eyes. His features were roughened, and his posture was confident. But what made me wary was the self-assured smile on his lips. It wasn\u2019t so much a smile as a smirk. Jett nodded and let out a low chuckle. In that instant I knew. Two men engaged in a battle of egos equaled a hell of a ride. And I was trapped inside this nightmare with no way out. Jett sped up and changed gears, the muscles in his arms straining. He didn\u2019t seem bothered by the way Doug\u2019s car kept coming too close\u2014or that Doug bumped into our car when he overtook us shortly before we reached the first cross-point.</p><p>Someone made a hand signal. Doug turned to the left and Jett followed. I expected Jett to swear, but instead he hit the pedals harder and we sped off. No signs of his nervousness. My fingers buried in the armrest when the tires hit a bump in the road and I shot forward against the seatbelt. I wanted to scream, but the sound remained trapped in my throat. Jett needed my support. He needed my trust, because doubt and fear would take us nowhere.</p><p>But fear choked me, made me gasp for air and wish I\u2019d never have to set foot in a car again.</p><p>I hated the way the car kept jerking after each bump and the engine roared like it might be about to draw its last breath. Every muscle in my body hurt, and my mind was spiraling into a giant hole of panic. Each second felt like an eternity. At the second cross-point, Jett overtook Doug. Adrenaline pulsed through me as I realized we still had a chance to win. Jett knew what he was doing, and his focus gave me courage. We were so close. So near I could already see the headlights of countless cars marking the finish line. Soon my ordeal would be over.</p><p>I recognized Brian\u2019s blue Ferrari in the distance. He was leaning casually against his car, the lights illuminating his features. We were almost there, barely a hundred feet. Fifty feet. But Jett didn\u2019t slow down. He was going way too fast. If he didn\u2019t stop in time, we\u2019d crash into Brian\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d I shouted. He didn\u2019t acknowledge my command. Was he so high on adrenaline that he didn\u2019t realize what was about to happen?</p><p>\u201cJett!\u201d I screamed, bracing myself. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem affected in any way. My heart dropped. In horror I watched Brian jump out of the way. Just in time, Jett swerved the wheel and drove past his car and the finish line.</p><p>\u201cServes him right for dragging you into this,\u201d he mumbled, and hit the accelerator again.</p><p>I shook my head at his stunt and let out a sigh of relief that nothing bad had happened. And we were the first to reach the finish line, meaning we had won. I turned to Jett. His fingers remained clenched around the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cBack to the city.\u201d His calm tone, which I suspected was supposed to comfort me, only managed to alert me.</p><p>Why would he drive all the way back to the city when we were supposed to pick up his award or whatever?</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cI thought you were going to stop. You said so yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He dragged out the word, not looking at me. \u201cOnce it\u2019s over. The race isn\u2019t finished yet.\u201d He took a left onto the main road. In the distance stretched out the illuminated highway and the New York skyline.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rules are: whoever arrives first, wins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to drive all the way back through the city? Through the traffic to the warehouses? How the hell would he win without getting a speeding ticket? Or worse yet, becoming famous on national TV? In my mind, I could already see a helicopter circling over us, relaying the news that a driver had run amok, and people being warned to stay off the streets. We\u2019d be all over national TV. So much for keeping a low profile.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I shook my head, realizing the finish line was the warehouse and we were taking a detour. What he was about to do was crazy. I checked the rearview mirror. Doug followed closely behind.</p><p>\u201cYou thought it\u2019d be that easy?\u201d Jett asked, answering my unspoken question.</p><p>\u201cYou call that easy?\u201d I muttered. \u201cI\u2019d say crazy, insane even.\u201d I clasped my hand over my mouth. The truth crippled me. Apparently, Jett had every intention of continuing this madness through the busy streets of New York City. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d he said. We overtook one car and then another. After a few minutes Jett hit the brakes. We slowed down to below the speed limit. I shot Jett a confused look. Doug drove past. Jett didn\u2019t seem to notice. When we halted in the middle of the road, I knew something was wrong. As much as I wanted to believe Jett had stopped because of me, I couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling he\u2019d never give up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked. Doug disappeared in the distance. Judging by the way he wound his way through traffic, he\u2019d either crash or win. Cars stacked up behind us, but Jett ignored them\u2014and me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJett?\u201d My fingers barely touched his arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you notice Doug stayed on our tail but didn\u2019t take the lead\u2014until now? He thinks he can catch up in the end, which is possible, given that it\u2019s one of the tricks I taught him. I\u2019m devising a different strategy.\u201d He peered at me briefly before turning his attention on the rearview mirror.</p><p>I feared the answer, but felt compelled to ask. \u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shortcut he doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Jett said calmly.</p> <p>Ah.</p><p>Somehow I didn\u2019t like it because, knowing Jett, shortcuts were never \u201cshortcuts\u201d as in \u201cthe easy way.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t just suspect.</p><p>I knew.</p><p>Doug had almost disappeared from my vision, but if I craned my neck I could still see him stuck at a red light. Jammed in with other cars, he couldn\u2019t possibly follow Jett.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a shortcut as a plan,\u201d Jett continued. That sounded even worse. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the same route, only the opposite way.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what he was talking about, but had no time to ask because Jett went into full reverse. The car spun around, earning us more honks, but he didn\u2019t seem particularly fazed by the swearing drivers as he navigated down a narrow strip of lawn, swerving straight into oncoming traffic.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking crazy?\u201d I shouted.</p><p>Ignoring me, he floored the accelerator, and the car jerked forward. We were driving so fast I wanted to cry. Instead I made do with burying my nails into the soft leather of my seat. My breath came in labored heaves each time cars drove out of our way to let us pass, or we dodged them.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop,\u201d I whispered in the hope Jett might listen to me for a change.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t. This is the only way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Doug\u2019s stuck,\u201d I argued. \u201cCan you at least\u2014\u201d</p><p>Slow down.</p><p>Jett shot me a strange look, and I clamped my mouth shut to stop myself from whining. At an intersection Jett took a sharp left into a quiet one-way road. Straight ahead was the main road.</p><p>We were in the city.</p><p>So many people, so many cars. Jett didn\u2019t seem concerned as he continued to race through the streets. I caught the flashing blue lights of a police car before I heard the siren.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Jett floored the gas pedal, turning the wheel expertly as he crossed a red light. The police car followed behind.</p><p>\u201cWe need to stop, Jett.\u201d My voice came so low I wasn\u2019t sure he heard me.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t. Trust me, we\u2019ll get out of this.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, God.</p><p>His shortcut involved driving like a madman. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I could\u2019ve sworn the brakes weren\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Jett whispered, his voice was strained but by no means nervous. I always knew Jett was a risk-taker. Now I realized the guy was crazy beyond my wildest dreams, because he apparently thought anyone could relax with him behind the wheel.</p><p>Relax?</p><p>I felt physically sick. In fact, I prayed I\u2019d just pass out and wake up when the nightmare was over. My heart pounded hard against the layer of frost spreading over me. I buried my face in my hands and started to chant in my mind.</p><p>Stay calm. Be quiet. Breathe in. Breathe out. Think of sunshine, of calming waters, the sound of seagulls. Think of violins, of heaven.</p><p>No. Bad idea. I didn\u2019t want to think of heaven.</p><p>Think of walking on the beach. Healthy. With Jett and a baby. Happy. Alive.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I muttered. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>My fear intensified and transformed into a growing chill that could turn into ice and shatter me into pieces. The car chase in Italy had been bad. It had been horrendous. But Jett racing through New York City\u2019s streets with a police car trailing us was a living nightmare.</p><p>\u201cBaby, just close your eyes,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>Close my eyes and pretend it wasn\u2019t happening? That had been the plan all along.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cJust continue to keep them closed,\u201d he replied, encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I muttered. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>Please, please, please, I prayed. Help us win. Help us arrive safely. Help us make it out alive. Help that nobody gets hurt.</p><p>Could I have that many different wishes at the same time?</p><p>\u201cThey lost us,\u201d Jett said at last. Confused, I opened my eyes. He had slowed down and we were cruising a half-empty parking garage.</p><p>The sirens echoed in the distance.</p><p>Jett drove out of the building, past several blocks, and turned onto a highway for a few minutes. I recognized buildings in the distance before Jett exited the highway and drove along the fence. To my utter disbelief, we had made it unscathed.</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>\u201cIs that\u2014\u201d</p><p>The warehouse, I wanted to ask until I saw Jett turning the wheel, spinning the car. He floored the gas and drove past the gates. The finish line had to be on the other side. In the distance I could see car headlights. Jett hit the brakes, and the tires screeched. My head jerked forward, and a pang of pain shot up my spine.</p><p>I smirked. My eyes fell on the crowd of people. They looked surprised, as though they didn\u2019t expect us to come from the back. And then the cheers began and more people gathered. Jett ignored them as he drove into the open garage. Doug\u2019s car wasn\u2019t there. Jett switched off the engine and turned to face me. His dark hair stuck to his temples, and sweat rivulets were running down his neck.</p><p>My legs were trembling so hard I pressed my soles into the floor to stop them from shaking. My whole body felt numb.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve won,\u201d Jett said, calmly. Was that a hint of pride? \u201cYou okay?\u201d I shook my head, because I wasn\u2019t okay. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we have a fake license plate.\u201d The corners of his lips curved upward. So I had been right. He was proud. Maybe even elated.</p><p>\u201cA speeding ticket isn\u2019t what I\u2019ve been worried about,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Fury burned inside me\u2014at Jett\u2019s reckless driving, at his whole alpha \u201cI do everything to win\u201d attitude, and at a million other things. How could he smile when barely seconds ago he\u2019d scared the hell out of God knows how many people, including me?</p><p>\u201cI fucking hate\u2014\u201d I struggled for words, the shock rendering me unable to form a coherent sentence.</p><p>\u201cHow much you love me?\u201d His dimples appeared, and for a moment I felt torn between hitting him and kissing him.</p><p>I stared at him, and then I started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I do, and how crazy is that?\u201d I knew it was hysteria and the adrenaline pumping inside my veins. That, or gratitude that we were still alive.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what came over me, but seeing him hot and sweaty, with that amused glint in his devilish green eyes, I wanted him. I wanted him badly. Madly. Furiously. And I didn\u2019t care if it happened here, right on the spot, and if his ego grew sky high. I climbed over to his side and moved on top of him. My fingers buried in his hair as my lips descended upon his mouth with the kind of hunger that demanded immediate gratification.</p><p>\u201cI knew there was a wicked side to you, Miss Stewart,\u201d Jett whispered against my mouth, and pulled back.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot crazy. I was crazy to come with you. I was crazy to think I could make it out with my sanity intact,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll never do anything like this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d His eyebrows shot up in mock surprise. \u201cWhat happened to \u2018no exceptions, no regrets\u2019? I really liked that one. It sort of gave me leverage to try new things with you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything for you, but no car races. No more stunts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like a challenge. You know that.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAccording to our arrangement and my rules, I still have several hours left.\u201d</p><p>I groaned.</p><p>Not that horrendous bet again!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve won. Get over it,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cJust one more stunt, baby.\u201d His eyes twinkled. I shook my head. \u201cHow about you let me change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, but I\u2019ll pass.\u201d I\u2019d had enough of an adrenaline rush to last me a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard second times around can be pretty good, too,\u201d Jett said. \u201cLet\u2019s sneak out of the party and spend time together. It\u2019s long overdue, anyway.\u201d</p><p>The way he said it, he made it sound like a date. We hadn\u2019t gone on a date in forever. Actually, since breaking into Kim Dessen\u2019s house. But it sure felt like an eternity. \u201cWhat party?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCall it a welcome party,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cTime to meet my gang.\u201d I had no idea what he was talking about, but the prospect of spending more time with him sounded tempting.</p><p>\u201cLet me take a shower first,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd no more stunts, Mayfield. I really mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo stunts, I promise.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Hadn\u2019t I heard that one before?</p><p>\u201cAt least for a while,\u201d Jett added.</p><p>My smile matched his as he pulled me to him for another kiss.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>THE UPPER FLOORS of the warehouses were converted into bedrooms. Brian had arranged that Jett and I would take a shower and change in a room upstairs, which was pretty much the opposite of how I envisioned it: tiny but tastefully decorated in cream and brown with an adjacent bathroom and a shower cubicle. A four-poster bed lined the east side. A soft cream couch was set up in the middle in front of a TV set mounted on the wall. Everything looked neat and tidy. Whoever had decorated it obviously had taste.</p><p>\u201cThis used to be my room,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d That really changed everything. I spun around slowly, trying to take in the details I might\u2019ve missed. I walked over to the bed and lay down. The mattress was soft and the covers smelled fresh, as though they\u2019d been changed recently. There were no pictures on the walls, but for some reason, I could feel a younger Jett\u2019s presence, his spirit and attitude. He had been tormented, yet he had also been happy.</p><p>\u201cI like it here,\u201d I said, softly. \u201cI\u2019m happy we get to stay for a while.\u201d</p><p>Someone\u2014I assumed Sylvie\u2014had brought over clothes and as soon as I closed the bathroom door behind me, I stripped off and stepped into the shower, eager to let the hot water relax my tense muscles and calm my frayed nerves.</p><p>I had barely shampooed and rinsed my hair when the bathroom door opened and I saw Jett\u2019s silhouette clearly outlined through the curtain. He took his clothes off and peered behind the curtain, his impossibly green gaze a mixture between hesitation and desire.</p><p>\u201cBrooke.\u201d His deep voice saying my name sent a jolt of fire between my legs. \u201cI want to do something dirty to you. Something you\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>My pulse picked up in speed, and a rush of excitement washed over me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He pushed the shower curtain aside and joined me in the cubicle, naked in all his glory. My mouth went dry at the beauty of his sculpted body with bulging muscles beneath taut skin.</p><p>Sex incarnate.</p><p>As though reading my dirty thoughts, Jett smiled, and our mouths met in a heated kiss. His tongue slipped inside me, prodding, demanding that I open up and give him what was his to take. At the same time, his hand settled between my legs. I moaned when he started to circle my clit. He didn\u2019t just make me wet; he made me ache for his fingers inside me, to touch him and test if he was real. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My fingertips grazed his swelling shaft.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning me on, baby.\u201d His whisper turned into a guttural rasp when my fingers began to work up and down his hardening shaft, mirroring his movements as his fingers circled faster around my clit, until I felt I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore.</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me,\u201d I moaned against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted my left leg, and I let go of his bulging erection to hold onto his shoulders for support. Ever so slowly he began to thrust one finger inside me, then two, igniting a blaze.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>Water kept pouring down on us, and I was sure that wasn\u2019t the only thing running down my leg. My body began to rock back and forth against him, seeking the pleasure only he could unleash. He pushed two fingers in and out, fast and furious. I moaned and leaned into his hand, ready for complete abandon. Just when I thought he\u2019d take me over the edge, Jett slowed down\u2014unbearably hot, unbearably painful\u2014and then pulled out. His fingers continued to circle my clit without giving me the release I desperately needed.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d I said. \u201cI want you to fuck me now.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an option; it was a demand.</p> <p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d His eyes bored into me as he pressed me against the tiled wall and forced my left leg up higher. I could feel the slick head of his erection at my entrance, circling and nudging, doing anything but filling me. Impatiently, I stirred against him, my eyes begging him to take me.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d He pushed the head inside me, stretching the soft flesh, while kissing my earlobe. My heart almost stopped from the sudden sweltering sensation gathering deep in my abdomen. I was so close. Just a few more inches.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>His erection plunged another inch into me, teasing me by moving gently, building the momentum until I felt like cursing him for torturing me.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Jett!\u201d I swore. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed that deep laugh of his that always made me tingle all over. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p> <p>I gasped as he shoved his entire length into me\u2014fast and determined. One full thrust. My flesh tightened around his shaft. The pain of him hitting an aching spot inside me disappeared quickly, and more pleasure began to build inside my abdomen. Consuming me. Burning my insides like hot lava.</p><p>He quivered, alive with fire, waiting...waiting for what?</p><p>My mind was too clouded to ask a question, too high from his scent and the taste of his mouth, too starved from his touch.</p><p>I needed him. He had to be moving. He had to before I exploded. Or else...</p><p>I ground my hips against him in need of more. My thigh muscles began to hurt from the effort, but I didn\u2019t mind. I needed release, and if he wouldn\u2019t give it to me, then I was ready to take it.</p><p>\u201cI could stay inside you forever,\u201d Jett whispered\u2014almost dreamy, almost regretful. He circled his hips without thrusting. \u201cRemember the feeling of me inside you. We\u2019re together. Not you, nor me, but us.\u201d</p><p>The rawness of his hot words sent another ripple through my core, pushing me closer to the brink of an orgasm. It felt good. He was so good. I wanted to tell him. As if sensing my desire for him, he smiled. Our eyes locked with such intensity I felt lost in them, unable to tell where I ended and he began.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t decline when you\u2019re like this.\u201d His lips crushed mine. \u201cSo wet. Baby, I could do this forever.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, his entire length began to move. I could feel every hard inch of him getting bigger, filling and stretching me. Pushing my boundaries.</p><p>Moaning into my open mouth, he began to thrust, first slow and then hard and harder. Faster and faster, sending my world into a whirlwind of lust and exhilaration. I closed my eyes to savor the sensation as the room began to spin around us. All I could feel was the hardness of his body spearing me.</p><p>\u201cJett.\u201d My breath quickened, and I plummeted into a sea of ecstasy. From the periphery of my mind I heard his final moan and felt his hot moisture spilling deep inside. My body melted into him, trusting him for support, as his waves of pleasure washed over me, taking us both to new shores.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how long we stood in that shower, our bodies merged, the water cooling our feverish skin. Eventually, when the water began to turn cold as ice, we stepped out of the shower, dripping all over the floor. My legs were shaking from the effort, but my heartbeat had slowed down to a normal speed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered, so low I didn\u2019t think Jett would hear me.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d He wrapped me in a towel and kissed the tip of my nose.</p><p>For being amazing.</p><p>I shrugged and smiled, keeping my thoughts to myself.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>BY THE TIME we finally arrived, the party was in full swing. The entire first floor was abuzz with people, Doug included, and more were flooding in by the minute. An indie band was playing in the corner. The air was thick with cigarette smoke. The tables were littered with alcohol bottles, half-empty glasses, and snacks, reminding me of my college days. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. It was going to be a long night, I could see that.</p><p>Jett led me through the crowd, his possessive hand resting on the small of my back. I nodded even though I couldn\u2019t hear a word he said and continued to scan the room for Sylvie\u2014without much success. We made it over to Brian. A girl sat on his lap. I recognized her as the one who had urged me to hurry with changing into the racing suit. The moment she saw us approaching, she stood and left.</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>Not only did she not like me, she had no problems showing it.</p><p>\u201cGood job.\u201d Brian patted Jett on the shoulder and then turned to address me. \u201cPeople owe me a shitload of money. I knew Jett would win.\u201d</p><p>So it was all about money?</p><p>Jett cocked his eyebrow. \u201cDid you also bet on winning the drinking game tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you challenging me?\u201d Brian laughed out loud. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m a champ all the way. I have a high tolerance level. No fucking way you\u2019d beat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I\u2019m in?\u201d Jett said. \u201cNo drinks for me tonight, but I know someone who\u2019d knock you off your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, I\u2019m Irish,\u201d Brian said. \u201cI\u2019ve won against everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for your sister.\u201d Jett nodded at the red-haired woman standing behind Brian. \u201cShe\u2019s in town, visiting.\u201d</p><p>Brian turned, his smile gone. \u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy money\u2019s well invested.\u201d Jett shot me a reassuring smile, and I knew he wasn\u2019t being serious. \u201cShe\u2019s going to strip you of your title big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello to you, too, big guy.\u201d The woman smiled at Jett and turned to me. Her hazel eyes reflected her curiosity, but there was something else in them\u2014warmth, which led me to believe Jett and she had been friends, and nothing but friends. \u201cNews spreads fast. When I heard you were back, I had to come and see for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooke,\u201d I said, reaching out. She grabbed my hand and gave it a good shake. For a moment, we just looked at each other, assessing. She was in her mid thirties, with a full-bodied voluptuous figure, pale skin, freckles, and an infectious smile. I decided to like her instantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cassidy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve already heard so much about you. The bastards who\u2019re after you will pay.\u201d It took me a moment to realize she was talking about Alessandro\u2019s club. \u201cBrian knows how to find them. He\u2019s like a bloodhound.\u201d She roared with laughter.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I said. \u201cJett and I could do with a little peace.\u201d Cassidy\u2019s gaze brushed my abdomen, and she nodded knowingly. I wondered how she\u2019d found out, but instead of asking I just smiled.</p><p>We chatted until Brian hit the stage, drawing everyone\u2019s attention to us by declaring Jett as the winner of the race, as if the world didn\u2019t know already, and then he went on to recount Jett\u2019s little stunt, including our car almost crashing into Brian\u2019s Ferrari. The room filled with laughter, Brian\u2019s included. Brian finally left the stage, and people flooded over to congratulate Jett, Doug among them. I stepped aside to give Jett his moment. Either the race had changed everything, or maybe everyone had been waiting for Brian\u2019s approval, but the ice was broken.</p><p>For the first time I saw Jett relaxed and easy-going in a public gathering. As if the person before me wasn\u2019t the Jett Mayfield I knew\u2014the rich, reticent millionaire whose only purpose was to ensure the success of his company. Kenny had been right. The gang was Jett\u2019s family. Jett had more in common with them than he might ever realize because they had shaped him. They had helped him after his father kicked him out. For the umpteenth time, I wondered what had gone so horribly wrong that Jett returned to his father.</p><p>\u201cWant to leave, baby?\u201d Jett whispered in my ear. \u201cYou look so good in your tight jeans you\u2019re turning me on.\u201d As though to prove his point, his hand brushed my ass and his lips grazed the sensitive skin on my neck. A delicious jolt pulsed through me. If it weren\u2019t for the dozen people around us, I would\u2019ve ripped open his shirt and pulled down his pants to enjoy his glorious body.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just arrived and you want to leave already?\u201d I asked, amused. \u201cWhat happened to partying through the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a trick question?\u201d His hoarse tone sent another shiver through my body. Slowly he began to nibble on my earlobe. \u201cWhen I want something, I don\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take it. Got it.\u201d I swallowed and turned around, facing his deep green eyes the color of sin. \u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a good idea, Miss Stewart.\u201d Heat traveled somewhere south at the insinuation in his voice. \u201cLet me show you something that will make your panties wet.\u201d</p><p>Again?</p><p>He grabbed my hand and motioned for me to follow him. We were almost out the door when Brian blocked our way.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone show you your way around?\u201d Brian asked, addressing me.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Jett said through gritted teeth. Did I detect a hint of irritation?</p><p>\u201cBut I insist.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged at Jett, who shot me a glare. I shrugged again. This was Brian\u2019s territory, and he was proud of what he had built. We were guests, so obviously we had to behave as such. Jett could take off his pants later.</p><p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d I said. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>Brian talked all the way through the tour, while Jett\u2019s mood seemed to plummet to an all-time low. Amused, I gaped at the hugeness of the place. The warehouses were interconnected by a subterranean maze of corridors, which I had already suspected. The upper floors had all been converted to rooms and apartments. From outside the walls looked like they might be about to crumble, but the interior design showed Brian had spared no expense. The furniture was minimalistic but modern and expensive, the technology high-tech. Abstract paintings in red and blue with golden swirls hung on the walls, each showing the same signature. I wondered if one of the guys was an artist.</p><p>\u201cYou all live here?\u201d I asked, impressed.</p><p>\u201cSome of us. Others prefer their own place,\u201d Brian said, and opened the next door, leading us into a huge living room with a fireplace and yet more paintings displayed on the walls. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to stay here for as long as you want. The top floor is all yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy old room will do just fine, Brian,\u201d Jett muttered.</p><p>\u201cI thought your girl might prefer something more\u2014\u201d Brian drew a long breath, considering his words as he regarded me \u201c\u2014upscale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019d love to stay in Jett\u2019s old room, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Jett\u2019s arm wrapped around my waist. If I didn\u2019t know better, I would have said he was pleased with my answer\u2014and possessive.</p> <p>\u201cIf you need anything, let me know.\u201d Brian hesitated and turned to Jett. \u201cCan I have a minute with you?\u201d</p><p>I wondered if talking with Jett in private was the reason why Brian had insisted on coming with us.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake as long as you need,\u201d I said to them. The door shut and I was alone, but I could hear their voices loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve arranged for a meeting tomorrow to find out who the unidentified recipient is. How much money are we talking about?\u201d Brian asked.</p> <p>\u201cFifty mill,\u201d Jett replied.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe company\u2019s going bankrupt.\u201d Jett hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m a CEO. If I don\u2019t sort out this mess, I could be held liable. I could lose everything; my money, my home, my investors in the new company, my reputation. But first I need you to focus on finding out who\u2019s responsible for Brooke\u2019s kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on decoding the disk,\u201d Brian said. \u201cGive us a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have days. I need it as soon as possible. My father wanted the book, so it must be valuable. As long as we don\u2019t know who we\u2019re dealing with, Brooke\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re assuming your father\u2019s in on it? What if he had no choice?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap, Brian. You know there\u2019s no other explanation. My best guess is he transferred the money to keep some for himself. However, the question is why? I need to know if there\u2019s anything we don\u2019t know. I need you to check out possible risks. The last thing I want is my father getting us into deeper shit than we\u2019re already in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep you updated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>For a minute they talked about Cassidy. I walked over to the bed as soon as I heard footsteps crossing the room. The door opened and Jett entered.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d he asked after he closed the door behind him.</p><p>I winced, unable to hide my guilty expression. \u201cHow did you know I was listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard to guess. I know you, Brooke. Besides I don\u2019t want to keep secrets from you.\u201d He tilted his head, scrutinizing me. \u201cSo, how much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost everything, actually. But I already know that Mayfield Realities are trouble, so it\u2019s no big deal,\u201d I admitted. \u201cYour brother mentioned that you were working on setting up a new company.\u201d</p> <p>He looked up, surprised. \u201cAnd what are your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking you\u2019re going to be great,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMany people don\u2019t know when to cut their losses when it\u2019s over. They choose to stay in a dead-end situation until everything comes crashing down on them. You\u2019re doing the right thing, Jett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacrifices before losses. I\u2019m happy you get me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you about the missing money sooner.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I would\u2019ve loved to help you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use your expert opinion in everything I do, Miss Stewart. How much do you charge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d My grin matched is. \u201cAnd I know exactly how you can repay me.\u201d I pointed at the couch behind us. \u201cBrian was kind enough to give us a nice room. We could commence our negotiations right now.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to the couch. Jett followed me and sat down, pulling me onto his lap. His hands pushed aside my hair to caress the nape of my neck. I closed my eyes, relishing his touch.</p><p>\u201cToo bad we\u2019re not staying for long,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t trust them. It\u2019s too dangerous for you. And second\u2014\u201d His breath tickled my skin a moment before his lips parted in a tender kiss. \u201cI want to spend quality time with you.\u201d</p><p>I turned to regard him. \u201cBrian helped you find me. He\u2019s trying to locate your father and find out what the club\u2019s all about. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re overreacting a little bit with the whole trust issue thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d Jett said grimly.</p><p>Well, it sort of was to me.</p><p>There was something in his expression that made me clamp my mouth shut and listen. He was angry. But why? Wasn\u2019t he happy to be back in touch with his old friends?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand, Jett. This used to be your family.\u201d I removed myself from his lap and kneeled before him, my elbows resting against his knees, as I looked at him. \u201cYou guys share so many memories. I thought you\u2019d want to spend time with them.\u201d</p><p>His face resembled a grim mask. Something I\u2019d said was wrong, and it made my mind frantic to figure out my misstep. I touched his leg to get his attention. Jett didn\u2019t react.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, unsure what I was apologizing for. \u201cDo you want to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>The silence between us seemed oppressing. Voice carried over from outside the door\u2014the chatter, music, and laughter building a strong contrast to what was going on inside Jett\u2019s tormented soul. I could sense that if I probed too hard, I\u2019d go too far, and I didn\u2019t want to push him. I watched Jett\u2019s fingers curl around the picture frame on the side table. On it were a group of men sitting around a bonfire. With his tanned body and gorgeous dimples, I recognized Jett instantly. I bit my lip as I tried to imagine what could have caused Jett\u2019s sudden change in mood.</p><p>\u201cI killed my best friend,\u201d he said, as though reading my thoughts. His voice was so low I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d heard him right. His finger pointed at a blond man sitting next to him, holding a beer in his hand and laughing.</p><p>\u201cWas it an accident?\u201d I asked, breathlessly. It had to be. Anything else wouldn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head slowly. \u201cNot really.\u201d His voice was raw, and his eyes filled with moisture. His face reflected so much pain that it seeped from his every pore. The thought that Jett was a killer didn\u2019t quite fit the picture inside my mind. I couldn\u2019t imagine him doing anything terrible, and yet I knew it was possible. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I remembered the gunshots. Somehow I knew Jett had shot the men who had been about to rape me. If it happened once, there was at least some possibility Jett had hurt people before.</p><p>In the silence of the room, my glance moved from Jett to the picture in his hands. It seemed to have been taken an eternity ago. But I couldn\u2019t ask the question burning a hole in my brain. Instead I waited patiently until he was ready.</p><p>\u201cJoe did stupid stuff,\u201d Jett began. His words came slowly, struggling. \u201cHe had owed everyone, me included, because he was a gambling addict. He was so deep in shit, he couldn\u2019t even tell me he had borrowed money from loan sharks.\u201d His voice faltered, and he took a deep breath.</p><p>I swallowed. I had never seen Jett this way, his usual composed self breaking down. Not even when he talked about his father.</p><p>\u201cOne day he needed a driver to pick something up. I didn\u2019t think much of it, so I drove him to the place without asking questions. But picking up wasn\u2019t the only thing he did that day. He killed someone. Said it was an accident. He confessed to me about various loans and the odd jobs he had been doing to repay those people. I promised I\u2019d have his back and help him if he stopped working for them. But Joe didn\u2019t want to listen.\u201d</p><p>His voice was so heavy I knew there was more to the story. I watched him take another breath and put the picture back on the side table. My body urged me to touch him, but the man standing in front of me was trapped by memories, and I was seemingly forgotten, a shadow that couldn\u2019t reach him.</p><p>\u201cThat day he was supposed to take back the money he stole. Instead he hid it somewhere inside the warehouse and told me he\u2019d leave the city, hide until he had made enough money to repay his debt and the high interest.\u201d</p><p>I shrank back a little at the intensity in Jett\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t need to tell me what he felt\u2014the pain was written all over his face, inside his soul, inside his mind. His hands were balled to fists. I didn\u2019t need words to figure out that things had gone horribly wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>He pressed his lips in a tight line, struggling, his eyes moving back to the picture, as if it held the answers he was looking for.</p><p>\u201cThe money was gone the next day. Joe accused me of stealing it, and we had a fight.\u201d He smiled bitterly. \u201cI was so angry about his accusation that I went to Brian and told him the truth about the loans. The job. The money. I wanted to help Joe. But Brian\u2014\u201d Jett took a deep breath, his tone angry. \u201cHe wanted Joe out of the gang. Said he was a liability.\u201d</p><p>I looked up, confused. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we already had problems with other gangs. It\u2019s the way this world works. Brian said that Joe posed a risk to all of us because he\u2019d get us involved with the big guys and the real shit, like drugs. Brian took me in when I had no place to stay. He was always there for me. I went to him, trusting his judgment. When Brian wanted to kick Joe out, I begged him to give Joe a second chance, because without a gang he would have had no protection from the sharks. Brian was reluctant but eventually agreed under the condition we taught Joe a lesson and\u2014\u201d Jett paused, taking his time \u201c\u2014I offered to do it. Even though I was angry with Joe, he was my best friend, and I wanted to have control over what would be done to him. I suggested a race with the plan to simulate a collision with Joe\u2014just to scare him, break a few bones, lock him inside a hospital for a while, where we could help him. Brian agreed. But it went wrong.\u201d He trailed off.</p><p>The air charged with heaviness. I knew what was coming, and it broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cI lost control over my car and killed him,\u201d Jett said slowly, his eyes hard and cold. \u201cIt was my fucking fault.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed down the lump in my throat as I stared at the picture and the man sitting next to Jett. Jett never lost control while driving. I had seen it with my own eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see the tree on his side of the road.\u201d He cast his gaze on the floor. In spite of the dimmed lights, I could see the moisture shimmering in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut he did,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhen I hit him, he spun the car, pushed mine aside, and crashed right into the tree. By doing so, he saved my life but sacrificed himself. I watched his car explode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>I loved Jett. I loved him with all my heart. I didn\u2019t want guilt to consume him. I grabbed his hand and pulled him to me, forcing him to look me in the eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was an accident, Jett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d His voice was angry. \u201cSee, there\u2019s always a huge risk. I knew it when I made that suggestion. I knew that it could kill him\u2014or me. Yet I made that mistake and it defined me. It changed everything.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his hands softly. Inside I was shaken by his confession\u2014not so much about what had happened, but by what he thought of himself. \u201cJett, your mistakes do not define you. You\u2019re far more than the sum of a few bad decisions in life.\u201d</p><p>He laughed darkly. I could see he didn\u2019t believe me.</p> <p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t raced that day, he\u2019d still be alive. My mistake cost his life,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cAnd when I found out that Brian knew about Joe\u2019s problems all along, that it was he who took the money and returned it to the sharks to prevent the place from being raided, I left the gang. If he had told me, I\u2019d never have suggested the race and Joe wouldn\u2019t be dead. So no, I can\u2019t trust Brian. Joe had been more than a friend to me. He was like a brother.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence. The muscles in his jaws began to work, but his eyes were glued to my hands, touching me without actually touching my skin. The air felt prickly and dark between us. I didn\u2019t know where to start or how to help him, even though to me Jett wasn\u2019t guilty. But how could I convince the man I loved that it was an accident\u2014that he didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2014when he was the only person who could convince himself?</p><p>\u201cIf Brian knew about Joe\u2019s problems all along, maybe the sharks threatened him and he returned the money to keep you all safe,\u201d I suggested. \u201cHave you ever asked him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I left.\u201d He shrugged, his face a hard mask of denial. \u201cBut you don\u2019t understand, Brooke. The race was my idea. It was my fucking idea, not Brian\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think Joe didn\u2019t know what he was getting himself into?\u201d I whispered. \u201cHe knew the risks, and he wanted out. Even if he hadn\u2019t died that day, he\u2019d have owed a lot of people a lot of money. Dangerous people who would\u2019ve come after him for taking that money. It wouldn\u2019t have ended well.\u201d</p> <p>It was a twisted kind of logic, but it was the brutal truth. And Jett knew it, whether he wanted to admit it or not.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d Jett said, choosing to stay in denial. \u201cFor all we know it could have ended differently, if only he\u2019d gotten the chance to turn his life around.\u201d</p><p>Jett was right. He didn\u2019t know if Joe wouldn\u2019t have been okay\u2014like I didn\u2019t know if my sister would have stopped seeing Danny if I hadn\u2019t let her leave the house that fateful night. But when I trusted Jett with my secret, he helped me cope with the guilt that had been torturing me for years. I felt connected to Jett because I thought he understood my pain. My confession was my key to feeling free and safe around him and within the confines of my mind. Now that I knew about his past, I longed to help him build that same connection to me.</p><p>I moistened my lips, considering my words carefully.</p><p>\u201cRight after I told you about my sister, you said to me that no one can help a person if they don\u2019t want to be helped. Remember?\u201d I paused. When he nodded, I continued. \u201cI know this hurts, but your past isn\u2019t so different from mine, Jett. You couldn\u2019t have helped Joe because he had made up his mind. For what it\u2019s worth, you gave it your best shot, given the knowledge and life experience you had at that time. Deep in your heart you cared for Joe. You suggested a car race because, like Kenny said, it was what you knew and did best. Not because you wanted to hurt your friend, but because you wanted to help him. I\u2019m sure Joe knew that. He would\u2019ve forgiven you. The fact that he saved your life shows that he cared for you, too.\u201d</p><p>Jett looked up into my worried face. His expression softened, and the warmth in his eyes returned.</p> <p>\u201cHas what I told you today changed your mind about me in any way?\u201d he asked at last. He sounded nervous. It took every ounce of my willpower not to shake some sense into him.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea, do you?\u201d I asked in disbelief.</p><p>He shook his head. When he remained silent, I realized that he had been serious. I got up from the floor to sit on his lap, my legs going around his waist so I could face him.</p><p>\u201cJett, I love you for who you are. And that includes your dark side as well. One wrong choice doesn\u2019t make you a failure. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doomed to fail again,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAnd to be honest, I don\u2019t care what you did or didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s in the past. And you can\u2019t change it. But I know this. You\u2019re a good person. You\u2019re a good friend.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his lips twitched in a half-smile, and one of his gorgeous dimples appeared. I stared at the perfection of it. It was one of the many reasons I\u2019d fallen in love with him. There was something genuine about Jett. He really cared about the people he welcomed into his heart.</p><p>\u201cAll my life I\u2019ve never felt this close to anybody,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf shit didn\u2019t happen, I\u2019d never know how to treasure my blessings.\u201d His thumb trailed the contours of my lips slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re my blessing, Brooke. I don\u2019t want to keep dreaming or take risks because, for the first time, reality is better than anything I could ever envision.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cIs that the reason you didn\u2019t want to race today? Because you thought tragedy could strike again?\u201d</p><p>Jett nodded. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford another mistake. Losing Joe was hard, but losing you would have killed me. It was another reason why I didn\u2019t want to beat Doug in an open race. I knew he\u2019d try to block us or move in for a PIT maneuver.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned, and he continued to explain, \u201cFishtailing. Anyway, I would\u2019ve done the same to him. He was never particularly good at keeping hold of the wheel.\u201d Jett sighed and rolled a strand of my hair around his finger, curling it and letting it loose, the way he always did when he was about to say something that bothered him. \u201cYou know, Brooke, when I met you I experienced happiness for the first time in my life. Brian thought I\u2019d be too scared to race, but he got it all wrong. I didn\u2019t want to\u2014not because I\u2019m scared, but because I don\u2019t want to risk what I have with you. I want to see our baby grow up. You both mean the world to me.\u201d</p><p>There were so many feelings inside me that I feared there might not be enough space to fit them all in. I drew a long breath and let it out slowly as realization kicked in. Jett and I were in his old room, and he had just declared how much I meant to him. My heart threatened to burst with emotion. Or maybe it was the result of his smile penetrating even the deepest layers of my soul, warming my body like no one could.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be mine forever,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cTo ensure it, I\u2019ll always make you happier than any other man could. I want to be the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already are.\u201d My fingers brushed over the stubble covering his strong chin. So hard and yet so soft\u2014just like the man hiding behind the most beautiful face I had ever seen. His eyes locked on my mouth, and slowly his lips met mine. A moment later our tongues tangled in an erotic dance, and his hand squeezed beneath my shirt to explore all that would be his forever.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>\u201cJETT, WE KNOW where your father is.\u201d Kenny stood in the door of the community kitchen, his laptop tucked under his arm. I motioned for him to come in and he sat down at the kitchen table where Jett and I were having afternoon coffee and snacks. In the last few days my appetite had quadrupled, and as much as I wanted to blame it on the baby, I couldn\u2019t rule out Jett\u2019s sexual appetite as being the culprit.</p><p>\u201cWe hacked into his accounts,\u201d Kenny said, opening his laptop. \u201cAs luck would have it, we also found a couple of things that will interest you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d Jett sounded as interested as a student after a long Friday afternoon class. Bored, he barely regarded the laptop\u2019s screen as he took a swig of his latte and cracked the shell of a peanut, handing it to me, then opened one for himself and popped it into his mouth. I suppressed the need to giggle. Ever since we arrived here five days ago, he had made himself comfortable in an odd way I hadn\u2019t seen on him before. His shirt was open and his hair a sexy tangled mess\u2014as if he couldn\u2019t stop boasting that his sex life was great, which was the truth. But did he have to be so obvious? We had been making love almost nonstop, his sexual thirst increasing by the day, just like my appetite.</p><p>\u201cWe checked his phone logs and found that he called Brooke\u2019s number when she was in Italy.\u201d Kenny looked at me. \u201cYou remember a call from abroad?\u201d</p><p>I froze at his question as the memory came flooding back: the hot summer day when my phone rang while I was pretending to Sylvie I wasn\u2019t seeing Jett. I had been so engrossed with the estate that I forgot all about the mysterious caller.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said slowly, my glance sweeping from Kenny to Jett. \u201cRemember when I asked you if you had called me?\u201d I raised my brows to jog his memory. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure, because the person hung up.\u201d</p><p>The confusion on Jett\u2019s face cleared as he remembered. \u201cAre you sure it was my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right I am.\u201d Kenny frowned at Jett popping another peanut into his mouth. \u201cThe day before he died\u2014\u201d Kenny made quotation marks \u201c\u2014he tried to reach her on her landline. Sounds like he was trying to talk to her in private, but that\u2019s not what I wanted to show you. Look.\u201d He pointed at the screen. \u201cWhen I searched through his phone records, I discovered that besides Brooke, he had called two other people on that same day.\u201d Kenny turned his laptop around to show us.</p><p>Now my interest was piqued.</p><p>Leaning forward, I tried to decipher the numbers, but all I saw was a bunch of html code and yet more code. No names. I had no idea how Kenny could read any of it, but I guessed with him being a hacker he knew how to get details and see connections.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, he\u2019s a company owner. You\u2019d expect he talked to more than two people,\u201d Jett said and gave his usual what do I care about this shit? shrug before his hand poked the bowl of peanuts in front of him. Kenny\u2019s brow furrowed as Jett took another peanut and cracked it open, the sound so loud it made me chuckle.</p><p>\u201cAre you planning on eating the whole bowl, man?\u201d Kenny asked Jett, his voice dripping with irritation. \u201cI\u2019m trying to have a serious conversation with you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis better be good.\u201d Jett let out an exasperated sigh and pushed the bowl aside.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Trust me.\u201d Kenny pointed to the screen. \u201cHe phoned a hotel service and an attorney. The attorney happens to have the same name as the person your father transferred money to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be attorney fees,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>Kenny shook his head. \u201cNot fees. The full fifty mill, dude, in small transactions. Your father transferred the money through the attorney\u2019s account into an unidentified recipient\u2019s account. Do you know who the recipient is?\u201d</p><p>Jett and I exchanged interested glances. Finally Jett said, \u201cNo idea. You?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA charity called ETNAD.\u201d Kenny paused, waiting for our reaction.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of it,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cYou better have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. First of all, it\u2019s a lot of money for one charity.\u201d Kenny leaned forward until his elbows rested on the kitchen bar. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the fact that the attorney your father called is the same guy handling the Lucazzone estate\u2019s affairs. He works for Alessandro Lucazzone and Brooke.\u201d</p><p>That was the moment I heard the needle drop. Or maybe it was a bomb. The silence in the room was so ominous a shudder ran down my spine.</p><p>\u201cClarkson?\u201d All of a sudden I felt faint.</p><p>Even Jett looked up and asked, \u201cWhy would my father transfer money to him? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense to me, either, until I told Sylvie and something completely unrelated crossed her mind. If she\u2019s right, we might\u2019ve found our connection between your father and why he wants the book.\u201d Kenny smiled pleased, enjoying every second of his show. \u201cShe mentioned Clarkson\u2019s slanted handwriting. Brooke, when Clarkson sent you letters he wrote your name and address on the envelope, right?\u201d I nodded, unsure where he was heading. \u201cWell, Sylvie thinks the handwriting\u2019s the same as the one in the book.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs she sure?\u201d Jett asked. \u201cFor all we know, he could have an assistant. It could be her handwriting.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. Clarkson most certainly had an assistant, but would he really drag her into any dirty affairs and risk exposure?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kenny said slowly. \u201cSylvie believes to remember. So it\u2019s a wild guess, I know, which is why I brought this in the hope you might recognize it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the black book out of his bag and pushed it across the table toward me. I flicked to the first page. The handwriting was slanted and old-fashioned, but I didn\u2019t remember whether it was analogous with Clarkson\u2019s handwriting because I never paid attention to the small details. Who would have?</p><p>\u201cWhat makes her think it\u2019s the same?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe recognized the letters \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018S.\u2019 The curved \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 in your name look pretty much like those.\u201d He pointed to the \u201cS\u201d in Statham and \u201cB\u201d in Bradley.</p> <p>\u201cHow would she remember something like that?\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question; more like awe. Sylvie referred to herself as a scatterbrain, but her keen eye for detail never ceased to amaze me.</p><p>Kenny answered anyway, \u201cShe said not many people write like this anymore, which is why she remembered it so well. The possibility didn\u2019t cross her mind until I told her about the money transfer.\u201d He let out a long breath. \u201cDo you have anything from Clarkson? An envelope, signature, anything at all?\u201d</p><p>I lapsed into silence as I tried to remember. \u201cThe estate\u2019s financial reports were stolen along with the envelope, but before I met with Clarkson for the first time, he sent me a letter. I might still have it at the apartment. No promises, though.\u201d</p><p>It had to be there because I had never sorted through my stuff, what with Jett lying to me and my consequent heartbreak, the sudden departure to Italy and our getting back together. And upon our return, I had barely had time to grab some of my stuff before I moved in with him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sylvie anyway?\u201d I passed the book to Jett absentmindedly. \u201cI thought she was coming today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her employee induction day,\u201d Kenny said.</p><p>\u201cShe took the job with Delta &amp; Warren?\u201d I asked surprised. \u201cI thought you guys were going on a road trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still are. Sylvie\u2019s trying to get two weeks off.\u201d Kenny hesitated, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s her first day and she\u2019s bargaining already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds like her,\u201d I said, my attention returning to the book in Jett\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kenny. I don\u2019t recognize the handwriting, but I\u2019ll head over to our apartment and get the envelope so we can compare it.\u201d</p><p>My head was spinning with facts. I massaged my throbbing temples. \u201cEven if it were Clarkson\u2019s handwriting, it still wouldn\u2019t make sense why Alessandro\u2019s attorney would write down a few names and numbers, then hide the book in his client\u2019s basement.\u201d</p><p>As I spoke the words, I realized I had never taken into account the possibility that my lawyer might not be the kind person I thought he was.</p><p>\u201cUnless Clarkson\u2019s also involved in the club and they all work together,\u201d Jett said, \u201cand as such the book has importance for all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured,\u201d Kenny replied matter-of-factly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mate,\u201d he added to Jett.</p><p>\u201cMy father led me to believe he and Lucazzone were enemies. If Clarkson works for both of them, then my father lied to me.\u201d Jett\u2019s entire demeanor had changed. His eyes were like layers of frost, devoid of compassion. \u201cYet another lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the charity that received the money?\u201d I asked, changing the subject.</p><p>Kenny shrugged, signaling he didn\u2019t know more than we did. \u201cIt\u2019s private. Apparently it supports the fine arts. That\u2019s all I could find out.\u201d</p><p>ETNAD? The letters echoed in my head. ETNAD. Why did it sound so familiar when I was sure I hadn\u2019t heard of it before?</p><p>I grabbed a pen and wrote down the name to visualize it.</p><p>\u201cCan you run it through a database or something and find out what the letters could possibly stand for?\u201d Jett asked.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to show you, but you were too busy munching,\u201d Kenny said mockingly, and opened a new window in his browser. \u201cThe most likely\u2014and only answer\u2014is Electronic or End Transactions Numerical Analysis Data.\u201d</p><p>They continued to chatter, their words no longer reaching me because my brain kept circling around the charity\u2019s name.</p><p>ETNAD</p><p>So far and yet so close.</p><p>I thought of Scrabble and possible combinations.</p><p>ETNAD. Five letters. The only five-letter word I could think of was anted, but the answer was on the tip of my tongue. I tapped the pencil against my lips as I fought hard to grasp it. When it didn\u2019t come to me, I began to combine four-letter words on a blank sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cAre you playing Scrabble?\u201d Jett asked. Nodding, I shushed him and read through what I had so far: etna, ante, dean, date, neat, tend, dent. Each of them sounded familiar, trying to tell me something, and yet they weren\u2019t quite right. And then I read from right to left and my blood froze in my veins.</p><p>ETNAD was DANTE.</p><p>Dante.</p><p>The man who had wanted me. A cold chill made me shudder as I recalled the events before Liz was raped.</p><p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I glanced up into Kenny and Jett\u2019s worried faces. Had I spoken out loud?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jett asked, his hand touching my arm gently but protectively. My glance fell on the pencil in my hand, broken in two. Jett\u2019s fingers burned my skin, or maybe I was frozen, not just my mind, but my entire body. \u201cYou okay?\u201d Jett persisted.</p><p>\u201cThe charity your father\u2019s involved with,\u201d I began, my voice shaking, \u201cif you read ETNAD from right to left, it spells Dante.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to speak the obvious. Jett\u2019s face turned into a mask of fury, and his jaw set. His fists balled, and something sparkled in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFuck! That sick bastard.\u201d He wiped a hand over his face, but it did nothing to diminish his anger. \u201cHe lured you in.\u201d</p><p>Kenny looked from Jett to me, the confusion on his face lifting, meaning Jett must\u2019ve told him everything. \u201cAnyway, guess where he called from when the explosion happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d Jett cut him off. \u201cI have a bigger problem now. He\u2019s still involved with the club, and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind he\u2019s responsible for what happened to Brooke. I need to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him, Jett?\u201d Kenny asked quietly. \u201cYour father\u2019s staying at the Richton Hotel, room number 113, under the name Paul Anderson. I\u2019ll go with you and we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, Jett walked out and slammed the door shut.</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019ll be waiting for him outside,\u201d Kenny said and smiled apologetically. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s a fucking mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t expect it any other way.\u201d I returned his weak smile and followed after Jett.</p><p>I found him in his former room and closed the door behind me. In the silence of the walls, it was just Jett and I, two tormented souls. From the doorway, I watched him retrieve a gun from a drawer and check that it was loaded.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt him,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much more proof do you need, Brooke? He\u2019s a fucking liar,\u201d Jett hissed. \u201cHe claimed he and Lucazzone hadn\u2019t been in contact for years. And then I find out he transferred money to a bogus charity that\u2019s connected to the club in some way.\u201d He shrugged into his leather jacket and squeezed the gun inside the holster at his back.</p><p>I moved closer until we were mere inches apart. \u201cPlease, Jett. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He scanned my eyes, his frown deepening as he cupped my face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know what I\u2019m doing. Okay? My father\u2019s my problem, and I have to deal with him by myself. The least he\u2019ll do is answer my fucking questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me come with you, then,\u201d I pleaded. I had a horrible feeling about the whole situation.</p><p>Jett shook his head vehemently. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here. After what he\u2019s done to you, I don\u2019t want him anywhere near you, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>I moistened my lips as I considered my words. There were so many loopholes that I just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the entire picture.</p><p>\u201cHe could have killed me in the car, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d I held onto Jett\u2019s arms, forcing him to listen. \u201cHis driver was shot. He arranged for a fake identity and money. He didn\u2019t have to do any of that, which his why I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Judging from his expression, Jett didn\u2019t believe me. Even I found it hard to believe, but the arguments inside my head kept telling me Robert Mayfield was innocent. The thought that Jett\u2019s father not only hated me so much he wanted me out of his son\u2019s life but also hated me so much he wanted to kill me was too wicked to believe. He had to be innocent, because I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone being so horrific and cruel.</p><p>\u201cHe threatened your family and friends\u2019 lives. Isn\u2019t that good enough a reason for you?\u201d Jett asked. \u201cAs long as I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, you\u2019re staying here, and Kenny\u2019s keeping watch on you.\u201d</p><p>He also threatened your life, but that I didn\u2019t add. Instead I looked up into Jett\u2019s beautiful eyes. My heart raced wildly at the thought of him going in alone.</p><p>\u201cYour father has bodyguards. I want Kenny to come with you.\u201d</p><p>A few moments of silence passed between us.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He sighed, giving in. \u201cBut you\u2019re staying here. I\u2019ll have Brian watch you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The decisiveness in his tone irritated me. I didn\u2019t like it when Jett handled me as if I had no say in the matter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m some fragile butterfly, Jett.\u201d I folded my arms over my chest and regarded him. \u201cI\u2019m going to make myself useful by returning to my apartment to find out whether Sylvie was right about the handwriting. I think I know where Clarkson\u2019s letter is. Brian can accompany me.\u201d</p><p>Anger crossed his features before he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was forceful. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before evening, and we\u2019ll go together. First I\u2019m dealing with my father, and then we start digging into Clarkson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re worrying about me when you\u2019re the one walking around with a gun,\u201d I murmured dryly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard women like a guy who knows how to fight and defend himself.\u201d A hint of a smile appeared on his lips. He was trying to be funny by pretending he had everything under control, but the cagey expression in his eyes gave away his real thoughts.</p><p>I ignored his statement.</p><p>\u201cNot when you intend to hurt someone.\u201d My fingers brushed his cheek gently. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t hurt him. He\u2019s your father, and you\u2019ll only end up hurting yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make that promise. You know that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can promise you I won\u2019t do anything I\u2019d live to regret.\u201d</p> <p>He pushed my hand away and walked over to retrieve the phone on the sideboard, then handed it to me. \u201cI want you to carry this with you. If something happens, call me. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He kissed me on the cheek, and then grabbed his jacket. I watched him walk out the door and close it behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you gave me a gun than a stupid cell phone,\u201d I muttered, and pushed the cell inside my handbag. It was true. I never would\u2019ve imagined I might want to carry a gun. In fact, the thought of having a weapon in the house used to scare me. But now, after seeing what had happened to Liz and having been subjected to violence myself, I had never wanted anything more than to be able to defend myself.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>JETT\u2019S WHOLE \u201cWEAK woman/strong man\u201d attitude was ridiculous. I didn\u2019t want to feel useless while he did all the hard work. If Jett thought he could treat me like some fragile flower that had to be protected at all costs, he was wrong. I harbored no plan, no intention, no desire to be that way. The thought alone made me livid. I, weak? I could take care of myself. Besides, Jett wasn\u2019t the only one who needed answers. I, too, sought to get rid of the nagging questions inside my head. I wanted to find out if Sylvie was right about the handwriting and maybe shed new light on the whole Lucazzone secret.</p><p>Peering through the window, I watched him leave with Kenny, and then grabbed my handbag. The kitchen was empty. Jett\u2019s buddies, Brian included, had gathered in the open-space living room slash hall on the floor below Jett\u2019s room. Thank God for football games accompanied by the usual male shouting and yelling. I sneaked past them and had reached the first floor when I felt someone\u2019s hand on my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Tiffany, Brian\u2019s girlfriend, asked. Regarding her oversized turquoise sweater and her short black hair with violet streaks, I begged my mind to come up with a good lie.</p><p>\u201cJett wants me to get a feel for his car. You know, acquaint ourselves.\u201d I groaned inwardly at my lame excuse.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut you can\u2019t drive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what he said.\u201d I rolled my eyes in mock irritation, ignoring her patronizing tone. \u201cI\u2019m just going to sit in it for a while. He\u2019s an amazing driver, and it looks so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Her lips curved into a fake smile and disappeared a second later. \u201cThe keys are in the locker room in a box on the wall. Have fun!\u201d She walked away. We had been staying for a few days, and I still didn\u2019t know what her issues were. I climbed down the stairs, passed the security cameras, and let myself out.</p><p>The buildings looked more ominous than ever\u2014maybe because it was a cloudy day promising a rainy night.</p><p>I crossed the backyard and reached the gate. The guard frowned but didn\u2019t comment as I walked through and called a taxi.</p><p>During the drive to Sylvie\u2019s apartment, I could no longer ignore the thoughts inside my head. There were too many loose ends, especially the part where Alessandro Lucazzone worked together with Robert Mayfield. If I didn\u2019t get answers, I\u2019d never find peace. My fear would continue to consume me. I couldn\u2019t spend my life hiding. I missed work, shopping, and meeting for coffee with Sylvie, and, most importantly, I wanted a normal life with Jett so I could prepare for motherhood.</p> <p>Eventually we reached the apartment, and I let myself in. Everything was quiet, but the air smelled of Sylvie\u2019s perfume and memories. So many happy memories.</p><p>Fighting the sudden onset of nostalgia, I removed my shoes and walked barefoot to my former room. Everything was tidy, the bed made. Just like I had left it when I moved in with Jett. I headed for my desk and began sorting through the mail pile Sylvie had kept for me. And there was a lot of it. It took me a while to find Clarkson\u2019s letter.</p><p>I scanned the old-fashioned writing. The \u201cB\u201d and \u201cS\u201d were curved\u2014as though he was into calligraphy. There was little doubt the owner of the book was the same person who\u2019d written down my name and address on the envelope.</p><p>I jumped in my skin when something clicked in the hall and footsteps thudded on the hardwood floor.</p><p>\u201cSylvie?\u201d Pressing the letter against my chest, I peered out the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you home so early. Kenny said\u2014\u201d I broke off as I stared at the one face I never expected to see. In front of me, standing near Sylvie\u2019s large bookcase, was Nate, his hands buried in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? How did you get in?\u201d I asked, unable to hide the shock in my voice. For some reason I thought there had to be a perfectly reasonable explanation.</p><p>\u201cThe door was open.\u201d He pointed behind him.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for Jett? He\u2019s not here, but I can call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>It was the strange smile on his face that made my heart beat frantically in my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>The apartment felt small, the air too thick to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be coming.\u201d He took slow, measured steps forward, his blue eyes scanning me. I inched back.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question. Why are you here?\u201d I was missing something; I just couldn\u2019t put my finger on it.</p><p>\u201cOh, Brooke.\u201d He laughed, the sound sending a shiver down my spine. \u201cI have answered your question. Weren\u2019t you listening?\u201d His tone was contemptuous. \u201cI said I was waiting for you. You walked away from me last time, and I had no choice but to wait for you. After all, I paid a lot of money to have you. Your behavior didn\u2019t please me, but I\u2019m willing to look past your indiscretion.\u201d</p><p>What indiscretion?</p><p>My body froze, and my chest began to tighten with fear. Alarm bells rang in my head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d I choked on my breath. The thought was horrible. It couldn\u2019t be true. I couldn\u2019t even speak it out loud. He nodded encouragingly, and his eyes flickered with knowledge and pleasure. I stared at his evil smile, thinking how much he seemed to enjoy the moment he disclosed his identity.</p><p>When Danny claimed a man paid for me, I imagined him to be older. Never Jett\u2019s attractive brother. Clearly, he was a sociopath\u2014charming and likeable on the outside, but twisted and sick to the core.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Dante?\u201d It wasn\u2019t so much a question as a statement. My voice was shaking and my throat was so tight I felt like I was being strangled.</p><p>\u201cI am Dante.\u201d His eyes flashed with pride, as though the name had a special meaning. And it did, somewhere at the back of my mind; my paralyzing fear just wouldn\u2019t let me grasp it.</p><p>\u201cYou work for the club and the charity?\u201d I asked in disbelief. On the rare occasions we had met, he had always been friendly, helpful even. He had claimed to be close to Jett. It had to be a misunderstanding.</p><p>\u201cNot working.\u201d He shook his head slowly. \u201cI\u2019m leading the club. I think there\u2019s a difference, Brooke. Clarkson convinced Lucazzone to leave everything to the charity, and the charity\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>My mouth went dry. The person I had been fleeing from had been among us all along.</p><p>\u201cYou seem surprised,\u201d Nate continued. \u201cDidn\u2019t you think I\u2019d be capable of such a grand scheme?\u201d The expression in his eyes changed from pride to amusement, and back to pride. \u201cMy brother\u2019s so blind in love with you he even told me where you were staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d I asked again. I hoped it was the book, but in some way I knew he hadn\u2019t arranged to kidnap me because of it.</p><p>\u201cYou know the answer, Brooke. Deep down.\u201d He took another step forward and stopped, like he had all the time in the world. \u201cThe estate. You. The company. All the things I worked hard for. All the things I deserve. I\u2019m here to take them all.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a hunting knife.</p><p>He was going to kill me.</p><p>The realization kicked in hard. I had to stall until I found a way out. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d I took another step, and my back hit the wall. The living room was to my right. This was my last chance to run. Turning, I dashed past him in the hope I could lock myself inside the living room and open the window to call for help. I hadn\u2019t even reached the door when he slammed me to the floor and, turning me around, his hand tightened around my throat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not finished.\u201d His grip was so tight I thought I might pass out. My palms flew upward to push him away as my eyes filled with moisture from the lack of oxygen. His face inched closer until I could feel his breath on my lips.</p><p>\u201cRight from the beginning, you were nothing but a millstone in my big plans, Brooke. You die. And I get everything. Simple as that,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI bet you didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d</p><p>His hands released my throat. I pulled myself up on my knees, gasping for air, ignoring the pangs of pain shooting through my ribcage. So the car chase in Italy hadn\u2019t been about the book; our pursuers wanted to kill me. Nate flung me on my back and held the knife against my throat. Tears began to trickle down my cheeks, not out of fear but out of shock.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t cry, little one. All those years, Alessandro had the choice to pass the estate on to me,\u201d Nate began. \u201cBut he kept looking for an heir, leaving me no choice than to trick him and everybody else. So I bought his late wife\u2019s favorite charity organization and made sure that Clarkson squeezed in a clause that if anything happened to you before you signed the inheritance papers, everything would fall to ETNAD. Then, after he signed the will, Lucazzone died.\u201d Watching me, he tilted his head. \u201cThat was a few weeks ago, right before I convinced Jett to meet with you to discuss a potential partnership.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. It wasn\u2019t possible. While I knew the will was drawn up prior to my meeting with Jett, Alessandro hadn\u2019t died. Thus, the timeframe was wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d I said. \u201cI met with Alessandro a few weeks ago. He\u2019s in a coma but alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClarkson works for me, Brooke,\u201d Nate said matter-of-factly, as if that was the answer to all my questions. \u201cThe old man you met was an actor I hired. Or why else do you think the nurse never left you two to talk in private? He was a bit senile, and we had to make sure he didn\u2019t make a mistake, revealing too much.\u201d Nate laughed and played with the knife pressed against my throat, obviously excited by his own madness.</p><p>\u201cYou and Jett were played from the beginning. Or did you think it was fate?\u201d he asked. \u201cI set up the meeting between the two of you. I even chose the bar. As his new assistant you were supposed to travel to Italy, meet with the old man, and never make it back alive. What I didn\u2019t expect was Jett to fall for you and figure out there was something wrong with the estate, but you\u2019ve done me a favor, Brooke. It makes sense that my brother would shoot you in a jealous fit and then kill himself, unable to live with the guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d never do that,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. But with my help, he will.\u201d Nate\u2019s blue eyes shimmered. I realized he was crazy. Literally crazy. A psycho. \u201cJealousy can be such a strong motive. And everyone who knows Jett knows he\u2019s a passionate man. It\u2019s a good plan, isn\u2019t it? And when Jett dies, I get his shares of the company as well.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounded fast, and desperation washed over me as I looked into Nate\u2019s hard, cold eyes\u2014the eyes of a killer.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about your brother. Don\u2019t you care about your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry things have to end this way,\u201d Nate said. \u201cBut business is business, and everyone has to fight for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go, Nate.\u201d A familiar voice carried over from the door. Nate eased enough on the knife, and I followed his line of vision to Jett\u2019s father pointing a gun at us.</p> <p>\u201cSo it was you all along? How could you betray me, Nate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove away from her and drop the knife.\u201d Robert waved his gun. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one more time, Nate. Let her go.\u201d</p><p>Nate took a step back, his knife dropping to the floor. I crawled toward the living room door, putting some distance between us. Nate seemed frozen, probably processing the news that his father was still alive. A few seconds passed. Robert spoke first.</p><p>\u201cI raised you as my son,\u201d Robert said, inching closer. \u201cAnd this is how you repay me? After all I\u2019ve done for you?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, confused. Wasn\u2019t Nate his biological son? And what about Jett?</p> <p>\u201cWho was the guy I saw at the morgue?\u201d Nate asked accusingly. His voice was tinted with a hint of anger.</p><p>\u201cSome dead guy who was already dead when we got the body from the morgue,\u201d Robert replied.</p><p>Nate remained silent as he stared back at his father. His eyes moved from his father to the knife on the floor. Eventually he asked, \u201cWhy did you fake your own death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I told about the club years ago, I did so to protect you from its influence. But you joined it behind my back and blackmailed me all those years.\u201d Robert shook his head. \u201cI thought I could trust you, but all you did was stab me in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no choice, Dad,\u201d Nate said slowly. \u201cI was blackmailed, too.\u201d</p><p>Robert laughed bitterly. \u201cBullshit. You went around our backs and manipulated everyone. When I sent Clarkson the money, I already suspected you were the actual recipient. But I wasn\u2019t sure. All I knew was that it had to be a relatively new member, someone who knew my every step by watching me. When Clarence Holton told me you were the new club leader and interested in Brooke\u2019s estate, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I had to see for myself that the son I raised like my own could do this to me.\u201d He paused. \u201cSo I led everyone to believe I was dead while I tried to keep Brooke safe and get the book. It was the only way to find out my blackmailer\u2019s identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the book?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Robert Mayfield\u2019s eyes narrowed on me. \u201cThe numbers are combinations to P.O. boxes containing videos taken during various\u2014\u201d he hesitated \u201c\u2014club meetings. I figured the blackmailer would feature in one of them.\u201d His attention turned back to Nate. \u201cI\u2019m sure if I looked hard enough, I\u2019d find proof that you\u2019ve been blackmailing members for years. Not that I need it now. Your standing here is proof enough that you betrayed the trust I placed in you when I told you about the club. I\u2019ve been watching the apartment for days because I knew if Brooke stopped by, you would, too.\u201d He shook his head, his face a mix of anger and grief. \u201cI\u2019m deeply ashamed of you, Nate. Of what you\u2019ve done to the club. Of what it\u2019s become.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad.\u201d Nate\u2019s manner changed. His face looked guilty, and his voice filled with sadness as he stepped forward, hands outstretched. \u201cIf I had known I was a disappointment to you, I would\u2019ve changed a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He was such a good actor\u2014the sudden realization scared me more than anything. In slow motion, I watched Nate pull out a gun.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted, but it was too late. A muffled shot echoed from the walls. Robert dropped to the floor, and blood began to pour out of his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you admit you\u2019re jealous, Dad? That you could never accomplish what I\u2019ve achieved?\u201d Nate picked up his father\u2019s gun, his eyes fixed on the old man, as he pushed it inside the belt holster at his back. I kneeled next to Robert and pressed my hands against his chest to stop the blood flow.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I shouted to Nate. The blood began to spread so fast it stained everything. My hands. Our clothes. The floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been long overdue,\u201d Nate said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all your fault, Brooke. If you hadn\u2019t run away, my plan would\u2019ve played out neatly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to help him, Nate,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cPlease call an ambulance, or he\u2019ll bleed to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about him. He\u2019s not even my father.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at him in shock. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d He shrugged and checked the gun. \u201cYears ago I opened his safe because I needed money and he wouldn\u2019t give it to me. That\u2019s when I found my birth certificate. He took me from my real parents. Nobody asked me if I wanted to be raised by him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took you in from an orphanage, Nate,\u201d Robert whispered. \u201cYour parents abandoned you.\u201d His face was distorted in pain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Nate raised the gun again. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking lying.\u201d He walked back to his father, his brows drawn in anger. Now I understood why Jett saw his father the way he did. As volatile. Competitive. Even heartless, and sometimes cruel. Robert was about to die, but he preferred telling the brutal truth rather than make amends.</p><p>\u201cYou were an orphan, Nate. Your mother abandoned you in the gutter when you were barely three days old.\u201d</p><p>Even though it was a poor excuse for his actions, for some reason I understood the pain Nate must\u2019ve gone through all those years after finding out he belonged nowhere. The past he had was based on a lie.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have paid a dime if it were the truth,\u201d Nate growled. \u201cThe fact I could blackmail you all those years so easily shows me you\u2019re guilty of taking me away from my real parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate!\u201d His father choked on his breath, his face distorting. \u201cI built the company. I didn\u2019t want to deal with any scandal or bad publicity. Everything I did was so you and Jett could have a carefree future. Showering you with millions to make you believe you were my own son and that you had a father was a small price to pay. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that you were abandoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking hate you,\u201d Nate whispered. He held the gun to Robert\u2019s head. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care about anything you say. I\u2019ll just fucking kill you both.\u201d</p><p>He meant business.</p><p>My gaze swept over the room, taking in anything I could use as a weapon. Anything to keep the psycho from killing us. I just needed a distraction.</p><p>The thudding and voices outside the door made me flinch, and Nate turned his head. I used the opportunity. Grabbing the vase on the side table, I smashed it into the back of Nate\u2019s head. He swayed, and the gun dropped to the floor. I lunged for it and pointed it at him. My hands were shaking badly because I knew Nate had another gun tucked in the holster at his back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about pulling it out,\u201d I hissed. \u201cOr I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d</p><p>Nate chuckled, unfazed, and took a step forward. \u201cLook at the way you\u2019re holding that gun. You can\u2019t even shoot.\u201d</p><p>I lifted the gun higher.</p><p>\u201cI swear I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He dove for me. I shot\u2014and missed.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The door bolted open, and from the periphery of my vision I saw Jett and a few guys storming in. Nate turned around, his arms spread out, a horrified expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re here, Jett,\u201d Nate shouted, his gaze brushing nervously over the gun in Brian\u2019s hands. \u201cShe shot our father. She\u2019s involved in his shit and now she\u2019s trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>I gaped, my speech failing me.</p><p>Un-believe-able.</p><p>The guy wasn\u2019t just a good actor; he was a born liar.</p><p>Jett pulled out his gun and pointed it at Nate. \u201cI don\u2019t believe my girlfriend would ever do that.\u201d</p><p>In slow motion I watched Nate retrieve his gun out of the holster. Jett aimed. An instant later a muffled gunshot resonated from the walls and Nate slumped to the floor, blood pouring out of his leg, his face a mask of agonizing pain.</p><p>I had no idea that Jett could shoot that well. Brian and another guy lifted Nate up and dragged him out the door. But my mind was already elsewhere.</p><p>Jett\u2019s hands were all over me, inspecting me for wounds. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he is.\u201d I pointed to his father, who lay in a puddle of blood, still conscious. The smell was overpowering, and I couldn\u2019t stop shaking. \u201cNate shot him while your father tried to protect me. We need to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Jett muttered, kneeling beside Robert as he pulled out his cell phone and called Sam.</p><p>By the time a private ambulance arrived, I was a nervous mess. It didn\u2019t help to see Jett\u2019s worried face as he exchanged a few words with his father.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I said after the ambulance drove away.</p><p>\u201cHe told me where to find the P.O. boxes with the videos. That\u2019s the only thing he said,\u201d Jett said, gravely. \u201cHe could barely speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d I buried my face in Jett\u2019s chest. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. The silence was oppressing as we drove to Sam\u2019s hospital.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d I whispered. We had been sitting in the waiting room for two hours until Sam could confirm that Jett\u2019s father had passed the critical phase following surgery. Avoiding the subject was easier than looking at the hard facts. It was easier than admitting that Jonathan Mayfield had been playing Jett all along, and Robert Mayfield might die because of his adopted son\u2019s greed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour cell.\u201d Jett smiled softly. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re stubborn, so I figured you wouldn\u2019t listen. It wasn\u2019t a hard guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what made you come looking for me? You said you wouldn\u2019t be back before evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenny found out Clarence Holton had also transferred fifty million to Clarkson, so my next guess was that someone must\u2019ve blackmailed them, and it wasn\u2019t my father.\u201d His eyes met mine, and for a moment they took my breath away. \u201cBut then Brian called to tell me his girlfriend saw you leaving, and I drove over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d I whispered, refusing to think of what might have happened otherwise.</p> <p>His shoulders slumped. \u201cI never would have expected this from my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what your father said, too.\u201d I leaned my head against his shoulder then recapped the events from the beginning. \u201cWhat are you going to do with Nate?\u201d I asked once I had finished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find the videos and hand them over to the authorities, and let them decide. He deserves all that\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>I sat up to regard him. \u201cWhat about your father?\u201d He couldn\u2019t possibly reveal his father\u2019s involvement in the club without risking Mayfield Realties\u2019 collapse. I wouldn\u2019t let so many people lose their jobs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Brooke,\u201d Jett said, defeated, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 29</p><p>THE NEWS ABOUT ETNAD and the elite club was splashed all over the newspapers on a Monday, a little more than a week after Jett\u2019s father was shot. Someone had tipped off the authorities and now investigations kept popping up all over the States and even Europe. New names were revealed every day, including Jett\u2019s brother.</p><p>I was standing in Jett\u2019s kitchen\u2014our kitchen\u2014brewing a large pot of coffee to see me through the busy night ahead. It was early evening, shortly after dusk, and the sun had just disappeared behind the thick curtain of rain clouds that had been hovering above New York City for the last few days. We had arrived back from the office and dinner in a nearby restaurant, and Jett was still in the shower so I was alone with my coffee and thoughts as I sat down on the couch, cross-legged, and spread the newspaper around me. I had gone through the articles countless times but for some reason I kept coming back, unable to grasp the fact that my nightmare had finally come to an end. That Nate had been involved for many years still shocked me. Jett refused to talk about him, as if his brother wasn\u2019t worth mentioning.</p><p>Robert Mayfield was mentioned in the business section\u2014the man, who had allegedly been involved in a freak explosion, only to come back from the dead. The hole in his chest had remained a well-kept secret. We had visited him in the hospital the day before. Even though the doctors kept him in an induced coma for days, I had wanted to see him. Knowing he\u2019d tried to protect Jett and me\u2014granted in a strange way, but still\u2014the meeting had felt different. And while I knew we\u2019d probably never meet for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, I planned on getting to know the real Robert Mayfield as soon as his health recovered, for both Jett\u2019s and the baby\u2019s sake.</p><p>With Kenny\u2019s help the missing money would be returned into the corporate bank accounts, and Jett could finally focus on launching his own company\u2014that\u2019s where all the coffee and my undying support came in. I didn\u2019t just love him; I was proud of him and his achievements, and I was going to see his dream come true, no matter what. Even if that involved working at the office during the day and helping him with the launch of his business at night.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to call it a day, babe?\u201d Jett said, appearing around the corner.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still so much to do.\u201d I pushed a cup of steaming coffee into his hands, marveling at the perfection of his broad chest and his electric eyes that reflected the light in a million facets of green.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to focus on something else for a while.\u201d He placed the cup on the table and pulled me against his hard body, his mouth burying in my hair at the nape of my neck. To smell, to kiss, to bite\u2014I had no idea, but work was waiting, and I could sense he was about to idle.</p><p>Ever so slowly Jett began to unbutton my dress. I pushed is hands away before he could rip off my bra.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mayfield, but if you want to call it a day, I\u2019ll have to insist you use the remaining twenty something hours of your win now, because I\u2019m not giving you any more for free.\u201d I pointed at the front of my dress. \u201cUnless of course\u2014\u201d I smiled \u201c\u2014you surrender your win and let me be in charge once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no way in hell I\u2019m surrendering, Miss Stewart.\u201d He fished a set of keys out of his pocket and dangled it in front of my face. \u201cBrian has changed the license plate for our little trip.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not racing anywhere,\u201d I whispered, petrified at the thought of Jett behind a steering wheel.</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cWhich is why I thought you might want to drive her.\u201d</p> <p>I overlooked the part where he kept calling his car a she in favor of the fact he was letting me drive his beloved. I had never driven anything so expensive and shiny. I was almost drooling at the thought.</p><p>Grinning, I grabbed the keys before he changed his mind. \u201cNow you\u2019re talking. How could I possibly resist going for a ride in your baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s not going to be my only ride tonight.\u201d He winked in case I missed the sexual undertones.</p><p>Heat scorched my cheeks. Did he have to be so blunt?</p><p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d I inclined my head in mock confusion. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to the Hamptons,\u201d Jett said, amused. \u201cI forgot my bag.\u201d</p><p>It was a little past eight p.m. when we arrived at Kim Dessen\u2019s place. With the moonlight casting an eerie glow, magnifying its large windows and the narrow path lined with rosebushes leading straight to the private beach, the building looked more beautiful than I remembered it. Jett unlocked the door and turned off the alarm, but didn\u2019t switch on the lights.</p><p>We climbed down the stairs past several doors and entered a dark room. Jett pressed a switch and the entire pool was lit up in soft blue and green colors, the underwater light bouncing off the dark walls like it was the only source of light. I gasped at the magnificence and the size of the place. On the west side were lounges and a bar. The pool had a huge elongate side, and a smaller circular one. Opposite from it was a large plasma television set fitted on the wall.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I spun in a slow circle. \u201cThis place is heavenly.\u201d</p><p>And tranquil. Much more amazing than any public indoor swimming pool or spa I had ever seen. I watched the color-changing water, immersed in the sparkling underwater lights.</p><p>\u201cI love it. Completely love it,\u201d I said, unable to hold back my enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cCare for a swim in the pool? Or should we try out the theater?\u201d In the darkness, my gaze searched for Jett and found him standing at the stairs of the pool. He had kicked off his shoes and his feet were in the water, his eyes beckoning me to inch closer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a choice?\u201d I asked, faking surprise.</p><p>\u201cMore like a question what you want to do first, because we\u2019ll be doing both.\u201d He grinned, revealing the two most gorgeous dimples in the world. \u201cWe have a long night ahead, during which I intend to push your boundaries and see what makes you tick. Or squeal. I\u2019m going to discover all your secret spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy secret spots aren\u2019t so secret any more,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve kept one or two hidden.\u201d He flashed me a grin that made my heart sink in my chest. \u201cI know a thing or two you don\u2019t yet know about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he began to remove his clothes. His jeans. His shirt. His underwear. The pool lights bathed his skin in a soft glow; the shadows did nothing to hide his perfection.</p><p>I found myself smiling when he strolled into the water naked. I could\u2019ve stayed transfixed to the spot, watching him for hours.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Brooke,\u201d Jett said, slowly.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be taking a shower first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He stepped out of the water and came toward me. I thought he\u2019d show me the way to the bathroom but instead he lifted me in his arms and walked with me back into the swimming pool.</p><p>Hovering in his arms above the surface of the water, I squealed and fought his iron grip when a cold wet sensation seeped through the material of my dress and reached my butt. It was cold. Scratch that. It was so freezing I thought I might see ice cubes floating around me. An instant later, Jett\u2019s arms were gone, and I plunged into the water, the coldness spreading around my limbs.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? I hate it when people do that,\u201d I said the moment I broke the surface of the water and wiped my eyes, probably smearing my make-up all over my face. My dress was soaking wet\u2014floating like a halo because the thin fabric was so light it didn\u2019t stay underwater. Jett laughed. No. Make that he laughed hysterically.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing like a hyena.\u201d I splashed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He grinned sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>I tried to swim to the edge when he grabbed my waist and pulled me against his naked body. \u201cYou\u2019re cute when you\u2019re angry, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said, unable to stop my teeth from chattering. \u201cIt\u2019s frickin\u2019 cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be warmer once you get out of this dress.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for my reply. Within seconds his expert hands had undone the zipper and pulled the dress down my shivering body, then tossed it on the edge of the pool.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked. There was a spark of mischief in his eyes. And he was still grinning. I frowned when he disappeared beneath the surface. Was he going to retrieve my high-heels?</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s still cold.\u201d I doubted he heard me. Looking down, I saw him diving. His naked body shimmered underwater, heading straight for me. Like a fish. Or was he supposed to be shark?</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t dare, would he?</p><p>He did.</p><p>He grabbed my left foot and pulled me underwater until my face was at the same level as his. My eyes were open as he drew me to him and kissed me, his lips pressing against mine. For a moment, I almost forgot we were underwater. It was the feeling of freedom. It was perfect, so perfect that words failed me.</p><p>He let go of me and together we broke the surface.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do something like this,\u201d Jett said, laughing. His hair looked like a sexy mess.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got balls, Jett. Pulling me under like that.\u201d I had loved it, but I wasn\u2019t ready to admit it because I was still shivering.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that cold.\u201d</p><p>He was right. It wasn\u2019t that cold.</p><p>It was damn icy\u2014so cold I couldn\u2019t even feel my limbs.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s freezing,\u201d I said, \u201cand kissing was your solution to keep us warm?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou always manage to heat me up. Do you want to try again?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head and stopped him before he dived. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. I don\u2019t want to get hypothermia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cJust keep moving.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head. \u201cEasy for you to say. You\u2019re a man. You don\u2019t feel the cold like I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, babe. That\u2019s because seeing you naked always raises the temperature a few degrees.\u201d The corners of his lips twitched.</p> <p>I frowned, suddenly seeing the connection. \u201cIs that why you asked me to get out of my dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I thought it\u2019d help.\u201d He held up his hand in an innocent gesture. \u201cI\u2019m just saying it would turn every man on. It sure turns me on seeing your nipples harden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Tarzan.\u201d I poked a finger in his chest, unable to remain pissed off. \u201cNo more funny stunts.\u201d The water barely reached my chin. I rubbed my arms to infuse some warmth into them. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to get warmer, I promise,\u201d Jett said. \u201cGive it a few minutes until the pool heats up.\u201d He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me against his chest.</p><p>Warm water began to pulsate from all directions. The knots in my muscles began to ease and I grew more relaxed with every minute. The underwater lights changed from blue to a fluorescent green\u2014dark and shimmering beautiful like the color of emerald. Just a few shades lighter than Jett\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever done this before?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jett shot me a sideway glance. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreaking and entering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly breaking in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You had a key, on both this and the previous occasion.\u201d I put on the most serious expression I could muster. \u201cUnlocking and entering, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I need to unlock is you.\u201d He laughed out loud. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s the first time, but you\u2019ve got to admit Kim has a nice house.\u201d He swam in a circle and then pulled me close again. I wrapped my legs around his waist, knowing well he couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cWe should do it more often,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cVisit properties, make sure they\u2019re well maintained. Unlock all the places we have to see.\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t talking about houses.</p><p>Jett grabbed my ass and I looked up into his eyes. They were glinting, full of mischief. Full of hope and promises.</p><p>With my legs wrapped around him, he carried me. I didn\u2019t put up a fight. Even if I tried, I wouldn\u2019t have been strong enough to push him and swim away.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe middle is heated,\u201d he said.</p><p>Every pool is heated, I wanted to point out.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t resist seeing you wet.\u201d He gave me a sly look, and I remembered we were intruders.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you jumped in naked. What if someone caught us?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at my mortified expression. \u201cSo what? It\u2019s worth the trouble. It\u2019s worth everything when you\u2019re with me. Not taking the risk is far riskier.\u201d</p><p>We stopped at the side of the pool, right below the sculpted statue of a Greek goddess towering over us. The water was warmer here.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Jett winked and pressed his palm against what looked like an inconspicuous white tile. Instantly, hot water began to shoot from small openings, shifting around my thighs and lower back in a fast spiral. I had been in a Jacuzzi before, but this was different because the bubbles didn\u2019t reach the surface. My arms went around Jett\u2019s neck, and his eyes met mine with such intensity it took my breath away.</p><p>The lights in the pool began to change, turning darker and darker until the surface was almost black and the lights underwater twinkled like stars in the night sky. I felt as though we were floating in a galaxy amidst stars. A minute passed, then another, and the lights changed to green again.</p><p>It was out of the ordinary. Nothing I had seen before.</p><p>It was so hauntingly beautiful I wished I could take a picture and hang it on the wall in my office. In the serenity around us, I brushed my fingertips along his jawline, praying I could freeze time and hold onto this moment forever.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to capture the moment of us and treasure it forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. Our future holds plenty more of such moments.\u201d He traced the contours of my lips, sending a tingle down my neck, right into my heart. \u201cYou\u2019re not just any girl for me. You\u2019re the only one that matters, and I have no intention to ever let you go because every moment with you is a little more than amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d I laughed even though I felt a little bit like crying because his words matched the way I felt about him.</p><p>His magnificent green eyes bored into me, and it took my breath away. \u201cWhy would I be? I\u2019ve no plans to give you anything less than you deserve, and you deserve the world,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI wish I had met you sooner.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t reply. I couldn\u2019t because my heart was doing cartwheels, and my mind was spinning.</p><p>\u201cEven knowing I might have pushed you away? Or fallen pregnant?\u201d I asked at last.</p><p>\u201cEspecially because of that. I love a challenge, and you provide plenty of that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe both know you pushed me away because you love being chased. You got pregnant because you wanted my baby.\u201d</p><p>I slapped his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t keep it in your pants and that\u2019s the reason.\u201d I returned his smile. In spite of the tranquility inside me, life tugged at me, growing, a reminder our future would bring many challenges. \u201cI\u2019m so afraid I\u2019ll get huge and ugly like a walrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou could never look ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I whispered. \u201cIn a few weeks I\u2019ll be all bloated and the size of a balloon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know,\u201d he replied. \u201cEvery time you tell me your hair\u2019s a mess and how much you hate it, I find you the most beautiful. I can\u2019t wait to see you grow, knowing that our baby is part you and part me, our best qualities merged into one being, and there\u2019s nothing ugly about that.\u201d He smiled gently. \u201cI cannot promise that carrying this child will be easy, but I can promise I\u2019ll carry you when you need me. I\u2019ll support you all the way.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head against his shoulder, and he wrapped his arm around me, drawing me close. In the silence of the room and in the stillness of the water, Jett\u2019s presence was overpowering. He was everywhere, inside my mind, in every cell of my body, settled deep within me. He was like water, pouring into me, filling me to almost overflow, drawing me under. Soon I\u2019d be drowning in my feelings for him. Soon our passion would become a current, drawing me into the depths to keep me with him forever, and claiming me as his.</p><p>His eyes glistened in the soft glow of the lights, and in the tranquility of this place his love for me was unmistakable, and his passion was definite. He didn\u2019t have to ask me what I felt for him or what I wanted. He knew. I knew. The whole world did.</p><p>I could see my own feelings and lust reflected in his eyes and feel them in the way he touched me. Strange that we had voices to talk, and yet our hearts spoke louder. Asking and yet not requesting. Pleading and yet not forcing. Making us aware there was one single truth in that single moment: we were in love.</p><p>Holding onto each other. Crazy about each other. Lost in our jungle of passion and fulfillment, we were insatiable. We were two of one mind.</p><p>His eyes probed mine with a gentleness that took my breath away. Even if I wanted to talk, I couldn\u2019t. I was afraid to break the moment because it was ours. In the solitude of the walls around us, it didn\u2019t matter where we came from or what journey we had been on. It didn\u2019t matter how much pain we carried or whether the world was coming to an end. All that mattered was there was still an us\u2014after everything that happened. The future was uncertain, but his love was not.</p><p>Jett leaned in and kissed me gently, the tip of his tongue arousing me. His lips were soft, not demanding, as if he had all the time in the world. His hands touched my back, my hips, sending jolts of lust through my body. On the outside I was shaking\u2014not from the cold but from want. On the inside I was trembling, pulsating, asking\u2014with need. He pressed me against the wall hard, and I wrapped my legs around his waist. My hands ran through his hair and gathered at the nape of his neck as his growing erection brushed my entry.</p><p>Jett\u2019s expression triggered a surge of arousal inside me. My core pulsated, asking for him. My whole being burned and flickered, boiling with a growing desire only he could still. He pushed me up high against the wall, and his body pressed into me, his hands cupping my ass.</p><p>I let my hand glide between our bodies to guide him, even though he didn\u2019t need guidance.</p><p>Jett never did.</p><p>I moaned, and his hard erection entered me, filling every last corner. I shifted my hips to let him slide just a little deeper, even though he was too big to bear, his unnatural warmth searing me.</p><p>And then he began to move, the warm water rolling gently around us, just like the thick shaft inside me. My insides clenched as the thrusts became harder and deeper, stretching me. With every thrust he hit my core, sending a pleasant shot of pain through me that made me call out his name. Pressed between him and the warm wall, I rocked against him until I could feel the release, and when I came, his body became my sanctuary.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>MY DRESS WAS dripping wet, the thin fabric completely transparent. I had only two options: walk around the house in a wet\u2014and transparent\u2014dress, or stay naked. I figured there wasn\u2019t really a difference.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I glanced around me in the hope I might spy something suitable to protect my modesty. \u201cYou could have warned me before pushing me into the pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I needed you wet.\u201d His tone was casual, but I didn\u2019t miss the amused flicker in his eyes. \u201cWet is good, baby. I like the way it feels.\u201d</p><p>Holy mother of double meanings!</p><p>My cheeks caught fire at his insinuation and, like on cue, moisture gathered between my legs. He always got me wet, whether I wanted it or not. And, unfortunately, he knew it.</p><p>I watched him slip into his jeans, which he left unbuttoned, revealing rows of hard muscles and bronze skin. I pointed to his shirt he picked up from the floor. \u201cGood for you. At least one of us is dry.\u201d I caught him glancing at the watch. \u201cWhat\u2019s your next plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going outside.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cTo the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d His gaze was relentless. \u201cI\u2019m not wasting one minute.\u201d</p><p>The dress then. I bent down to pick it up and caught Jett glancing at my naked ass. No surprise to find him grinning.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not going to wear that.\u201d He pointed to the dress in my hand. \u201cI love the way you are just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his lips twitched. \u201cYep, au natural. With no flavors, no additives, no make-up. Stripped of all the layers.\u201d He smiled his most saccharine smile. \u201cJust raw pureness.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask me to run around naked, Jett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ask.\u201d His eyes twinkled\u2014probably at the thought of having me at his mercy. \u201cI was going to plead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d I slipped into the wet dress. It was useless. It was so transparent that I could see the outline of my nipples. And judging from Jett\u2019s grin, that had been the plan all along. I crossed my arms over my chest and put on my most serious expression. Grinning would only encourage that inflated ego of his. Actually grinning would encourage him to do naughty things, and I\u2019d probably end up playing along just for the sake of it.</p><p>Or maybe because you want him as much as he wants you.</p> <p>\u201cYou can wear this, baby.\u201d He pushed his dry shirt into my hands. I pressed it against my chest, realizing it was shorter than my dress and would probably barely cover my butt.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>He was standing before me half naked, with nothing but his jeans and muscles on display. He caught my appreciative gaze and in response flexed his chest muscles, the movement making his tattoo come alive. But that wasn\u2019t what made me swallow hard. Hard and defined. Like a bronze statue. His body was so sexy I wanted to trail my tongue all over it.</p><p>\u201cAre you shy? Or are you just pretending?\u201d He removed my arms from my chest and held them up. Inside the pool water had covered my body. Now it was just the thin layer of my dress, and under his gaze I felt exposed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to hide, baby. You\u2019re sexy and you\u2019re beautiful. I love every inch of your body.\u201d His gaze swept over me in a way that made me blush. He placed my hands on his hard stomach. \u201cI like you touching me. And that\u2019s not the only thing I want you doing to me.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes met mine, and I couldn\u2019t stop my mouth going dry at the thought of having him inside me again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you\u2019re insatiable, Jett,\u201d I muttered. \u201cEither that, or you\u2019re a sex addict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019m just saying that I can\u2019t get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>He drew my mouth to his and kissed me softly.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we should skip the beach walk and just watch a movie. You realize we\u2019ve never done that?\u201d A wicked grin appeared on his lips. \u201cIn the darkness, just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that sounds tempting.\u201d I liked the idea of darkness and Jett, and the way he said it made it sound like he shared my naughty thoughts.</p> <p>He held open the door. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>I walked in, turning to see if he was following me, and found his eyes glued to my ass again.</p><p>\u201cNice view.\u201d He nodded appreciatively. I shook my head and kept on walking. A side look into one of the large mirrors reminded me I looked horrible. My hair was a complete mess. And my make-up had vanished. By the time we reached the long foyer, I had made a mental list of all the things that needed taking care of.</p><p>Change into something more suitable.</p><p>Blow-dry my hair.</p><p>Apply make-up.</p><p>I even pondered how long it\u2019d take me to dry my dress with a blow dryer. And I had to insist on cleaning the house before leaving. No way would we leave clues of our breaking and entering behind. The last thing we needed was our DNA prints or fluids scattered all over the place.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me twenty minutes?\u201d I asked on the way to the living room.</p> <p>\u201cTen minutes.\u201d He kissed my cheek and opened the door. \u201dWe only have twenty-two hours left and I\u2019m not deducting your minutes from my meager hours.\u201d He grinned and then slapped my ass playfully. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me waiting too long, woman.\u201d</p><p>The southern accent again.</p><p>I giggled and headed for the stairs, then remembered this wasn\u2019t our home. We weren\u2019t even guests. I stopped in the middle of the stairs. Jett hadn\u2019t moved from his spot.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the house?\u201d I pointed to the wet footprints on the marble floor. \u201cWe need to clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry your pretty head about it,\u201d Jett said. \u201cCleaners are coming in for an open day next week. They\u2019ll take care of everything. Besides, Kim knows.\u201d He winked. \u201cShe even gave us her blessing.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>IT WAS OUR first vacation together. Jett and I had arrived at the lush Hawaiian resort three days ago and had barely left the room for anything other than to eat and give the poor cleaning lady some space.</p><p>\u201cCare for a visit to the beach?\u201d Jett asked. In the moonlight flooding through the restaurant\u2019s window, his face was nothing but beauty and pure sexiness.</p><p>I shrugged and interlaced my fingers with his. \u201cSounds good. It\u2019s not like I can sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you change that,\u201d Jett whispered, and led me out of the restaurant and down the path of trees, shrubs, and bushes to the beach.</p><p>It was true. Ever since I was held hostage and woke up in the hospital, I couldn\u2019t sleep because fear kept me awake, which was why Jett had insisted on taking this vacation. I was supposed to rest, to live and forget. I leaned against his arm, enjoying the delicious sensation the sound of his voice sent through me.</p><p>The sky was pitch black, dotted with thousands of stars. I had seen it before, but this time it seemed more beautiful than ever. As if my bad experiences made me appreciate the view more. Or maybe because whenever Jett was around, the whole world seemed different. Serene and colorful. Full of magic and mystery. Pure perfection\u2014just like the man I loved.</p><p>He spread his jacket on the soft sand and sat down, the water just inches from our feet. Slowly, he wrapped his arm around my shoulders. Engrossed in our thoughts and each other\u2019s presence, we watched the waves of the ocean crashing against the shore.</p><p>I smiled at him and rubbed my cheek against the roughness of his stubble, wishing I could collect the magic of the moment in a bottle and keep it forever.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful here,\u201d I whispered, and looked up at the sky. He didn\u2019t reply. At some point I realized Jett was looking at me\u2014as if I was the only star in his night sky. I turned to regard him, and Jett kept looking at me, his eyes meeting mine with gentleness.</p><p>For once his silence didn\u2019t worry me, because no words were strong or expressive enough to capture the beauty of the moment. No words could express the magnitude of my feelings for him, or how much I wanted us to have a future. No words could express how much I didn\u2019t want to let him go\u2014not yet, not now, and surely never. It was sad, really, because if we were in a dream I\u2019d wish we\u2019d never wake up from it.</p><p>But it was reality, and while I wanted to forget the past, there were ugly reminders that lingered at the back of my mind. Danny. The estate I never wanted but had inherited nonetheless. The lawyer, Clarkson, who\u2019d disappeared. In this reality, with the way things were progressing, I knew life would go on, and the little moments I spent with Jett would not stay forever.</p><p>Like bubbles, this moment would rise to great heights until someday, I just knew, it would burst\u2014little droplets we\u2019d struggle to hold onto, falling, until the fragments disappeared, leaving behind nothing but a fleeting memory. A dream. I swallowed hard, reminding myself never to take any moment with the love of my life for granted. Because it\u2019d pass too fast. In a heartbeat. Lost forever.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Jett asked. \u201cYou just had the strangest expression on your face.\u201d</p><p>I pondered for a few seconds whether to tell him or not, when I remembered Sylvie\u2019s advice on relationships and honesty. In the serenity of the night, with the soothing sounds of the ocean enveloping us, I knew I could trust him the way I had trusted him when I told him about my past. By confiding in him, we had become one mind\u2014connected in some way, like the water to the moon.</p><p>Like the tides.</p><p>\u201cI want to keep all my happy memories with you, because they\u2019re the only thing that remain of the past, but I don\u2019t know how.\u201d I rested my head against his shoulder. \u201cI see the stars in the sky, and they make me think of life. Of the many plans dwelling inside my mind, but how few memories I have. No matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t choose which memories I want to keep or which I can forget. So I\u2019ve been wondering what\u2019s the purpose of creating memories if I can\u2019t keep them all?\u201d</p><p>Jett took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to try so hard to remember them, Brooke,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe moments that mean the most to you stay etched in your mind. They might be few, but those are the only ones that matter.\u201d</p><p>I turned to him, taking in his beautiful eyes. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDo you know why I had the tattoos done?\u201d</p><p>His question threw me off balance.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>He lifted his shirt. Under the moonlight, his skin shimmered golden, the black tribal tattoos hauntingly beautiful. \u201cI had them done to help me remember all the things I don\u2019t want to forget.\u201d He pointed to the upper one on his shoulder. \u201cThis one helps me remember how hard my father was and all the lessons he taught me. It also reminds me that true power comes not from submission or gain, but from controlling my inner demons. Because our true enemies live within ourselves and feed from the lessons we failed to learn from our pasts.\u201d He arranged his shirt back in place. \u201cEver since I got my tattoos, my bad memories have become good memories. Even valuable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should get my own tattoo,\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed and tilted his head to the side. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want your skin covered in ink. I love it the way it is just now.\u201d As though to prove his point, his fingertip brushed my collarbone, sending a shiver down my spine.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me what I can\u2019t do with my skin?\u201d I raised my eyebrows, which made him laugh harder.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about a small one.\u201d He pointed to my ankle. \u201cA tiny one that\u2019s not noticeable, then feel free to come along. I\u2019m getting a new one soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me you wanted a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t know until I met you.\u201d</p><p>He lowered me onto my back and settled on top of me, his dark green eyes lingering on me. Beneath me I could feel the sand on my skin. It was cold but not unpleasant. \u201cYou know the feeling you get when you think you hear music, and it makes you stop in your tracks, completely absorbed? Well, that\u2019s how I felt when I kissed you for the very first time. I knew right then that I could love you. The night in the bar? That was the best thing that ever happened to me, and that\u2019s what I want my next tattoo to remind me of. I want your face on my skin. Something to look at when you\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing that. What if we fight and you come to regret it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly. \u201cNever.\u201d He was so serious that my laughter died in my throat. \u201cI\u2019ve never been this much in love. And never before did I feel the desire to have someone as much as I want you in my life. So, you\u2019re stuck with me, Miss Stewart. Whether you want it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019ll be stuck with you for a long time,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBecause moments pass way too fast.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot if I hold onto them,\u201d Jett said, adding softly, \u201cNot if they\u2019re real.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and for the first time I felt hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI hope our child gets your long eyelashes,\u201d he said, his breath warm brushing my lips as his hands caressed my face. \u201cIn fact, if we have a girl, we\u2019re naming her Treasure.\u201d</p><p>Whoa, he had chosen our kid\u2019s name already? Without me?</p> <p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d I snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His hand trailed up my thigh, gathering in the waistband of my jeans. \u201cI said it once and I\u2019ll say it again. You\u2019re my treasure, Brooke, so the name\u2019s perfect for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s debatable.\u201d I tried to push his hand away, but it was a feeble attempt. \u201cBesides, what makes you think it\u2019s a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be.\u201d His lips curled up at one corner. \u201cBut in the off chance I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll let you pick out a boy\u2019s name.\u201d His mouth found mine, and under the stars, no kiss could\u2019ve been more perfect\u2014a moment I hoped would never end.</p><p>Life\u2019s uncontrollable, unpredictable, and a hell of a mess. Without fear, loss, and the wrong choices we made, we wouldn\u2019t be who we were. And while some of our decisions had broken us, the pain glued us together. Without the passion, we wouldn\u2019t have surrendered and conquered what we never thought could be ours. Without Jett\u2019s love, I wouldn\u2019t have learned the true value of our relationship.</p> <p>When Jett saved me, he saved not only my life, but also my hopes and our future. He allowed me to believe that our love would never fade away. He left a memory I didn\u2019t want to forget, and now I was ready to treasure his love forever.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
