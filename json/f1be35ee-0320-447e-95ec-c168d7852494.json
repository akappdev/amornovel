Plenty of people are busy. I have a high-powered job, my career is important to me, and I enjoy it.</p> <p>OK. So sometimes I do feel a bit tense. But I\u2019m a lawyer in the City, for God\u2019s sake. What do you expect?</p><p>My handwriting is pressing so hard into the page, I\u2019ve torn the paper. Dammit. Never mind. Let\u2019s move on to the next question.</p><p>On average, how many hours do you spend in the office every day?</p><p>14</p><p>12</p> <p>8</p><p>It depends.</p><p>Do you exercise regularly?</p><p>I regularly go swimming</p><p>I occasionally go swim</p><p>I am intending to begin a regular regime of swimming. When I have time. Work\u2019s been busy lately, it\u2019s a blip.</p> <p>Do you drink 8 glasses of water a day?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Sometimes</p><p>No.</p><p>I put down my pen and clear my throat. Across the room, Maya looks up from where she\u2019s rearranging all her little pots of wax and nail varnish. Maya is my spa beauty therapist for the day and is in her forties, I\u2019d say. Her long dark hair is in a plait with one white streak woven through it, and she has a tiny silver stud in her nose.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right with the questionnaire?\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>\u201cI did mention that I\u2019m in a bit of a hurry,\u201d I say politely. \u201cAre all these questions absolutely necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the Green Tree Center we like to have as much information as possible to assess your beauty and health needs,\u201d she replies in soothing yet implacable tones.</p> <p>I glance at my watch. Nine forty-five.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time for this. I really do not have the time. But it\u2019s my birthday treat and I promised my best friend, Freya.</p><p>To be more accurate, it\u2019s last year\u2019s birthday treat. Freya gave me the gift voucher for an \u201cUltimate De-stress Experience\u201d just over a year ago. She\u2019s my oldest school friend and is always on at me for working too hard. In the card that came with the voucher she wrote Make Some Time For Yourself, Samantha!!!</p><p>Which I did fully intend to do. But we had the Zincon Petrochemical Group restructuring and the Zeus Minerals merger ... and somehow a year went by without my finding a spare moment. I\u2019m a lawyer with Carter Spink. I work in the corporate department on the finance side, and just at the moment, things are pretty hectic with some big deals on. It\u2019s a blip. It\u2019ll get better. I just have to get through the next couple of weeks.</p><p>Anyway, then Freya sent me this year\u2019s birthday card\u2014and I suddenly realized the voucher was about to expire. So here I am, on my twenty-ninth birthday. Sitting on a couch in a white toweling robe and surreal paper knickers. With a half-day window. Max.</p><p>Do you smoke?</p><p>No.</p><p>Do you drink alcohol?</p><p>Yes. The odd glass of wine.</p><p>Do you eat regular home-cooked meals?</p><p>What does that have to do with anything? What makes \u201chome-cooked\u201d meals superior?</p><p>I eat a nutritious, varied diet, I write at last.</p><p>Which is absolutely true.</p><p>Anyway, everyone knows the Chinese live longer than we do\u2014so what could be more healthy than to eat their food? And pizza is Mediterranean. It\u2019s probably more healthy than a home-cooked meal.</p><p>Do you feel your life is balanced?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>N</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d I announce, and hand the pages back to Maya, who starts reading through my answers. Her finger is traveling down the paper at a snail\u2019s pace. Like we\u2019ve got all the time in the world.</p><p>Which she may well have. But I seriously have to be back in the office by one.</p><p>Maya looks up, a thoughtful expression on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re obviously quite a stressed-out woman.\u201d</p><p>What? Where does she get that from? I specifically put on the form, I am not stressed-out.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d I hope Maya\u2019s taking in my relaxed, see-how-unstressed-I-am smile. She looks unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cYour job is obviously very pressured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thrive under pressure,\u201d I explain. Which is true. I\u2019ve known that about myself ever since ...</p><p>Well. Ever since my mother told me, when I was about eight. You thrive under pressure, Samantha. Our whole family thrives under pressure. It\u2019s like our family motto or something.</p><p>Apart from my brother Peter, of course. He had a nervous breakdown. But the rest of us.</p><p>I love my job. I love spotting the loophole in a contract. I love the thrill of negotiation, and arguing my case, and making the sharpest point in the room. I love the adrenaline rush of closing a deal.</p><p>I suppose just occasionally I do feel as though someone\u2019s piling heavy weights on me. Like big concrete blocks, one on top of the other, and I have to keep holding them up, no matter how exhausted I am ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But then everyone probably feels like that. It\u2019s normal.</p><p>\u201cYour skin\u2019s very dehydrated.\u201d Maya is shaking her head. She runs an expert hand across my cheek and rests her fingers underneath my jaw, looking concerned. \u201cYour heart rate\u2019s very high. That\u2019s not healthy. Are you feeling particularly tense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork\u2019s pretty busy at the moment.\u201d I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s just a blip. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Can we get on with it?</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Maya gets up. She presses a button set in the wall and gentle pan-pipe music fills the air. \u201cAll I can say is, you\u2019ve come to the right place, Samantha. Our aim here is to de-stress, revitalize, and detoxify.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLovely,\u201d I say, only half listening. I\u2019ve just remembered that I never got back to David Elldridge about the Ukrainian oil contract. I meant to call him yesterday. Shit.</p><p>\u201cOur aim is to provide a haven of tranquility, away from all your day-to-day worries.\u201d Maya presses another button in the wall, and the light dims to a muted glow. \u201cBefore we start,\u201d she says softly, \u201cdo you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I do.\u201d I lean forward.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d She beams. \u201cAre you curious about today\u2019s treatments, or is it something more general?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I possibly send a quick e-mail?\u201d</p> <p>Maya\u2019s smile freezes on her face.</p><p>\u201cJust quickly,\u201d I add. \u201cIt won\u2019t take two secs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha, Samantha ...\u201d Maya shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re here to relax. To take a moment for yourself. Not to send e-mails. E-mail\u2019s an obsession! An addiction! As evil as alcohol. Or caffeine.\u201d</p><p>For goodness sake, I\u2019m not obsessed. I mean, that\u2019s ridiculous. I check my e-mails about once every ... thirty seconds, maybe.</p><p>The thing is, a lot can change in thirty seconds.</p><p>\u201cAnd besides, Samantha,\u201d Maya goes on. \u201cDo you see a computer in this room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I reply, obediently looking around the dim little room, at posters of yoga positions and a wind chime and a row of crystals arranged on the windowsill.</p><p>\u201cThis is why we ask that you leave all electronic equipment in the safe. No mobile phones are permitted. No little computers.\u201d Maya spreads her arms. \u201cThis is a retreat. An escape from the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod meekly.</p><p>Now is probably not the time to reveal that I have a BlackBerry hidden in my paper knickers.</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s begin.\u201d Maya smiles. \u201cLie down, please, under a towel. And remove your watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my watch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother addiction.\u201d She tsks reprovingly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know the time while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She turns away, and with reluctance I take off my watch. Then, a little awkwardly, I arrange myself on the massage table, trying to avoid squashing my precious BlackBerry.</p> <p>I did see the rule about no electronic equipment. And I did surrender my Dictaphone. But three hours without a BlackBerry? I mean, what if something came up at the office? What if there was an emergency?</p><p>If they really wanted people to relax, they would let them keep their BlackBerrys and mobile phones, not confiscate them.</p><p>Anyway, she\u2019ll never see it under my towel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to begin with a relaxing foot rub,\u201d says Maya, and I feel her smoothing some kind of lotion over my feet. \u201cTry to clear your mind.\u201d</p><p>I stare dutifully up at the ceiling. Clear mind. My mind is as clear as a transparent ... glass ...</p><p>What am I going to do about Elldridge? He\u2019ll be waiting for a response. What if he tells the other partners I was lax? What if it affects my chances of partnership?</p><p>I feel a clench of alarm. Now is not the time to leave anything to chance.</p><p>\u201cTry to let go of all your thoughts....\u201d Maya is chanting. \u201cFeel the release of tension....\u201d</p><p>Maybe I could send him a very quick e-mail.</p><p>Surreptitiously I reach down and feel the hard corner of my BlackBerry. Gradually I inch it out of my paper knickers. Maya is still massaging my feet, totally oblivious.</p><p>\u201cYour body is growing heavy ... your mind should be emptying ...\u201d</p><p>I edge the BlackBerry up onto my chest until I can just see the screen underneath the towel. Thank goodness this room is so dim. Trying to keep my movements to a minimum, I furtively start typing an e-mail with one hand.</p><p>\u201cRelaax ...\u201d Maya is saying in soothing tones. \u201cImagine you\u2019re walking along a beach ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh ...\u201d I murmur.</p><p>David, I\u2019m typing. Re ZFN Oil contract. I read through amendments.

It can all wait. You just don\u2019t know how to relax!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a workaholic!\u201d I retort indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer!

Especially not right now. I\u2019m ... well, I\u2019m up for partnership at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>As I say the words aloud I feel the familiar stabbing of nerves. Partner of one of the biggest law firms in the country. The only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted, ever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up for partnership,\u201d I repeat, more calmly. \u201cThey make the decision tomorrow. If it happens, I\u2019ll be the youngest partner in the history of the firm. Do you know how big a deal that is? Do you have any idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone can take a couple of hours out,\u201d interrupts Maya. She puts her hands on my shoulders. \u201cSamantha, you\u2019re incredibly nervy. Your shoulders are rigid, your heart\u2019s racing ... it seems to me you\u2019re right on the edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bundle of jitters!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to decide to slow down, Samantha.\u201d She looks at me earnestly. \u201cOnly you can decide to change your life. Are you going to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... well ...\u201d</p> <p>I stop with a squeak of surprise, as from inside my paper knickers there comes a judder.</p><p>My mobile phone. I shoved it in there along with the BlackBerry and turned it onto vibrate so it wouldn\u2019t make a noise.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Maya is gaping at my twitching towel. \u201cWhat on earth is that ... quivering?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t admit it\u2019s a phone. Not after the BlackBerry.</p><p>\u201cErm ...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cIt\u2019s my special ... er ... love toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d Maya looks taken aback.</p><p>The phone judders inside my pants again. I have to answer. It might be the office.</p><p>\u201cUm ... you know, I\u2019m reaching a bit of an intimate moment right now.\u201d I give Maya a significant look. \u201cMaybe you could ... uh ... leave the room?\u201d</p><p>Suspicion snaps into Maya\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWait a moment!\u201d She peers again. \u201cIs that a phone under there? You smuggled in a mobile phone as well?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. She looks furious.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I say, trying to sound apologetic. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got your rules and everything, which I do respect, but the thing is, I need my mobile.\u201d I reach under the towel for the phone.</p><p>\u201cLeave it!\u201d Maya\u2019s cry takes me by surprise. \u201cSamantha,\u201d she says, making an obvious effort to keep calm. \u201cIf you\u2019ve listened to a single word I\u2019ve said ... you\u2019ll switch the phone off right now.\u201d</p><p>The phone vibrates again in my hand. I look at the caller ID and feel a twist in my stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can leave a message. They can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your own time.\u201d She leans forward and clasps my hands earnestly. \u201cYour own time.\u201d</p><p>She really doesn\u2019t get it, does she? I almost want to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an associate at Carter Spink,\u201d I explain. \u201cI don\u2019t have my own time.\u201d I flip the phone open and an angry male voice bites down the line.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, where the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Ketterman. The head of our corporate department. He\u2019s in his late forties and his first name is John, but no one ever calls him anything except Ketterman.

You would too, if your time was measured in six-minute segments. For every six minutes of my working life, I\u2019m supposed to bill a client.

And the truth is, you get used to measuring your life in little chunks. And you get used to working.

As soon as I have a moment.</p><p>\u201cMeeting in ten minutes,\u201d he says. \u201cI want the draft financing documentation ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I reply. Ketterman is unnerving at the best of times. He just emanates scary, brainy power. But today is a million times worse, because Ketterman is on the decision panel. Tomorrow morning at nine a.m., he and thirteen other partners are holding a big meeting to decide on which associates will become partners this year. All the candidates gave presentations last week to the panel, outlining what qualities and ideas we would bring to the firm. As I finished mine, I had no idea whether I\u2019d impressed or not. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll find out.</p><p>\u201cThe draft documentation is right here....\u201d I reach into a pile of folders and pull out what feels like a box file with an efficient flourish.</p><p>It\u2019s the wrong one.</p><p>Hastily I put it down. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely here somewhere....\u201d I scrabble frantically and locate the correct file. Thank God. \u201cHere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can work in this shambles, Samantha.\u201d Ketterman\u2019s voice is thin and sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cAt least everything\u2019s to hand!\u201d I attempt a little joke, but Ketterman remains stony-faced. Flustered, I pull out my chair, and a pile of articles and old drafts falls in a shower to the floor.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, the old rule was that desks were completely cleared every night by six.\u201d Ketterman\u2019s voice is steely. \u201cPerhaps we should reintroduce it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha!\u201d A genial voice interrupts us and I look round in relief to see Arnold Saville approaching along the corridor.</p><p>Arnold is my favorite of the senior partners. He\u2019s got woolly gray hair that always seems a bit wild for a lawyer, and flamboyant taste in ties. Today he\u2019s wearing a bright red paisley affair, with a matching handkerchief in his top pocket. He greets me with a broad smile, and at once I feel myself relax.</p><p>I\u2019m sure Arnold\u2019s the one who\u2019s rooting for me to be made partner. Just as I\u2019m equally sure Ketterman will be opposing it. I\u2019ve already overheard Ketterman saying I\u2019m very young to be made a partner, that there\u2019s no rush. He\u2019d probably have me pegging away as an associate for five more years. But Arnold\u2019s always been on my side. He\u2019s the maverick of the firm, the one who breaks the rules. For years he had a labrador, Stan, who lived under his desk, despite the complaints of the health and safety department. If anyone can lighten the atmosphere in a tricky meeting, it\u2019s Arnold.</p><p>\u201cLetter of appreciation about you, Samantha.\u201d Arnold beams and holds out a sheet of paper. \u201cFrom the chairman of Gleiman Brothers, no less.\u201d</p><p>I take the cream vellum sheet in surprise and glance down at the handwritten note: ... great esteem ... her services always professional ...</p><p>\u201cI gather you saved him a few million pounds he wasn\u2019t expecting.\u201d Arnold twinkles. \u201cHe\u2019s delighted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d I color slightly. \u201cWell, it was nothing.

Excellent, Samantha! Very well done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... thanks.\u201d I glance at Ketterman, just to see if by any remote chance he might look impressed. But he\u2019s still frowning impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI also want you to deal with this.\u201d Ketterman puts a file on my desk. \u201cMarlowe and Co. are acquiring a retail park.

It\u2019ll take me hours to do this.</p><p>Ketterman\u2019s always giving me extra bits of mundane work he can\u2019t be bothered to do himself. In fact, all the partners do it. Even Arnold. Half the time they don\u2019t even tell me, just dump the file on my desk with some illegible memo and expect me to get on with it.</p><p>And of course I do. In fact I always try to get it done just a bit faster than they were expecting.</p><p>\u201cAny problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I say in a brisk, can-do, potential-partner voice. \u201cSee you at the meeting.\u201d</p> <p>As he stalks off I check my watch. Ten twenty-two. I have precisely eight minutes to make sure the draft documentation for the Fallons deal is all in order. Fallons is our client, a big multinational tourism company, and is acquiring the Smithleaf Hotel Group. I open the file and scan the pages swiftly, checking for errors, searching for gaps. I\u2019ve learned to read a lot faster since I\u2019ve been at Carter Spink.</p><p>In fact, I do everything faster. I walk faster, talk faster, eat faster ... have sex faster ...</p><p>Not that I\u2019ve had much of that lately. But two years ago I dated a senior partner from Berry Forbes. His name was Jacob and he worked on huge international mergers, and he had even less time than I did. By the end, we\u2019d honed our routine to about six minutes, which would have been quite handy if we were billing each other. (Obviously we weren\u2019t.) He would make me come\u2014and I would make him come. And then we\u2019d check our e-mails.</p><p>Which is practically simultaneous orgasms. So no one can say that\u2019s not good sex. I\u2019ve read Cosmo; I know these things.</p><p>Anyway, then Jacob was made a huge offer and moved to Boston, so that was the end of it. I didn\u2019t mind very much.</p><p>To be totally honest, I didn\u2019t really fancy him.</p> <p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d It\u2019s my secretary, Maggie. She only started three weeks ago and I don\u2019t know her very well yet. \u201cYou had a message while you were out. From Joanne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoanne from Clifford Chance?\u201d I look up, my attention grabbed. \u201cOK. Tell her I got the e-mail about clause four, and I\u2019ll call her about it after lunch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that Joanne,\u201d Maggie interrupts. \u201cJoanne your new cleaner. She wants to know where you keep your vacuum-cleaner bags.\u201d</p><p>I look at her blankly. \u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVacuum-cleaner bags,\u201d repeats Maggie patiently. \u201cShe can\u2019t find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does the vacuum cleaner need to go in a bag?\u201d I say, puzzled. \u201cIs she taking it somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Maggie peers at me as though she thinks I must be joking. \u201cThe bags that go inside your vacuum cleaner,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cTo collect the dust? Do you have any of those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cOh, those bags. Er ...\u201d</p> <p>I frown thoughtfully, as though the solution is on the tip of my tongue. The truth is, I can\u2019t even visualize my vacuum cleaner. Where did I put it? I know it was delivered, because the porter signed for it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a Dyson,\u201d suggests Maggie. \u201cThey don\u2019t take bags. Is it a cylinder or an upright?\u201d She looks at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sort it,\u201d I say in a businesslike manner, and start gathering my papers together. \u201cThanks, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had another question.\u201d Maggie consults her pad. \u201cHow do you switch on your oven?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I continue gathering my papers. \u201cWell. You turn the ... er ... knob,\u201d I say at last, trying to sound nonchalant. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear, really....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said it has some weird timer lock.\u201d Maggie frowns. \u201cIs it gas or electric?\u201d</p><p>OK, I think I should terminate this conversation right now.</p><p>\u201cMaggie, I really need to prepare for this meeting,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s in three minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what shall I tell your cleaner?\u201d Maggie persists. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting for me to call back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell her to ... leave it for today.

Vacuum-cleaner bags\u2014buy</p> <p>I put the pen down and massage my forehead. I really don\u2019t have time for this. I mean, vacuum bags. I don\u2019t even know what they look like, for God\u2019s sake, let alone where to buy them\u2014</p><p>A sudden brain wave hits me. I\u2019ll order a new vacuum cleaner. That\u2019ll come with a bag already installed, surely.</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d I give a startled jump and open my eyes. Guy Ashby is standing at my door.</p><p>Guy is my best friend in the firm. He\u2019s six foot three with olive skin and dark eyes, and normally he looks every inch the smooth, polished lawyer. But this morning his dark hair is rumpled and there are shadows under his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cRelax.\u201d Guy smiles. \u201cOnly me. Coming to the meeting?\u201d</p><p>He has the most devastating smile. It\u2019s not just me; everyone noticed it the minute he arrived at the firm.</p><p>\u201cOh. Er ... yes, I am.\u201d I pick up my papers, then add carelessly, \u201cAre you OK, Guy? You look a bit rough.\u201d</p><p>He broke up with his girlfriend. They had bitter rows all night and she\u2019s walked off for good....</p><p>No, she\u2019s emigrated to New Zealand....</p><p>\u201cAll-nighter,\u201d he says, wincing. \u201cFucking Ketterman. He\u2019s inhuman.\u201d He yawns widely, showing the perfect white teeth he had fixed when he was at Harvard Law School.</p> <p>He says it wasn\u2019t his choice. Apparently they don\u2019t let you graduate until you\u2019ve been OK\u2019d by the cosmetic surgeon.</p><p>\u201cBummer.\u201d I grin in sympathy, then push back my chair. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve known Guy for a year, ever since he joined the corporate department as a partner. He\u2019s intelligent and funny, and works the same way I do, and we just somehow ... click.</p><p>And yes. It\u2019s possible that some kind of romance would have happened between us if things had been different. But there was a stupid misunderstanding, and ...</p><p>Anyway. It didn\u2019t. The details aren\u2019t important. It\u2019s not something I dwell on. We\u2019re friends\u2014and that\u2019s fine by me.</p><p>OK, this is exactly what happened.</p><p>Apparently Guy noticed me his first day at the firm, just like I noticed him. And he was interested. He asked Nigel MacDermot, who had the next-door office to him, if I was single. Which I was.</p><p>This is the crucial part: I was single. I\u2019d just split up with Jacob. But Nigel MacDermot\u2014who is a stupid, stupid, thoughtless behind-the-times moron\u2014told Guy I was attached to a senior partner at Berry Forbes.</p> <p>Even though I was single.</p><p>If you ask me, the system is majorly flawed. It should be clearer. People should have engaged signs, like toilets. Taken. Not-Taken. There should be no ambiguity about these things.</p><p>Anyway, I didn\u2019t have a sign. Or if I did, it was the wrong one. There were a slightly embarrassing few weeks where I smiled a lot at Guy\u2014and he looked awkward and started avoiding me, because he didn\u2019t want to a) break up a relationship or b) have a threesome with me and Jacob.</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand what was going on, so I backed off. Then I heard through the grapevine he\u2019d started going out with a girl called Charlotte who he\u2019d met at some weekend party. They live together now. A month or two later we worked together on a deal, and got to know each other as friends\u2014and that\u2019s pretty much the whole story.</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s fine. Really. That\u2019s the way it goes. Some things happen\u2014and some things don\u2019t. This one obviously just wasn\u2019t meant to be.</p><p>Except deep down ... I still believe it was.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Guy as we walk along the corridor to the meeting room. \u201cWhat was Ketterman in your room for earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the usual. A due diligence report. Have it back by yesterday, that kind of thing. Like I\u2019m not snowed under already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone wants you to do their work for them, that\u2019s why,\u201d says Guy. He shoots me a concerned look. \u201cYou want to delegate anything? I could speak to Ketterman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I reply at once. \u201cI can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want anyone to help.\u201d He sounds amused. \u201cYou\u2019d rather die, smothered by a heap of due diligence files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re not the same!\u201d I retort.</p><p>Guy hates admitting defeat or asking for help as much as I do. Last year he sprained his leg in a skiing accident and point-blank refused to use the crutch that the firm\u2019s doctor gave him. His secretary kept running after him with it down corridors, but he\u2019d just tell her to take it away and use it as a coat stand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be calling the shots soon.

What\u2019s your IQ again, six hundred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Guy laughs. \u201cWhat\u2019s one twenty-four times seventy-five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine thousand, three hundred,\u201d I say grudgingly.</p><p>Since I was about ten years old, I\u2019ve been able to do big sums in my head. God knows why, I just can. And everyone else just goes, \u201cOh cool,\u201d and then forgets about it.</p> <p>But Guy keeps on about it, pitching sums at me like I\u2019m a circus performer. This is the one thing that irritates me about him. He thinks it\u2019s funny, but it actually gets a bit annoying. I still haven\u2019t quite worked out how to get him to stop.</p><p>Once I told him the wrong number on purpose\u2014but that time it turned out he actually needed the answer, and he put it in a contract and the deal nearly got wrecked as a result. So I haven\u2019t done that again.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t practiced in the mirror for the firm\u2019s Web site?\u201d Guy adopts a pose with his finger poised thoughtfully at his chin. \u201cMs. Samantha Sweeting, Partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even thought about it,\u201d I say, feigning indifference.</p><p>This is a slight lie. I\u2019ve already planned how to do my hair for the photo. And which of my black suits to wear.</p><p>\u201cI heard your presentation blew their socks off,\u201d says Guy more seriously.</p> <p>My indifference vanishes in a second. \u201cReally?\u201d I say, trying not to sound too eager for praise. \u201cYou heard that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you put William Griffiths right on a point of law in front of everybody.\u201d Guy folds his arms and regards me humorously. \u201cDo you ever make a mistake, Samantha Sweeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I make plenty of mistakes,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cBelieve me.\u201d</p><p>Like not grabbing you and telling you I was single, the very first day we met.</p><p>\u201cA mistake isn\u2019t a mistake.\u201d Guy pauses. \u201cUnless it can\u2019t be put right.\u201d As he says the words, his eyes seem to hold an extra significance.</p><p>Or else they\u2019re just squiffy after his night of no sleep. I was never any good at reading the signs.</p><p>I should have done a degree in mutual attraction, instead of law. It would have been a lot more useful. Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Knowing When Men Fancy You And When They\u2019re Just Being Friendly.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Ketterman\u2019s whiplash voice behind us makes us both jump, and we turn to see a whole phalanx of soberly suited men, together with a pair of even more soberly suited women.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Guy nods at Ketterman, then turns back and winks at me.</p><p>Three</p><p>Nine hours later we\u2019re all still in the meeting.</p><p>The huge mahogany table is strewn with photocopied draft contracts, financial reports, notepads covered in scribbles, polystyrene coffee cups, and Post-its. Take-out boxes from lunch are littering the floor. A secretary is distributing fresh copies of the draft agreement. Two of the lawyers from the opposition have got up from the table and are murmuring intently in the breakout room. Every meeting room has one of these: a little side area where you go for private conversations, or when you feel like breaking something.</p><p>The intensity of the afternoon has passed. It\u2019s like an ebb in the tide. Faces are flushed, tempers are still high, but no one\u2019s shouting anymore. The Fallons and Smithleaf people have gone. They reached agreement on various points at about four o\u2019clock, shook hands, and sailed off in their shiny limos.</p><p>Now it\u2019s up to us, the lawyers, to work out what they said and what they actually meant (and if you think it\u2019s the same thing, you might as well give up law now) and put it all into a draft contract in time for more negotiations.</p><p>When they\u2019ll probably begin shouting some more.</p><p>I rub my dry face and take a gulp of cappuccino before realizing I\u2019ve picked up the wrong cup\u2014the stone-cold cup from four hours ago. Yuck. Yuck. And I can\u2019t exactly spit it out all over the table.</p><p>I swallow the revolting mouthful with an inward shudder. The fluorescent lights are flickering in my eyes and I feel drained. My role in all of these megadeals is on the finance side\u2014so it was me who negotiated the loan agreement between Fallons and PGNI Bank. It was me who rescued the situation when a \u00a310-million black hole of debt turned up in a subsidiary company. And it was me who spent about three hours this afternoon arguing one single, stupid term in the contract. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The term was best endeavors. The other side wanted to use reasonable efforts. In the end we won the point\u2014but I can\u2019t feel my usual triumph. All I know is, it\u2019s seven-nineteen, and in eleven minutes I\u2019m supposed to be halfway across town, sitting down to dinner at Maxim\u2019s with my mother and brother Daniel.</p><p>I\u2019ll have to cancel. My own birthday dinner.</p><p>Even as I think the thought, I can hear the outraged voice of Freya ringing in my mind.</p><p>They can\u2019t make you stay at work on your birthday!</p> <p>I canceled on her too, last week, when we were supposed to be going to a comedy club. A company sell-off was due to complete the next morning and I didn\u2019t have any choice.</p><p>What she doesn\u2019t understand is, the deadline comes first, end of story. Prior engagements don\u2019t count; birthdays don\u2019t count. Vacations are canceled every week. Across the table from me is Clive Sutherland from the corporate department. His wife had twins this morning and he was back at the table by lunchtime.</p><p>\u201cAll right, people.\u201d Ketterman\u2019s voice commands immediate attention.</p><p>Ketterman is the only one here who isn\u2019t red-faced or weary-looking or even jaded. He looks as machinelike as ever, as polished as he did this morning. When he gets angry, he just exudes a silent, steely fury.</p><p>\u201cWe have to adjourn.\u201d</p> <p>What? My head pops up.</p><p>Other heads have popped up too; I can detect the hope around the table. We\u2019re like schoolkids sensing a disturbance during the math test, not daring to move in case we land a double detention.</p><p>\u201cUntil we have the due diligence documentation from Fallons, we can\u2019t proceed. I\u2019ll see you all tomorrow, here at nine a.m.\u201d He sweeps out, and as the door closes, I exhale. I was holding my breath, I realize.</p><p>Clive has already bolted for the door. People are on their mobile phones all over the room, discussing dinner, films, uncanceling previous arrangements. There\u2019s a joyful lift to the proceedings. I have a sudden urge to yell \u201cYay!\u201d</p><p>But that wouldn\u2019t be partnerlike.</p><p>I gather up my papers, stuff them into my briefcase, and push back my chair.</p> <p>\u201cSamantha. I forgot.\u201d Guy is making his way across the room. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p><p>As he hands me a simple white package, I feel a ridiculous rush of joy. A birthday present. He\u2019s the only one in the whole company who remembered my birthday. I can\u2019t help glowing as I undo the cardboard envelope.</p><p>\u201cGuy, you really shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was no trouble,\u201d he says, clearly satisfied with himself.</p><p>\u201cStill!\u201d I laugh. \u201cI thought you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off abruptly as I uncover a corporate DVD in a laminated case. It\u2019s a summary of the European Partners presentation we had the other day. I mentioned that I\u2019d like a copy.</p><p>I turn it over in my hands, making sure my smile is completely intact before I look up. Of course he didn\u2019t remember my birthday. Why would he? He probably never even knew it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ... great,\u201d I say at last. \u201cThanks!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He\u2019s picking up his briefcase. \u201cHave a good evening. Anything planned?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell him it\u2019s my birthday. He\u2019ll think\u2014he\u2019ll realize\u2014</p><p>\u201cJust ... a family thing.\u201d I smile. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The main thing is, I\u2019m going to make dinner after all. And I won\u2019t even be late! Last time I had dinner with Mum, about three months ago now, I was an hour late after my plane from Amsterdam was delayed. Then she had to take a conference call halfway through the main course. It wasn\u2019t exactly a success.</p><p>As my taxi edges through the traffic on Cheapside, I quickly rifle in my bag for my new makeup case. I nipped into Selfridges in my lunch hour the other day when I realized I was still using the old gray eyeliner and mascara I bought for a Law Society dinner a year ago. I didn\u2019t have time for a demonstration, but I asked the girl at the counter if she could just quickly sell me everything she thought I should have.</p><p>I didn\u2019t really listen as she explained each item, because I was on the phone to Elldridge about the Ukrainian contract. But the one thing I do remember is her insistence I should use something called \u201cbronzer powder.\u201d She said it might give me a glow and stop me looking so dreadfully\u2014</p><p>Then she stopped herself. \u201cPale,\u201d she said at last. \u201cYou\u2019re just a bit ... pale.\u201d</p><p>I take out the compact and huge blusher brush and start sweeping the powder onto my cheeks and forehead. Then, as I peer at my reflection in the mirror, I stifle a laugh. My face stares back at me, freakishly golden and shiny. I look ridiculous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I mean, who am I kidding? A City lawyer who hasn\u2019t been on holiday for two years doesn\u2019t have a tan. I might as well walk in with beads in my hair and pretend I\u2019ve just flown in from Barbados.</p><p>I look at myself for a few more seconds, then take out a cleansing wipe and scrub the bronzer off until my face is white again, with shades of gray. Back to normal. The makeup girl kept mentioning the dark shadows under my eyes too, and there they are.</p><p>Thing is, if I didn\u2019t have shadows under my eyes, I\u2019d probably get fired.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing a black suit, as I always do. My mother gave me five almost identical black suits for my twenty-first birthday, and I\u2019ve never really broken the habit. The only item of color about me is my bag, which is red. Mum gave that to me as well, two years ago. At least ... she gave me a black one originally. But on the way home I saw it in a shop window in red, had a total brainstorm, and exchanged it. I\u2019m not convinced she\u2019s ever forgiven me.</p> <p>I free my hair from its elastic band, quickly comb it out, then twist it back into place. My hair has never exactly been my pride and joy. It\u2019s mouse-color, medium length, with a medium wave. At least, it was last time I looked. Most of the time it lives screwed up into a knot.</p><p>\u201cNice evening planned?\u201d says the taxi driver, who\u2019s been watching me in his mirror.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday!\u201d He eyes me in the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019ll be partying, then. Making a night of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... kind of.\u201d</p> <p>My family and wild parties don\u2019t exactly go together. But even so, it\u2019ll be nice for us to see one another and catch up. It doesn\u2019t happen very often.</p><p>It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to see one another. We just all have very busy careers. There\u2019s my mother, who\u2019s a barrister. She\u2019s quite well-known, in fact. She started her own chambers ten years ago and last year she won an award for Women in Law. And then there\u2019s my brother Daniel, who is thirty-six and head of investment at Whittons. He was named by Money Management Weekly last year as one of the top deal-makers in the city.</p><p>There\u2019s also my other brother, Peter, but like I said, he had a bit of a breakdown. He lives in France now and teaches English at a local school and doesn\u2019t even have an answering machine. And my dad, of course, who lives in South Africa with his third wife. I haven\u2019t seen much of him since I was three. But I\u2019ve made my peace about this. My mother\u2019s got enough energy for two parents.</p><p>I glance at my watch as we speed along the Strand. Seven forty-two. I\u2019m starting to feel quite excited. The street outside is still bright and warm and tourists are walking along in T-shirts and shorts, pointing at the High Court. It must have been a gorgeous summer\u2019s day. Inside the air-conditioned Carter Spink building you have no idea what the weather in the real world is doing.</p><p>We come to a halt outside Maxim\u2019s and I pay the taxi driver, adding a large tip.</p><p>\u201cHave a great evening, love!\u201d he says. \u201cAnd happy birthday!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>As I hurry into the restaurant, I\u2019m looking all around for Mum or Daniel, but I can\u2019t spot either of them.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say to the ma\u00eetre d\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m meeting Ms. Tennyson.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s Mum. She disapproves of women taking the name of their husband. She also disapproves of women staying at home, cooking, cleaning, or learning to type, and thinks all women should earn more than their husbands because they\u2019re naturally brighter.</p><p>The ma\u00eetre d\u2019\u2014a dapper man who is a good six inches shorter than me\u2014leads me to an empty table in the corner and I slide into the suede banquette.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I smile at the waiter who approaches. \u201cI\u2019d like a Buck\u2019s Fizz, a gimlet, and a martini, please. But don\u2019t bring them over until the other guests arrive.\u201d</p><p>Mum always drinks gimlets. And I\u2019ve no idea what Daniel\u2019s on these days, but he won\u2019t say no to a martini.</p><p>The waiter nods and disappears, and I shake out my napkin, looking all around at the other diners. Maxim\u2019s is a pretty cool restaurant, all wenge floors and steel tables and mood lighting. It\u2019s very popular with lawyers; in fact, Mum has an account here. Two partners from Linklaters are at a distant table, and I can see one of the biggest libel lawyers in London at the bar. The noise of chatter, corks popping, and forks against oversize plates is like the huge roar of the sea, with occasional tidal waves of laughter making heads turn.</p> <p>As I scan the menu I suddenly feel ravenous. I haven\u2019t had a proper meal for a week, and it all looks so good. Glazed foie gras. Lamb on minted hummus. And on the specials board is chocolate-orange souffl\u00e9 with two homemade sorbets. I just hope Mum can stay long enough for pudding. I\u2019ve heard her say plenty of times that half a dinner party is enough for anybody. The trouble is, she\u2019s not really interested in food. She\u2019s also not that interested in most people, as they\u2019re generally less intelligent than her. Which rules out most potential dinner guests. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Daniel will stay. Once my brother starts on a bottle of wine, he feels obliged to see it through to the end.</p><p>\u201cMiss Sweeting?\u201d I look up to see the ma\u00eetre d\u2019. He\u2019s holding a mobile phone. \u201cI have a message. Your mother has been held up at her chambers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I try to hide my disappointment. But I can hardly complain. I\u2019ve done the same thing to her enough times. \u201cSo ... what time will she be here?\u201d</p><p>I think I see a flash of pity in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI have her here on the telephone. Her secretary will put her through.... Hello?\u201d he says into the phone. \u201cI have Ms. Tennyson\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d comes a crisp, precise voice in my ear. \u201cDarling, I can\u2019t come tonight, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come at all?\u201d My smile falters. \u201cNot even ... for a drink?\u201d</p><p>Her chambers is only five minutes away in a cab, in Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields.</p><p>\u201cFar too much on. I have a very big case on and I\u2019m in court tomorrow\u2014No, get me the other file,\u201d she adds to someone in her office. \u201cThese things happen,\u201d she resumes. \u201cBut have a nice evening with Daniel. Oh, and happy birthday. I\u2019ve wired three hundred pounds to your bank account.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you haven\u2019t heard about the partnership yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard your presentation went well....\u201d I can hear her tapping her pen on the phone. \u201cHow many hours have you put in this month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... probably about two hundred ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that enough? Samantha, you don\u2019t want to be passed over. You\u2019ve been working toward this for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Like I don\u2019t know that.</p><p>Still, I suppose I should be glad she\u2019s not badgering me about whether I\u2019ve got a boyfriend. Mum never asks me about my personal life. She expects me to be as focused and driven as she is, if not more so. And even though we don\u2019t talk very often anymore, even though she\u2019s less controlling than she was when I was younger, I still feel apprehensive whenever she rings.</p><p>\u201cThere will be younger lawyers coming up behind,\u201d she continues. \u201cSomeone in your position could easily go stale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred hours is quite a lot ...\u201d I try to explain. \u201cCompared to the others\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be better than the others!\u201d Her voice cuts across mine as though she\u2019s in a courtroom. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford for your performance to slip below excellent. This is a crucial time\u2014Not that file!\u201d she adds impatiently to whoever it is. \u201cHold the line, Samantha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d</p><p>I look up in confusion from the phone to see a girl with long swishy blond hair, wearing a powder-blue suit, approaching the table. She\u2019s holding a gift basket adorned with a bow, and has a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lorraine, Daniel\u2019s PA,\u201d she says in a singsong voice I suddenly recognize from calling Daniel\u2019s office. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t make it tonight, I\u2019m afraid. But I\u2019ve got a little something for you\u2014plus he\u2019s here on the phone to say hello....\u201d</p> <p>She holds out a lit-up mobile phone. In total confusion, I take it and press it to my other ear.</p><p>\u201cHi, Samantha,\u201d comes Daniel\u2019s businesslike drawl. \u201cLook, babe, I\u2019m snowed under. I can\u2019t be there.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them is coming?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Daniel\u2019s saying. \u201cOne of those things. But have a great time with Mum, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. I can\u2019t admit she blew me off too. I can\u2019t admit that I\u2019m sitting here all on my own.</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d Somehow I muster a breezy tone. \u201cWe will!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve transferred some money to your account. Buy something nice. And I\u2019ve sent some chocolates along with Lorraine,\u201d he adds proudly. \u201cPicked them out myself.\u201d</p><p>I look at the gift basket Lorraine is proffering. It isn\u2019t chocolates, it\u2019s soap.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really lovely, Daniel,\u201d I manage. \u201cThanks very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday to you ...\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s sudden chorusing behind me. I swivel round to see a waiter carrying over a cocktail glass with a sparkler. Happy Birthday Samantha is written in caramel on the steel tray, next to a miniature souvenir menu signed by the chef. Three waiters are following behind, all singing in harmony.</p><p>After a moment, Lorraine awkwardly joins in. \u201cHappy birthday to you ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The waiter puts the tray down in front of me, but my hands are full with phones.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that for you,\u201d says Lorraine, relieving me of Daniel\u2019s phone. She lifts it to her ear, then beams at me. \u201cHe\u2019s singing!\u201d she says, pointing to the receiver encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Mum is saying in my ear. \u201cAre you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just ... they\u2019re singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 ...\u201d</p> <p>I put the phone on the table. After a moment\u2019s thought, Lorraine puts the other phone carefully down on the other side of me.</p><p>This is my family birthday party.</p><p>Two cell phones.</p><p>I can see people looking over at the singing, their smiles falling a little as they see I\u2019m sitting on my own. I can see the sympathy in the faces of the waiters. I\u2019m trying to keep my chin up, but my cheeks are burning with embarrassment.</p><p>Suddenly the waiter I ordered from earlier appears at the table. He\u2019s carrying three cocktails on a tray and looks at the empty table in slight confusion.</p> <p>\u201cWho is the martini for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was ... supposed to be for my brother ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the Nokia,\u201d says Lorraine helpfully, pointing at the mobile phone.</p><p>There\u2019s a pause\u2014then, with a blank, professional face, the waiter sets the drink down in front of the phone, together with a cocktail napkin.</p><p>I want to laugh\u2014except there\u2019s a stinging at the back of my eyes. He places the other cocktails on the table, nods at me, then retreats. There\u2019s an awkward pause.</p><p>\u201cSo anyway ...\u201d Lorraine retrieves Daniel\u2019s mobile phone and pops it into her bag. \u201cHappy birthday\u2014and have a lovely evening!\u201d</p> <p>As she tip-taps her way out of the restaurant, I pick up the other phone to say good-bye\u2014but Mum\u2019s already rung off. The singing waiters have melted away. It\u2019s just me and a basket of soap.</p><p>\u201cDid you wish to order?\u201d The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 has reappeared at my chair. \u201cI can recommend the risotto,\u201d he says in kind tones. \u201cSome nice salad, perhaps? And a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually ...\u201d I force myself to smile. \u201cI\u2019ll just get the bill, thanks.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>We were never all going to make a dinner. We shouldn\u2019t even have tried to set the date. We\u2019re all busy, we all have careers, that\u2019s just the way my family is.</p><p>As I stand outside the restaurant, a taxi pulls up right in front of me and I quickly stick my hand out. The rear door opens and a tatty beaded flip-flop emerges, followed by a pair of cutoff jeans, an embroidered kaftan, familiar tousled blond hair ...</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d she\u2019s instructing the taxi driver. \u201cI can only be five minutes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreya?\u201d I say in disbelief. She wheels round and her eyes widen.</p> <p>\u201cSamantha! What are you doing on the pavement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I counter. \u201cI thought you were going to India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way! I\u2019m meeting Lord at the airport in about ...\u201d She looks at her watch. \u201cTen minutes.\u201d</p><p>She pulls a guilty face, and I can\u2019t help laughing. I\u2019ve known Freya since we were both seven years old and in boarding school together. On the first night she told me her family were circus performers and she knew how to ride an elephant and walk the tightrope. For a whole term I believed her stories about the exotic circus life. Until her parents arrived that first Christmas to pick her up and turned out to be a pair of accountants from Staines. Even then she was unabashed and said she\u2019d lied to cover up the real truth\u2014which was that they were spies.</p><p>She\u2019s taller than me, with bright blue eyes and freckled skin, permanently tanned from her travels. Right now her skin is peeling slightly on her nose, and she has a new silver earring, right at the top of her ear. She has the whitest, most crooked teeth I\u2019ve ever seen, and when she laughs, one corner of her top lip rises.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to gate-crash your birthday dinner.\u201d Freya focuses on the restaurant in suspicion. \u201cBut I thought I was late. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d I hesitate. \u201cThe thing was ... Mum and Daniel ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft early?\u201d As she peers at me, Freya\u2019s expression changes to one of horror. \u201cDidn\u2019t turn up? Jesus Christ, the bastards. Couldn\u2019t they just for once put you first instead of their frigging\u2014\u201d She stops her tirade; she knows I\u2019ve heard it all before. \u201cSorry. I know. They\u2019re your family. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Freya and my mum don\u2019t exactly get on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I say, shrugging ruefully. \u201cReally. I\u2019ve got a pile of work to get through anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork?\u201d Freya looks appalled. \u201cNow? Are you serious? Doesn\u2019t it ever stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re busy at the moment. It\u2019s just a blip\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a blip! There\u2019s always a crisis! Every year you put off doing anything fun\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery year you tell me work will get better soon. But it never does!\u201d Her eyes are filled with concern. \u201cSamantha ... what happened to your life?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent for a moment, cars roaring along behind me on the street. To be honest, I can\u2019t remember what my life used to be like. As I cast my mind back over the years, I recall the holiday I had with Freya in Italy, the summer after A Levels, when we were both eighteen. My last window of real freedom. Since then work has gradually, almost imperceptibly, taken over.</p><p>\u201cI want to be a partner of Carter Spink,\u201d I say at last. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want. You have to make ... sacrifices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens when you make partner?\u201d she persists. \u201cDoes it get easier?\u201d</p> <p>The truth is, I haven\u2019t thought beyond making partner. It\u2019s like a dream. Like a shiny ball in the sky.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-nine years old, for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d Freya gestures with a bony, silver-ringed hand. \u201cYou should be able to do something spontaneous once in a while. You should be seeing the world!\u201d She grabs my arm. \u201cSamantha, come to India. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I give a startled laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t come to India!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a month off. Why not? They\u2019re not going to fire you. Come to the airport, we\u2019ll get you a ticket....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreya, you\u2019re crazy. Seriously.\u201d I squeeze her arm. \u201cI love you\u2014but you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Freya\u2019s grip on my arm loosens.</p> <p>\u201cSame,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy, but I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her mobile starts ringing, but she ignores it. Instead, she rummages in her embroidered bag. At last she produces a tiny, intricately worked silver perfume bottle haphazardly wrapped in a piece of purple shot silk, which is already falling off.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She thrusts it at me.</p><p>\u201cFreya.\u201d I turn it over in my fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like it.\u201d She pulls her mobile out of her pocket. \u201cHi!\u201d she says impatiently into it. \u201cLook, Lord, I\u2019ll be there, OK?\u201d</p><p>Freya\u2019s husband\u2019s full name is Lord Andrew Edgerly. Freya\u2019s nickname for him started as a joke and stuck. They met five years ago on a kibbutz and got married in Las Vegas. He\u2019s tall and phlegmatic and keeps Freya on track during her wilder moments. He\u2019s also amazingly witty once you get past the deadpan exterior. Technically, their marriage makes her Lady Edgerly\u2014but her family can\u2019t quite get their heads round this idea. Nor can the Edgerlys.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming. Thanks for this.\u201d I hug her. \u201cHave a fabulous time in India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d Freya is climbing back into her taxi. \u201cAnd if you want to come out, just let me know. Invent a family emergency ... anything. Give them my number. I\u2019ll cover for you. Whatever your story is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d I say, laughing, and give her a little push. \u201cGo to India.\u201d</p><p>The door slams, and she sticks her head out the window.</p><p>\u201cSam ... good luck for tomorrow.\u201d She seizes my hand, suddenly serious. \u201cIf it\u2019s really what you want\u2014then I hope you get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I want more than anything else.\u201d As I look at my oldest friend, all my calculated nonchalance disappears. \u201cFreya ... I can\u2019t tell you how much I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it. I know you will.\u201d She kisses my hand, then waves good-bye. \u201cAnd don\u2019t go back to the office! Promise!\u201d she shouts over the roar of her taxi.</p><p>\u201cOK! I promise!\u201d I yell back. I wait until her cab has disappeared, then stick my hand out for another.</p><p>\u201cCarter Spink, please,\u201d I say as it pulls up.</p><p>I was crossing my fingers. Of course I\u2019m going back to the office.</p><p>I arrive home at eleven o\u2019clock, exhausted and brain-dead, having got through only about half of Ketterman\u2019s file. Bloody Ketterman, I\u2019m thinking, as I push open the main front door of the 1930s-mansion block where I live. Bloody Ketterman. Bloody ... bloody ...</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Samantha.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nearly jump a mile. It\u2019s Ketterman. Right there, standing in front of the lifts, holding a bulging briefcase. For an instant I\u2019m transfixed in horror. What\u2019s he doing here?</p><p>\u201cSomeone told me you lived here.\u201d His eyes glint through his spectacles. \u201cI\u2019ve bought number thirty-two as a pied-\u00e0-terre. We\u2019ll be neighbors during the week.\u201d</p><p>Please tell me this is not happening. He lives here?</p><p>\u201cEr ... welcome to the building!\u201d I say, trying as hard as I can to sound like I mean it. The lift doors open and we both get in.</p> <p>Number 32. That means he\u2019s only two floors above me. I feel like my headmaster has moved in. Why did he have to choose this building?</p><p>The elevator rises in silence. I feel more and more uncomfortable. Should I attempt small talk? Some light, neighborly chitchat?</p><p>\u201cI made some headway on that file you gave me,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says curtly, and nods.</p><p>So much for the small talk. I should just cut to the big stuff.</p> <p>Am I going to become a partner tomorrow?</p><p>\u201cWell ... good night,\u201d I say awkwardly as I leave the lift.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Samantha.\u201d</p><p>The lift doors close and I emit a silent scream. I cannot live in the same building as Ketterman. I\u2019m going to have to move.</p><p>I\u2019m about to put my key in the lock when the door to the opposite flat opens a crack.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d</p> <p>As if I haven\u2019t had enough this evening. It\u2019s Mrs. Farley, my neighbor. She has silver hair and gold-rimmed spectacles and an insatiable interest in my life. But she is very kind and takes in parcels for me, so I try to tolerate her intrusiveness.</p><p>\u201cAnother delivery arrived for you, dear,\u201d she says. \u201cDry cleaning this time. I\u2019ll just fetch it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say gratefully, swinging my door open. A small pile of junk leaflets is sitting on the doormat and I sweep them aside, onto the bigger pile building up at the side of my hallway. I\u2019m planning to recycle them when I get a moment. It\u2019s on my list.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late home again.\u201d Mrs. Farley is at my side, holding a pile of polythene-covered shirts. \u201cYou girls are so busy!\u201d She clicks her tongue. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been home before eleven this week!\u201d</p><p>This is what I mean by an insatiable interest. She probably has all my details logged somewhere in a little book.</p><p>\u201cThanks very much.\u201d I reach for my dry cleaning, but to my horror Mrs. Farley pushes past me into the flat, exclaiming, \u201cI\u2019ll carry it in for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... excuse the ... er ... mess,\u201d I say as she squeezes past a pile of pictures propped against the wall. \u201cI keep meaning to put those up....\u201d</p><p>I steer her hastily into the kitchen, away from the pile of take-away menus on the hall table. Then I wish I hadn\u2019t. On the kitchen counter is a stack of old tins and packets, together with a note from my new cleaner, all in capitals:</p> <p>DEAR SAMANTHA</p><p>1. ALL YOUR FOOD IS PAST ITS SELL-BY DATES. SHOULD I THROW AWAY?</p><p>2. DO YOU HAVE ANY CLEANING MATERIALS, E.G. BLEACH? COULD NOT FIND ANY.</p><p>3. ARE YOU COLLECTING CHINESE FOOD CARTONS FOR ANY REASON? DID NOT THROW THEM AWAY, JUST IN CASE.</p><p>YOUR CLEANER JOANNE</p><p>I can see Mrs. Farley reading the note. I can practically hear the clucking going on in her head. Last month she gave me a little lecture on did I have a slow cooker, because all you needed to do was put in your chicken and vegetables in the morning and it didn\u2019t take five minutes to slice a carrot, did it?</p><p>I really wouldn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cSo ... thanks.\u201d I hastily take the dry cleaning from Mrs. Farley and dump it on the hob, then usher her out to the door, aware of her swiveling, inquisitive eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s really kind of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble! Not wishing to interfere, dear, but you know, you could wash your cotton blouses very well at home and save on all that money.\u201d</p><p>I look at her blankly. If I did that I\u2019d have to dry them. And iron them.</p><p>\u201cAnd I did just happen to notice that one of them came back missing a button,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe pink and white stripe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say. \u201cWell ... that\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll send it back. They won\u2019t charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can pop a button on yourself, dear!\u201d Mrs. Farley is shocked. \u201cIt won\u2019t take you two minutes. You must have a spare button in your workbox?\u201d</p><p>My what?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a workbox,\u201d I explain as politely as I can. \u201cI don\u2019t really do sewing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can sew a simple button on, surely!\u201d she exclaims. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, a bit rankled at her expression. \u201cBut it\u2019s no problem. I\u2019ll send it back to the dry cleaners.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley is appalled. \u201cYou can\u2019t sew a button on? Your mother never taught you?\u201d</p><p>I stifle a laugh at the thought of my mother sewing on a button. \u201cEr ... no. She didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my day,\u201d says Mrs. Farley, shaking her head, \u201call well-educated girls were taught how to sew on a button, darn a sock, and turn a collar.\u201d</p> <p>None of this means anything to me. Turn a collar. It\u2019s gibberish.</p><p>\u201cWell, in my day ... we weren\u2019t,\u201d I reply politely. \u201cWe were taught to study for our exams and get a career worth having. We were taught to have opinions. We were taught to use our brains,\u201d I can\u2019t resist adding.</p><p>Mrs. Farley doesn\u2019t seem impressed. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d she says at last, and pats me sympathetically.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to keep my temper, but I\u2019ve worked for hours, I\u2019ve had a nonexistent birthday, I feel bone-tired and hungry, Ketterman is living two floors above me\u2014and now this old woman\u2019s telling me to sew on a button?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a shame,\u201d I say tightly.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, dear,\u201d says Mrs. Farley in pacifying tones, and heads across the hallway to her flat.</p><p>Somehow this goads me even more.</p><p>\u201cHow is it a shame?\u201d I demand, stepping out of my doorway. \u201cHow? OK, maybe I can\u2019t sew on a button. But I can restructure a corporate finance agreement and save my client thirty million pounds. That\u2019s what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley regards me from her doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d she repeats, as though she didn\u2019t even hear me. \u201cGood night, dear.\u201d She closes the door and I emit a squeal of exasperation.</p><p>\u201cDid you never hear of feminism?\u201d I cry at her door.</p><p>But there\u2019s no answer.</p> <p>Crossly, I retreat into my own flat, close the door, and pick up the phone. I speed-dial the local wood-fired pizza company and order my usual: a capricciosa and a bag of Kettle Chips. I pour myself a glass of wine out of the fridge, then head back into the sitting room and flick on the telly.</p><p>A workbox. What else does she think I should have? A pair of knitting needles? A loom?</p><p>I sink down onto the sofa with the remote and flick through the TV channels, peering vaguely at the images. News ... a French film ... some animal documentary ...</p><p>Hang on. I stop flicking, drop the remote onto the sofa, and settle back on the cushions.</p><p>The Waltons. On some obscure syndicated channel. I have not seen The Waltons for years.</p><p>Ultimate comfort viewing. Just what I need.</p><p>On the screen the whole family\u2019s gathered round the table; Grandma\u2019s saying grace.</p><p>I take a swig of wine and feel myself start to unwind. I\u2019ve always secretly loved The Waltons, ever since I was a kid. I used to sit in the darkness when everyone else was out and pretend I lived on Walton\u2019s Mountain too.</p> <p>And now it\u2019s the last scene of all, the one I always waited for: the Walton house in darkness. Lights twinkling; crickets chirping. John Boy talking in voice-over. A whole huge houseful of people who love one another. I hug my knees and look wistfully at the screen as the familiar music tinkles to its close.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Elizabeth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Grandma,\u201d I reply aloud. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone to hear.</p><p>\u201cNight, Mary Ellen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, John Boy,\u201d I say in unison with Mary Ellen.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>I wake at six a.m. with my heart pounding, half on my feet, scrabbling for a pen, and saying out loud, \u201cWhat? What?\u201d</p><p>Which is pretty much how I always wake up. I think nervy sleep runs in the family or something. Last Christmas at Mum\u2019s house I crept into the kitchen at about three a.m. for a drink of water\u2014to find Mum in her dressing gown reading a court report, and Daniel swigging a Xanax as he checked the Hang Seng Index on TV.</p><p>I totter into the bathroom and stare at my pale reflection. This is it. All the work, all the studying, all the late nights ... it\u2019s all been for this day.</p><p>Partner. Or not Partner.</p><p>Oh, God. Stop it. Don\u2019t think about it. I head into the kitchen and open the fridge. Dammit. I\u2019m out of milk.</p><p>And coffee.</p><p>I must find myself a food-delivery company. And a milkman. I reach for a Biro and scrawl 47. Food delivery/milkman? at the bottom of my TO DO list.</p><p>My TO DO list is written on a piece of paper pinned up on the wall and is a useful reminder of things I\u2019m intending to do. It\u2019s yellowing a bit now, actually\u2014and the ink at the top of the list has become so faint I can barely read it. But it\u2019s a good way to keep myself organized. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I should really cross off some of the early entries, it occurs to me. I mean, the original list dates from when I first moved into my flat, three years ago. I must have done some of this stuff by now. I pick up a pen and squint at the first few faded entries.</p><p>1. Find milkman</p><p>2. Food delivery\u2014organize?</p><p>3. How switch on oven?</p> <p>Oh. Right.</p><p>Well, I really am going to get all this delivery stuff organized. At the weekend. And I\u2019ll get to grips with the oven. I\u2019ll read the manual and everything.</p><p>I scan quickly down to newer entries, around two years old.</p><p>16. Sort out milkman</p><p>17. Have friends over?</p> <p>18. Take up hobby??</p><p>The thing is, I am meaning to have some friends over. And take up a hobby. When work is less busy.</p><p>I look down to even later entries\u2014maybe a year old\u2014where the ink is still blue.</p><p>41. Go on holiday?</p><p>42. Give dinner party?</p><p>43. MILKMAN??</p> <p>I stare at the list in slight frustration. How can I have done nothing on my list? Crossly, I throw my pen down and turn on the kettle, resisting the temptation to rip the list into bits.</p><p>The kettle has come to a boil and I make myself a cup of weird herbal tea I was once given by a client. I reach for an apple from the fruit bowl\u2014only to discover it\u2019s gone all moldy. With a shudder, I throw the whole lot into the bin and nibble a few Shreddies out of the packet.</p><p>The truth is, I don\u2019t care about the list. There\u2019s only one thing I care about.</p><p>I arrive at the office determined not to acknowledge this is any kind of special day. I\u2019ll just keep my head down and get on with my work. But as I travel up in the lift, three people murmur \u201cGood luck,\u201d and walking along the corridor a guy from Tax grasps me meaningfully on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBest of luck, Samantha.\u201d</p><p>How does he know my name?</p><p>I head hurriedly into my office and close the door, trying to ignore the fact that through the glass partition I can see people talking in the corridor and glancing in my direction.</p><p>I really shouldn\u2019t have come in today. I should have feigned a life-threatening illness.</p> <p>Anyway. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just start on some work, like any other day. I open Ketterman\u2019s file, find my place, and start reading through a document that codifies a five-year-old share transfer.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d</p><p>I look up. Guy is at my door, holding two coffees. He puts one down on my desk.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, turning a page in a businesslike manner. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just ... normal. In fact, I don\u2019t know what all the fuss is.\u201d</p><p>Guy\u2019s amused expression is flustering me slightly. I flip over another page to prove my point\u2014and somehow knock the entire file to the floor.</p><p>Thank God for paper clips.</p><p>Red-faced, I shove all the papers back inside the file and take a sip of coffee.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Guy nods gravely. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re not nervous or jumpy or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, refusing to take the bait. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d He lifts his coffee cup as though toasting me, then walks off. I look at my watch.</p><p>Only eight fifty-three. The partners\u2019 decision meeting starts in seven minutes. I\u2019m not sure I can bear this.</p><p>Somehow I get through the morning. I finish up Ketterman\u2019s file and make a start at my report. I\u2019m halfway through the third paragraph when Guy appears at my office door again.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say without looking up. \u201cI\u2019m fine, OK? And I haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d</p><p>Guy doesn\u2019t reply.</p><p>At last I lift my head. He\u2019s right in front of my desk, looking down at me with the strangest expression, as if affection and pride and excitement are all mixed together under his poker-straight face.</p><p>\u201cI should not be doing this,\u201d he murmurs, then leans in closer. \u201cYou did it, Samantha. You\u2019re a partner. You\u2019ll hear officially in an hour.\u201d</p><p>For an instant I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear it from me, OK?\u201d Guy\u2019s face creases briefly in a smile. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>I made it. I made it.</p><p>\u201cThanks ...\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later. Congratulate you properly.\u201d He turns and strides away, and I\u2019m left staring unseeingly at my computer.</p><p>I made partner.</p><p>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my GOD!</p><p>I\u2019m feeling a terrible urge to leap to my feet and cry out \u201cYES!\u201d How do I survive an hour? How can I just sit here calmly? I can\u2019t possibly concentrate on Ketterman\u2019s report. It isn\u2019t due until tomorrow, anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shove the file away from me\u2014and a landslide of papers falls on the floor on the other side. As I gather them up I find myself looking anew at the disorderly heap of papers and files, at the teetering pile of books on my computer terminal.</p><p>Ketterman\u2019s right. It is a bit of a disgrace. It doesn\u2019t look like a partner\u2019s desk.</p><p>I\u2019ll tidy it up. This is the perfect way to spend an hour. 12:06\u20131:06: office administration. We even have a code for it on the computer time sheet.</p><p>I had forgotten how much I detest tidying.</p> <p>All sorts of things are turning up as I sift through the mess on my desk. Company letters ... contracts that should have gone to Maggie for filing ... old invitations ... memos ... a Pilates pamphlet ... a CD that I bought three months ago and thought I\u2019d lost ... last year\u2019s Christmas card from Arnold, which depicts him in a woolly reindeer costume ... I smile at the sight, and put it into the things to find a place for pile.</p><p>There are tombstones too\u2014the engraved, mounted pieces of Lucite we get at the end of a big deal. And ... oh, God, half a Snickers bar I obviously didn\u2019t finish eating at one time or another. I dump it in the bin and turn with a sigh to another pile of papers.</p><p>They shouldn\u2019t give us such big desks. I can\u2019t believe how much stuff is on here.</p><p>Partner! shoots through my mind, like a glittering firework. PARTNER!</p><p>Stop it, I instruct myself sternly. Concentrate on the task at hand. As I pull out an old copy of The Lawyer and wonder why on earth I\u2019m keeping it, some paper-clipped documents fall to the floor. I reach for them and run my gaze down the front page, already reaching for the next thing. It\u2019s a memo from Arnold.</p> <p>Re Third Union Bank.</p><p>Please find attached debenture for Glazerbrooks Ltd. Please attend to registration at Companies House.</p><p>I peer at it without great interest. Third Union Bank is Arnold\u2019s client, and I\u2019ve only dealt with them once. The bank has agreed to loan \u00a350 million to Glazerbrooks, a big building-materials company, and all I have to do is register the security document within twenty-one days at Companies House. It\u2019s just another of the mundane jobs that partners are always dumping on my desk. Well, not anymore, I think with a surge of determination. In fact, I think I\u2019ll delegate this to someone else, right now. I glance automatically at the date.</p><p>Then I look again. The security document is dated May 26th.</p><p>Five weeks ago? That can\u2019t be right.</p><p>Puzzled, I flip quickly through the papers, looking to see if there\u2019s been a typo. There must be a typo\u2014but the date is consistent throughout. May 26th.</p> <p>May 26th?</p><p>I sit, frozen, staring at the document. Has this thing been on my desk for five weeks?</p><p>But ... it can\u2019t. I mean ... it couldn\u2019t. That would mean\u2014</p><p>It would mean I\u2019ve missed the deadline.</p><p>I can\u2019t have made such a basic mistake. I cannot possibly have failed to register a charge before the deadline. I always register charges before the deadline.</p><p>I close my eyes and try to remain calm. It\u2019s the excitement of being partner. It\u2019s addled my brain. OK. Let\u2019s look at this again, carefully.</p><p>But the memo says exactly the same thing as before. Attend to registration. Dated May 26th. Which would mean I\u2019ve exposed Third Union Bank to an unsecured loan. Which would mean I\u2019ve made about the most elementary mistake a lawyer can make.</p><p>There\u2019s a kind of iciness about my spine. I\u2019m trying desperately to remember if Arnold said anything about the deal to me. I can\u2019t even remember him mentioning it. But then\u2014why would he mention a simple loan agreement? We do loan agreements in our sleep. He would have assumed I\u2019d carried out his instructions. He would have trusted me.</p> <p>Oh, Jesus.</p><p>I leaf through the pages again, searching desperately for some loophole. Some miracle clause that will have me exclaiming \u201cOh, of course!\u201d in relief. But of course it\u2019s not there.</p><p>How could this have happened? Did I even notice this? Did I sweep it aside, meaning to do it later?</p><p>What am I going to do? A wall of panic hits me as I take in the consequences. Third Union Bank has lent Glazerbrooks \u00a350 million. Without the charge being registered, this loan\u2014this multimillion-pound loan\u2014is unsecured. If Glazerbrooks went bust tomorrow, Third Union Bank would go to the back of the queue of creditors. And probably end up with nothing.</p><p>\u201cSamantha!\u201d says Maggie at the door. Instinctively I plant my hand over the memo even though she wouldn\u2019t realize the significance, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI just heard!\u201d she says in a stage whisper. \u201cGuy let it slip! Congratulations!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... thanks!\u201d Somehow I force my mouth into a smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting a cup of tea.

I\u2019m trying to keep calm, but inside is a great well of terror. I have to face it. I\u2019ve made a mistake.</p><p>I have made a mistake.</p> <p>What am I going to do? I can\u2019t think straight\u2014</p><p>Then suddenly Guy\u2019s words from yesterday ring in my ears, and I feel an almost painful flood of relief. A mistake isn\u2019t a mistake unless it can\u2019t be put right.</p><p>Yes. The point is, I can put this right. I can still register a charge.</p><p>The process will be excruciating. I\u2019ll have to tell the bank what I\u2019ve done\u2014and Glazerbrooks\u2014and Arnold\u2014and Ketterman. I\u2019ll have to have new documentation drawn up. And, worst of all, live with everyone knowing I\u2019ve made the kind of stupid, thoughtless error a trainee would make.</p><p>It might mean an end to my partnership. I feel sick\u2014but there\u2019s no other option. I have to put the situation right.</p> <p>Quickly I log on to the Companies House Web site and enter a search for Glazerbrooks. As long as no other charges have been registered against Glazerbrooks in the meantime, it will all come to the same thing....</p><p>I stare at the page in disbelief.</p><p>No.</p><p>It can\u2019t be.</p><p>There\u2019s a new debenture in Glazerbrooks\u2019 charge register, securing \u00a350 million owed to some company called BLLC Holdings. It was registered last week. Third Union Bank has been bumped down the creditors\u2019 queue.</p><p>My mind is helter-skeltering. This isn\u2019t good. It\u2019s not good. I have to talk to someone quickly. I have to do something about this now, before any more charges are made. I have to ... to tell Arnold.</p> <p>Just the thought paralyzes me with horror.</p><p>I can\u2019t do it. I just can\u2019t go out and announce I\u2019ve made the most basic, elementary error and put \u00a350 million of our client\u2019s money at risk. What I\u2019ll do is ... is start sorting out the mess first, before I tell anyone here. Have the damage limitation under way. Yes. I\u2019ll call the bank first. The sooner they know, the better\u2014</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I practically leap out of my chair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nervy today!\u201d Maggie laughs and comes toward the desk with a cup of tea. \u201cFeeling on top of the world?\u201d</p><p>For an instant I honestly have no idea what she\u2019s talking about. My world has been reduced to me and my mistake and what I\u2019m going to do about it.</p><p>\u201cOh! Right. Yes!\u201d I try to grin back and surreptitiously wipe my damp hands on a tissue.</p><p>\u201cI bet you haven\u2019t come down off your high yet!\u201d She leans against the filing cabinet. \u201cI\u2019ve got some champagne in the fridge, all ready....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr ... great! Actually, Maggie, I\u2019ve really got to get on....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looks hurt. \u201cWell, OK. I\u2019ll leave you.\u201d</p><p>As she walks out I can see indignation in the set of her shoulders. She probably thinks I\u2019m a total cow. But every minute is another minute of risk. I have to call the bank. Immediately.</p><p>I search through the attached contact sheet and find the name and number of our contact at Third Union. Charles Conway.</p><p>This is the man I have to call. This is the man whose day I have to disturb and admit that I\u2019ve totally messed up. With trembling hands I pick up the phone. I feel as though I\u2019m psyching myself up to dive into a noxious swamp.</p><p>For a few moments I just sit there, staring at the keypad, willing myself to punch in the number. At last, I reach out and dial. As it rings, my heart begins to pound.</p><p>\u201cCharles Conway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, trying to keep my voice steady. \u201cIt\u2019s Samantha Sweeting from Carter Spink. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Samantha.\u201d He sounds friendly enough. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was phoning on a ... a technical matter. It\u2019s about ...\u201d I can hardly bear to say it. \u201cGlazerbrooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve heard about that,\u201d says Charles Conway. \u201cNews travels fast.\u201d</p><p>The room seems to shrink.</p><p>\u201cHeard ... what?\u201d My voice is higher than I\u2019d like. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!

I can hear him tapping at a keyboard in the background, totally unconcerned. \u201cYou might want to double-check that loan security.\u201d</p><p>For a few moments I can\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say at last, my voice hoarse. \u201cThank you.\u201d I put down the receiver, shaking all over.</p> <p>I\u2019ve fucked up.</p><p>I have fucked up so big, I can\u2019t even ...</p><p>Barely knowing what I\u2019m doing, I push back my chair. I have to get out.</p><p>Five</p><p>I walk through reception on autopilot. Out onto the sunny lunchtime street, one foot in front of the other, just another office worker among the midday crowds.</p> <p>Except I\u2019m different. I\u2019ve just lost my client \u00a350 million.</p><p>Fifty million. The amount is like a drumbeat in my head.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand how it happened. I don\u2019t understand. My mind keeps turning it over. Over and over, obsessively. How could I have not seen ... how could I have overlooked ... It must have been put on my desk, then covered up with something else. A file, a pile of contracts, a cup of coffee.</p><p>One mistake. The only mistake I\u2019ve ever made. I want to wake up and this will all be a bad dream, it happened to someone else, it\u2019s a story I\u2019m listening to in the pub, agog, thanking my lucky stars it wasn\u2019t me.... But it is me.</p><p>My career is over. The last person at Carter Spink who made a mistake like this was Ted Stephens, who lost a client \u00a310 million in 1983. He was fired on the spot. And I\u2019ve lost five times that.</p><p>My chest feels tight; I feel like I\u2019m being smothered. I think I could be having a panic attack. I sit down on a bench set against some railings and wait to feel better.</p> <p>OK, I\u2019m not feeling better. I\u2019m feeling worse.</p><p>Suddenly I jump in terror as my mobile phone vibrates in my pocket. I pull it out and look at the caller ID. It\u2019s Guy.</p><p>I can\u2019t talk to him. I can\u2019t talk to anybody. Not right now.</p><p>A moment later, the phone tells me a message has been left. I lift the phone to my ear and press 1 to listen.</p><p>\u201cSamantha!\u201d Guy sounds cheery. \u201cWhere are you? We\u2019re all waiting with the champagne to make the big partnership announcement!\u201d</p><p>Partnership. I want to burst into tears. But ... I can\u2019t. This mistake is too big for tears. I thrust my phone in my pocket and get to my feet again. I begin to walk faster and faster, weaving through the pedestrians. My head is pounding and I have no idea where I\u2019m going.</p><p>I walk for what seems like hours, my head in a daze, my feet moving blindly. The sun is beating down, and the pavements are dusty, and after a while my head starts to throb. At some point my mobile starts to vibrate again, but I ignore it.</p><p>At last, when my legs are starting to ache, I slow down and come to a halt. My mouth is dry; I\u2019m totally dehydrated. I need some water. I look up, trying to get my bearings. Somehow I seem to have reached Paddington Station, of all places.</p> <p>Numbly, I turn my steps toward the entrance and walk inside. The place is noisy and crowded with travelers. The fluo-rescent lights and air-conditioning and the blaring announcements make me flinch. As I\u2019m making my way to a kiosk selling bottled water, my mobile vibrates again. I pull it out and look at the display. I have fifteen missed calls and another message from Guy. He left it about twenty minutes ago.</p><p>I hesitate, my heart beating with nerves, then press 1 to listen to it.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Samantha, what happened?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t sound cheery anymore, he sounds totally stressed. I feel prickles of dread all over my body.</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cOK? We know about Third Union Bank. Charles Conway called up. Then Ketterman found the paperwork on your desk. You have to come back to the office. Now. Call me back.\u201d</p><p>He rings off but I don\u2019t move. I\u2019m paralyzed with fright.</p><p>They know. They all know.</p><p>The black spots are dancing in front of my eyes again. Nausea is rising up inside me. The entire staff of Carter Spink knows I messed up. People will be calling each other. E-mailing the news in horrified glee. Did you hear ...</p><p>As I\u2019m standing there, something catches the corner of my eye. A familiar face is just visible through the crowd. I turn my head and squint at the man, trying to place him\u2014then feel a fresh jolt of horror.</p><p>It\u2019s Greg Parker, one of the senior partners. He\u2019s been in the States, I remember. He\u2019ll have just got in on the Heathrow Express. Now he\u2019s striding along the concourse in his expensive suit, holding his mobile phone. His brows are knitted together and he looks concerned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo where is she?\u201d His voice travels across the concourse.</p><p>Panic hits me like a lightning bolt. I have to get out of his line of vision. I have to hide. Now. I edge behind a vast woman in a beige mac and try to cower down so I\u2019m hidden. But she keeps wandering about, and I keep having to shuffle along with her.</p><p>\u201cDid you want something?\u201d She suddenly turns.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cI\u2019m ... er ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, leave me alone!\u201d She scowls and stalks off toward Costa Coffee. I\u2019m totally exposed in the middle of the concourse. Greg Parker is about fifty yards away, still talking on his mobile phone.</p><p>If I move, he\u2019ll see me. If I stay still ... he\u2019ll see me.</p><p>Suddenly the electronic Departures display board renews itself with fresh train information. A crowd of waiting travelers grab their bags and newspapers and head toward platform 9.</p><p>Without thinking twice, I join the throng, hidden in their midst as we sweep through the open barriers and onto the train. It pulls out of the station and I sink into a seat, opposite a family all wearing London Zoo T-shirts. They smile at me\u2014and somehow I manage to smile back.</p><p>\u201cRefreshments?\u201d A wizened man pushing a trolley appears in the carriage and beams at me. \u201cHot and cold sandwiches, teas and coffees, soft drinks, alcoholic beverages?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe last, please.\u201d I try not to sound too desperate. \u201cA double. Of ... anything.\u201d</p><p>No one comes to check my ticket. No one bothers me. The train seems to be some sort of express. Suburbs turn into fields, and the train is still rattling along. I\u2019ve drunk three small bottles of gin, mixed with orange juice, tomato juice, and a chocolate yogurt drink. The chunk of icy fright in my stomach has thawed and I feel weirdly distanced from everything around me.</p><p>I have made the biggest mistake of my career. I will have lost my job. I will never be a partner.</p><p>One stupid mistake.</p><p>The London Zoo family have opened packets of crisps and offered me one and invited me to join in their game of Travel Scrabble. The mother even asked me if I was traveling for business or fun?</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bring myself to answer.</p> <p>My heart rate has gradually subsided, but I have a bad, throbbing headache. I\u2019m sitting with a hand over one eye, trying to block out the light.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen.\u201d The conductor is crackling over the loudspeaker. \u201cUnfortunately ... rail works ... alternative transport ...\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t follow what he\u2019s saying. I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m headed. I\u2019ll just wait for the next stop, get out of the train, and take it from there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how you spell raisin,\u201d London Zoo mother is saying to one of the children, when the train suddenly starts to slow down. I look up to see that we\u2019re pulling into a station. Lower Ebury. People are gathering up their bags and getting off.</p><p>Like an automaton I get up too. I follow the London Zoo family off the train and out of a tiny, twee country station. There\u2019s a pub called The Bell across the road, which bends round in both directions, and I can glimpse fields in the distance. There\u2019s a coach waiting, and all the passengers from the train are boarding.</p><p>London Zoo mother has turned round and is gesturing at me. \u201cYou need to come this way,\u201d she says helpfully. \u201cIf you want the bus to Gloucester?\u201d</p><p>The thought of getting on a coach makes me want to heave. I don\u2019t want the bus to anywhere. I just want an aspirin. My head feels like it\u2019s about to split open.</p><p>\u201cEr ... no, thanks. I\u2019m fine here.\u201d Before she can say anything else, I start walking down the road.</p> <p>I have no idea where I am. None.</p><p>Inside my pocket, my phone suddenly vibrates. It\u2019s Guy. Again. This must be the thirtieth time he\u2019s rung. And every time he\u2019s left a message telling me to call him back, asking if I\u2019ve got his e-mails.</p><p>I haven\u2019t got any of his e-mails. I was so freaked out, I left my BlackBerry on my desk. My phone is all I have. It vibrates again and I stare at it for a few moments. I can\u2019t ignore him forever. My stomach clenched with nerves, I lift it to my ear and press talk.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d My voice is scratchy. \u201cIt\u2019s ... it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d His incredulous voice blasts down the line. \u201cIs that you? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I had to get away. I ... I went into shock....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha, I don\u2019t know if you got my messages. But ...\u201d He hesitates. \u201cEveryone knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I lean against an old crumbling wall and squeeze my eyes shut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d He sounds as shocked as I feel. \u201cHow the hell did you make a simple error like that?

The firm\u2019s professional indemnity insurance. I\u2019m suddenly gripped by an almost exhilarating hope. If the insurers pay up without making a fuss, maybe things won\u2019t be as bad as I thought....</p><p>But even as I feel my spirits lift I know I\u2019m like some traveler seeing the mirage through the haze. Insurers never cough up the whole amount. Sometimes they don\u2019t cough up anything. Sometimes they pay up but raise their premiums to unfeasible levels.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the insurers say? Will they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t said anything yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I wipe my sweaty face, screwing up my courage to ask the next question. \u201cAnd what about ... me?\u201d</p><p>Guy is silent.</p><p>There\u2019s my answer. I open my eyes to see two small boys on bikes staring at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, isn\u2019t it? My career\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know that. Listen, Samantha, you\u2019re freaked out. It\u2019s natural. But you can\u2019t hide. You have to come back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Ketterman\u2019s face looms in my mind. And what will Arnold think of me now? \u201cI can\u2019t face everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSamantha, be rational!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need some time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaman\u2014\u201d I flip my phone shut.</p><p>I feel a bit faint. I must get some water. But I can\u2019t face going into a noisy pub, and I can\u2019t see any shops.</p><p>I totter along the road until I reach a pair of tall carved pillars decorated with lions. Here\u2019s a house. I\u2019ll ring the bell and ask for some aspirin and a glass of water. And ask if there\u2019s a hotel nearby.</p><p>I push open the elaborate wrought-iron gate and crunch over the gravel toward the heavy oak front door. It\u2019s a rather grand old house made out of honey-colored stone, set well back from the road, with steep gables and tall chimneys and two Porsches on the drive. I raise a hand and tug the bellpull.</p><p>There\u2019s silence. The whole house seems dead. I\u2019m about to give up and trudge back down the drive\u2014when all of a sudden the door swings open.</p><p>Before me stands a woman with blond lacquered hair to her shoulders and long, dangly earrings. She has lots of makeup, long silk trousers in a weird shade of peach, a cigarette in one hand and a cocktail in the other.</p> <p>\u201cHello.\u201d She drags on her cigarette and looks at me a bit suspiciously. \u201cAre you from the agency?\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>I have no idea what this woman\u2019s talking about. My head\u2019s hurting so much, I can barely look at her, let alone take in what she\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d She peers at me. \u201cYou look terrible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a rather bad headache,\u201d I manage. \u201cCould I possibly have a glass of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Come in!\u201d She waves her cigarette in my face and beckons me into a huge, impressive hall with a vaulted ceiling. There\u2019s a circular oak table in the middle, bearing a vase of huge lilies, and a medieval-style bench at the side. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to see the house, anyway. Eddie?\u201d Her voice rises to a shriek. \u201cEddie, another one\u2019s here! I\u2019m Trish Geiger,\u201d she adds to me. \u201cYou may call me Mrs. Geiger. This way ...\u201d</p><p>She leads me down a short passage into a luxurious maple kitchen and tries a few drawers, apparently at random, before crying \u201cAha!\u201d and pulling out a plastic box. She opens it to reveal about fifty assorted bottles of pain-relief tablets, vitamins, and bottles of something called Hollywood Skin Glow Supplement, and starts rootling about with her lacquered fingernails.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got aspirin ... paracetamol ... ibuprofen ... very mild Valium ...\u201d She holds up a livid red pill. \u201cThis one\u2019s from America,\u201d she says brightly. \u201cIllegal in this country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... lovely.\u201d</p><p>She hands me three green tablets and after a few attempts locates a cupboard full of glasses. \u201cHere we are. Migraine relief. They\u2019ll zap any headache. Eddie!\u201d She runs me some iced water from the fridge. \u201cDrink that up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, swallowing the tablets down with a wince. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful. My head\u2019s just so painful. I can barely think straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour English is very good.\u201d She gives me a close, appraising look. \u201cVery good indeed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, thrown. \u201cRight. Well, I\u2019m English. That\u2019s ... you know, probably why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re English?\u201d Trish Geiger seems galvanized by this news. \u201cWell! Come and sit down. Those\u2019ll kick in, in a minute. If they don\u2019t we\u2019ll get you some more.\u201d</p> <p>She sweeps me out of the kitchen and back through the hall. \u201cThis is the drawing room,\u201d she says, pausing by a door. She gestures around the large, grand room, dropping ash on the carpet. It\u2019s decorated with what look like antiques, several big velvet sofas, and lots of lamps and ornaments everywhere. \u201cAs you\u2019ll see, there\u2019s quite a lot of hoovering ... dusting ... silver to be kept clean ...\u201d She looks at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod. I have no idea why this woman is telling me about her housework, but she seems to be waiting for a reply.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful table,\u201d I offer at last, gesturing at a shiny mahogany side table.</p><p>\u201cIt needs polishing.\u201d Her eyes narrow. \u201cRegularly. I do notice these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I nod, bemused.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go in here ...\u201d She\u2019s leading me through another huge, grand room into an airy glassed conservatory furnished with opulent teak sun-loungers, frondy plants, and a well-stocked drinks tray.</p><p>\u201cEddie! Come in here!\u201d She bangs on the glass and I look up to see a dark-haired man in golfing slacks walking over the large, well-manicured lawn. He\u2019s tanned and affluent-looking, probably in his late forties.</p><p>Trish is probably in her late forties too, I think, glimpsing her crow\u2019s feet as she turns away from the window.</p><p>\u201cLovely garden,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her eyes sweep over it without much interest. \u201cYes, our gardener is very good. Has all sorts of ideas. Now, sit down!\u201d She makes a flapping motion with her hands and, feeling a little awkward, I sit down on a lounger. Trish sinks into a basket chair opposite and drains her cocktail.</p><p>\u201cCan you make a good Bloody Mary?\u201d she asks abruptly.</p> <p>I stare at her, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d She drags on her cigarette. \u201cI can teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach me ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d she demands before I\u2019m able to finish. \u201cBetter? Ah, here\u2019s Eddie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreetings!\u201d The door opens and Mr. Geiger comes into the conservatory. He doesn\u2019t look quite as impressive close up as he did striding over the lawn. His blue eyes are a little bloodshot, and he has the beginnings of a beer belly.</p><p>\u201cEddie Geiger,\u201d he says, holding out his hand jovially. \u201cMaster of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie, this is ...\u201d Trish looks at me in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d I explain. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to bother you, but I had the most terrible headache ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI gave Samantha some of those wonderful migraine tablets!\u201d puts in Trish.</p><p>\u201cGood choice!\u201d Eddie unscrews a Scotch bottle and pours himself a drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very grateful, really.\u201d I manage a half smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very kind, letting me trespass on your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer English is good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Eddie raises his eyebrows at Trish.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s English!\u201d says Trish triumphantly, as though she\u2019s pulled a rabbit out of a hat. \u201cUnderstands everything I say!\u201d</p><p>I am really not getting something here. Do I look foreign?</p><p>\u201cShall we do the tour of the house?\u201d Eddie turns to Trish.</p><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s not necessary,\u201d I begin. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s absolutely beautiful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s necessary!\u201d Trish stubs out her cigarette. \u201cCome on ... bring your glass!\u201d</p><p>This woman cannot have a life. All she seems interested in is housework. As we trail round the first floor, viewing one splendid room after another, she keeps pointing out things that need special dusting and polishing, and how careful you have to be with the soft furnishings. I\u2019m sure silk drapes do need special treatment\u2014but why tell me?</p><p>\u201cNow upstairs!\u201d She sweeps out of the dining room.</p><p>Oh, God. There\u2019s more?</p><p>\u201cYou come from London, Samantha?\u201d says Eddie Geiger as we head up the stairs. A huge oil painting of Trish in a long blue evening dress with astonishingly sparkly eyes and teeth gazes down at us, and I can see the real Trish waiting for a reaction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I do.

People just have no idea what the life of a lawyer is like.</p><p>\u201cYou used to work through the night?\u201d Trish seems stupefied. \u201cOn your own?</p><p>\u201cMe and the other staff. Whoever was needed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you come from ... a big setup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the biggest in London.\u201d</p><p>Trish and Eddie are darting glances at each other. They really are the oddest people.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re far more relaxed, you\u2019ll be glad to hear!\u201d Trish pushes open a door. \u201cThis is the master bedroom ... the second bedroom ...\u201d</p><p>As we walk down the corridor she opens and closes doors and shows me four-poster beds and swishy curtains and matching upholstered ottomans, until my head swims. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too much floral wallpaper or whatever was in those migraine pills\u2014but I\u2019m feeling more lightheaded by the minute.</p><p>\u201cThe green bedroom ... As you will know, we don\u2019t have children or pets.... Are you a smoker?\u201d Trish suddenly demands.</p> <p>\u201cUm ... no. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that we mind either way.\u201d</p><p>We descend a small flight of stairs and I grab on to the wall to keep myself steady.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Eddie catches my arm.</p><p>\u201cI think those tablets were a bit strong ...\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cThey can be.\u201d Trish gives me a considering look. \u201cYou haven\u2019t drunk any alcohol today, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... well, yes ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaah.\u201d She pulls a face. \u201cWell, maybe you should have a little rest before you leave. What a good thing we\u2019ve come to the staff accommodation!\u201d She opens the last door with a flourish.</p> <p>All the rooms in this house are huge. This one is about the size of my flat, with pale walls and stone mullioned windows overlooking the garden. It has the plainest bed I\u2019ve seen yet in this house, vast and square and made up with crisp white bed linen.</p><p>I fight a sudden, almost overwhelming urge to lie down on it and sink into oblivion.</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d I say politely. \u201cIt\u2019s ... a gorgeous room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Eddie smacks his hands together. \u201cWell, Samantha. I\u2019d say you\u2019ve got the job!\u201d</p><p>I look at him dumbly.</p><p>Job?</p><p>\u201cEddie!\u201d snaps Trish. \u201cYou can\u2019t just offer her the job! We haven\u2019t finished the interview!\u201d</p><p>Interview?</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t even given her a full job description!\u201d Trish is still laying into Eddie. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been through any of the details!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, go through the details, then!\u201d retorts Eddie. Trish shoots him a look of fury and clears her throat.</p><p>\u201cSo, Samantha,\u201d she says in formal tones. \u201cYour role as full-time housekeeper will comprise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>Trish clicks her tongue in exasperation. \u201cYour role as full-time housekeeper,\u201d she says, more slowly, \u201cwill comprise all cleaning, laundry, and cooking. You will wear a uniform and maintain a courteous and respectful ...\u201d</p><p>My role as\u2014</p><p>These people think I\u2019m applying to be their housekeeper?</p><p>I\u2019m too dumbfounded to speak.</p><p>\u201c ... full board and lodging,\u201d Trish is saying, \u201cand four weeks holiday a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the salary?\u201d says Eddie with interest. \u201cAre we paying her more than the last girl?\u201d</p><p>I think Trish might murder him, there and then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Samantha!\u201d Before I can even open my mouth she\u2019s dragged Eddie out of the room and banged the door, whereupon a furious, muted argument breaks out.</p><p>I look around the room, trying to gather my wits.</p><p>They think I\u2019m a housekeeper. A housekeeper! This is ridiculous. I have to put them right. I have to explain the misunderstanding.</p><p>Another wave of wooziness engulfs me and I sit down on the bed. Then, before I can stop myself, I lie back on the cool white cover and close my eyes. It\u2019s like sinking into a cloud. It\u2019s been a long day. A long, exhausting, painful nightmare of a day. I just want it to be over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSamantha, I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d I open my eyes and struggle up to see Trish coming back in, followed by a pink-faced Eddie. \u201cBefore we continue, did you have any questions about the post?\u201d</p><p>I stare back at her, my head swirling.

Trish is firing a series of questions at me that sound like they come from a how-to-hire-your-housekeeper pamphlet.

Samantha, what the hell are you DOING?</p><p>But I\u2019m not listening. I don\u2019t want to listen.

They\u2019re the Geigers\u2019 sheets.</p> <p>I sink comfortably back into my pillows\u2014until another thought strikes me.</p><p>Who are the Geigers?</p><p>I screw up my face, trying to remember. I feel as though I\u2019m both hungover and still drunk. Snatches of yesterday are vivid in my mind, amid a dense fog. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s real and what\u2019s a dream. I came on the train ... yes ... I had a headache ... Paddington Station ... walking out of the office ...</p><p>Oh, God. Oh, please, no.</p><p>With a sickening whoosh the whole nightmare comes rushing back. The memo. Third Union Bank. Fifty million pounds. Asking Guy if I had a job left ...</p> <p>His silence ...</p><p>My career is wrecked. My life as I knew it is over.</p><p>At last I push back the covers and get out of bed, feeling weak and spacey. This time yesterday I was in my kitchen, getting ready for work, blissfully unaware of what was about to happen. In another world\u2014in a parallel universe to this one\u2014I would be waking up today a partner of Carter Spink. I\u2019d be surrounded by messages of congratulation.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes tight, trying to escape the sickening if-only thoughts. If I\u2019d seen the memo earlier\u2014if I had a tidier desk\u2014if Arnold hadn\u2019t given me that loan agreement\u2014</p><p>But there\u2019s no point. I walk to the window and take deep gulps of fresh air. What happened happened. All I can do is deal with it. Until this moment in time my whole life has been mapped out to the hour. Through exams, through holiday internships, the rungs of the career ladder ... I thought I knew exactly where I was headed. And now I find myself in a strange room in the middle of the countryside, my career in ruins.</p><p>Plus ... there\u2019s something else. Something\u2019s nagging at me. A final piece of the jigsaw still missing in my dazed brain. It\u2019ll come to me in a minute.</p> <p>I lean against the windowsill and watch a man on the distant horizon walking his dog. Maybe things are salvageable. Maybe it\u2019s not all as bad as I thought. Guy didn\u2019t actually say I\u2019d lost my job. I have to call him\u2014and find out just how bad it is. I take a deep breath and run my hands through my tangled hair. God, I flipped out yesterday. When I consider the way I acted, running out of the office, jumping on a train ... I was really on another planet. If it weren\u2019t for the Geigers being so understanding\u2014</p><p>My train of thought halts abruptly.</p><p>The Geigers.</p><p>Something about the Geigers. Something I\u2019m not remembering ... something that\u2019s ringing slight alarm bells ...</p><p>I turn round and focus on a blue dress hanging on the wardrobe door. Some kind of uniform, with piping. Why would there be a\u2014</p><p>The alarm bells are getting louder. They\u2019re starting to clang wildly. It\u2019s coming back to me like some kind of terrible, drunken dream.</p><p>Did I take a job as a housekeeper?</p><p>For a few instants I cannot move. Oh, God. What have I done? What have I done?</p> <p>My heart starts to thump as I take in my situation properly for the first time. I am staying in a strange couple\u2019s house under completely false pretenses. I\u2019ve slept in their bed. I\u2019m wearing one of Trish\u2019s old T-shirts. They even gave me a toothbrush, after I invented a suitcase-stolen-on-the-train story. The last thing I remember is hearing Trish gloating on the phone. \u201cShe\u2019s English!\u201d she was saying. \u201cYes, speaks English perfectly! Super girl. Cordon Bleu trained!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll have to tell them it was all lies.</p><p>There\u2019s a rapping at my bedroom door and I jump in fright.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Trish\u2019s voice comes through the door. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Um ... yes!\u201d</p><p>The door opens and Trish appears, wearing pale pink exercise clothes with a diamant\u00e9 logo.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made you a cup of tea,\u201d she says, handing me the mug with a formal smile. \u201cMr. Geiger and I would like you to feel very welcome in our house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I swallow nervously. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Geiger, there\u2019s something I need to tell you. I\u2019m not a housekeeper.</p><p>Somehow the words don\u2019t make it out of my mouth.</p><p>Trish\u2019s eyes have narrowed as though she\u2019s already regretting her kind gesture. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll be getting this every day, of course! But since you weren\u2019t feeling well last night ...\u201d She taps her watch. \u201cNow you\u2019d better get dressed. We\u2019ll expect you down in ten minutes. We only have a light breakfast as a rule. Toast and coffee.

I open my bedroom door and look up and down the corridor. No one\u2019s about. Cautiously I creep into the bay and lift the receiver. The dial tone rings in my ear. I take a deep breath\u2014then dial the direct line for Arnold. It isn\u2019t nine yet, but he\u2019ll be in.</p><p>\u201cArnold Saville\u2019s office,\u201d comes the cheerful voice of Lara, his secretary.</p><p>\u201cLara,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s Samantha.

Everyone\u2019s been\u2014\u201d She draws herself up.</p><p>\u201cI ... I\u2019m out of London right now. May I speak with Arnold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He\u2019s right here....\u201d She disappears briefly into chirpy Vivaldi, before the line clears again.</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d Arnold\u2019s friendly, assured voice booms down the line. \u201cMy dear girl. You\u2019ve got yourself in a pickle, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Only Arnold could describe the loss of a client\u2019s \u00a350 million as a \u201cpickle.\u201d In spite of everything, I feel the beginning of a smile. I can just picture him, in his waistcoat, his woolly eyebrows knitting together.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, trying to match his understated tones. \u201cIt\u2019s ... not great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m obliged to point out that your hasty departure yesterday did not help matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m so sorry. I just ... panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable. However, you left a bit of a mess behind.\u201d</p><p>Beneath Arnold\u2019s jolly veneer I can hear unfamiliar levels of stress. Arnold never gets stressed. Things must be really bad. I want to fall to the floor in a groveling heap, crying, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d But that wouldn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve already been unprofessional enough.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014what\u2019s the latest situation?\u201d I\u2019m trying to sound matter-of-fact. \u201cIs there anything the receivers can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it unlikely. They say their hands are tied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d His response is like a hammer blow to the stomach. So that\u2019s it. The fifty million is gone for good. \u201cAnd ... the insurers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the next step, of course. The money will be recovered eventually, I\u2019m sure.

That I\u2019m not a trained Cordon Bleu housekeeper at all, I just wanted a place to stay for the night?</p><p>I have a sudden image of them bundling me furiously out of the house. Feeling totally used. Maybe they\u2019ll even call the police and file charges. Oh, God. This could get really nasty.</p><p>But, I mean, it\u2019s not like I have any other option. It\u2019s not like I could actually ...</p><p>... Could I?</p> <p>I pick up the blue uniform and finger it, my mind whirling round and round.</p><p>They\u2019ve been so kind, putting me up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing anything else right now. It\u2019s not like I have anywhere else to go. Maybe it\u2019ll even take my mind off things, doing a little light housework\u2014</p><p>Abruptly I come to a decision.</p><p>I\u2019ll busk it for a morning. It can\u2019t be that hard. I\u2019ll make their toast and dust the ornaments or whatever. I\u2019ll think of it as my little thank-you to them. Then as soon as I hear from Arnold I\u2019ll find a convincing excuse to leave. And the Geigers will never know I wasn\u2019t a proper housekeeper.</p><p>Hurriedly I put on my uniform and run a comb through my hair. Then I stand to face myself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mrs. Geiger,\u201d I say to my reflection. \u201cAnd ... er ... how would you like the drawing room dusted?\u201d</p><p>The Geigers are standing at the bottom of the stairs looking up at me as I descend. I have never felt more self-conscious in my life.</p><p>I\u2019m a housekeeper. I must behave like a housekeeper.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome, Samantha!\u201d says Eddie as I arrive down in the hall. He\u2019s wearing a polo shirt with some crested logo, and golfing trousers. \u201cSleep all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, thank you, Mr. Geiger,\u201d I reply demurely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Eddie rocks back and forth on the soles of his feet. He seems just a little awkward. In fact ... they both seem awkward. Underneath the makeup, the tans, the expensive clothes ... there seems a hint of uncertainty about the Geigers.</p><p>I walk over to the bench seat and straighten a cushion, trying to look as though I know what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be wanting to get to know your new kitchen!\u201d says Trish brightly.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say with a confident smile. \u201cI\u2019m ... looking forward to it!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s only a kitchen. It\u2019s only one morning. I can do this.</p><p>Trish leads the way into the vast maple kitchen, and this time I try to take in the details. There\u2019s a huge hob set into the granite counter to my left. A bank of ovens built into the wall. Everywhere I look I can see shiny chrome gadgets plugged into sockets. Racks of saucepans and implements of all descriptions are hanging overhead in a jumble of stainless steel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to get it the way you like it, of course,\u201d says Trish, gesturing around. \u201cJust change anything you like. Knock it into shape. You\u2019re the professional!\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re both looking at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I say in a businesslike way. \u201cObviously I have my own ... um ... systems. That shouldn\u2019t be there, for example.\u201d I point randomly at a small metal gadget resembling a torpedo. \u201cThe ... um ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuice extractor,\u201d supplies Trish. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExactly.

Even Eddie looks interested.</p><p>\u201cKitchen ... ergonomic ... theory,\u201d I improvise. \u201cSo, you\u2019d like toast for breakfast?\u201d I add quickly.</p> <p>\u201cToast for both of us,\u201d says Trish. \u201cWhole wheat. And coffee with skim milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing up.\u201d I smile, feeling slight relief.</p><p>I can make toast. And the bread bin is helpfully marked Bread.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll just bring that through in a moment,\u201d I add, trying to chivvy them out. \u201cWould you like to eat in the dining room?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a small crash from the hall.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the newspaper,\u201d says Trish. \u201cYes, you may serve breakfast in the dining room.\u201d She hurries out, but Eddie loiters in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d He gives me a jovial smile. \u201cForget the toast, Samantha. I\u2019ll have your famous eggs Benedict. You whetted my appetite last night!\u201d</p><p>Last night? What did I say last\u2014</p><p>Oh, Jesus. Eggs Benedict. My famous signature dish as beloved by Lord Edgerly.</p><p>What was I thinking?</p><p>I don\u2019t even know what eggs Benedict is.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ... sure that\u2019s what you want?\u201d I try to sound relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss your specialty!\u201d Eddie rubs his stomach in anticipation. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite breakfast. The best eggs Benedict I\u2019ve ever tasted were at the Carlyle in New York, but I\u2019ll take a bet yours are even better!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that!\u201d</p><p>OK, think. It must be simple enough. Eggs and ... something.</p><p>Eddie leans against the counter with an expectant look. I have a nasty suspicion he\u2019s waiting for me to start cooking. Hesitantly, I get down a gleaming pan from the rack, just as Trish bustles in with the newspaper. She eyes me with bright curiosity.</p><p>\u201cHow will you be using the asparagus steamer, Samantha?\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to ... examine it. Yes.\u201d I nod briskly, as though the pan has confirmed my suspicions, then carefully hang it back on the rack again.</p> <p>Could I quickly look it up in a cookbook?</p><p>But it\u2019s supposed to be my specialty. Why would I need a cookbook?</p><p>I\u2019m feeling hotter and hotter. I have no idea even how to begin. Do I ... crack the eggs? Boil them?</p><p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d Eddie takes a huge box of eggs out of the fridge, plonks them on the counter, and lifts the lid. \u201cShould be enough there, I\u2019d imagine!\u201d</p><p>Before me are rows and rows of brown eggs. What do I think I\u2019m doing? I can\u2019t make bloody eggs Benedict. I can\u2019t make these people breakfast. I\u2019m going to have to confess.</p><p>I turn round and take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cMr. Geiger ... Mrs. Geiger ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEggs?\u201d Trish\u2019s voice cuts across mine. \u201cEddie, you can\u2019t have eggs! Remember what the doctor said!\u201d Her eyes bore into me. \u201cWhat did he ask you for, Samantha? Boiled eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... Mr. Geiger ordered eggs Benedict. But the thing is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating eggs Benedict!\u201d Trish practically shrieks at Eddie. \u201cIt\u2019s full of cholesterol!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat what I like!\u201d Eddie protests.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor gave him an eating plan.\u201d Trish is dragging furiously on her cigarette as she speaks. \u201cHe\u2019s already had a bowl of cornflakes this morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hungry!\u201d says Eddie, defensive. \u201cYou had a chocolate muffin!\u201d</p><p>Trish gasps as though he\u2019s hit her. Small red dots appear in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWe will have a cup of coffee each, Samantha,\u201d she announces at last in a dignified voice. \u201cYou may serve it in the lounge. Use the pink china. Come along, Eddie.\u201d And she sweeps out before I can respond.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I want to laugh or cry. This is ridiculous. I can\u2019t carry on with this charade. I have to tell the Geigers the truth. Now. I walk decisively out of the kitchen into the hall, but then behind the closed door of the sitting room I can hear the shrill, indistinct voice of Trish angrily berating Eddie, and Eddie\u2019s defensive rumbles in return. Hastily I back away again into the kitchen and switch the kettle on.</p><p>A quarter of an hour later I\u2019ve arranged a silver tray with a French press coffeepot, pink cups, creamer, sugar, and a sprig of pink flowers I snipped from a hanging basket outside the kitchen window. Fifteen minutes, just to make a cup of coffee. At Carter Spink I would have earned the firm \u00a3125 in that time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, I would have been quicker if I hadn\u2019t had to work out how to use the French press first.

Eddie is on the other side of the room, examining a wooden carving.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Samantha.\u201d Trish inclines her head graciously as I pour out the coffee. \u201cThat will be all for the moment.\u201d</p><p>I feel as though I\u2019ve stumbled into some bizarre Merchant Ivory costume drama, except the costumes are pink yoga wear and golfing sweaters.</p><p>\u201cEr ... very good, madam,\u201d I say, playing my part. Then, without meaning to, I bob a curtsy.</p><p>There\u2019s a staggered pause. Both Geigers just gape at me in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cSamantha ... did you just ... curtsy?\u201d says Trish at last.</p> <p>I stare back, frozen.</p><p>What was I thinking? Why did I curtsy? Housekeepers don\u2019t bloody curtsy. This isn\u2019t Gosford Park.</p><p>They\u2019re still goggling at me. I have to say something.</p><p>\u201cThe Edgerlys liked me to ... curtsy.\u201d My face is prickling all over. \u201cIt\u2019s a habit I got into. I\u2019m sorry, madam, I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Trish is squinting at me as though she\u2019s trying to make me out. She must realize I\u2019m a fake, she must....</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d she pronounces at last, and nods her head in satisfaction. \u201cYes, I like it. You can curtsy here too.\u201d</p> <p>What?</p><p>This is the twenty-first century. And I am being asked to curtsy to a woman called Trish?</p><p>I take a breath to protest\u2014then close my mouth again. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not real. I can curtsy for a morning.</p><p>Eight</p><p>As soon as I\u2019m out of the room, I dash upstairs, along the corridor, and into my bedroom to check my mobile. But it\u2019s only half charged and I have no idea where I\u2019m going to find a signal. If Trish could get one, I must be able to. I wonder what network she\u2019s on\u2014</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d</p><p>Trish\u2019s voice rises from the ground floor.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d She sounds annoyed. Now I can hear her footsteps coming up the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cMadam?\u201d I hurry back along the corridor.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d She frowns slightly. \u201cKindly do not disappear to your room while on duty. I don\u2019t want to have to be calling you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes, Mrs. Geiger,\u201d I say. As we arrive down in the hall my stomach flips over. Beyond Trish, I can see the Times lying on the table. It\u2019s open at the business pages and a headline reads glazerbrooks calls in receivers.</p><p>My eyes run down the text as Trish starts rootling around in a huge white Chanel bag\u2014but I can\u2019t see any mention of Carter Spink. Thank God for that. The PR department must have managed to keep a lid on the story.</p><p>\u201cWhere are my keys?\u201d Trish sounds fretful. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d She rummages more and more violently in her Chanel bag. A gold lipstick goes flying through the air and lands at my feet. \u201cWhy do things disappear?\u201d</p><p>I pick up the lipstick and hand it to her. \u201cDo you remember where you lost them, Mrs. Geiger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lose them.\u201d She inhales sharply. \u201cThey\u2019ve been stolen. It\u2019s obvious. We\u2019ll have to change all the locks. Our identities will be taken.\u201d She clutches her head. \u201cThis is what these fraudsters do, you know. There was a huge article about it in the Mail\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this them?\u201d I\u2019ve suddenly noticed a Tiffany key fob glinting on the windowsill. I pick it up and hold out the bunch of keys.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Trish looks utterly amazed. \u201cYes, that\u2019s them! Samantha, you\u2019re marvelous! How did you find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was ... no trouble.\u201d I shrug modestly.</p><p>\u201cWell! I\u2019m very impressed!\u201d She gives me a significant look. \u201cI will be telling Mr. Geiger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, madam,\u201d I say, trying to inject the right note of overwhelming gratitude into my voice. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Geiger and I will be going out in a minute,\u201d she continues, producing a scent spray and spritzing herself. \u201cKindly prepare a light sandwich lunch for one o\u2019clock, and get on with the downstairs cleaning. We\u2019ll talk about dinner later.\u201d She swivels round. \u201cI might tell you, we were both very impressed by your seared foie gras menu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... um ... good!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s fine.

For some reason, cleaners never get it right. So kindly pay attention.\u201d</p> <p>Obediently, I turn with her to face the mantelpiece.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important, Samantha, that these china dogs face each other.\u201d Trish points to a pair of King Charles spaniels. \u201cDo you see? They don\u2019t face out. They face each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEach other,\u201d I echo, nodding. \u201cYes. I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the shepherdesses face very slightly out. You see? They face out.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s speaking slowly and clearly, as though I have the IQ of a rather thick three-year-old.</p> <p>\u201cOut,\u201d I repeat dutifully.</p><p>\u201cNow, have you got that?\u201d Trish steps back from the fireplace. \u201cLet\u2019s see. Which way do the china dogs go?\u201d She lifts an arm to block my view of the mantelpiece.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. She\u2019s testing me.</p><p>\u201cThe china dogs,\u201d she prompts. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, I cannot resist this.</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d I ponder hard for a few moments. \u201cThey face ... out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEach other!\u201d Trish cries in exasperation. \u201cThey face each other!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cYes. Sorry. I\u2019ve got that now.\u201d</p><p>Trish has closed her eyes and is holding two fingers to her forehead as though the stress of stupid help is too much to bear.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she says at last. \u201cWe\u2019ll try again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the coffee tray out,\u201d I suggest humbly. As I pick it up I glance again at my watch. Ten twelve. I wonder if they\u2019ve started the meeting.</p><p>By eleven-thirty my nerves are really beginning to fray. My mobile\u2019s charged and I\u2019ve finally found a signal in the kitchen, but it hasn\u2019t rung. And there are no messages. I\u2019ve checked it every minute.</p><p>I\u2019ve stacked the dishwasher and at last managed to turn it on. And I\u2019ve dusted the china dogs with a tissue. Other than that all I\u2019ve done is pace up and down the kitchen.</p><p>I gave up on the \u201clight sandwich lunch\u201d almost straightaway. At least, I briefly tried sawing away at two loaves of bread\u2014and ended up with huge, wonky slices, each one more misshapen than the last, lying in a sea of crumbs.</p> <p>All I can say is, thank God for yellow pages and caterers. And American Express. It\u2019s only going to cost me \u00a345.50 to provide Trish and Eddie with a \u201cgourmet sandwich lunch\u201d from Cotswold Caterers. Less than six minutes of my time at Carter Spink.</p><p>Now I\u2019m just sitting on a chair, my hand clasped tight over the mobile in my pocket, desperately willing it to ring.</p><p>At the same time I\u2019m utterly terrified that it will.</p><p>This tension is unbearable. I need something to relieve it. Anything. I wrench open the door of the Geigers\u2019 enormous fridge and pull out a bottle of white wine. I pour myself a glass and take an enormous gulp. I\u2019m about to take another when I feel a tingling on the nape of my neck.</p><p>As if ... I\u2019m being watched.</p><p>I swivel round and nearly jump out of my skin. There\u2019s a man at the kitchen door.</p><p>He\u2019s tall and broad, and deeply tanned, with intense blue eyes. His wavy hair is golden brown with bleached-blond tips. He\u2019s wearing old jeans and a torn T-shirt and the muddiest boots I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>His eyes run doubtfully over the ten wonky, crumbly bread slices on the side, then onto my glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says at last. \u201cAre you the new Cordon Bleu cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes! Absolutely.\u201d I smooth my uniform down. \u201cI\u2019m the new housekeeper, Samantha. Hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nathaniel.\u201d He holds out his hand and after a pause I take it. His skin is so hard and rough, it\u2019s like shaking a piece of tree bark. \u201cI do the garden for the Geigers. You\u2019ll be wanting to talk to me about vegetables.\u201d</p><p>I look at him uncertainly. Why would I want to talk to him about vegetables?</p><p>As he leans against the door frame and folds his arms, I can\u2019t help noticing how massive and strong his forearms are. I\u2019ve never seen a man with arms like that before.</p><p>\u201cI can supply pretty much anything,\u201d he continues. \u201cSeasonal, of course. Just tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for cooking,\u201d I say, suddenly realizing what he means. \u201cEr ... yes. I\u2019ll be wanting some of those.

They must be some kind of vegetable. I search my mind frantically but all I can see is images of brassieres, waving on a washing line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to consult my menus,\u201d I say at last with a businesslike nod. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on that one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut just generally.\u201d He looks up. \u201cWhich do you use most?

Albinstar or Bleu de Solaise?\u201d</p> <p>I fiddle with a button on my uniform, my face prickling. I didn\u2019t catch either of those.

He\u2019s regarding me with something approaching incredulity.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you say you trained?\u201d he says.</p> <p>I feel a twinge of alarm. He\u2019s not stupid, this man.</p><p>\u201cAt ... Cordon Bleu school.\u201d My cheeks are growing rather hot.

I keep stirring for a minute, then put down my wooden spoon. \u201cSo. I\u2019ll just leave that to ... marinate now.\u201d</p><p>At last I look up. Nathaniel is still leaning against the door frame, calmly watching me. There\u2019s an expression in his blue eyes that makes my throat tighten.</p><p>He knows.</p><p>He knows I\u2019m a fake.</p><p>Please don\u2019t tell the Geigers, I silently transmit to him. Please. I\u2019ll be gone soon.</p> <p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Trish\u2019s head pops round the door and I start nervously. \u201cOh, you\u2019ve met Nathaniel! Did he tell you about his vegetable garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I can\u2019t look at him. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarvelous!\u201d She pushes her sunglasses up onto her head. \u201cWell, Mr. Geiger and I are back now, and we\u2019d like our sandwiches in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes? But it\u2019s only ten past twelve. The caterers aren\u2019t coming till one o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink first, maybe?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks!\u201d she says. \u201cJust the sandwiches. We\u2019re both rather famished, actually, so if you could hurry up with them ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I swallow. \u201cNo problem!\u201d</p><p>I automatically bob a curtsy as Trish disappears, and I hear a kind of snorting sound from Nathaniel.</p><p>\u201cYou curtsy,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYes, I curtsy,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cAnything wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel\u2019s eyes move to the misshapen bread slices lying on the breadboard.</p><p>\u201cIs that lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not lunch!\u201d I snap, flustered. \u201cAnd please could you get out of my kitchen? I need a clear space to work in.\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyebrows. \u201cSee you around, then. Good luck with the sauce.\u201d He nods toward the pan of wine.</p><p>As he closes the kitchen door behind him I whip out my phone and speed-dial the caterers. But they\u2019ve left their machine on.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say breathlessly after the bleep. \u201cI ordered some sandwiches earlier? Well, I need them now. As soon as you can. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Even as I put the phone down I realize it\u2019s fruitless. The caterers are never going to turn up in time. The Geigers are waiting.</p><p>OK. I can do this. I can make a few sandwiches.</p><p>Quickly I pick up the two least wonky of my bread slices and start cutting off the crusts until they\u2019re about an inch square but presentable. There\u2019s a butter dish on the side and I gouge some out with a knife. As I spread butter on the first slice of bread, it tears into two pieces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fuck.</p><p>I\u2019ll patch them together. No one\u2019ll notice.</p><p>I fling open a cupboard door and frantically root through pots of mustard ... mint sauce ... strawberry jam. Jam sandwiches it is. An English classic. I hastily smother one piece of bread with jam, spread some more butter on the other, and sandwich the two together. Then I stand back and consider the result.</p><p>Total disaster. Jam is oozing out of the cracks and it still isn\u2019t completely square. I\u2019ve never seen a more revolting sandwich in my life.</p> <p>Slowly I put the knife down in defeat. So this is it. Time for my resignation. Two jobs potentially lost in one day. As I stare at the jammy mess I feel strangely disappointed in myself. I would have thought I could last a morning.</p><p>The sound of someone knocking breaks me out of my reverie and I whip round to see a girl in a blue velvet hair band peering through the kitchen window.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she calls. \u201cDid you order sandwiches for twenty?\u201d</p><p>It all happens so fast. One minute I\u2019m standing there looking at my botch of jam and crumbs. The next, two girls in green aprons are trooping into the kitchen with plate after plate of professionally made sandwiches.</p><p>Clean-cut white and brown sandwiches, stacked in neat pyramids, garnished with sprigs of herbs and slices of lemon. They even have little handwritten paper flags describing the fillings.</p> <p>Tuna, mint, and cucumber. Smoked salmon, cream cheese, and caviar. Thai chicken with wild rocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about the numbers mix-up,\u201d the girl in the hair band says as I sign for them. \u201cIt honestly looked like a twenty. And we don\u2019t often get an order for sandwiches for just two people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d I say, edging her toward the door. \u201cReally. Whatever. Just put it on my card....\u201d</p><p>The door finally closes and I look around the kitchen, totally dazed. I\u2019ve never seen so many sandwiches. There are plates of them everywhere. On every surface. I\u2019ve even had to put some on the cooker.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d I can hear Trish approaching.</p><p>\u201cUm ... hold on!\u201d I hurry to the door, trying to block her view.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s already five past one,\u201d I can hear her saying a little sharply. \u201cAnd I did ask, most clearly, for ...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trails off into silence as she reaches the kitchen door, and her whole face sags in astonishment. I turn and follow her gaze as she surveys the endless plates of sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness!\u201d At last Trish finds her voice. \u201cThis is ... this is very impressive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what fillings you\u2019d prefer,\u201d I say. \u201cObviously next time I won\u2019t make quite so many....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d Trish appears totally at a loss. She picks up one of the little flags and reads it out loud. \u201cRare beef, lettuce, and horseradish.\u201d She looks up in astonishment. \u201cI haven\u2019t bought any beef for weeks! Where did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... in the freezer?\u201d</p><p>I looked in the freezer earlier. The amount of food crammed into it would probably feed an entire small African country for a week.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Trish clicks her tongue. \u201cAnd you thawed it in the microwave! Aren\u2019t you clever!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll put a selection on a plate for you,\u201d I suggest. \u201cAnd bring it out to the conservatory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarvelous. Nathaniel!\u201d Trish raps on the kitchen window. \u201cCome in and have a sandwich!\u201d</p><p>I stop dead. No. Not him again.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to waste them, after all.\u201d She arches her eyebrows. \u201cIf I did have a criticism, Samantha, it would be that you were a little profligate\u2014Not that we\u2019re poor,\u201d she adds suddenly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... no, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about money, Samantha.\u201d Trish lowers her voice a little. \u201cIt\u2019s very vulgar. However\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Geiger?\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel has appeared in the kitchen doorway again, holding a muddy garden spade.</p><p>\u201cHave one of Samantha\u2019s delicious sandwiches!\u201d exclaims Trish, gesturing around the kitchen. \u201cJust look! Isn\u2019t she clever?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s total silence as Nathaniel surveys the endless mounds of sandwiches. I can\u2019t bring myself to meet his eye. I feel I could be losing my grip on sanity here. I\u2019m standing in a kitchen in the middle of nowhere. In a blue nylon uniform. Masquerading as a housekeeper who can magically make sandwiches out of thin air.</p><p>\u201cExtraordinary,\u201d he says at last.</p><p>I finally risk looking up. He\u2019s gazing at me, his brow deeply furrowed as if he really can\u2019t make me out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t take you long,\u201d he says, a slight question in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... pretty quick when I want to be,\u201d I say blandly.</p><p>\u201cSamantha\u2019s wonderful!\u201d says Trish, biting greedily into a sandwich. \u201cAnd such a tidy worker! Look at this immaculate kitchen!\u201d She shoves another sandwich in her mouth and practically swoons. \u201cThis Thai chicken is divine!\u201d</p><p>Surreptitiously I pick up one from the pile and take a bite into it, feeling suddenly ravenous.</p> <p>Bloody hell, that\u2019s good. Though I say it myself.</p><p>By half past two the kitchen is empty. Trish and Eddie devoured over half the sandwiches and have now gone out. Nathaniel is back in the garden. I\u2019m pacing up and down, fiddling with a spoon.</p><p>Arnold will call soon. The meeting must have broken up by now.</p><p>I look out the window at a small brown bird pecking at the ground, then turn away and sink into a chair, staring down at the table, running my thumbnail obsessively round the fine grain of the polished wood.</p><p>I made one mistake. One. People are allowed to make one mistake in life. It\u2019s in the rules.</p> <p>Or ... maybe it\u2019s not. I just don\u2019t know.</p><p>Suddenly I feel my mobile vibrate. I grab the phone out of my uniform pocket with a trembling hand.</p><p>The caller ID tells me it\u2019s Guy.</p><p>\u201cHi, Guy?\u201d I try to speak confidently\u2014but my voice sounds tiny and scared to my own ears.</p><p>\u201cSamantha? Is that you?\u201d Guy\u2019s voice rushes through the phone in an urgent torrent. \u201cWhere the hell are you? Why aren\u2019t you here? Didn\u2019t you get my e-mails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got my BlackBerry,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI tried early today, but your phone seemed out of order. Then I was in meetings, but I\u2019ve been sending you e-mails all morning.... Samantha, where on earth are you? You should be here at the office! Not hiding out, for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>Hiding out? What does he mean?</p><p>\u201cBut ... but Arnold said don\u2019t come in! He said it would be best! He told me to stay away and he would do what he could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how this looks?\u201d Guy cuts across me. \u201cFirst you freak out, then you disappear. People are saying you\u2019re unhinged, you\u2019ve had a breakdown ... There\u2019s a rumor you\u2019ve skipped the country....\u201d</p><p>As the truth hits me, I feel a hot, choking panic. I can\u2019t believe how wrong I\u2019ve played this. I can\u2019t believe how stupid I\u2019ve been. What am I doing still sitting in this kitchen, miles from London?</p><p>\u201cTell them I\u2019m coming straight in,\u201d I stammer. \u201cTell Ketterman I\u2019ll be there at once.... I\u2019m getting on a train ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be too late.\u201d Guy sounds heavy and reluctant. \u201cSamantha ... all sorts of stories are going round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStories?\u201d My heart is thudding so hard I can barely say the word. \u201cWhat ... what stories?\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t take all this in. I feel like my car has suddenly lurched off the road and I can\u2019t stop it.</p><p>\u201cApparently people have said you\u2019re ... unreliable,\u201d Guy says at last. \u201cThat this isn\u2019t the first time. That you\u2019ve made errors before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErrors?\u201d I leap to my feet, my voice as sharp as though I\u2019ve been scalded. \u201cWho\u2019s saying that? I\u2019ve never made any errors! What are they talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t in the meeting. Samantha ... think back carefully. Have you made any other mistakes?\u201d</p><p>Think back carefully?</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. He doesn\u2019t believe me?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never made any mistakes,\u201d I say, trying and failing to keep my voice level. \u201cNone. Never! I\u2019m a good lawyer. I\u2019m a good lawyer.\u201d To my dismay I realize tears are pouring down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m steady! You know that, Guy.\u201d</p><p>In the tense little silence that follows, the unsaid is there between us. Like a conviction. I lost a client \u00a350 million.</p><p>\u201cGuy, I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t see the Glazerbrooks documentation.\u201d My words tumble out faster and faster. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it happened.

I have to get out of here.</p><p>I grab a piece of paper and a pencil and scrawl,</p><p>Dear Mrs. Geiger,</p><p>I am afraid I must resign as your housekeeper. While I have enjoyed my time</p> <p>Come on. I haven\u2019t got time to write any more, I have to leave now. I put the paper down on the table and head for the door. Then I stop.

Many thanks for your kindness.</p><p>Yours sincerelySamantha Sweeting</p><p>I put the pen down and push my chair back with a scrape.

It\u2019s not Guy.</p> <p>It\u2019s Ketterman.</p><p>Something cold grips my spine. As I stare at his name I feel real fear in a way I never have before. Childish, nightmarish fear. Every instinct in my body is telling me not to answer.</p><p>But my phone\u2019s already open. It\u2019s too late. Slowly I lift it up to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha.

I know this is my moment to speak, but my throat feels wadded by cotton wool. No words seem adequate. Everyone knows how much Ketterman despises apologies and excuses and explanations.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, I\u2019m ringing to tell you that your contract with Carter Spink has been terminated.\u201d</p><p>I feel all the blood drain from my face.</p><p>\u201cA letter is on its way to you giving the reasons.\u201d His tone is distant and formal. \u201cGross negligence compounded by your subsequent unprofessional behavior. Your P45 will be sent to you. Your pass has been disabled. I don\u2019t expect to see you at the Carter Spink offices again.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s going too fast. This is all happening too fast.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t ...\u201d I blurt out. \u201cPlease give me another chance. I made one mistake. One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawyers at Carter Spink don\u2019t make mistakes, Samantha. Nor do they run away from their mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it was wrong to run away.\u201d I\u2019m shaking all over. \u201cBut it was such a shock.... I wasn\u2019t thinking straight....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve disgraced the reputation of the firm and yourself.\u201d Ketterman\u2019s voice sharpens as though he, too, might be finding this difficult. \u201cYou have lost fifty million pounds of a client\u2019s money through your own negligence. And subsequently absconded with no explanation. Samantha, you cannot have expected any other outcome, surely.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence. My forehead is pressed hard against the heel of my hand. I try to focus on just breathing. In and out. In and out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper at last.</p><p>It\u2019s over. My entire career is really over.</p><p>Ketterman starts on a preprepared speech about meeting with the human-resources department, but I don\u2019t listen.</p><p>Everything I\u2019ve worked for since I was twelve years old. Gone. Everything ruined. In twenty-four hours.</p><p>At last I realize Ketterman has disappeared from the line. I get to my feet and stagger over to the shiny fridge. My eyes are huge, burning holes.</p><p>For a long time I just stand there, staring at my own face until the features blur.</p><p>I\u2019ve been fired. The phrase echoes round my mind. I\u2019ve been fired. I could collect the dole. I imagine myself with the men from The Full Monty. Standing in the unemployment queue, moving my hips back and forth to \u201cHot Stuff.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I hear the sound of a key in the front door. I can\u2019t be found in this condition. I can\u2019t face any probing, any sympathy. Otherwise I\u2019m afraid I might just collapse into sobs and never stop.</p><p>Distractedly, I reach for a cloth and start sweeping it in meaningless circles over the table. Then I glimpse my note to Trish, still lying there. I crumple it up and throw it in the bin. Later. I\u2019ll do it later. I feel as though I can barely function right now, let alone give a convincing resignation speech.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d Trish comes tripping into the kitchen on her high-heeled clogs, holding three bursting shopping bags. \u201cSamantha!\u201d She stops at the sight of me. \u201cAre you all right?

Extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not homesick,\u201d I say, gulping my tea.</p><p>My mind is beating like a butterfly\u2019s wings.

This will make your day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surprise?\u201d I look up, bewildered, as Trish starts producing packets from the bag.</p> <p>\u201cFoie gras ... chickpeas ... shoulder of lamb ...\u201d She hefts a joint of meat onto the table and looks at me expectantly. Then she clicks her tongue at my bewildered expression. \u201cIt\u2019s ingredients! Your dinner-party menu!

I\u2019m the one in disgrace. And he\u2019s not.</p><p>At last I sit up and rub my cheeks, trying to get my spirits back. Come on. This is Guy. He\u2019ll want to hear from me. He\u2019ll want to help. I flip open my phone and dial his direct line. A moment later I hear footsteps clopping along the wooden floor of the hall.</p><p>Trish.</p><p>I shut the phone, pocket it, and reach for a clump of broccoli.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d Trish\u2019s voice greets me. \u201cMaking progress?\u201d</p><p>As she enters the kitchen she looks a little surprised to see me still sitting in the exact same spot she left me. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just ... assessing the ingredients,\u201d I improvise. \u201cGetting the feel of them.\u201d</p><p>Just then a thin red-haired woman appears round the door, next to Trish. She\u2019s wearing diamant\u00e9 sunglasses on her head and regards me with an avid interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Petula,\u201d she announces. \u201cHow do you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetula\u2019s just eaten some of your sandwiches,\u201d puts in Trish. \u201cShe thought they were marvelous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve heard about the foie gras with an apricot glaze!\u201d Petula raises her eyebrows. \u201cVery impressive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha can cook anything!\u201d boasts Trish, pink with pride. \u201cShe trained with Michel de la Roux de la Blanc! The master himself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how exactly will you be glazing the foie gras, Samantha?\u201d asks Petula with interest.</p><p>The kitchen is silent. Both women are waiting, agog.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I clear my throat several times. \u201cI expect I\u2019ll use the ... usual method. The word glaze, obviously, comes from the transparent nature of the ... er ... finish ... and complements the ... gras. Foie,\u201d I amend. \u201cDe gras. The ... blend of the flavors.\u201d</p><p>I am making absolutely no sense here, but neither Trish nor Petula seems to have noticed. In fact they both seem totally impressed.</p><p>\u201cWhere on earth did you find her?\u201d says Petula to Trish in what she clearly imagines to be a discreet undertone. \u201cMy girl is hopeless. Can\u2019t cook and doesn\u2019t understand a word I say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe just applied out of the blue!\u201d Trish murmurs back, still flushed with pleasure. \u201cCordon Bleu!

I can\u2019t bear this anymore.</p><p>\u201cShall I make you some tea and bring it through to the conservatory?\u201d I ask. Anything to get them out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re popping out to have our nails done,\u201d says Trish. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Samantha.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an expectant pause. Suddenly I realize Trish is waiting for my curtsy. I start to prickle all over in embarrassment. Why did I curtsy? Why did I curtsy?</p><p>\u201cVery good, Mrs. Geiger.\u201d I bow my head and make an awkward bob. When I look up, Petula\u2019s eyes are like saucers.</p><p>As the two women leave, I can hear Petula hissing, \u201cShe curtsies? She curtsies to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple mark of respect,\u201d I hear Trish replying airily. \u201cBut very effective. You know, Petula, you should really try it with your girl....\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. What have I started?</p> <p>I wait until the sound of tapping heels has completely disappeared. Then, moving into the larder to be on the safe side, I flip open my phone and redial Guy\u2019s number. After three rings he answers.</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d He sounds guarded. \u201cHi. Have you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, Guy. I\u2019ve spoken to Ketterman. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ, Samantha. I\u2019m so sorry this has happened. So sorry ...\u201d</p><p>I cannot stand his pity. If he says anything else I\u2019ll burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say, cutting him off. \u201cReally. Let\u2019s not talk about it. Let\u2019s just ... look forward. I have to get my life on track.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re focused!\u201d There\u2019s a note of admiration in his voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t let anything faze you, do you?\u201d</p><p>I push my hair back off my face. \u201cI just have to ... get on with things.\u201d Somehow I keep my voice even and steady. \u201cI need to get back to London. But I can\u2019t go home. Ketterman bought a flat in my building. He lives there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Yes, I heard about that.\u201d There\u2019s a wince in his voice. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t face him, Guy.\u201d I feel the threat of tears again and force myself to hold them back. \u201cSo ... I was wondering. Could I come and stay with you for a while? Just for a few days?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I wasn\u2019t expecting silence.</p><p>\u201cSamantha ... I\u2019d love to help,\u201d says Guy at last. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to check with Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, a little taken aback.</p><p>\u201cJust stay on the line for a sec. I\u2019ll call her.\u201d</p> <p>The next moment I\u2019ve been put on hold. I sit waiting, listening to the tinny harpsichord music, trying not to feel discomfited. It was unreasonable to expect him to say yes straightaway. Of course he has to clear it with his girlfriend.</p><p>At last Guy comes onto the line again. \u201cSamantha, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>I feel slammed. \u201cRight.\u201d I try to sound natural, as though this is no big deal. \u201cWell ... never mind. It doesn\u2019t matter ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte\u2019s very busy right now ... we\u2019re having some work done to the bedrooms ... it\u2019s just not a good time....\u201d</p><p>He sounds halting, as if he wants to get off the line. And suddenly I realize. This isn\u2019t about Charlotte. This is all about him. He doesn\u2019t want to be near me. It\u2019s as though my disgrace is contagious, as though his career might get blighted too.</p><p>Yesterday I was his best friend. Yesterday, when I was about to become a partner, he was hanging around my desk, full of smiles and quips. And today he doesn\u2019t want to be associated with me at all.</p><p>I know I should stay quiet, keep my dignity, but I just can\u2019t contain myself.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be associated with me, do you?\u201d I burst out.</p><p>\u201cSamantha!\u201d His voice is defensive. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still the same person. I thought you were my friend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am your friend! But you can\u2019t expect me to ... I have Charlotte to consider ... we don\u2019t have that much space ... Look, call me in a couple of days, maybe we can meet up for a drink\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, don\u2019t worry.\u201d I try to control my voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have bothered you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cDon\u2019t go!

Everything\u2019s changed. Or maybe he hasn\u2019t changed. Maybe this was what Guy was always like and I just never realized it.</p><p>I stare down at the tiny display of my phone, watching the seconds of each minute tick by. Wondering what to do next. When it suddenly vibrates in my hand, I nearly jump out of my skin. Tennyson, my display reads.</p><p>Mum.</p> <p>I feel a clutch of dread. She can only be ringing for one thing. She\u2019s heard the news. I guess I should have known this was coming. I could go and stay with her, it occurs to me. How weird. I didn\u2019t even think of that before. I open up the phone and steel myself.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d Her voice pierces my ear with no preamble. \u201cExactly how long were you going to wait before you told me about your debacle? I have to find out about my own daughter\u2019s disgrace from an Internet joke.\u201d She utters the words with revulsion.</p><p>\u201cAn ... Internet joke?\u201d I echo faintly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Apparently in certain legal circles the new term for fifty million pounds is \u2018a Samantha.\u2019 Take it from me, I was not amused.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least the story has been contained within the legal world. I\u2019ve spoken to Carter Spink and they assure me that it won\u2019t be going further. You should be grateful for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I suppose so ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she cuts across my faltering words. \u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m standing in a larder, surrounded by packets of cereal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... at someone\u2019s house. Out of London.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I rub my face. \u201cI need to ... get myself together. Find a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA job,\u201d she says scathingly. \u201cYou think any top law firm is going to touch you now?\u201d</p><p>I flinch at her tone. \u201cI ... I don\u2019t know. Mum, I\u2019ve only just heard about being fired. I can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. Thankfully, I have acted for you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s acted for me?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called in all my favors. It wasn\u2019t an easy job. But the senior partner at Fortescues will see you tomorrow at ten.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m almost too stupefied to reply. \u201cYou\u2019ve ... organized me a job interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming all goes well, you will enter at senior associate level.\u201d Her voice is crisp. \u201cYou\u2019re being given this chance as a personal favor to me. As you can imagine, there are ... reservations. So if you want to progress, Samantha, you are going to have to perform. You\u2019re going to have to give this job every hour you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I shut my eyes, my thoughts whirling. I have a job interview. A fresh start. It\u2019s the solution to my nightmare.</p><p>Why don\u2019t I feel more relieved?</p><p>\u201cYou will have to give more than you did at Carter Spink,\u201d Mum continues in my ear. \u201cNo slacking. No complacency. You will have to prove yourself doubly. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say automatically.</p><p>More hours. More work. More late nights.</p><p>It\u2019s almost as if I can feel the concrete blocks being loaded onto me again. More and more of them. Heavier and heavier.</p><p>\u201cI mean ... no,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cNo. It\u2019s too much. I ... don\u2019t want that now. I need some time.\u201d</p><p>The words come out of my mouth all by themselves. I wasn\u2019t planning them; I\u2019ve never even thought them before. But now that they\u2019re out in the air they somehow feel ... true.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice is sharp. \u201cSamantha, what on earth are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019m kneading my forehead, trying to make sense of my own confusion. \u201cI was thinking ... I could take a break, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA break would finish your legal career.\u201d Her voice snaps dismissively. \u201cFinish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ... do something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t last more than two minutes in anything else!\u201d She sounds affronted. \u201cSamantha, you\u2019re a lawyer. You\u2019ve been trained as a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other things in the world than being a lawyer!\u201d I cry, rattled.</p><p>There\u2019s an ominous silence. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m standing up to her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever challenged my mother in my life. I feel shaky as I grip the phone. But at the same time, I know I can\u2019t do what she wants. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSamantha, if you\u2019re having some kind of breakdown like your brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having a breakdown!\u201d My voice rises in distress. \u201cI never asked you to find me another job. I don\u2019t know what I want. I need a bit of time ... to ... to think ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be at that job interview, Samantha.\u201d Mum\u2019s voice is like a whip. \u201cYou will be there tomorrow at ten o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me where you are! I\u2019m sending a car straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>I switch off my phone, come out of the larder, and almost savagely throw it down onto the table. She\u2019s my mother. And she didn\u2019t express one word of sympathy. Not one jot of kindness. My face is burning and tears are pressing hotly at the back of my eyes. The phone starts vibrating angrily on the table, but I ignore it. I\u2019m not going to answer it. I\u2019m not going to talk to anyone. I\u2019m going to have a drink. And then I\u2019m going to cook this bloody dinner.</p><p>I slosh some white wine into a glass and take several gulps. Then I address myself to the pile of raw ingredients waiting on the table.</p><p>I can cook. I can cook this stuff. Even if everything else in my life is in ruins, I can do this. I have a brain, I can work it out.</p> <p>Without delay I rip the plastic coverings off the lamb. This can go in the oven. In some kind of dish. Simple. And the chickpeas can go in there too. Then I\u2019ll mash them and that will make the hummus.</p><p>I open a cupboard and pull out a whole load of gleaming baking dishes and trays. I select a baking tray and scatter the chickpeas onto it. Some bounce onto the floor, but I don\u2019t care. I grab a bottle of oil from the counter and drizzle it over the top. Already I\u2019m feeling like a cook.</p><p>I shove the tray into the oven and turn it on full blast. Then I put the lamb in an oval dish and shove that in too.</p><p>So far so good. Now all I need to do is leaf through all Trish\u2019s recipe books and find instructions for seared foie gras with an apricot glaze.</p><p>OK. I didn\u2019t find a single recipe for seared foie gras with an apricot glaze. I found apricot and raspberry flan, turkey with chestnut and apricot stuffing, and almond pithivier with apricot filling and Prosecco sabayon.</p><p>I stare at the page blindly. I have just turned down what may be my only opportunity to start over. I\u2019m a lawyer. That\u2019s what I am. What else am I going to do? What\u2019s happened to me?</p> <p>Oh, God. Why is smoke coming out of the oven?</p><p>By seven o\u2019clock I\u2019m still cooking.</p><p>At least I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. Both ovens are roaring with heat. Pots are bubbling on the hob. The electric whisk is whirring busily. I\u2019ve burned my right hand twice taking things out of the oven. Eight recipe books are open around the kitchen, one drenched with spilled oil and another with egg yolk. I\u2019m puce in the face, sweating hard, and trying every so often to run my hand under cold water.</p><p>I\u2019ve been going for three hours. And I haven\u2019t yet made anything that could actually be eaten. So far I\u2019ve discarded a collapsed chocolate souffl\u00e9, two pans of burned onions, and a saucepan of congealed apricots that made me feel sick just to look at them.</p><p>I can\u2019t work out what\u2019s going wrong. I haven\u2019t got time to work out what\u2019s going wrong. There\u2019s no scope for analysis. Every time there\u2019s a disaster I just dump it and start again, quickly thawing food from the freezer, changing tack, trying to cobble something together.</p><p>The Geigers meanwhile are drinking sherry in the drawing room. They think everything is going splendidly. Trish tried to come into the kitchen about half an hour ago, but I managed to head her off.</p><p>In less than an hour she and Eddie are going to be sitting down at the table expecting a gourmet meal. Shaking out their napkins with anticipation, pouring out their mineral water and wine.</p><p>A kind of frenzied hysteria has come over me. I know I cannot do this, but somehow I can\u2019t give up either. I keep thinking a miracle will happen. I\u2019ll pull it all together. I\u2019ll manage it somehow\u2014</p> <p>Oh, God, the gravy\u2019s bubbling over.</p><p>I shove the oven door shut, grab a spoon, and start stirring it. It looks like revolting lumpy brown water. Frantically I start searching in the cupboards for something to chuck in. Flour. Cornstarch. Something like that. This\u2019ll do. I grab a small pot and shake in vigorous amounts of the white powder, then wipe the sweat off my brow. OK. What now?</p><p>Suddenly I remember the egg whites, still whisking up in their bowl. I grab the recipe book, running my finger down the page. I changed the dessert course to pavlova after I chanced upon the line in a recipe book: Meringues are so easy to make. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So far so good. What next? Form the stiff meringue mixture into a large circle on your baking parchment.</p><p>I peer at my bowl. Stiff meringue mixture? Mine\u2019s liquid.</p><p>It has to be right, I tell myself feverishly. It has to be. I followed the instructions. Maybe it\u2019s thicker than it looks. Maybe once I start pouring it out, it\u2019ll stiffen up by some weird culinary law of physics.</p><p>Slowly I start to pour it onto the tray. It doesn\u2019t stiffen up. It spreads in a white oozing lake and starts dripping off the tray onto the floor.</p> <p>Something tells me this is not going to make white chocolate pavlova for eight.</p><p>A splodge lands on my foot and I give a frustrated cry, near tears. Why didn\u2019t it work? I followed the sodding recipe and everything. A pent-up rage is rising inside me: rage at myself, at my defective crappy egg whites, at cookery books, at cooks, at food ... and most of all at whoever wrote that meringues were so easy to make.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not!\u201d I hear myself yelling. \u201cThey\u2019re bloody not!\u201d I hurl the book across the kitchen, where it smashes against the kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2014\u201d a male voice exclaims in surprise.</p><p>The door flies open and Nathaniel is standing there, a rucksack hefted over his shoulder; he looks like he\u2019s on his way home. \u201cIs everything OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say, rattled. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. Thank you. Thank you so much.\u201d I make a dismissive motion with my hand, but he doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were cooking a gourmet dinner tonight,\u201d he says slowly, surveying the mess.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m just in the ... most complex stage of the ... um ...\u201d I glance down at the hob and give an involuntary scream. \u201cFuck! The gravy!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened. Brown bubbles are expanding out of my gravy saucepan, all over the cooker, and down the sides on the floor. It looks like the porringer in the story of the magic pot that wouldn\u2019t stop making porridge.</p><p>\u201cGet it off the heat, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d exclaims Nathaniel, throwing his rucksack aside. He snatches up the pan and moves it to the counter. \u201cWhat on earth is in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I say. \u201cJust the usual ingredients ...\u201d</p> <p>Nathaniel has noticed the little pot on the counter. He grabs it and takes a pinch between his fingers. \u201cBaking soda? You put baking soda in gravy? Is that what they taught you at\u2014\u201d He breaks off and sniffs the air. \u201cHang on. Is something burning?\u201d</p><p>I watch helplessly as he opens the bottom oven, grabs an oven glove with a practiced air, and hauls out a baking tray covered in what look like tiny black bullets.</p><p>Oh, no. My chickpeas.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these supposed to be?\u201d he says incredulously. \u201cRabbit droppings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re chickpeas,\u201d I retort. My cheeks are flaming but I lift my chin, trying to regain some kind of dignity. \u201cI drizzled them in olive oil and put them in the oven so they could ... melt.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel stares at me. \u201cMelt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoften,\u201d I amend hurriedly.</p><p>Nathaniel puts down the tray and folds his arms. \u201cDo you know anything about cooking?\u201d</p> <p>Before I can answer, there\u2019s the most almighty BANG from the microwave.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I shriek in terror. \u201cOh, my God! What was that?\u201d Nathaniel is peering through the glass door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was in there?\u201d he demands. \u201cSomething\u2019s exploded.\u201d</p><p>My mind races frantically. What on earth did I put in the microwave? It\u2019s all a blur.</p><p>\u201cThe eggs!\u201d I suddenly remember. \u201cI was hard-boiling the eggs for the canap\u00e9s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a microwave?\u201d he expostulates.</p><p>\u201cTo save time!\u201d I practically yell back. \u201cI was being efficient!\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel yanks the plug of the microwave from the wall socket and turns round to face me, his face working with disbelief. \u201cYou know bugger all about cooking! You\u2019re not a housekeeper. I don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re up to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not up to anything!\u201d I reply, in shock.</p><p>\u201cThe Geigers are good people.\u201d He faces me square on. \u201cI won\u2019t have them exploited.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. What does he think? That I\u2019m some kind of confidence trickster?</p><p>\u201cLook ... please.\u201d I rub my sweaty face. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to rip anyone off. OK, I can\u2019t cook. But I ended up here because of ... a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of misunderstanding?\u201d</p><p>I sink down onto a chair and massage my aching lower back. I hadn\u2019t realized how exhausted I was. \u201cI was running away from ... something. I needed a place to stay for the night. I stopped here for some water and directions to a hotel and the Geigers assumed I was a housekeeper. And then this morning I felt terrible. I thought I\u2019d do the job for the morning. But I\u2019m not planning to stay. And I won\u2019t take any money from them, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nathaniel is leaning against the counter, his arms folded. His wary frown has eased a little. He reaches into his rucksack and takes out a bottle of beer. He offers it to me and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you running from?\u201d he says, cracking the bottle open.</p><p>I feel a painful wrench inside. I cannot face telling the whole dreadful story.</p><p>\u201cIt was ... a situation.\u201d I look down.</p> <p>He takes a drink of beer. \u201cA bad relationship?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m silenced. I think back over all my years at Carter Spink. All the hours I gave them, everything I sacrificed. Finished in a three-minute phone call.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cA bad relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven years.\u201d To my horror I can feel tears seeping out of the corners of my eyes. I have no idea where they came from. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I gulp. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a stressful day.\u201d</p> <p>Nathaniel tears off a piece of kitchen towel from the wall-mounted roll behind him and hands it to me. \u201cIf it was a bad relationship, you\u2019re well out of it,\u201d he says in calm tones. \u201cNo point staying. No point looking back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I wipe my eyes. \u201cYes. I just have to decide what to do with my life. I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d I reach for the bottle of Cointreau, which was supposed to go in the chocolate-orange souffl\u00e9, pour some into a handy eggcup, and take a gulp.</p><p>\u201cThe Geigers are good employers,\u201d says Nathaniel with a tiny shrug. \u201cYou could do worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I raise a half smile. \u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>He puts his bottle of beer down and wipes his mouth. His hands look scrubbed clean, but I can still see the traces of earth ingrained around his nails, in the seams of his weather-beaten skin.</p><p>\u201cI could speak to my mum. She can cook. She could teach you the basics.\u201d</p> <p>I look at him in astonishment, almost laughing. \u201cYou think I should stay? I thought I was supposed to be a confidence trickster.\u201d I shake my head, wincing at the taste of the Cointreau. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt would have been nice to have someone around who speaks English. And makes such great sandwiches,\u201d he adds, totally deadpan.</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling back. \u201cCaterers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I wondered.\u201d</p><p>A faint rapping at the door makes us both look up.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Trish\u2019s voice outside is hushed and urgent. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t come in. I don\u2019t want to disturb anything! You\u2019re probably at a very crucial stage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKind of ...\u201d</p><p>I catch Nathaniel\u2019s eye and a sudden wave of hysteria rises through me.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to ask,\u201d Trish\u2019s voice continues, \u201cif you will be serving any kind of sorbet between the courses?\u201d</p><p>I look at Nathaniel. His shoulders are shaking with silent laughter. I can\u2019t stop a tiny snort escaping. I clamp my hand over my mouth, trying to get control of myself.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... no,\u201d I manage at last. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any sorbet.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel has picked up one of my pans of burned onions. He mimes taking a spoonful and eating it. Yummy, he mouths.</p><p>\u201cWell! See you later!\u201d</p><p>Trish tip-taps away and I collapse into helpless laughter. I\u2019ve never laughed so hard in my life. My ribs hurt; I\u2019m coughing; I almost feel like I\u2019ll be sick.</p><p>At last I wipe my eyes and blow my runny nose on the kitchen towel. Nathaniel\u2019s stopped laughing too and is looking around the bombshelled kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are you going to do about this? They\u2019re expecting a fancy dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know they are. I\u2019ll just have to ... think of something.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the kitchen. Nathaniel is curiously eyeing the white splodges of meringue on the floor. I cast my mind back to all the times I\u2019ve had to go into a room at Carter Spink and bluff my way out of a tricky spot. There has to be a way.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I take a deep breath and push back my damp hair. \u201cI\u2019m going to rescue the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to rescue the situation?\u201d He looks skeptical.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I think this might solve everyone\u2019s problems.\u201d I get to my feet and start busily sweeping packets into the bin. \u201cFirst I need to clear up the kitchen a bit....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d Nathaniel stands up. \u201cThis I have to see.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Companionably, we empty pans and pots and packets into the bin. I scrub all the smeared surfaces while Nathaniel mops up the meringue.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you worked here?\u201d I ask as he rinses out the mop in the sink.</p><p>\u201cThree years. I worked for the people who lived here before the Geigers, the Ellises. Then Trish and Eddie moved in two years ago and kept me on.\u201d</p><p>I digest this. \u201cWhy did the Ellises move? It\u2019s such a beautiful house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Geigers made them an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s mouth is twitching with ... amusement?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, intrigued. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d He puts the mop down. \u201cIt was fairly comical. The house was used as a location in a BBC period drama, all set in the Cotswolds. Two weeks after it was aired, Trish and Eddie arrived on the doorstep waving a check. They\u2019d seen it on television, decided they wanted it, and tracked it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I laugh. \u201cPresumably they paid a good price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows what they paid. The Ellises would never say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know how the Geigers made all their money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey built up a road haulage company from nothing and sold it off. Made a bundle.\u201d He starts mopping up the final patch of meringue.</p><p>\u201cAnd how about you? Before the Ellises?\u201d I tip the congealed apricots down the waste disposal with a shudder.</p><p>\u201cI was working at Marchant House,\u201d Nathaniel replies. \u201cIt\u2019s a stately home near Oxford. Before that, university.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUniversity?\u201d I say, my ears pricking up. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>I halt, reddening. I was about to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t know gardeners went to university.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did natural sciences.\u201d Nathaniel gives me a look that makes me think he knew exactly what I was thinking.</p><p>I open my mouth to ask him where and when he was at university\u2014then on second thought, close it and switch the waste disposal on. I don\u2019t want to start getting into details, going down the \u201cdo we know anyone in common?\u201d road. Right now, I could do without remembering the particulars of my life.</p><p>At last the kitchen looks a bit more normal. I pick up the eggcup, drain the rest of the Cointreau, and take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cOK. Showtime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d Nathaniel raises his eyebrows.</p><p>I open the kitchen door to see Trish and Eddie loitering in the hall, holding their sherry glasses.</p><p>\u201cAh, Samantha! Everything ready?\u201d Trish\u2019s face is all lit up with anticipation, and I feel a huge twinge of guilt for what I\u2019m about to do.</p><p>But I can\u2019t see any other way.</p> <p>I take a deep breath and put on my best breaking-bad-news-to-a-client face.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Geiger.\u201d I look from one face to the other, making sure I have their attention. \u201cI am devastated.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and shake my head.</p><p>\u201cDevastated?\u201d echoes Trish nervously.</p><p>\u201cI have done my best.\u201d I open my eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid I cannot work with your equipment. The dinner I created was not up to my own professional standards. I could not allow it out of the kitchen. I will of course reimburse all your costs\u2014and offer my resignation. I will leave in the morning.\u201d</p><p>There. Done. And no casualties.</p><p>I can\u2019t help glancing at Nathaniel, standing in the doorway of the kitchen. He gives me the thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d Trish puts her sherry glass down on a side table with a little crash. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave! You\u2019re the best housekeeper we\u2019ve ever had! Eddie, do something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Geiger, after tonight\u2019s performance, I feel I have no choice,\u201d I say. \u201cTo be frank, the dinner was inedible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your fault!\u201d she says in consternation. \u201cIt was our fault! We\u2019ll order you new equipment at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give us a list of what you need. Spare no expense! And we\u2019ll give you a pay rise!\u201d She\u2019s suddenly gripped by a new idea. \u201cHow much do you want? Name your price!\u201d</p><p>This is not going the way I planned. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cWell ... we never discussed pay,\u201d I begin. \u201cAnd really I can\u2019t accept\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie!\u201d Trish rounds on him savagely. \u201cThis is your fault! Samantha\u2019s leaving because you\u2019re not paying her enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Geiger, that\u2019s not the case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she needs new kitchen pots and pans. From the best place.\u201d She digs Eddie in the ribs with her elbow and mutters, \u201cSay something!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh ...

Three people. All telling me they want me within the space of ten minutes.</p><p>I could stay. It\u2019s as simple as that. For however long it takes to ... work myself out. I\u2019m miles away from London. No one knows I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll be safe.</p><p>I can\u2019t cook, a little voice reminds me. I can\u2019t clean. I\u2019m not a housekeeper.</p><p>But I could learn. I could learn it all.</p><p>The silence is growing in tension. Even Nathaniel is watching me closely from the door.</p> <p>\u201cWell ... OK.\u201d I feel a smile coming to my lips. \u201cOK. If you want me to ... I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Later that night, after we\u2019ve all eaten a Chinese take-away, I take out my mobile phone, call my mother\u2019s office, and wait till I\u2019m put through to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mum,\u201d I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to call in any favors. I\u2019ve got a job.\u201d And I click the mobile shut.</p><p>Ten</p><p>The only thing is, now I actually have to be a housekeeper.</p><p>The next morning my alarm goes off at six fifteen and I arrive downstairs in the kitchen before seven, in my uniform. The garden is misty and there are no sounds, except a couple of magpies chacking at each other on the lawn. I feel as though I\u2019m the only person awake in the world.</p> <p>As quietly as I can, I empty the dishwasher and put everything away in the cupboards. I straighten the chairs under the table. I make a cup of coffee. Then I look around at the gleaming granite counters.</p><p>My domain.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t feel like my domain. It feels like someone else\u2019s scary kitchen.</p><p>So ... what do I do now? I feel twitchy, just standing here. I should be occupied. My mind flashes back to London before I can stop it, to my regular routine. If I were still at Carter Spink, I would be queuing for a cappuccino by now. Or maybe on the tube, answering e-mails. I wonder how many e-mails are stacked up, unanswered, in my BlackBerry? The thought makes me feel slightly ill.</p><p>No. Don\u2019t think about it. There\u2019s an old copy of The Economist in the magazine rack by the table and I pick it up. I flip through and start reading a piece on international monetary controls, sipping my coffee.</p><p>Then, as I hear a sound from upstairs, I hastily put it down again. Housekeepers aren\u2019t supposed to read articles on international monetary controls. They\u2019re supposed to be making breakfast. But how can I do that until I know what the Geigers want?</p><p>Then all of a sudden I remember yesterday morning. Trish made me a cup of tea.</p><p>Maybe today I\u2019m supposed to make her a cup of tea. Maybe they\u2019re waiting upstairs, tapping their fingers impatiently, saying \u201cWhere\u2019s the damn tea?\u201d</p> <p>Quickly I boil the kettle and make a teapot full. I put it on a tray with cups and saucers and after a moment\u2019s thought add a couple of biscuits. Then I head upstairs, venture along the silent corridor to Trish and Eddie\u2019s bedroom ... and stop outside the door.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>What if they\u2019re asleep and I wake them up?</p><p>I lift a hand to knock\u2014but the tray\u2019s too heavy to hold in one hand and there\u2019s an alarming chinking as the whole thing starts tilting sideways. In horror, I grab it just before the teapot slides off. Sweating, I put the whole lot on the ground, raise a hand, and knock very quietly, then pick up the tray again.</p><p>There\u2019s no answer.</p><p>Hesitantly I tap again.</p><p>\u201cEddie! Stop that!\u201d Trish\u2019s raised voice filters faintly through the door.</p><p>Oh, God. Why can\u2019t they hear me?</p><p>I\u2019m hot all over. This tray is bloody heavy. I can\u2019t stand outside their room with a cup of tea all morning. Shall I just ... retreat?</p><p>I\u2019m about to turn round and creep away. Then determination comes over me. No. Don\u2019t be so feeble. I\u2019ve made the tea. They can always tell me to leave.</p><p>I grip the tray tightly and bang the corner hard against the door. They have to have heard that.</p><p>After a moment, Trish\u2019s voice rises up. \u201cCome in!\u201d</p><p>I feel a swell of relief. They\u2019re expecting me. I knew they would be. Somehow I turn the doorknob while balancing the tray against the door. I push the door open and walk into the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trish looks up from the canopied mahogany bed, where she\u2019s sprawled on a pile of lace pillows, alone. She\u2019s wearing a silky nightie, her hair is disheveled, and makeup is smudged about her eyes. For a moment she looks startled to see me.</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d she says sharply. \u201cWhat do you want? Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>I have an immediate, horrible feeling I\u2019ve done the wrong thing. My gaze doesn\u2019t move from hers, but my peripheral vision starts to register a few details in the room. I can see a book called Sensual Enjoyment on the floor. And a bottle of musk-scented massage oil. And ...</p><p>A well-worn copy of The Joy of Sex. Right by the bed. Open at \u201cTurkish Style.\u201d</p> <p>OK. So they weren\u2019t expecting tea.</p><p>I swallow, trying to keep my composure, desperately pretending I haven\u2019t seen anything.</p><p>\u201cI ... brought you a cup of tea,\u201d I say, my voice cracking with nerves. \u201cI thought you might ... like one.\u201d</p><p>Do not look at The Joy of Sex. Keep your eyes up.</p><p>Trish\u2019s face relaxes. \u201cSamantha! You treasure! Put it down!\u201d She waves an arm vaguely at a bedside table.</p> <p>I\u2019m just starting to move toward it when the bathroom door opens and Eddie emerges, naked except for a pair of too-tight boxer shorts, displaying a quite staggeringly hairy chest.</p><p>Somehow I manage not to drop the entire tray on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I stammer, backing away. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly! Come in!\u201d exclaims Trish gaily. She now seems completely reconciled to me being in her bedroom. \u201cWe\u2019re not prudish.\u201d</p><p>OK, I\u2019m really wishing they were. Cautiously I edge further toward the bed, stepping over a mauve lace bra. I find a place for the tray on Trish\u2019s bedside cabinet by pushing aside a photo of her and Eddie sitting in a Jacuzzi, holding up glasses of champagne.</p><p>I pour out the tea as fast as I can and hand a cup to each of them. I cannot look Eddie in the eye. In what other job do you see your boss naked?</p> <p>Only one other occupation springs immediately to mind. Which isn\u2019t that encouraging.</p><p>\u201cWell ... I\u2019ll go now,\u201d I mumble, head down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush off!\u201d Trish sips her tea with relish. \u201cMmm. Now you\u2019re here, I wanted to have a little chat! See where we are with things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... right.\u201d Her nightie is gaping and I can see the edge of her nipple. I hastily look away and find myself catching the eye of the bearded guy in The Joy of Sex as he contorts himself.</p><p>I can feel my face flaming with embarrassment. What kind of surreal weirdness is this, that I am standing in the bedroom of two people, pretty much strangers to me, being practically shown how they have sex? And they don\u2019t seem remotely bothered....</p><p>And then it comes to me. Of course. I\u2019m staff. I don\u2019t count.</p><p>\u201cSo, is everything all right, Samantha?\u201d Trish puts her cup down and gives me a beady look. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your routine sorted? All under control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I grope for a competent-sounding phrase. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much ... on top of everything.\u201d Aaargh. \u201cI mean ... getting to grips with it all.\u201d</p> <p>Aaaargh.</p><p>She takes a sip of tea. \u201cI expect you\u2019ll be tackling the laundry today.\u201d</p><p>The laundry. I hadn\u2019t even thought about the laundry.</p><p>\u201cOnly I\u2019d like you to change the sheets when you make the beds,\u201d she adds.</p><p>Make the beds?</p><p>I feel a slight twinge of panic.</p><p>\u201cObviously I have my own ... er ... established routine,\u201d I say, trying to sound casual. \u201cBut it might be an idea if you give me a list of duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Trish looks a little irritated. \u201cWell ... if you really think you need it ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I, Samantha, must go through your terms and conditions later on,\u201d says Eddie. He\u2019s standing in front of the mirror, holding a dumbbell. \u201cLet you know what you\u2019ve got yourself into.\u201d He guffaws, then with a slight grunt lifts the weight above his head. His stomach is rippling with the effort. And not in a good way.</p><p>\u201cSo ... I\u2019ll get on with ... things.\u201d I start backing toward the door.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, then, at breakfast.\u201d Trish gives me a cheery little wave from the bed. \u201cCiao ciao!\u201d</p><p>I cannot keep up with Trish\u2019s mood shifts. We seemed to have lurched straight from employer-employee to people-enjoying-a-luxury-cruise-together.</p><p>\u201cEr ... bye then!\u201d I say, matching her chirpy tone. I bob a curtsy, step over her bra again, and exit the room as quickly as I can. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Breakfast is a bit of a nightmare. It takes me three failed attempts before I realize how you\u2019re supposed to cut a grapefruit in half. You\u2019d think they\u2019d make it clearer. They could draw guidelines round them, or have perforations, or something. Meanwhile the milk for the coffee boils over\u2014and when I plunge down the cafeti\u00e8re, the coffee explodes everywhere. Luckily Trish and Eddie are so busy arguing about where to go on their next holiday, they don\u2019t seem to notice what\u2019s going on in the kitchen.</p><p>When they\u2019ve finished, I stack the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and am desperately trying to remember how I made it work yesterday, when Trish comes into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, Mr. Geiger would like to see you in his study,\u201d she says. \u201cTo discuss your pay and conditions. Don\u2019t keep him waiting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... very good, madam.\u201d I curtsy, then smooth down my uniform and head out into the hall. I approach the door of Eddie\u2019s study and knock twice.</p> <p>\u201cCome in!\u201d replies a jovial voice. I walk in to find Eddie sitting behind his desk\u2014a huge affair of mahogany and tooled leather\u2014with an expensive-looking laptop in front of him. He\u2019s fully clothed by now, thank God, in tan trousers and a sports shirt.</p><p>\u201cAh, Samantha. Ready for our little meeting?\u201d Eddie gestures to an upright wooden chair, and I sit down. \u201cHere we are! The document you\u2019ve been waiting for!\u201d</p><p>With a self-important air he hands me a folder marked housekeeper\u2019s contract. I open it up to find a title sheet on cream vellum paper.</p><p>CONTRACT OF AGREEMENT</p><p>Between Samantha Sweeting and Mr. and Mrs. Edward Geiger, this first day of July in the year of our Lord two thousand and four.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cDid a lawyer draw this up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need a lawyer.\u201d Eddie chuckles knowingly. \u201cDownloaded it from the Internet. And obviously amended it slightly. All you need is a bit of common sense.\u201d</p><p>I turn over the title sheet and run my eyes down the printed clauses. I have to bite my lip as I take in phrases here and there, presumably Eddie\u2019s \u201camendments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, I know it looks frightening!\u201d says Eddie, misinterpreting my silence. \u201cBut don\u2019t be intimidated by all these long words. Did you have a chance to look at the pay?\u201d</p><p>My eye flicks to the figure quoted in bold under Weekly Salary. It\u2019s slightly less than I charged per hour as a lawyer.</p><p>\u201cIt seems extremely generous,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cThank you very much, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t understand?\u201d He beams jovially. \u201cJust say!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... this bit.\u201d I point to Clause 7: Hours. \u201cDoes this mean I have the whole weekend off? Every weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless we\u2019re entertaining.\u201d Eddie nods. \u201cIn which case you\u2019ll have two days off in lieu ... You\u2019ll see in clause nine ...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not listening. Every weekend free. I can\u2019t get my head around this idea. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a totally free weekend since I was about twelve.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d I look up, unable to stop myself smiling. \u201cThanks very much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your previous employers give you weekends off?\u201d Eddie looks taken aback.</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d I say truthfully. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sound like slave drivers!\u201d He beams. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll leave you alone for a while to study the agreement before you sign.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve pretty much read it\u2014\u201d I halt as Eddie raises a hand in reproof.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, Samantha, Samantha,\u201d he says in avuncular tones, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a little tip that will stand you in good stead in life. Always read legal documents very carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I say, my nose twitching with the effort of staying deadpan. \u201cI\u2019ll try to remember that.\u201d</p><p>As Eddie disappears from the room, I look down at the contract again, rolling my eyes. I pick up a pencil and automatically start correcting the text, rephrasing, scoring out, and adding queries in the margin.</p><p>What am I doing?</p><p>I grab an eraser and hastily erase all my amendments. I reach for a Biro and turn to the bottom of the page.</p><p>Name: Samantha Sweeting.</p><p>Occupation:</p><p>I hesitate for a moment ... then put Domestic Help.</p><p>I\u2019m really doing this. I\u2019m really committing to this job, miles away from my former life in every sense. And no one knows what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>I have a sudden flash on my mother\u2019s face, on the expression she\u2019d have if she knew where I was right now ... if she could see me in my uniform ... her reaction.... It would be as though some seismic world catastrophe had occurred. I\u2019m almost tempted to call her up and tell her what I\u2019m doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I\u2019m not going to. And I haven\u2019t got time to think about her. I have laundry to do.</p><p>It takes me two trips to bring down all the washing to the laundry room, just off the kitchen. I dump the overflowing baskets on the tiled floor and look at the hi-tech washing machine. This should be simple enough. Experimentally, I open the door of the machine and at once an electronic display starts flashing at me. WASH? WASH?</p><p>Immediately I feel flustered. Obviously I want you to wash, I feel like snapping back. Just give me a chance to get the bloody clothes in.</p><p>Stay calm. One thing at a time. First step: sort the clothes. Feeling pleased with myself for having thought of this, I start sorting out the dirty clothes into piles on the floor, consulting the labels as I go. As I\u2019m peering at one marked Wash with GREAT CARE, I hear Trish coming into the kitchen, clearly on the phone.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she\u2019s saying, her voice trembling. \u201cYou\u2019re right! But he doesn\u2019t see it like that! And let me tell you, I\u2019ve tried!\u201d</p><p>I freeze in embarrassment. Does Trish know I\u2019m in here? Should I cough?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to play golf! Is there nothing else we can do together?\u201d I glance out of the laundry door into the kitchen and to my horror see Trish at the table, dabbing at her eyes with a pink tissue. \u201cIt\u2019s all right for him! He has no idea what it\u2019s like for me!\u201d</p><p>Hastily I duck back into the laundry and start busily shoving clothes into the drum at random. If Trish comes in, she\u2019ll see me dutifully at work, impervious to her conversation. I shake some washing powder into the little tray at the top and close the door firmly. Now what?</p><p>WASH? the machine is still flashing at me. WASH?</p> <p>\u201cEr ... yes!\u201d I mutter. \u201cWash them.\u201d I jab randomly at a button.</p><p>ENTER PROGRAM? it flashes back.</p><p>My eyes dart about for clues, and I spot a manual tucked behind a spray bottle. I grab it and start leafing through.</p><p>The half-load option for small washes is only available for prewash programs A3-E2 and superrinse programs G2-L7 not including H4.</p><p>... What?</p><p>OK, let\u2019s forget the manual. Let\u2019s just use common sense. I briskly press at the keypad in my best housekeeper manner.</p> <p>PROGRAM K3? the machine flashes at me. PROGRAM K3?</p><p>I don\u2019t like the sound of program K3. It sounds sinister. Like a cliff face or secret government plot.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say aloud, jabbing at the machine. \u201cI want something else.\u201d</p><p>YOU HAVE CHOSEN K3, it flashes back. HEAVY-DUTY UPHOLSTERY PROGRAM.</p><p>Heavy duty? Upholstery?</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I say under my breath, and start banging all the buttons. \u201cStop!\u201d I kick the machine in desperation. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, Samantha?\u201d Trish appears at the laundry door. All signs of tears are gone and she\u2019s applied fresh lipstick. I wonder what she was so upset about. But it\u2019s hardly my place to ask.</p><p>\u201cEr ... fine! Just ... getting some washing on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell done.\u201d She holds out a stripy shirt to me. \u201cNow, Mr. Geiger needs a button sewn on this shirt, if you would be so kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I take it from her, praying my trepidation doesn\u2019t show on my face.</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s your list of duties!\u201d She hands me a sheet of paper. \u201cIt\u2019s by no means complete, but it should get you started.\u201d</p><p>As I run my eyes down the endless list, I feel a bit faint.</p><p>Make beds ... sweep and clean front steps ... arrange flowers ... polish all mirrors ... store cupboards tidy ... laundry ... clean bathrooms daily ...</p><p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s nothing here that should present you with a problem, is there?\u201d adds Trish.</p><p>\u201cEr ... no!\u201d My voice is a little strangled. \u201cNo, it should all be fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut make a stab at the ironing first,\u201d she continues firmly. \u201cThere is quite a lot, I\u2019m afraid, as you\u2019ll have seen. It does tend to mount up rather ...\u201d For some reason, Trish is looking upward. With a slight foreboding, I follow her gaze. There, above us, is a mountain of crumpled shirts hanging on a wooden drying rack. At least thirty.</p><p>As I stare up at them, I feel wobbly. I can\u2019t iron a shirt. I\u2019ve never used an iron in my life. What am I going to do?</p><p>\u201cI expect you\u2019ll whip through these in no time!\u201d she says gaily. \u201cThe ironing board\u2019s just there,\u201d she adds with a nod.</p><p>\u201cUm, thanks!\u201d I manage.</p><p>I reach for the ironing board, trying to look matter-of-fact, as if I do this all the time. I tug briskly at one of the metal legs, but it won\u2019t move. I try another one with no luck. I\u2019m pulling harder and harder, till I\u2019m hot with the effort, but the bloody thing won\u2019t budge. How am I supposed to open it up? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s got a catch,\u201d Trish says, watching me in surprise. \u201cUnderneath.\u201d She takes the board from me, and in two movements has opened it up to exactly the right height. \u201cI expect you\u2019re used to a different model,\u201d she adds wisely as she clicks it shut. \u201cThey all have their own little tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say, seizing on this excuse in relief. \u201cOf course! I\u2019m far more used to working with a ... a ... a Nimbus 2000.\u201d</p><p>Trish peers at me in surprise. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the broomstick out of Harry Potter?\u201d</p><p>Damn. I knew I\u2019d heard it somewhere.</p> <p>\u201cYes ... it is,\u201d I say at last, my face flaming. \u201cAnd also a well-known ironing board. In fact, I think the broomstick was named ... er ... after the ironing board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Trish looks fascinated. \u201cI never knew that!\u201d To my horror she leans expectantly against the door and lights a cigarette. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me!\u201d she adds, her voice muffled. \u201cJust carry on!\u201d</p><p>Carry on?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the iron,\u201d she adds with a gesture. \u201cBehind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... great! Thanks!\u201d I take the iron and plug it in, as slowly as possible, my heart banging in fright. I cannot do this. I need a way out. But I can\u2019t think of one. My brain is totally blank.</p> <p>\u201cI expect the iron\u2019s hot enough now!\u201d says Trish helpfully.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I give her a sick smile.</p><p>I have no choice. I reach for one of the shirts overhead and spread it out awkwardly on the ironing board. Unable to believe what I\u2019m doing, I pick up the iron. It\u2019s far heavier than I imagined and emits a terrifying cloud of steam. Very gingerly, I start lowering it toward the cotton fabric. I have no idea which bit of the shirt I\u2019m aiming for. I think my eyes might be shut.</p><p>Suddenly there\u2019s a trilling from the kitchen. The phone. Thank God ... thank God ... thank God ...</p><p>\u201cOh, who\u2019s that?\u201d says Trish, frowning. \u201cSorry, Samantha. I should get this ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine!\u201d My voice is shrill. \u201cNo worries! I\u2019ll just get on\u2014\u201d</p> <p>As soon as Trish is out of the room I put the iron down with a crash and bury my head in my hands. I must have been mad. This isn\u2019t going to work. I\u2019m not made to be a housekeeper. The iron puffs steam in my face and I give a little scream of fright. I switch it off and collapse against the wall. It\u2019s only nine twenty and I\u2019m already a total wreck.</p><p>And I thought being a lawyer was stressful.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>By the time Trish comes back into the kitchen I\u2019m a little more composed. I can do this. Of course I can. It\u2019s not quantum physics. It\u2019s housework.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to desert you for the day,\u201d says Trish, looking concerned. \u201cMr. Geiger is off to golf and I\u2019m going to see a very dear friend\u2019s new Mercedes. Will you be all right on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine!\u201d I say, trying not to sound too joyful. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about me. Really. I\u2019ll just get on with things....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the ironing done already?\u201d She glances at the laundry room, impressed.</p><p>Done?</p> <p>\u201cActually, I thought I\u2019d leave the ironing for now and tackle the rest of the house,\u201d I say, trying to sound matter-of-fact. \u201cThat\u2019s my normal routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She nods vigorously. \u201cWhatever suits you. Now, I won\u2019t be here to answer any questions, I\u2019m afraid, but Nathaniel will!\u201d She beckons out the door. \u201cYou\u2019ve met Nathaniel, of course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say as he walks in, wearing ripped jeans, his hair disheveled. \u201cEr ... yes. Hi, again.\u201d</p><p>It feels a bit strange seeing him this morning, after all the dramas of last night.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say lightly. \u201cReally well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel knows all there is to know about this house,\u201d puts in Trish, who is doing her lipstick. \u201cSo if you can\u2019t find anything\u2014need to know how a door unlocks or whatever\u2014he\u2019s your man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bear that in mind,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Nathaniel, I don\u2019t want you disturbing Samantha,\u201d adds Trish, giving him a severe look. \u201cObviously she has her own established routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d says Nathaniel. As Trish turns away, he raises an eyebrow in amusement and I feel my color rise.</p><p>What\u2019s that supposed to mean? How does he know I don\u2019t have a routine? Just because I can\u2019t cook, it doesn\u2019t follow I can\u2019t do anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be OK?\u201d Trish picks up her handbag. \u201cYou\u2019ve found all the cleaning stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d I look around uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cIn the laundry room!\u201d She disappears through the doorway for a moment, then reappears, holding a gigantic blue tub full of cleaning products. \u201cThere you are!\u201d she says, dumping it on the table. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget your Marigolds!\u201d she adds merrily.</p><p>My what?</p> <p>\u201cRubber gloves,\u201d says Nathaniel.

I\u2019ll get on.\u201d</p><p>I wait for Nathaniel to leave, but he leans against the table and looks at me quizzically. \u201cDo you have any idea how to clean a house?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to feel quite insulted here. Do I look like someone who can\u2019t clean a house?</p><p>\u201cOf course I know how to clean a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly I told my mum about you last night.\u201d He smiles, as though remembering the conversation. What could he have said about me? \u201cAnyway. She\u2019s willing to teach you cooking. And I said you\u2019d probably need cleaning advice too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not need cleaning advice!\u201d I retort. \u201cI\u2019ve cleaned houses loads of times. In fact, I need to get started.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind me.\u201d Nathaniel shrugs.</p><p>I\u2019ll show him. In a businesslike manner, I pick a can out of the tub and spray it onto the counter.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve cleaned lots of houses,\u201d says Nathaniel, watching me.</p><p>\u201cYes. Millions.\u201d</p><p>The spray has solidified into crystalline little gray droplets. I rub them briskly with a cloth\u2014but they won\u2019t come off.</p><p>I look more closely at the can. do not use on granite. Shit.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d I say, hastily putting the cloth down to hide the droplets. \u201cYou\u2019re in my way.\u201d I grab a feather duster from the blue tub and start brushing crumbs off the kitchen table. \u201cExcuse me ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you, then,\u201d says Nathaniel, his mouth twitching. He looks at the feather duster. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be using a dustpan and brush for that?\u201d</p> <p>I look uncertainly at the feather duster. What\u2019s wrong with this one? Anyway, what is he, the duster police?</p><p>\u201cI have my methods,\u201d I say, lifting my chin. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d He grins. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to let him faze me. I just need ... a plan. Yes. A time sheet, like at work.</p><p>I grab a pen and the pad of paper by the phone and start scribbling a list for the day-.

I just hope to heaven Trish and Eddie won\u2019t notice that their wardrobe has magically regenerated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>11:06 And ... oh. The ironing. What am I going to do about that?</p><p>11:12 I have a solution, via the local paper. A girl from the village will collect it, iron it all overnight at \u00a33 a shirt, and sew on Eddie\u2019s button.</p><p>So far this job has cost me nearly a thousand pounds. And it\u2019s not even midday.</p><p>11:42 I\u2019m doing fine. I\u2019m doing well. I\u2019ve got the Hoover on, I\u2019m cruising along nicely\u2014</p> <p>What was that? What just went up the Hoover? Why is it making that grinding noise?</p><p>Have I broken it?</p><p>11:48 How much does a Hoover cost?</p><p>12:24 My legs are in total agony. I\u2019ve been kneeling on hard tiles, cleaning the bath, for what seems like hours. There are little ridges where the tiles have dug into my knees, and I\u2019m boiling hot and the cleaning chemicals are making me cough. All I want is a rest. But I can\u2019t stop for a moment. I am so behind ...</p><p>12:30 What is wrong with this bleach bottle? Which way is the nozzle pointing, anyway? I\u2019m turning it round in confusion, peering at the arrows on the plastic ... Why won\u2019t anything come out? OK, I\u2019m going to squeeze it really, really hard\u2014</p> <p>That nearly got my eye.</p><p>12:32 FUCK. What has it done to my HAIR?</p><p>By three o\u2019clock I am utterly knackered. I\u2019m only halfway down my list and I can\u2019t see myself ever making it to the end. I don\u2019t know how people clean houses. It\u2019s the hardest job I\u2019ve ever done, ever.</p><p>I am not moving smoothly from task to task like Mary Poppins. I\u2019m darting from unfinished job to unfinished job like a headless chicken. Right now I\u2019m standing on a chair, cleaning the mirror in the drawing room. But it\u2019s like some kind of bad dream. The more I rub, the more it smears.</p><p>I keep catching glances of myself in the glass. I have never looked more disheveled in my life. My hair is sticking out wildly, with a huge grotesque streak of greeny-blond where I splashed the bleach. My face is bright red and shiny, my hands are pink and sore from scrubbing, and my eyes are bloodshot.</p><p>Why won\u2019t it get clean? Why?</p> <p>\u201cGet clean!\u201d I cry, practically sobbing in frustration. \u201cGet clean, you bloody ... bloody\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly I stop rubbing, to see Nathaniel standing in the doorway. \u201cHave you tried vinegar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVinegar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt cuts through the grease,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s good on glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d I put my cloth down, trying to regain my cool. \u201cYes, I knew that.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel shakes his head. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I look at his adamant face. There\u2019s no point pretending anymore. He knows I\u2019ve never cleaned a house in my life.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I admit at last. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As I get down off the chair, I feel wobbly with fatigue.</p><p>\u201cYou should have a break,\u201d says Nathaniel firmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been at it all day; I\u2019ve seen you. Did you have any lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time.\u201d</p><p>I collapse onto a chair, suddenly too drained to move. Every single muscle in my body is in pain, including muscles I never even knew I had. I feel like I\u2019ve run a marathon, and I still haven\u2019t polished the woodwork or beaten the mats.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... harder than I thought,\u201d I say at last. \u201cA lot harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He\u2019s peering at my head. \u201cWhat happened to your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleach,\u201d I say shortly. \u201cCleaning the loo.\u201d</p><p>He gives a muffled snort of laughter, but I don\u2019t respond. To be honest, I\u2019m beyond caring.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard worker,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that. And it\u2019ll get easier\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d The words come out before I can stop them. \u201cI can\u2019t do this job. I\u2019m ... hopeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d He rifles through his rucksack and produces a can of Coke. \u201cHave this. You can\u2019t work on no fuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, taking it gratefully. I crack open the can and take a gulp, and it\u2019s the most delicious thing I\u2019ve ever tasted.</p><p>\u201cThe offer still stands,\u201d he adds after a pause. \u201cMy mother will give you lessons if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I wipe my mouth, push back my sweaty hair, and look up at him. \u201cShe\u2019d ... do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes a challenge, my mum.\u201d Nathaniel gives a little smile. \u201cShe\u2019ll teach you your way around a kitchen. And ... anything else you need to know.\u201d</p><p>I feel a sudden burn of humiliation and look away. I don\u2019t want to be useless. I don\u2019t want to need lessons. That\u2019s not who I am. I want to be able to do this on my own, without asking assistance from anyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But ... the truth is, I need help.</p><p>Apart from anything else, if I keep on going like today I\u2019ll be bankrupt in two weeks.</p><p>I turn back to Nathaniel.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d I say. \u201cI really appreciate it. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>Twelve</p><p>I wake up the next morning, heart pounding, leaping to my feet, my mind racing with everything I have to do ...</p><p>And then it stops, like a car screeching to a halt. For a moment I can\u2019t move. Then, hesitantly, I sink back into bed, overcome by the most extraordinary feeling.</p><p>It\u2019s Saturday. I have nothing to do.</p><p>No contracts to go over, no e-mails to reply to, no emergency meetings at the office. Nothing.</p> <p>I try to remember the last time I had nothing to do. But I\u2019m not sure I can. It seems like I\u2019ve never had nothing to do, ever since I was about seven. I get out of bed, walk to the window, and stare out at the early morning translucent blue sky, trying to get my head around my situation. It\u2019s my day off. No one has any hold over me. No one can call me up and demand my presence. This is my own time. My own time.</p><p>As I stand there at the window, contemplating this fact, I start to feel an odd feeling inside. Light and giddy, like a helium balloon. I\u2019m free. A smile of exhilaration spreads across my face. For the first time ever, I can do whatever I like.</p><p>I check the time\u2014and it\u2019s only 7:15 a.m. The whole day stretches before me like a fresh sheet of paper. What shall I do? Where do I start?</p><p>I\u2019m already sketching out a timetable for the day in my head. Forget six-minute segments. Forget hurrying. I\u2019m going to start measuring time in hours. An hour for wallowing in the bath and getting dressed. An hour for lingering over breakfast. An hour for reading the paper, cover to cover. I\u2019m going to have the laziest, most indolent, most enjoyable morning I\u2019ve ever had in my adult life.</p><p>As I head into the bathroom, I can feel muscles twinging with pain all over my body. They really should market housecleaning as a workout. I run a deep warm bath and slosh in some of Trish\u2019s bath oil, then step into the scented water and lie back happily.</p><p>Delicious. I\u2019m just going to stay here for hours and hours and hours.</p> <p>I close my eyes, letting the water lap my shoulders, and time wafts past in great swathes. I think I even fall asleep for a while. I have never spent so long in a bath in my entire life.</p><p>At last I open my eyes, reach for a towel, and get out. As I\u2019m starting to dry myself off I reach for my watch, just out of curiosity.</p><p>7:30 a.m.</p><p>What?</p><p>I was only fifteen minutes?</p><p>How can I have only taken fifteen minutes? I stand, dripping, in indecision for a moment, wondering if I should get back in and do it all again, more slowly.</p><p>But no. That would be too weird. It doesn\u2019t matter. So I had my bath too quickly. I\u2019ll just make sure I take my time properly over breakfast.</p><p>At least I have some clothes to put on. Trish took me out last night to a shopping center a few miles away so I could stock up on underwear and shorts and summer dresses. She told me she\u2019d leave me to it\u2014then ended up bossing me about and picking everything out for me ... and somehow I ended up with not a single item in black.</p> <p>I cautiously put on a pink slip dress and a pair of sandals and look at myself. I\u2019ve never worn pink before in my life. My entire closet at home is filled with black suits for work\u2014and I\u2019ve got into the habit of wearing black at the weekends too. It just makes life easy. But to my amazement I don\u2019t look too bad! Apart from the huge streak of bleach in my hair.</p><p>As I make my way along the corridor, there\u2019s no sound from the Geigers\u2019 bedroom. I move silently past the door, feeling suddenly awkward. It\u2019ll be a bit strange, spending all weekend in their house, with nothing to do. I\u2019d better go out later. Get out of their way.</p><p>The kitchen is as silent and gleamy as ever, but it\u2019s starting to feel slightly less intimidating. I know my way around the kettle and the toaster, if nothing else. I\u2019ll have toast for breakfast, with orange and ginger marmalade, and a nice cup of coffee. And I\u2019ll read the paper from cover to cover. That\u2019ll take me to about eleven o\u2019clock and then I can think about what else to do....</p><p>I wonder how the Fallons deal is progressing.</p><p>The thought pops into my mind with no warning. I can\u2019t help picturing my last scribbled amendments on the draft agreement\u2014all my work, left half done. And Ketterman\u2019s due diligence report. I never finished that.</p><p>My grip on the kettle tightens as I remember all the projects I\u2019ve left behind. I wonder who\u2019s taken over all my unfinished deals. Edward Faulkner, maybe? He\u2019s a year or two younger than me, but pretty sharp. With a wince I imagine him taking the files off my desk, flipping through all my work, introducing himself to the Fallons people. The team could be there right now, finishing up an all-nighter\u2014sitting around the table, Edward Faulkner in my place ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stop.</p><p>Just stop. I mustn\u2019t think about it. I\u2019ve left Carter Spink. It\u2019s nothing to do with me anymore. I\u2019m going to relax and enjoy my free time, like any normal person.</p><p>Forcing the images out of my mind, I head out into the hall, where I find a copy of the Times on the doormat. I bring it back to the kitchen just as my toast is popping up.</p><p>This is the life.</p> <p>I sit by the window, crunching toast, sipping coffee, and leafing through the paper in a leisurely way. At last, after devouring three slices, two cups of coffee, and all the Saturday sections, I stretch my arms in a big yawn and glance at the clock.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s only seven fifty-six.</p><p>What is wrong with me? I was supposed to take hours over breakfast. I was supposed to be sitting there all morning. Not get everything finished in twenty minutes flat.</p><p>OK ... never mind. I\u2019ll soon get the hang of it.</p><p>I put my crockery away in the dishwasher and wipe away my toast crumbs. Then I sit down at the table again and look about. I wonder what to do next.</p> <p>Abruptly I realize I\u2019m tapping the table with my fingernails. I stop myself and survey my hands for a moment. This is ridiculous. I\u2019m having my first true day off in about ten years. I should be relaxed. Come on, I can think of something nice to do, surely.</p><p>What do people do on days off? My mind scrolls through a series of images from TV. I could make another cup of coffee, but I\u2019ve already had two. I could read the paper again, but I have an almost photographic memory. So rereading things I already know is a bit pointless.</p><p>My gaze drifts to the garden, where a squirrel is perched on a stone pillar, looking around with bright eyes. Maybe I\u2019ll go outside. Enjoy the garden and the wildlife and the early morning dew. Good idea.</p><p>Except the trouble with early morning dew is it gets all over your feet. As I pick my way over the damp grass, I\u2019m already wishing I hadn\u2019t put on open-toed sandals. Or that I\u2019d waited till later for my little stroll.</p><p>The garden is a lot bigger than I\u2019d appreciated. I walk down the lawn toward an ornamental hedge where the land seems to finish, only to realize there\u2019s a whole section beyond it, with an orchard at the end and some sort of walled garden to my left.</p><p>It\u2019s a stunning garden. Even I can see that. The flowers are vivid without being garish; every wall is covered with some beautiful creeper or vine. As I walk toward the orchard I can see little golden pears hanging from the branches of trees. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an actual pear growing on a tree before in my life. I grew up in a town house with a small paved courtyard containing nothing but a few nondescript shrubs.</p> <p>I walk through the fruit trees toward a huge, square, brown patch of earth with vegetation growing in serried rows. These must be the vegetables. I prod one of them cautiously with my foot. It could be a cabbage or a lettuce. Or the leaves of something growing underground, maybe.</p><p>To be honest, it could be an alien. I have no idea.</p><p>I sit down on a mossy wooden bench and look at a nearby bush covered in white flowers. Mm. Pretty.</p><p>Now what? What do people do in their gardens?</p><p>I feel I should have something to read. Or someone to call. My fingers are itching to move. I look at my watch. Still only eight sixteen. Oh, God.</p><p>Come on, I can\u2019t give up yet. I\u2019ll just sit here for a bit and enjoy the peace. I lean back and watch a little speckled bird pecking the ground nearby for a while.</p><p>Then I look at my watch again: eight seventeen.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this.</p> <p>I can\u2019t do nothing all day. It\u2019s going to drive me crazy. I\u2019ll have to go and buy another paper from the village shop. If they\u2019ve got War and Peace, I\u2019ll buy that too. I get up and head briskly back across the lawn when a bleep from my pocket makes me stop still.</p><p>It\u2019s my mobile. It\u2019s received a text. Someone\u2019s just texted me, early on a Saturday morning. I pull out my mobile, feeling edgy. I haven\u2019t had any contact with the outside world for two days. Is it from Carter Spink?</p><p>I know there are other texts in my phone\u2014but I haven\u2019t read any of them. I know there are messages in my voice mail\u2014but I haven\u2019t listened to a single one. I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>I finger my mobile, telling myself to put it away. But now my curiosity has been sparked. Someone texted me a few seconds ago. Someone, somewhere, has been holding a mobile phone, punching in a message to me. I have a sudden vision of Guy, in his off-duty chinos and blue shirt. Sitting at his desk, frowning as he texts. Apologizing. Or giving me some news. Some kind of development I couldn\u2019t have guessed at yesterday\u2014</p><p>I can\u2019t help it. Despite all, I feel a sudden flicker of hope. As I stand there on the early morning lawn, I can feel my mental self being dragged out of this garden, back to London, back to the office. Two whole days have gone on there without me. A lot can happen in forty-eight hours. Things can change for the better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or ... become even worse.

I have to know. Good or bad. I flip open the phone and find the text. It\u2019s from a number I don\u2019t even recognize.</p><p>Who? Who on earth is texting me?</p><p>Feeling a little sick, I press ok to read.</p> <p>hi samantha, nathaniel here.</p><p>Nathaniel?</p><p>Nathaniel?</p><p>My relief is so huge, I laugh out loud.

What a perfect way to fill the day! I press reply and quickly text:</p><p>would love to. thanks. sam</p><p>I send it with a little smile. This is fun. A minute or two later, the phone bleeps again.</p><p>what time? is 11 too early? nat</p><p>I look at my watch. Eleven o\u2019clock is still two and a half hours away.</p><p>Two and a half hours with nothing to do except avoid Trish and Eddie. I press reply.</p> <p>shall we make it 10? sam</p><p>At five to ten I\u2019m ready in the hall. Nathaniel\u2019s mother\u2019s house is nearby but apparently tricky to find, so the plan is to meet here and he\u2019ll walk me over. I check my reflection in the hall mirror and wince. The streak of bleach in my hair is as obvious as ever. Am I really going out in public like this? I push my hair backward and forward a few times\u2014but I can\u2019t hide it. Maybe I could walk along with my hand carelessly positioned at my head, as if I\u2019m thinking hard. I attempt a few casual, pensive poses in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cIs your head all right?\u201d</p><p>I swivel round in shock to see Nathaniel at the open door, wearing a plaid shirt and jeans.</p><p>\u201cEr ... fine,\u201d I say, my hand still glued to my head. \u201cI was just ...\u201d</p><p>Oh, there\u2019s no point. I bring my hand down from my hair and Nathaniel regards the streak for a moment.</p><p>\u201cIt looks nice,\u201d he says. \u201cLike a badger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA badger?\u201d I say, affronted. \u201cI don\u2019t look like a badger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBadgers are beautiful creatures,\u201d says Nathaniel with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019d rather look like a badger than a stoat.\u201d</p><p>Hang on. Since when was my choice between badger and stoat? How did we get onto this subject, anyway?</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should go,\u201d I say with dignity, then pick up my bag and give one last glance in the mirror.</p><p>OK. Maybe I look a little bit like a badger.</p><p>The summer air is already warming up outside, and as we walk down the gravel drive I sniff appreciatively. There\u2019s some sort of nice flowery smell that I definitely recognize....</p><p>\u201cHoneysuckle and jasmine!\u201d I exclaim in sudden recognition. I have the Jo Malone bath oil at home.</p><p>\u201cHoneysuckle on the wall.\u201d Nathaniel points to a tangle of tiny pale-yellow flowers on the old stone wall bordering the drive. \u201cPut it in a year ago.\u201d</p><p>I peer up at the delicate flowers with interest. That\u2019s what real honeysuckle looks like?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no jasmine around here, though,\u201d he says, curiously. \u201cCan you smell it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d I spread my hands vaguely. \u201cMaybe not.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll mention my Jo Malone bath oil at this point. Or, in fact, at any point.</p><p>As we turn out of the drive I realize this is the first time I\u2019ve been out of the Geigers\u2019 grounds since I arrived here\u2014apart from the shopping trip with Trish, when we turned in the opposite direction. And anyway, I was too busy scrabbling for her Celine Dion CD to notice my surroundings. Nathaniel has turned left and is striding easily along the road\u2014but I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m gazing at the sight in front of me, my jaw wide open. This village is absolutely stunning.</p><p>I had no idea.</p><p>I look around, taking in the old, honey-colored stone walls, the rows of ancient cottages with steeply pitched roofs, the little river lined with willow trees. Up ahead is the pub I noticed on the first night, decorated with hanging baskets. I can hear the distant clip-clop of horses\u2019 hooves. Nothing jars. Everything is soft and mellow and feels like it\u2019s been here for hundreds of years.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel has finally noticed I\u2019m pinned to the spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I hurry to join him. \u201cIt\u2019s just such a beautiful place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d I can hear a note of pride in his voice. \u201cGets too many tourists, but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea!\u201d We continue to walk along the street, but I can\u2019t stop looking around, wide-eyed. \u201cLook at the river!

I\u2019ve hardly ever been to the English countryside, I suddenly realize. We always stayed in London or went abroad. I\u2019ve been to Tuscany more times than I can remember, and I once spent six months in New York when Mum was working there. But I\u2019ve never been to the Cotswolds in my life.</p><p>We walk over the river on an old arched stone bridge. At the top I stop to look at the ducks and swans.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just ... gorgeous.\u201d I exhale. \u201cAbsolutely beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see any of this as you arrived?\u201d Nathaniel looks amused. \u201cDid you just appear in a bubble?\u201d</p> <p>I think back to that panicked, dazed, desperate journey.</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI didn\u2019t really notice where I was going.\u201d</p><p>We both watch as a pair of swans sail regally under the little bridge.

It\u2019s already five past ten.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d I say with a little start. \u201cYour mother will be waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no rush,\u201d Nathaniel calls as I hasten down the other side of the bridge. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all day.\u201d He lopes down the bridge. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. You can slow down.\u201d</p> <p>I try to match his relaxed pace. But I\u2019m not used to this easy rhythm. I\u2019m used to striding along crowded pavements, fighting my way, pushing and elbowing.</p><p>\u201cSo, did you grow up here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d He swings into a little cobbled lane. \u201cI came back when my dad got ill. Then he died and I had to sort things out. Take care of Mum. It\u2019s been tough on her. The finances were in a mess\u2014everything was in a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... sorry,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cDo you have any other family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother, Jake. He came back for a week.\u201d Nathaniel hesitates. \u201cHe runs his own computer business. Very successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you mind?\u201d I say. \u201cThat he only stayed a week?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJake\u2019s a busy man. He has other priorities.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel\u2019s voice is as easy as ever, but I can detect a thread of ... something. Maybe I won\u2019t ask any more about his family.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d live here,\u201d I say with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou do live here,\u201d he reminds me.</p><p>I feel a tweak of surprise. I suppose he\u2019s right. Technically, I do.</p><p>I try to process this new thought. I\u2019ve never lived anywhere except London before, apart from my three years at Cambridge and those six months in New York when I was eight. I\u2019m a city person. That\u2019s who I am. That\u2019s who I ... was.</p><p>But already the old me is feeling more distant. When I think back to myself even last week, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m seeing myself through tracing paper. Everything I once prized has been destroyed. I\u2019m still feeling sore and bruised. But at the same time ... my rib cage expands widely as I breathe in the country air, and I suddenly feel a wave of optimism. On impulse, I stop by a huge tree and gaze up into the green-laden branches. As I do so, a memory from English A Level suddenly comes into my mind.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a wonderful Walt Whitman poem about an oak tree.\u201d I lift a hand and tenderly stroke the cool, rough bark. \u201cI saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing. All alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the branches.\u201d</p> <p>I glance over at Nathaniel, half-expecting him to look impressed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a beech,\u201d he says, nodding at the tree.</p><p>Oh. Right.</p><p>I don\u2019t know any poems about beeches.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Nathaniel pushes open an old iron gate and gestures me to go up a stone path toward a little cottage with blue flowered curtains at the windows. \u201cCome and meet your cooking teacher.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel\u2019s mother is nothing like I expected. I was picturing some cozy Mrs. Tiggywinkle character with gray hair in a bun and half-moon spectacles. Instead, I\u2019m looking at a wiry woman with a vivid, pretty face. Her eyes are bright blue, and her graying hair is in plaits on either side of her face. She\u2019s wearing an apron over jeans, T-shirt, and espadrilles, and is vigorously kneading some kind of dough on the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cMum.\u201d Nathaniel grins and pushes me forward into the kitchen. \u201cHere she is. This is Samantha. Samantha\u2014my mum. Iris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha. Welcome.\u201d Iris looks up, and I can see her taking me in, head to foot. \u201cJust let me finish this.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel gestures to me to sit down, and I cautiously take a seat on a wooden chair. The kitchen is at the back of the house and is filled with light and sun. Flowers in earthenware jugs are everywhere. There\u2019s an old-fashioned range and a scrubbed wooden table and a stable door open to the outside. As I\u2019m wondering whether I should be making conversation, a chicken wanders in and starts scratching at the ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, a chicken!\u201d I exclaim before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cYes, a chicken.\u201d I can see Iris looking at me with wry amusement. \u201cNever seen a chicken before?\u201d</p><p>Only in the supermarket chill counter. The chicken comes pecking toward my open-toe-sandaled feet and I quickly tuck them under my chair, trying to look as though I meant to do that anyway.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Iris picks up the dough, shapes it efficiently into a round shape on a tray, opens the heavy oven door, and pops it in. She washes her floury hands at the sink, then turns to face me.</p> <p>\u201cSo. You want to learn how to cook.\u201d Her tone is friendly but businesslike. I sense this is a woman who doesn\u2019t waste words.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I smile. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordon Bleu fancy stuff,\u201d chimes in Nathaniel, who\u2019s leaning against the range.</p><p>\u201cAnd how much cooking have you done before?\u201d Iris dries her hands on a red-checked towel. \u201cNathaniel said none. That can\u2019t be right.\u201d She folds the towel and smiles at me for the first time. \u201cWhat can you make? What are your basics?\u201d</p><p>Her intent blue gaze is making me feel a little nervous. I rack my brains, trying to think of something I can make.</p> <p>\u201cWell ... I can ... I can make ... um ... toast,\u201d I say. \u201cToast would be my basic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToast?\u201d She looks taken aback. \u201cJust toast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd crumpets,\u201d I add quickly. \u201cTea cakes ... anything that goes in a toaster, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about cooking?\u201d She drapes the towel over a steel bar on the range and looks at me more carefully. \u201cWhat about ... an omelet? Surely you can cook an omelet.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Iris\u2019s expression is so incredulous I feel my cheeks flame. \u201cI never really did home economics at school,\u201d I explain. \u201cI never really learned how to make meals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut your mother, surely ... or your grandmother\u2014\u201d She breaks off as I shake my head. \u201cAnyone?\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. Iris exhales sharply as though taking in the situation for the first time.</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t cook anything at all. And what have you promised to make for the Geigers?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>\u201cTrish wanted a week\u2019s worth of menus. So I ... um ... gave her one based on this.\u201d Sheepishly, I get the crumpled Maxim\u2019s menu out of my bag and hand it to her.</p><p>\u201cBraised lamb and baby onion assembl\u00e9 with a fondant potato and goat\u2019s cheese crust, accompanied by cardamom spinach puree,\u201d she reads out, in tones of disbelief.</p><p>I hear a snort and look up to see Nathaniel in fits of laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt was all I had!\u201d I exclaim defensively. \u201cWhat was I going to say, fish fingers and chips?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAssembl\u00e9 is just flannel.\u201d Iris is still perusing the sheet. \u201cThat\u2019s souped-up shepherd\u2019s pie. We can teach you that. And the braised trout with almonds is straightforward enough....\u201d She runs her finger further down the page, then at last looks up, frowning. \u201cI can teach you these dishes, Samantha. But it isn\u2019t going to be easy. If you\u2019ve really never cooked before.\u201d She glances at Nathaniel. \u201cI\u2019m really not sure ...\u201d</p><p>I feel a flicker of alarm. Please don\u2019t say she\u2019s going to back out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a quick learner.\u201d I lean forward. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll work hard. I really, really want to do this.\u201d</p><p>Please. I need this.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d says Iris at last. \u201cLet\u2019s get you cooking.\u201d</p><p>She reaches into a cupboard for a set of weighing scales, and I take the opportunity to reach into my bag for a pad of paper and a pen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d She raises her chin toward the paper.</p><p>\u201cSo I can take notes,\u201d I explain. I write down the date and Cooking lesson no. 1, underline it, then stand at the ready. Iris is slowly shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, cooking isn\u2019t about writing down. It\u2019s about tasting. Feeling. Touching. Smelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod.</p><p>I must remember that. I quickly uncap my pen and scribble down Cooking = all about tasting, smelling, feeling, etc. I cap my pen again, only to see Iris regarding me with incredulity.</p><p>\u201cTasting,\u201d she says, removing my pen and paper from my hands. \u201cNot writing. You need to use your senses. Your instincts.\u201d</p><p>She lifts the lid off a pot gently steaming on the cooker and dips a spoon into it. \u201cTaste this.\u201d</p><p>Gingerly I take the spoon in my mouth. \u201cGravy,\u201d I say at once. \u201cDelicious!\u201d I add politely. Iris shakes her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what you think it is.

She\u2019s waiting for something else.</p> <p>\u201cEr ... meat?\u201d I hazard.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>My mind is blank. I can\u2019t think of anything else. I mean, it\u2019s gravy. What else can you say about gravy?</p><p>\u201cTaste it again.\u201d Iris is relentless. \u201cYou need to try harder.\u201d</p><p>My face is growing hot as I struggle for words. I feel like the dumb kid at the back of the class who can\u2019t do the two-times table.</p> <p>\u201cMeat ... water ...\u201d I try desperately to think what else is in gravy. \u201cFlour!\u201d I say in sudden inspiration.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t taste flour. There\u2019s none in there. Samantha, don\u2019t think about identifying the taste. Just tell me what the sensation is.\u201d Iris holds the spoon out a third time. \u201cTaste it again\u2014and this time close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Close my eyes?</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I take a mouthful and close my eyes obediently.</p><p>\u201cNow. What can you taste?\u201d Iris\u2019s voice is in my ear. \u201cConcentrate on the flavors. Nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Eyes shut tight, I block out everything and focus all my attention on my mouth. All I\u2019m aware of is the warm salty liquid on my tongue. Salt. That\u2019s one flavor. And sweet ... and ... there\u2019s another taste as I swallow it down....</p> <p>It\u2019s almost like colors appearing. First the bright, obvious ones, and then the gentler ones you\u2019d almost miss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s salty and meaty ...\u201d I say slowly, without opening my eyes. \u201cAnd sweet ... and ... and almost fruity? Like cherries?\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes, feeling a bit disoriented. There is Iris, smiling. Behind her I suddenly notice Nathaniel, scrutinizing me intently. I feel a tad flustered. Tasting gravy with your eyes closed is a fairly intimate thing to do, it turns out. I\u2019m not sure I want anyone watching me.</p><p>Iris seems to understand. \u201cNathaniel,\u201d she says briskly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need ingredients for all these dishes.\u201d She scribbles a long list and hands it to him. \u201cRun down and get these for us, love.\u201d</p><p>As he leaves the room, she looks at me with kindness. \u201cThat was much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy George, she\u2019s got it?\u201d I say hopefully, and Iris throws back her head in laughter.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, sweetie, by a long chalk. Here, get a pinny on.\u201d She hands me a red-and-white striped apron and I tie it around my waist, feeling self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good of you to help me,\u201d I venture. Iris is pulling onions and some orange vegetable I don\u2019t recognize out from a bin by the door. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like a challenge.\u201d She takes a knife from a block on the counter. \u201cI get bored. Nathaniel does everything for me. Too much sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut still. You\u2019d never even met me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked the sound of you.\u201d Iris draws down a heavy wooden chopping board from a shelf above. \u201cNathaniel told me how you got yourself out of your mess the other night. That took some spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to do something,\u201d I say ruefully.</p><p>\u201cAnd they offered you a pay rise as a result. Wonderful.\u201d As she smiles, fine lines appear round her eyes like starbursts. \u201cTrish Geiger is a very foolish woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Trish,\u201d I say, feeling a stab of loyalty.</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d Iris nods. \u201cShe\u2019s been very supportive to Nathaniel. But I do sometimes wonder\u2014\u201d She pauses, her hand resting on an onion.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>\u201cWhy she needs quite so much help. Why the full-time housekeeper? What does she do with her time?\u201d She looks genuinely interested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say truthfully. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite worked it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntriguing.\u201d Iris seems lost in thought for a moment. Then she focuses on me again. \u201cSo you\u2019ve taken the Geigers in completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I smile. \u201cThey have no idea who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</p><p>Her question takes me completely by surprise.</p><p>\u201cIs your name really Samantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say in shock.</p><p>\u201cThat was a little blunt,\u201d Iris acknowledges. \u201cBut a girl arrives in the middle of the countryside out of nowhere and takes a job she can\u2019t do ...\u201d She pauses, clearly choosing her words with care. \u201cNathaniel tells me you\u2019ve just got out of a bad relationship?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I mumble, my head bowed, hoping she won\u2019t start probing for details.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. No. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As I look up there\u2019s a thread of understanding in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine by me.\u201d She picks up a knife. \u201cNow let\u2019s start. Roll up your sleeves, tie back your hair, and wash your hands. I\u2019m going to teach you to chop an onion.\u201d</p><p>We spend all weekend cooking.</p><p>I learn to slice an onion finely, turn it the other way, and produce tiny dice. As I first watch Iris wielding her knife I can\u2019t imagine doing the same without chopping off a finger\u2014but after two ruined onions I just about crack it. I learn to chop herbs with a rounded blade. I learn how to rub flour and ground ginger into chunks of meat, then drop them into a spitting hot, cast-iron pan. I learn that pastry has to be made with quick, cold hands, by an open window. I learn the trick of blanching French beans in boiling water before saut\u00e9ing them in butter.</p><p>A week ago I didn\u2019t know what blanching even meant.</p><p>In between cooking I sit on the back step with Iris. We watch the chickens scratch in the dirt, and sip freshly brewed coffee accompanied by a pumpkin muffin or salty, crumbly cheese sandwiched with lettuce in homemade bread.</p> <p>\u201cEat and enjoy,\u201d Iris says each time, handing me my share. My impulse is to gobble down my food\u2014but Iris always shakes her head in dismay. \u201cNot so fast. Take your time! Taste the food!\u201d</p><p>As we\u2019re stirring risotto on Saturday afternoon, Iris puts on a CD of Puccini and tells me how she spent a year in Italy at the age of twenty, learning to cook and speak the language. She tells me how she came home for a holiday, intending to return to Italy after a month. She\u2019d been offered a cooking job there. But she met Benjamin, Nathaniel\u2019s father\u2014and never took the job.</p><p>\u201cHe must have been an extraordinary person for you to do that.\u201d I look up from the risotto.</p><p>\u201cYes, he was,\u201d says Iris, her face softening. \u201cHe was funny and warm ... and full of life. And kind. Most of all, kind.\u201d Then she notices my stationary spoon. \u201cKeep stirring!\u201d</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, under Iris\u2019s calm guidance, I make roast chicken with sage and onion stuffing, steamed broccoli, cumin-scented carrots, and roast potatoes. As I heave the huge roasting tin out of the oven, I pause for a moment and let the warm, chicken-scented air rise over me. I have never smelled a more homey smell in my life. The chicken is golden, its crisp, crackly skin speckled with the pepper I ground on earlier, the juices still sizzling in the tin.</p><p>\u201cGravy time,\u201d Iris calls from the other side of the kitchen. \u201cTake the chicken out and put it on the dish\u2014and cover it up. We need to keep it warm. Now tilt the roasting tin. Can you see those globules of fat floating on the surface? You need to spoon those out.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s finishing the topping on a plum crumble as she speaks. She dots it with butter and pops it into the oven, then seamlessly reaches for a cloth and wipes down the surface. I\u2019ve watched her all day, moving swiftly and precisely around the kitchen, tasting as she goes, fully in control.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She\u2019s by my side, watching as I whisk the gravy. \u201cKeep going ... it\u2019ll thicken in a minute ...\u201d</p><p>I cannot believe I\u2019m making gravy. Making gravy.</p><p>And\u2014like everything I\u2019ve learned to make in this amazing kitchen\u2014it\u2019s working. The ingredients are obeying. The mishmash of chicken juices, stock, and flour is somehow turning into a smooth, fragrant broth.</p><p>\u201cVery good!\u201d says Iris. \u201cNow pour it into this nice warm jug ... sieve out any bits ... See how easy that was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re magic,\u201d I say bluntly. \u201cThat\u2019s why everything works in here. You\u2019re a cooking witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cooking witch! Ha! I like that. Now come on. Pinny off. Time to enjoy what we\u2019ve made.\u201d She takes off her apron and holds out a hand for mine. \u201cNathaniel, have you finished the table?\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel has been in and out of the kitchen all weekend, and I\u2019ve got used to his presence. In fact, I\u2019ve been so taken up with cooking I\u2019ve barely noticed him. Now he\u2019s laying the wooden table with rush mats, old bone-handled cutlery, and soft checked napkins.</p> <p>\u201cWine for the cooks,\u201d says Iris, producing a bottle from the fridge and uncorking it. She pours me a glass, then gestures to the table. \u201cSit, Samantha. You\u2019ve done enough for one weekend. You must be shattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I say automatically. But as I sink down into the nearest chair, I realize for the first time quite how exhausted I am. And how much my feet hurt. I close my eyes and feel myself relax for the first time that day. My arms and back are aching from all the chopping and mixing. My senses have been bombarded with smells and tastes and new sensations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep!\u201d Iris\u2019s voice jolts me back to the present. \u201cThis is our reward!

You can carve.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes to see Nathaniel carrying over the serving dish bearing the roast chicken, and feel a fresh glow of pride. My first roast chicken.

You\u2019ve done splendidly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smile and am about to sip my wine when I realize the other two aren\u2019t moving.</p><p>\u201cAnd to Ben,\u201d Iris adds softly.</p> <p>\u201cOn Sundays we always remember Dad,\u201d Nathaniel explains.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hesitate, then raise my glass.</p><p>\u201cAnd now.\u201d Iris reaches for her knife and fork. \u201cThe moment of truth.\u201d She takes a bite of chicken while I try to hide my nerves.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d She nods at last. \u201cVery good indeed.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop beaming. \u201cReally? It\u2019s ... good?\u201d</p><p>Iris lifts her glass to me. \u201cBy George. She\u2019s got roast chicken, at any rate.\u201d</p> <p>I sit in the glow of the evening light, not talking much but eating and listening to Iris and Nathaniel chat. They tell me stories about Eddie and Trish, about when they tried to buy the local church and turn it into a guest cottage, and I can\u2019t help laughing. Nathaniel outlines his plans for the Geigers\u2019 garden and draws a sketch of the avenue of limes he created at Marchant House. When he gets animated he draws more and more quickly, his hand dwarfing the stub of pencil he\u2019s using. Iris notices me watching in admiration and points out a watercolor of the village pond, hanging on the wall.</p><p>\u201cBen did that.\u201d She nods toward Nathaniel. \u201cHe takes after his father.\u201d</p><p>The atmosphere is so relaxed and easy, so different from any meal I\u2019ve ever had at home. No one\u2019s on the phone. No one\u2019s rushing to get anywhere else. I could sit here all night.</p><p>As the meal is finally drawing to a close I clear my throat. \u201cIris, I just want to say thank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed it.\u201d Iris takes a forkful of plum crumble. \u201cI always did enjoy bossing people about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut really. I\u2019m so grateful. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without your help. Is there any way I can repay you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d Iris takes a sip of wine and dabs her mouth. \u201cNext weekend we\u2019ll make lasagne. And gnocchi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext weekend?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ve finished? I\u2019ve only just started on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... I can\u2019t take up all your weekends ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not graduating you yet,\u201d she says with a cheerful asperity. \u201cSo you have no choice. Now, what else do you need help with? Cleaning? Washing?\u201d</p><p>I feel a twinge of embarrassment. She clearly knows exactly how much of a mess I got myself into the other day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure how to use the washing machine,\u201d I admit at last.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll cover that.\u201d She nods. \u201cI\u2019ll pop up to the house when they\u2019re out and have a look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t sew on buttons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cButtons ...\u201d She reaches for a piece of paper and a pencil, and writes it down, still munching on the crumble. \u201cI suppose you can\u2019t hem either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHemming ...\u201d She scribbles it down. \u201cWhat about ironing?\u201d She looks up, suddenly alert. \u201cYou must have had to iron. How did you wriggle out of that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending the clothes out to Stacey Nicholson,\u201d I confess. \u201cIn the village. She charges three pounds a shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStacey Nicholson?\u201d Iris puts her pencil down. \u201cThat flibbertigibbet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her ad she said she was an experienced laundress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fifteen years old!\u201d Galvanized, Iris pushes back her chair. \u201cSamantha, you are not paying Stacey Nicholson to do your ironing. You\u2019re going to learn how to do it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you. Anyone can iron.\u201d She reaches into a little side room, pulls out an old ironing board covered in flowery material, and sets it up, then beckons me over. \u201cWhat do you have to iron?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMr. Geiger\u2019s shirts, mainly,\u201d I say, nervously joining her at the ironing board.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She plugs in an iron and turns the dial. \u201cHot, for cotton. Wait for the iron to heat up. No point beginning till it\u2019s at the right temperature. Now, I\u2019ll show you the right way to tackle a shirt....\u201d</p><p>She rootles, frowning, in a pile of clean laundry in the little room. \u201cShirts ... shirts ... Nathaniel, take off your shirt a moment.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. As I glance at Nathaniel I see he has stiffened too.</p> <p>\u201cMum!\u201d He gives an awkward laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be ridiculous, love,\u201d says Iris impatiently. \u201cYou can take off your shirt for a moment. No one\u2019s embarrassed. You\u2019re not embarrassed, are you, Samantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ...\u201d My voice is a little grainy for some reason. \u201cUm ... no, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, this is your steam.\u201d She presses a button on the iron and a jet of steam shoots into the air. \u201cAlways check that your steam compartment has water.... Nathaniel! I\u2019m waiting!\u201d</p><p>Through the steam I can see Nathaniel slowly unbuttoning his shirt. I catch a flash of smooth tanned skin and hastily lower my gaze.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not be adolescent about this. So he\u2019s taking off his shirt. It\u2019s no big deal.</p><p>He tosses the shirt to his mother, who catches it deftly. My eyes are studiously fixed downward.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to look at him.</p><p>\u201cStart with the collar.\u201d Iris is smoothing the shirt out on the ironing board. \u201cNow, you don\u2019t have to press hard.\u201d She guides my hand as the iron glides over the fabric. \u201cKeep a smooth touch ...\u201d</p><p>This is ridiculous. I\u2019m an adult, mature woman. I can look at a man with no shirt on without falling to bits. What I\u2019ll do is ... take a casual peek. And get this out of my mind.</p><p>\u201cNow the yoke ...\u201d Iris turns the shirt around on the board and I start pressing again. \u201cVery good ... onto the cuffs now ...\u201d</p> <p>I lift the shirttail to flip it over\u2014and as I do so, accidentally-on-purpose raise my eyes.</p><p>Sweet Jesus.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure the whole getting-it-out-of-my-mind plan is going to work after all.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Iris grabs the iron from my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re scorching the shirt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I come to. \u201cSorry. I ... I lost concentration for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cheeks seem very flushed.\u201d Iris puts a curious hand to my cheek. \u201cAre you all right, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be the ... um ... steam.\u201d I start ironing again, my face like a furnace. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>At last I shake out his ironed shirt, perfectly done with all the creases in the right places.</p> <p>\u201cVery good!\u201d says Iris, applauding. \u201cAfter some practice you\u2019ll be able to do that in four minutes flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks great.\u201d Nathaniel smiles, holding out a hand. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK!\u201d I manage in a strangled squawk, and hastily look away again, my heart thumping.</p><p>Great. Just great. One glimpse of his body and I have a full-blown crush.</p><p>I honestly thought I was a bit deeper than that.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend.</p><p>I managed to get that information out of Trish on Sunday night, under the guise of asking about all the neighbors. There was some girl in Gloucester, apparently\u2014but that was all over months ago. The way is clear. I just need a strategy.</p><p>As I shower and get dressed the next morning, I\u2019m totally fixated by thoughts of Nathaniel. I\u2019m aware I\u2019ve reverted to the behavior of a fourteen-year-old, that next I\u2019ll be doodling Samantha loves Nathaniel with a love heart dotting the i. But I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not as though being a mature, levelheaded professional was working out so great for me.</p><p>I brush my hair, looking out at the misty green fields, and feel inexplicably lighthearted. I have no reason to feel this way. On paper, everything is still catastrophic. My fast-track career is over. My family has no idea where I am. I\u2019m earning a fraction of what I used to, for a job that involves picking up other people\u2019s dirty underwear off the floor.</p><p>And yet I find myself humming as I straighten my bed.</p><p>My life has changed, and I\u2019m changing with it. It\u2019s as if the old conventional monochrome Samantha has faded away into a paper doll. I\u2019ve thrown her into the water and she\u2019s melting away to nothing. And in her place is a new me. A me with possibilities.</p><p>I\u2019ve never gone after a man before. But then, until yesterday I\u2019d never basted a chicken before. If I can do that, I can ask a man out, surely? The old Samantha would have sat back and waited to be approached. Well, not the new Samantha. I\u2019ve seen the dating shows on TV; I know the rules. It\u2019s all about looks and body language and flirty conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walk over to the mirror and, for the first time since I\u2019ve arrived here, examine my appearance with an honest, unflinching eye.</p><p>At once I regret it. Ignorance was better.</p><p>For a start, how can anyone look good in a blue nylon overall? I reach for a belt, fasten it around my middle, and hitch up my overall till the skirt is about three inches shorter, like we used to at school.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say to my reflection, and casually toss back my hair. \u201cHi, Nathaniel. Hi, Nat.\u201d</p> <p>All I need now is lots of black eyeliner badly applied, and I\u2019ll be back to my fourteen-year-old self in every single way.</p><p>I reach for my makeup bag and spend about ten minutes alternately applying and removing makeup, until I\u2019ve got something that looks natural and subtle, yet defined. Or else like I\u2019ve wasted ten minutes. I have no idea.</p><p>Now to the body language. I wrinkle up my forehead, trying to remember the rules from TV. If a woman is attracted to a man, her pupils will dilate. Also, she will unconsciously lean forward, laugh at his jokes, and expose her wrists and palms.</p><p>Experimentally I lean toward my reflection, holding out my hands as I do so.</p><p>I look like Jesus.</p> <p>I try adding a flirty laugh. \u201cHa ha ha!\u201d I exclaim aloud. \u201cYou just crack me up!\u201d</p><p>Now I look like a cheerful Jesus.</p><p>I\u2019m really not sure this is adding to my chances.</p><p>I head downstairs and draw back the curtains, letting in the bright morning sunshine. I\u2019m picking up the post from the doormat when the doorbell rings. A guy in uniform, holding a clipboard, is standing outside, a van behind him in the drive. \u201cDelivery from Professional Chef\u2019s Equipment Direct,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere shall I put the boxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say apprehensively. \u201cIn the kitchen, please. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Professional Chef\u2019s Equipment. I guess that would be for me, the Professional Chef.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that van, Samantha?\u201d calls Trish, tottering down the stairs in a dressing gown and high-heeled mules. \u201cIs it flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the cookery equipment you ordered for me!\u201d Somehow I summon up an enthusiastic front.</p><p>\u201cOh, good!\u201d Trish is delighted. \u201cNow you\u2019ll be able to stun us with your cooking! It\u2019s roasted sea bream with julienned vegetables tonight, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes!\u201d I gulp. \u201cI suppose it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your backs!\u201d</p><p>We both jump aside as two deliverymen troop past with boxes stacked high in their arms. I follow them into the kitchen and watch the growing pile in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNow, we bought you everything,\u201d says Trish, as though reading my mind. \u201cGo on! Open them! I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t wait!\u201d</p><p>I fetch a knife and start unpacking the first box, while Trish slits the plastic on another. Out of the profusion of foam peanuts and bubble wrap, I lift a gleaming stainless-steel ... something. What on earth is this? I glance quickly at the label on the side of the box. Savarin Mold.</p> <p>\u201cA ... savarin mold!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cHow marvelous. Just what I ... wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only got eight of those,\u201d says Trish, with concern. \u201cIs that enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d I look at it helplessly. \u201cThat should be plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, the saucepans.\u201d Trish has ripped open a box of shiny aluminum pans and holds out one to me expectantly. \u201cWe were told these were the very best quality. Would you agree? As a trained chef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just have a look,\u201d I say, trying to sound professional. I heft the saucepan appraisingly, then study the bottom and, for good measure, ping the surface with my fingernail.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s a nice-quality pan,\u201d I say at last. \u201cYou chose well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good!\u201d Trish beams, delving into another box. \u201cAnd look at this!\u201d She scatters foam to reveal a weird-shaped gadget with a wooden handle. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen one of these! What is it, Samantha?\u201d</p><p>Yikes. What\u2019s that? It looks like a cross between a sieve, a grater, and a whisk. I glance quickly at the box for clues, but the label has been torn off.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d says Trish again.</p><p>\u201cThis is used for a highly specialized cooking technique,\u201d I say at last. \u201cHighly specialized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do with it? Show me!\u201d She thrusts the handle at me.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I take the thing from her. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of ... whisking ... circular motion ... keep the wrist light ...\u201d I beat the air briskly a few times. \u201cKind of like that. It\u2019s difficult to show properly without the ... um ... truffles.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it called?\u201d says Trish, agog.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always known it as a ... truffle beater,\u201d I say at last. \u201cBut it could have some ... other name as well. Why don\u2019t I make you a cup of coffee?\u201d I add quickly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll unpack everything else later.\u201d</p><p>I switch on the kettle, reach for the coffeepot, and glance out the window. Nathaniel is striding across the lawn.</p><p>Oh, God. Full crush alert. Full, one hundred percent, old-fashioned adolescent crush.</p> <p>I cannot take my eyes off him. The sunlight is catching the ends of his tawny hair and he\u2019s wearing ancient, faded jeans. As I watch, he picks up some huge sack of something, swings it round easily, and throws it onto something that might be a compost heap.</p><p>My mind is suddenly filled with a fantasy of him picking me up in exactly the same way. Swinging me round easily in his big strong arms. I mean, I can\u2019t be that much heavier than a sack of potatoes\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo, how was your weekend off, Samantha?\u201d Trish breaks my thoughts. \u201cWe barely saw you! Did you go into town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to Nathaniel\u2019s house,\u201d I reply without thinking.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel?\u201d Trish sounds astonished. \u201cThe gardener? Why?\u201d</p> <p>Immediately I realize my huge mistake. I can\u2019t exactly say, \u201cTo have cooking lessons.\u201d I try to fabricate an instant, convincing reason.</p><p>\u201cJust ... to say hello, really,\u201d I say at last, aware that I sound tongue-tied. And also that my cheeks are turning pink.</p><p>Trish\u2019s face suddenly snaps in comprehension and her eyes open very wide.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d she says. \u201cHow adorable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s not ... Honestly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d Trish cuts me off emphatically. \u201cI won\u2019t say a word. I am discretion itself.\u201d She puts a finger to her lips. \u201cYou can rely on me.\u201d</p> <p>Before I can say anything else she picks up her coffee and heads out of the kitchen. I sit down amid all the kitchen stuff and packaging and fiddle with the truffle beater.</p><p>That was awkward. But I suppose it doesn\u2019t really matter. As long as she doesn\u2019t say anything inappropriate to Nathaniel.</p><p>Then I realize I\u2019m being stupid. Of course she\u2019ll say something inappropriate to Nathaniel. She\u2019ll make some oh-so-subtle innuendo, and then who knows what he\u2019ll think. This could be really embarrassing. This could ruin everything.</p><p>I must go and make the situation quite clear to him. That Trish misunderstood me, and I do not have a crush on him.</p><p>While, obviously, making it clear that I do.</p><p>I force myself to wait until I\u2019ve done breakfast for Trish and Eddie, tidied the new kitchen equipment away, mixed up some olive oil and lemon zest, and put tonight\u2019s sea bream fillets into it, just as Iris taught me.</p><p>Then I hitch up my uniform a bit more, add some more eyeliner for luck, and head out into the garden, holding a basket I found in the larder. If Trish wants to know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m gathering herbs for cooking.</p><p>I find Nathaniel in the orchard behind the old wall, standing on a ladder, tying some rope round a tree. As I make my way toward him I\u2019m ridiculously nervous. My mouth feels dry\u2014and did my legs just wobble?</p> <p>God, you\u2019d think I\u2019d have some poise. You\u2019d think being a lawyer for seven years would have prepared me a bit better. Ignoring my jitters as best I can, I walk up to the ladder, toss back my hair, and wave up to him, trying not to squint in the sun.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Nathaniel smiles back. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks! Much better. No disasters yet ...\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. I suddenly realize I\u2019m gazing a little too hard at his hands as they tighten the rope. \u201cI was just after some ... rosemary.\u201d I gesture to my basket. \u201cIf you have any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll cut you some.\u201d He jumps down off the ladder and we walk along the path toward the herb garden.</p><p>It\u2019s totally silent, down here away from the house, apart from the odd buzzing insect and the crunch of gravel on the path. I try to think of something light and easy to say, but my brain is blank.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... hot,\u201d I manage at last.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Nathaniel nods, and steps up easily over the stone wall into the herb garden. I try to follow him with a light springing step and catch my foot on the wall. Ow. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d Nathaniel turns.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Even though my foot is throbbing with agony. \u201cWow. This is amazing!\u201d I look around the garden in genuine admiration. It\u2019s laid out in a hexagonal shape, with little paths between the sections. Tiny dark green hedges act as borders, and topiary spheres mark the corners. Lavender stems are gently waving in old stone planters, interspersed with tubs of some tiny white flower that smells of honey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you do all this?\u201d I peer at a bed of plants that I think might be oregano. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely stunning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.

That\u2019s it? That\u2019s all he has to say on the subject?</p> <p>\u201cActually, I\u2019d like some more,\u201d I say, and he turns back to the bush. \u201cSo ... isn\u2019t it ridiculous?\u201d I add, trying to prod him into a proper answer.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course.\u201d At last Nathaniel looks at me properly. \u201cYou won\u2019t be wanting to get into anything for a while. Not so soon after a bad relationship.\u201d</p><p>I look at him blankly. What on earth\u2014</p><p>Oh, yes. My bad relationship.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cYes, that.\u201d</p><p>Dammit.</p> <p>Why did I go along with the bad relationship story? What was I thinking?</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your rosemary.\u201d Nathaniel puts a fragrant bundle into my arms. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... yes!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cCould I have some mint?\u201d</p><p>I watch as he moves carefully over the rows of herbs to where mint is growing in large stone containers.</p><p>\u201cActually ...\u201d I force myself to sound careless. \u201cActually, the relationship wasn\u2019t that bad. In fact, I think I\u2019ve pretty much got over it.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel looks up, shading his eyes against the sun. \u201cYou\u2019ve got over a seven-year relationship in a week?\u201d</p><p>Now that he puts it like that, it does sound a bit implausible. I cast around quickly in my mind.</p><p>\u201cI have great reserves of resilience,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI\u2019m like ... rubber.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRubber,\u201d he echoes, his expression unreadable.</p><p>Was rubber a bad choice of word? No. Come on, rubber is sexy.</p><p>Nathaniel adds the mint to the rosemary in my arms. \u201cMum said ...\u201d He pauses awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, a little breathless. They\u2019ve been talking about me?</p><p>\u201cMum wondered if you\u2019d been ... badly treated.\u201d He shifts his gaze away. \u201cYou\u2019re so tense and twitchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tense and twitchy!\u201d I retort at once.</p><p>Well, maybe that was a little tense and twitchy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naturally twitchy,\u201d I explain. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t badly treated or anything like that. I was just ... I always felt ... trapped.\u201d</p><p>The word comes out to my own surprise. I have a flash of my life at Carter Spink. Constantly at the beck and call of senior partners. Practically living at the office some weeks. Taking piles of work home with me. Answering e-mails at every hour. Maybe I did feel a little bit trapped.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m fine now.\u201d I shake back my hair. \u201cReady to move on ... and start a new relationship ... or something more casual ... whatever.\u201d</p><p>I gaze up at him, trying as hard as I can to dilate my pupils and casually lifting my hand to my ear for good measure. There\u2019s a still, tense silence, broken only by the buzzing of insects.</p><p>\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t rush into anything new,\u201d Nathaniel says. He moves away without meeting my eye and starts examining the leaves on a shrub.</p><p>There\u2019s a stiffness in his back. I feel a rush of blood to my face. He\u2019s letting me down lightly. He doesn\u2019t want to go out with me.</p><p>Aargh. This is hideous. Here I am, with my hitched-up skirt and eyeliner, employing all the body language I know, basically just offering myself to him. And he\u2019s trying to let me know he\u2019s not interested.</p><p>I\u2019m mortified. I have to get away from here. From him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cIt\u2019s ... far too soon to think about anything like that. In fact, it would be a terrible idea. I\u2019m just going to focus on my new job. Cooking and ... and ... so forth. I must get on. Thanks for the herbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d says Nathaniel.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well. I\u2019ll see you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clasping the bundle more tightly, I turn on my heel, step over the wall, managing not to bash my foot this time, and stride back along the gravel path up to the house.</p><p>I am beyond embarrassed. So much for a whole new Samantha.</p><p>That is the last time I ever go after a man, ever. My original strategy of waiting politely, being ignored, and then being passed over for someone else was a million times better.</p><p>Anyway. I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s for the best, really. Because I do have to concentrate on my work. As soon as I get back to the house I set up the ironing board, plug in the iron, turn on the radio, and make a nice strong cup of coffee. This is going to be my focus from now on. Getting my tasks for the day done. Not some ridiculous crush on the gardener. I\u2019m being paid to do a job here and I\u2019m going to do it.</p> <p>By midmorning I\u2019ve ironed ten shirts, put a load of laundry on, and hoovered the conservatory. By lunchtime, I\u2019ve dusted and hoovered all the downstairs rooms and polished all the mirrors with vinegar. By teatime, I\u2019ve put on another load of laundry, shredded my vegetables in the food processor, measured out the wild rice to be steamed, and carefully prepared four filo pastry cases for my tartes de fruits, as Iris taught me.</p><p>By seven o\u2019clock I\u2019ve thrown away one lot of burned filo cases, baked another four, topped them with strawberries, and finished with heated-up apricot jam. I\u2019ve pan-fried the vegetable shreds in olive oil and garlic till they\u2019re soft. I\u2019ve blanched my French beans. I\u2019ve put the sea bream in the oven. I\u2019ve also taken more than a few sips of vermouth meant for the coulis, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.</p><p>My face is bright red and my heart is beating fast and I\u2019m moving round the kitchen in a kind of speeded-up reality\u2014but I kind of feel OK. In fact, I almost feel exhilarated. Here I am, actually cooking a meal all on my own\u2014and I\u2019m just about on top of it! Apart from the mushroom fiasco. But they\u2019re safely in the bin.</p><p>I\u2019ve laid the dining table with the Minton china and put candles in the silver candlesticks. I\u2019ve got a bottle of Prosecco waiting in the fridge and heated plates waiting in the oven, and I\u2019ve even put Trish\u2019s CD of Enrique Iglesias love songs in the player. I feel like I\u2019m throwing my first dinner party.</p><p>With a pleasant flutter in my stomach, I smooth down my apron and push open the kitchen door. \u201cMrs. Geiger? Mr. Geiger?\u201d</p> <p>What I need is a big gong.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Geiger?\u201d I try again.</p><p>There\u2019s absolutely no reply. I would have thought they\u2019d be hovering around the kitchen by now. I fetch a glass and a fork and tinkle one loudly in the other.</p><p>Nothing. Where are they?</p><p>I investigate the rooms on the ground floor, but they\u2019re all empty. Cautiously, I advance up the stairs.</p><p>Maybe they\u2019re having a Joy of Sex moment. Should I retreat?</p> <p>\u201cEr ... Mrs. Geiger?\u201d I call hesitantly. \u201cDinner\u2019s served.\u201d</p><p>I can hear voices from the end of the corridor, as I take a few more steps forward. \u201cMrs. Geiger?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the bedroom door is violently flung open.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s money for?\u201d comes Trish\u2019s shrill voice. \u201cJust tell me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you what money\u2019s for!\u201d Eddie is yelling back. \u201cNever have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you understood anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand!\u201d Eddie sounds apoplectic. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>Ooooookay. So probably not a Joy of Sex moment. I start backing away silently on tiptoe\u2014but it\u2019s too late.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Portugal?\u201d Trish shrieks. \u201cDo you remember that?\u201d She strides out of the room in a whirlwind of pink and stops short as she sees me.</p><p>\u201cUm ... dinner\u2019s ready,\u201d I mumble, my eyes fixed on the carpet. \u201cMadam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mention bloody Portugal one more bloody time\u2014\u201d Eddie comes marching out of the room.</p><p>\u201cEddie!\u201d Trish cuts him off savagely, then gives a tiny nod toward me. \u201cPas devant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Eddie, scowling.</p><p>\u201cPas devant! Les ... les ...\u201d She wheels her hands, as though trying to conjure the missing word.</p><p>\u201cDomestiques?\u201d I offer awkwardly.</p><p>Trish shoots me a flinty look, then draws herself up with dignity. \u201cI shall be in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my bloody room too!\u201d says Eddie furiously, but the door has already banged shut.</p><p>\u201cErm ... I\u2019ve made dinner ...\u201d I venture, but Eddie stalks to the stairs, ignoring me.</p><p>I feel a swell of dismay. If the sea bream isn\u2019t eaten soon it\u2019ll get all shriveled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMrs. Geiger?\u201d I knock on her door. \u201cI\u2019m just worried the dinner will spoil\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d comes back her muffled voice. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for eating.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the door in disbelief. I\u2019ve spent all bloody day cooking dinner for them. It\u2019s all ready. The candles are lit, the plates are in the oven. They can\u2019t just not eat it.</p><p>\u201cYou have to eat!\u201d I cry out, and Eddie stops, halfway down the stairs. The bedroom door opens, and Trish looks out in astonishment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says.</p><p>OK. Play this one carefully.</p><p>\u201cEveryone has to eat,\u201d I improvise. \u201cIt\u2019s a human need. So why not discuss your differences over a meal? Or put them on hold! Have a glass of wine and relax and agree not to mention ... er ... Portugal.\u201d</p><p>As I say the word, I can feel their hackles rising.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who mentioned it,\u201d growls Eddie. \u201cI thought the subject was closed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI only mentioned it because you were so insensitive.\u201d Trish brushes a sudden tear from her eye. \u201cHow do you think I feel, being your ... trophy wife?\u201d</p><p>Trophy?</p><p>I must not laugh.</p><p>\u201cTrish.\u201d To my astonishment, Eddie is hurrying up the stairs. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever say that.\u201d He grips her shoulders and looks her fiercely in the eye. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a partnership. You know that. Ever since Sydenham.\u201d</p><p>First Portugal, now Sydenham. One day I have to sit Trish down with a bottle of wine and coax her entire life history out of her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d whispers Trish.</p> <p>She\u2019s gazing up at Eddie as though no one else exists, and I suddenly feel a little pang. They really are in love. I can see the antagonism slowly melting away in their eyes. It\u2019s like witnessing a chemical reaction in a test tube.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and eat,\u201d says Eddie finally. \u201cSamantha was right. We should have a nice meal together. Sit down and talk it over.\u201d</p><p>Thank God for that. The sea bream will still be just about OK.... I only need to put the sauce in a jug.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s.\u201d Trish sniffs. \u201cSamantha, we\u2019ll be out to dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>My smile freezes on my face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about cooking for us,\u201d puts in Eddie, giving me a jovial pat. \u201cYou can have a night off!\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cBut ... I\u2019ve cooked!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Well ... never mind.\u201d Trish makes a vague dismissive gesture with her hand. \u201cEat it yourself.\u201d</p><p>No. No. They cannot do this to me.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all ready for you downstairs! Roasted fish ... and julienned vegetables ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere shall we go?\u201d says Trish to Eddie, not listening to a word. \u201cShall we try and get in at The Mill House?\u201d</p><p>As I stand there in stupefaction, she disappears into the bedroom, followed by Eddie. The door closes and I\u2019m left on the landing.</p><p>My dinner party\u2019s ruined.</p><p>When they\u2019ve roared out of the drive in Eddie\u2019s Porsche, I go into the dining room and slowly clear everything up. I put away the crystal glasses and fold up the napkins and blow out the candles. Then I head back into the kitchen and look for a moment at all my dishes, set out ready for action. My sauce, bubbling away on the hob. My carved lemon-slice garnishes. I was so proud of everything.</p><p>Well, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.</p><p>My sea bream are looking pretty sorry for themselves, but I slip one onto a plate anyway and pour myself a glass of wine. I sit at the table, cut myself a piece, and raise it to my mouth. Then I put my knife and fork down without even tasting it. I\u2019m not hungry.</p><p>A whole wasted afternoon. And tomorrow I\u2019ve got to do it all over again. The thought makes me feel like sinking my head down onto my arms and never looking up again.</p><p>What am I doing here?</p><p>I mean, really. What am I doing? Why am I not walking out right now and getting on a train back to London?</p><p>As I\u2019m slumped there I become aware of a faint tapping at the open door, and I look up to see Nathaniel leaning in the door frame, holding his rucksack. Remembering this morning\u2019s encounter, I feel a flash of embarrassment. Without quite meaning to, I swivel my chair away slightly and fold my arms.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, with a tiny If-you-think-I\u2019m-interested-in-you-you\u2019re-much-mistaken shrug.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d come and see if you needed any help.\u201d His eyes travel around the kitchen, at the dishes of untouched food. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t eat it. They went out to dinner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nathaniel stares at me for a moment, then shakes his head. \u201cAfter you spent all day cooking for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s their food. Their house. They can do what they like.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to sound careless and matter-of-fact. But the disappointment remains heavy inside me. Nathaniel puts down his rucksack and inspects the sea bream. \u201cLooks good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like congealed, overcooked fish,\u201d I correct him.</p> <p>\u201cMy favorite.\u201d He grins, but I\u2019m not in the mood for his good humor.</p><p>\u201cHave some, then.\u201d I gesture at the dish. \u201cNo one else is going to eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Shame to waste it.\u201d He helps himself to everything, piling his plate ludicrously high, then pours himself a glass of wine and sits down opposite me at the table.</p><p>\u201cTo you.\u201d Nathaniel raises his glass. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously, Samantha.\u201d He waits patiently until I drag my eyes up from the floor. \u201cWhether they ate it or not, this is a real achievement. I mean, bloody hell. Remember the last dinner you cooked in this kitchen?\u201d</p><p>I give a reluctant smile. \u201cThe lamb of doom, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chickpeas. I\u2019ll never forget those.\u201d He takes a bite of fish. \u201cThis is good, by the way.\u201d</p><p>An image comes to me of those tiny blackened bullets; myself running around in a frenzy; the meringue dripping on the floor ... and in spite of everything I want to giggle. I\u2019ve already learned so much since then.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, I\u2019d have been OK that night,\u201d I say nonchalantly. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t insisted on helping me. I had it all under control till you got in my way.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel puts his fork down, still munching, his blue eyes crinkled up with something\u2014amusement, maybe. I can feel the telltale heat rising in my cheeks, and as I glance downward I notice that my hands are resting on the table, palms up.</p> <p>And I\u2019m leaning forward, I realize in sudden horror. My pupils are probably half a mile wide too. My body language could not be any clearer if I wrote I fancy you in felt-tip on my forehead.</p><p>I hastily remove my hands to my lap, sit up straight, and adopt a stony expression. I haven\u2019t got over this morning\u2019s mortification. In fact, I might take the opportunity to regain my equilibrium.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d I begin, just as Nathaniel starts speaking too.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d He takes another bite of fish. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cAfter our ... conversation this morning. I was just going to say that you\u2019re quite right about relationships. Obviously I\u2019m not ready for anything new yet. Or even interested. At all.\u201d</p><p>There. At least I\u2019ve salvaged my dignity a little.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d I ask, pouring more wine into his glass.</p><p>\u201cI was going to ask you out,\u201d says Nathaniel, and I nearly flood the table with wine.</p> <p>He what?</p><p>The body language worked?</p><p>\u201cBut not to worry.\u201d He takes a gulp of wine. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Backtrack. I need to backtrack, very, very quickly. Yet subtly, so he doesn\u2019t actually notice I\u2019m backtracking.</p><p>Oh, bugger it, I\u2019ll just be inconsistent. I\u2019m a woman, I\u2019m allowed to be.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel,\u201d I force myself to say calmly. \u201cI\u2019d love to go out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He looks unperturbed. \u201cHow\u2019s Friday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>As I grin back, I suddenly realize I\u2019m hungry. I pull my plate of sea bream toward me, pick up my knife and fork, and begin to eat.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>I get to Friday morning without any major calamities. At least, none that the Geigers know about.</p><p>There was the vegetable-risotto disaster on Tuesday\u2014but thank God I managed to get a last-minute substitute from the caterers. There was a peach camisole that, in hindsight, should have been ironed on a lower setting. There was the Dartington vase that I broke while trying to dust with the vacuum-cleaner attachment. But no one seems to have noticed it\u2019s gone yet. And the new one should arrive tomorrow.</p><p>So far, this week has cost me only two hundred pounds, which is a vast improvement on last week. I may even start making a profit before too long.</p><p>I\u2019m putting Eddie\u2019s damp underwear in the dryer, averting my eyes as best I can, when I hear Trish calling me.</p><p>\u201cSamantha! Where are you?\u201d She doesn\u2019t sound pleased. What\u2019s she discovered? \u201cI can\u2019t have you walking around like that anymore.\u201d Trish arrives at the door of the utility room, shaking her head vigorously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I peer at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour hair.\u201d She makes a face.</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I touch the bleached patch with a grimace. \u201cI meant to get it done at the weekend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having it done now,\u201d she cuts across me. \u201cMy super hairdresser\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cBut ...

I should have known she couldn\u2019t be that stupid\u2014</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done to it.\u201d Trish pushes open her bedroom door. \u201cBut it looks marvelous.

Thought you\u2019d try the streaky look?\u201d She gives a raucous laugh at her own joke.</p><p>\u201cIt was a ... bleach accident.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAccident!\u201d She runs her fingers through my hair, tsking all the while. \u201cWell, it can\u2019t stay this color. We\u2019d better go a nice blond. You don\u2019t mind going blond, do you, dear?\u201d</p><p>Blond?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been blond,\u201d I say in alarm. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the coloring for it.\u201d She\u2019s brushing my hair out.</p><p>\u201cWell, as long as it\u2019s not too blond,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cNot ... you know, that fake, tarty, platinum blond ...\u201d</p><p>I trail off as I realize that the other two women in the room have fake, tarty, platinum-blond hair.</p><p>\u201cOr ... um ...\u201d I swallow. \u201cWhatever you think. Really.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the chair, wrap a towel around my shoulders, and try not to flinch as Annabel briskly pastes some chemical-smelling goo on my head and layers in what feels like a thousand bits of silver foil.</p> <p>Blond. Yellow hair. Barbie dolls.</p><p>Oh, God. What am I doing?</p><p>\u201cI think this was a mistake,\u201d I say abruptly, trying to get out of my chair. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a natural blonde\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax!\u201d Annabel clamps down on my shoulders, forcing me back into my seat, and puts a magazine in my hand. Behind, Trish is opening a bottle of champagne. \u201cYou\u2019ll look lovely. Pretty girl like you should do something with her hair. Now, read us our signs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSigns?\u201d I say in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cHoroscopes!\u201d Annabel tsks again. \u201cNot the brightest penny, is she?\u201d she adds in an undertone to Trish.</p><p>\u201cShe is a little dim,\u201d Trish murmurs back discreetly. \u201cBut marvelous at laundry.\u201d</p><p>So this is what being a lady of leisure is like. Sitting with foil in your hair, drinking Buck\u2019s Fizz, and reading glossy magazines. I haven\u2019t read any magazines except The Lawyer since I was about thirteen. Normally I spend my hairdresser\u2019s appointments typing e-mails or reading contracts.</p><p>But I simply can\u2019t relax. By the time Annabel is blow-drying my hair, my entire body is seized up in fear.</p><p>I can\u2019t be blond. It\u2019s just not who I am.</p><p>\u201cThere we are!\u201d Annabel gives a final blast and switches the hair dryer off. There\u2019s silence. I can\u2019t open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cMuch better!\u201d Trish says approvingly.</p><p>I slowly open one eye. Then the other.</p><p>My hair isn\u2019t blond. It\u2019s caramel. It\u2019s warm caramel with streaks of honey and the tiniest threads of gold. As I move my head it shimmers.</p><p>I think I might cry.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe me, did you?\u201d Annabel raises her eyebrows at me in the mirror, a satisfied smile at her lips. \u201cThought I didn\u2019t know what I was doing?\u201d</p><p>She can so obviously read my mind, I feel abashed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d I say, finding my voice. \u201cI\u2019m ... Thank you so much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m entranced by my reflection, by my new, glowing, caramel, honey self. I look alive. I look colorful.</p><p>I\u2019m never going back to the way I looked before. Never.</p><p>My pleasure doesn\u2019t fade. Even when I\u2019ve gone downstairs again and am pushing the Hoover round the drawing room, I\u2019m totally preoccupied by my new hair. As I pass any shiny surface, I stop to admire myself and flick up my hair so it cascades back down in a caramelly shower.</p><p>Vacuum under the rug. Flick. Vacuum under the coffee table. Flick. Flick.</p> <p>It never even occurred to me to dye my hair before. What else have I been missing out on?</p><p>\u201cAh, Samantha.\u201d I look up to see Eddie coming into the room, wearing a navy jacket and tie. \u201cI\u2019m having a meeting in the dining room. I\u2019d like you to make some coffee and bring it in to my guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I curtsy. \u201cHow many of you are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour altogether. And some biscuits. Snacks. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>Huh. He didn\u2019t even notice my hair. In fact, he looks hyped up and red in the face. I wonder what this meeting is. As I head to the kitchen I glance curiously out the front window and see an unfamiliar red Mercedes Series 5 parked in the drive, next to a silver convertible BMW and a dark green Rover.</p><p>Hmm. Probably not the local vicar, then. Maybe it\u2019s something to do with his company.</p><p>I make a pot of coffee, put it on a tray, add a plate of biscuits and some muffins I bought for tea. Then I head to the dining room and knock.</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d</p><p>I push the door open to see Eddie sitting with four men in suits, around the dining-room table, each with a thick, open file before him. Sitting beside Eddie is a plumpish man in a soft brown jacket and horn-rimmed glasses. Directly opposite him is a guy with chiseled, good-looking features, wearing an expensive-looking suit.</p><p>\u201cSo just a few amendments,\u201d the chiseled man is saying as I approach the table. \u201cNothing that should concern anyone!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour coffee,\u201d I murmur in deferential tones.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Samantha.\u201d Eddie looks puffed up, like the lord of the manor. \u201cIf you could serve it out?\u201d</p><p>I put the tray down on the sideboard and distribute the cups among the men. As I\u2019m doing so I can\u2019t help glancing at the papers on the table\u2014and immediately recognize them as contracts.</p><p>\u201cEr ... white or black?\u201d I say to a burly, red-haired guy in a blazer.</p><p>\u201cWhite, thanks.\u201d He doesn\u2019t even acknowledge me. While I pour the coffee, I have another casual look. It looks like some kind of property investment deal. Is Eddie sinking his money into something?</p><p>\u201cBiscuit?\u201d I offer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sweet enough.\u201d The red-haired man bares his teeth in a grin. What an asshole.</p><p>\u201cSo, Eddie. You understand that point now?\u201d The chiseled-looking man is speaking, his voice dripping with concern.</p> <p>I recognize this man. Not his face\u2014but I know him. I worked with people like this for seven years. And I know instinctively that this man doesn\u2019t care two jots whether Eddie understands.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Eddie. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d He peers at the contract uncertainly, then looks at the man in the brown jacket next to him. \u201cMartin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just have a look,\u201d replies Martin. He starts perusing the document, nodding every so often. I guess he must be Eddie\u2019s lawyer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re as concerned about security as you are,\u201d says the chiseled man, with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to money, who isn\u2019t?\u201d quips the red-haired guy.</p><p>OK. What exactly is going on here? Why am I suspicious?</p><p>As I move round to the chiseled-looking man and pour his coffee, the contract is clearly visible and I run my eyes down it with a practiced speed. It\u2019s a property-development partnership. Both sides putting up money ... residential development ... so far so standard ... It looks fine.</p><p>I pour out coffee for the next guy and have another quick scan, just to be sure.</p><p>And then I see something that makes me freeze in shock. A carefully worded, innocuous-looking little clause at the bottom of the page that commits Eddie to funding any shortfall. In one line. With no reciprocity.</p><p>If things go wrong ... Eddie has to foot the bill. Does he realize?</p><p>Does his lawyer realize?</p><p>I\u2019m totally aghast. My urge to reach for the contract and rip it up is almost overpowering. If this were at Carter Spink, these guys would not last two minutes. Not only would I throw their contract out, but I would recommend to my client that\u2014</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d I jerk back to reality to see Eddie frowning slightly at me. \u201cCould you please serve Martin?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not at Carter Spink. I\u2019m in a housekeeper\u2019s uniform and I have refreshments to serve.</p><p>I move round the table and pour out coffee for Martin, who is reading through the contract with not one sign of alarm. Hasn\u2019t he seen the clause?</p><p>\u201cChocolate biscuit?\u201d I offer him the plate. \u201cOr a muffin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d His fleshy face lights up. \u201cNow ... let me see ... they all look so good....\u201d His hand hovers over the plate.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe this. He\u2019s paying more attention to the muffins than he is to the contract. What kind of lawyer is this guy?</p><p>\u201cSo. Enough talk. The adventure begins.\u201d Mr. Chiseled is unscrewing the lid of a smart pen. \u201cReady?\u201d He hands it to Eddie.</p><p>He\u2019s about to sign? Now?</p><p>\u201cEverything OK by you?\u201d says Eddie to Martin, whose mouth is now stuffed full of muffin.</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d Mr. Chiseled adds with a perfect-toothed smile. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to read it through again ...\u201d</p> <p>I feel a surge of sudden fury at these guys, with their flash cars and sharp suits and smooth voices. They are not going to rip off my boss. I\u2019m not going to let it happen.</p><p>\u201cMr. Geiger,\u201d I say urgently. \u201cCould I see you for a minute please? In private?\u201d</p><p>Eddie looks up in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d he says with heavy humor. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of rather important business here. Important to me, at any rate!\u201d He glances round the table, and the three men laugh sycophantically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very urgent,\u201d I say. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, Mr. Geiger. I need to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>At last Eddie exhales in exasperation and puts down the pen.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He gets up and ushers me out of the room. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he demands.</p><p>I stare back at him dumbly. Now I\u2019ve got him out here I have no idea how to bring up the subject. What can I say?</p><p>Mr. Geiger, I would recommend reviewing clause 14.</p><p>Mr. Geiger, your liabilities are not sufficiently protected.</p><p>It\u2019s impossible. Who takes legal advice from their housekeeper?</p><p>His hand is on the doorknob. This is my last chance.</p> <p>\u201cDo you take sugar?\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t remember,\u201d I mumble. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to draw attention to your sugar consumption in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I take one lump,\u201d says Eddie testily. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... yes, there was something else. It looks like you\u2019re signing some papers in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He frowns. \u201cPrivate papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I swallow. \u201cI was just ... remembering. You told me always to be very careful with legal documents.\u201d</p><p>Eddie laughs jovially.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry. I\u2019m not a fool. I do have a lawyer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... yes, sir.\u201d I think quickly for another way. \u201cOnly I couldn\u2019t help thinking of a time that Lady Edgerly signed up to some kind of investment, I think it was. And afterward she said to me that she wished she\u2019d got a second opinion.\u201d</p><p>I look into his eyes, willing the message to get through. Consult a decent lawyer, you stupid schmuck.</p><p>\u201cVery thoughtful of you to be concerned, Samantha.\u201d Eddie gives me a pat on the shoulder, then opens the door and strides back in. \u201cWhere were we, gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>I watch in dismay as he picks up the pen again. He\u2019s going to get fleeced.</p><p>But not if I can help it.</p><p>\u201cYour coffee, Mr. Geiger,\u201d I murmur, hurrying into the room. I pick up the pot, start pouring, then accidentally-on-purpose drop it on the table.</p><p>\u201cAaargh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s total mayhem as the coffee spreads in a dark brown lake over the table, soaking into papers and dripping onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cThe contracts!\u201d shouts Mr. Chiseled in annoyance. \u201cYou stupid woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I say in my most flustered voice. \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry. The coffeepot just ... slipped.\u201d I start mopping the coffee with a tissue, making sure to spread it over all the remaining paperwork.</p><p>\u201cDo we have any copies?\u201d asks the red-haired man, and I look up, alert.</p><p>\u201cThey were all on the bloody table,\u201d says Mr. Chiseled in exasperation. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get them printed out again.\u201d He looks at Eddie. \u201cCan you make tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually ...\u201d Eddie clears his throat. \u201cNot tomorrow. I think I want a little more time. Just want to make sure it\u2019s all shipshape. Might even get another opinion, to be on the safe side.

Something tells me this deal may not be happening after all.</p> <p>\u201cYour jacket, sir?\u201d I say with a smile, handing it to him. \u201cAnd again, I\u2019m dreadfully, dreadfully sorry.\u201d</p><p>The great thing about legal training is it really teaches you to lie.</p><p>It also teaches you to put up with being yelled at by your boss.

That meeting was crucial!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, madam,\u201d I say, eyes downcast.</p> <p>\u201cI know you have no understanding of these things, Samantha.

Stay humble.</p><p>\u201cA lot of money,\u201d Trish repeats, impressively.</p><p>She\u2019s itching to tell me more.

I\u2019ve got tonight off,\u201d I say in alarm. \u201cYou said it would be OK, I could leave you a cold supper ...\u201d</p><p>Trish has clearly forgotten all about our conversation.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she says querulously. \u201cThat was before you threw coffee over our guests. That was before you spent all morning sitting about, having your hair done.\u201d</p> <p>What? That is so unfair I can\u2019t even find a response.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, Samantha, I expect a little better. You will stay in tonight and serve dinner.\u201d She picks up a magazine and strides out of the kitchen.</p><p>I stare after her, a familiar, heavy resignation creeping over me. This has happened so many times in my life, I\u2019m used to it. I\u2019ll have to call off my date with Nathaniel. Another date ... another cancellation.</p><p>And then my thoughts stop mid-track. I\u2019m not at Carter Spink anymore. I don\u2019t have to put up with this.</p><p>I stalk out of the kitchen and find Trish in the living room.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Geiger,\u201d I say as forcefully as I can. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the coffee and I\u2019ll make every effort to do better.

I\u2019ve never asserted myself like that before in my life. If I\u2019d ever spoken like that at Carter Spink I\u2019d have been dead meat.</p><p>For a moment Trish looks livid.

People envy me my full life, you know, Samantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... sure they do, madam. It was just a thought.\u201d I bob a curtsy and head out of the kitchen. At the door I glance back. Trish is still standing in exactly the same place.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>By seven o\u2019clock that evening, Trish\u2019s mood has unaccountably transformed. Or maybe not so unaccountably. I arrive downstairs in the hall to see her wandering out of the living room with a cocktail glass, bloodshot eyes, and a high color.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d she says benevolently. \u201cYou\u2019re going out with Nathaniel tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d I glance at myself in the mirror. I\u2019ve gone for a fairly informal outfit. Jeans, nice simple top, sandals.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very attractive young man.\u201d She eyes me inquisitively over the top of her glass. \u201cVery muscular.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr ... yes. I suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re wearing?\u201d She runs her eyes over my outfit. \u201cIt\u2019s not very jazzy, is it? Let me lend you a little something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind not being jazzy\u2014\u201d I begin, feeling a few qualms, but Trish has already disappeared up the stairs. A few moments later she appears, holding a jewel box.</p><p>\u201cHere we are. You need a bit of glitz.\u201d She produces a diamant\u00e9 clip in the shape of a sea horse. \u201cI got this in Monte Carlo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... lovely!\u201d I say, eyeing it in horror. Before I can stop her, she sweeps my hair to one side and plonks it on. She looks at me appraisingly. \u201cNo ... I think you need something larger. Here.\u201d She fishes out a large jeweled beetle and clips it to my hair. \u201cNow. You see how the emerald brings out your eyes?\u201d</p><p>I gaze at myself speechlessly. I cannot go out with a sparkly beetle on my head.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is very glam!\u201d Now she\u2019s garlanding a gilt chain around my waist. \u201cLet me just hang the charms on ...\u201d</p><p>Charms?</p><p>\u201cMrs. Geiger ...\u201d I begin, flustered, as Eddie appears out of the study.</p><p>\u201cJust got the quote in for the bathroom,\u201d he says to Trish. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this twinkly elephant gorgeous?\u201d says Trish, hooking it on the gilt belt. \u201cAnd the frog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I need any elephants\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven thousand.\u201d Eddie cuts across me. \u201cSeems quite reasonable. Plus VAT.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how much is it with VAT?\u201d says Trish, rifling in her box. \u201cWhere\u2019s that monkey gone?\u201d</p> <p>I feel like a Christmas tree. She\u2019s hanging more and more glittery baubles off the belt, not to mention the beetle. And Nathaniel will arrive any moment\u2014and he\u2019ll see me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d retorts Eddie impatiently. \u201cWhat\u2019s seventeen and a half percent of seven thousand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thousand, two hundred, and twenty-five,\u201d I respond absently.</p><p>There\u2019s a stunned silence.</p><p>Shit. That was a mistake.</p> <p>I look up to see Trish and Eddie goggling at me.</p><p>\u201cOr ... something.\u201d I laugh, hoping to distract them. \u201cJust a guess. So ... have you got any more charms?\u201d</p><p>Neither of them takes the slightest notice of me. Eddie\u2019s eyes are fixed on the paper he\u2019s holding. Very slowly he looks up, his mouth working strangely.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d he announces. \u201cShe\u2019s bloody right. That\u2019s the correct answer.\u201d He jabs the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right?\u201d Trish breathes in sharply. \u201cBut how ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw her! She did it in her head!\u201d They both swing round to goggle at me again.</p> <p>\u201cIs she autistic?\u201d Trish seems beside herself.</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake. Rain Man has a lot to answer for, if you ask me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not autistic!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just ... I\u2019m just quite good with numbers. It\u2019s no big deal ...\u201d</p><p>To my huge relief the doorbell rings, and I rush to answer it. Nathaniel is standing on the doorstep, looking a little smarter than usual in tan jeans and a green shirt.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Eddie blocks my way. \u201cYoung lady, you may be a lot brighter than you realize.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d asks Nathaniel.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a mathematical genius!\u201d says Trish wildly. \u201cAnd we discovered it! It\u2019s just extraordinary!\u201d</p><p>I shoot Nathaniel an agonized she\u2019s-talking-nonsense look.</p><p>\u201cWhat formal education have you had, Samantha?\u201d Eddie demands. \u201cOther than cooking.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. What did I say in my interview? I honestly can\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cI ... um ... here and there.\u201d I spread my hands vaguely. \u201cYou know ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the schools today,\u201d Trish declares. \u201cTony Blair should be shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d Eddie says self-righteously. \u201cI will take on your education. And if you\u2019re prepared to work hard\u2014hard, mind\u2014I\u2019m sure we can get you some qualifications.\u201d</p><p>This is getting worse.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want any qualifications, sir,\u201d I mumble. \u201cI\u2019m happy as I am. Thanks anyway\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take no for an answer!\u201d insists Eddie.</p><p>\u201cAim higher, Samantha!\u201d says Trish with sudden passion, gripping my arm. \u201cGive yourself a chance in life! Reach for the stars!\u201d</p><p>As I look from face to face I can\u2019t help feeling touched. They only want the best for me.</p><p>\u201cUm ... well ... maybe.\u201d I surreptitiously divest myself of all the jeweled creatures and slip them back into the jewelry box. Then I turn to Nathaniel, who has been waiting patiently on the doorstep. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what was all that about?\u201d asks Nathaniel as we start walking along the village road. The air is soft and warm and my new hair is bouncing lightly, and with every step I can see my toes, painted in Trish\u2019s pink nail polish. \u201cYou\u2019re a mathematical genius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I can\u2019t help laughing. \u201cOf course not! I can just ... do sums in my head. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be. But I\u2019d rather be able to cook like your mum. She\u2019s wonderful.\u201d I think back to the serene, homey atmosphere of the cottage, sitting at Iris\u2019s table, feeling sated and sleepy and secure. \u201cYou must have had a really happy childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were pretty happy,\u201d Nathaniel assents. \u201cOf course, Dad was alive then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like they had a fantastic marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all hearts and flowers.\u201d Nathaniel grins. \u201cMum can speak her mind, and so could Dad. But it was ... grounded. They knew they belonged together and that was more important than anything else in life.\u201d He smiles, reminiscently. \u201cWhen they got really mad with each other, Dad would go and chop wood in the barn, and Mum would chop vegetables in the kitchen. The two of them would be at it furiously. Jake and I would be creeping around, not daring to make a sound.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them would crack,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cUsually Dad.\u201d He turns his head. \u201cHow about your parents?\u201d</p><p>I tense up with apprehension. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to start talking about myself yet.</p><p>\u201cThey split up when I was little,\u201d I say at last. \u201cAnd my mum works hard.... It wasn\u2019t really the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople do what they have to do,\u201d says Nathaniel after a pause. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for a single woman bringing up a family on her own, having to make ends meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... yes.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I sense he might have formed a slightly different idea of Mum from the reality.</p><p>We walk on, passing an old stone wall covered with a profusion of climbing roses, and as I breathe in the delicious scent, I feel a sudden buoyancy. The street is dappled with soft evening light and the last rays of sun are warm on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNice hair, by the way,\u201d says Nathaniel.</p> <p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I say nonchalantly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really.\u201d Flick. \u201cSo ... where are we heading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pub. If that\u2019s OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d</p><p>We walk over the bridge and pause to look at the river. Moorhens are diving for weed and the sunlight is like amber puddles on the water. Some tourists are taking pictures of each other, and I feel a glow of pride. I\u2019m not just visiting this beautiful place, I want to tell them. I live here.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d says Nathaniel. \u201cBefore you came here? What\u2019s your background?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... you don\u2019t want to know.\u201d I give him a brush-off smile. \u201cVery boring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that for a minute.\u201d His tone is light but persistent. \u201cDid you have a career?\u201d</p><p>I walk for a few paces without responding, trying to think what to say. I can feel Nathaniel\u2019s eyes on me, but I twist my head away from his scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel exhales sharply. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a bad time of it?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, he still thinks I\u2019m an abused wife.</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just ... a long story.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel doesn\u2019t look put off. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all evening.\u201d</p> <p>As I meet his steady gaze I feel a sudden pull, like a hook inside my chest. Although it\u2019ll be painful, I want to tell him. I want to unburden everything. Who I am, what happened, how hard it\u2019s been. Of all people, I could trust him. He wouldn\u2019t tell anyone. He\u2019d understand. He\u2019d keep it secret.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d He stops still in the street, his thumbs in his pockets. \u201cAre you going to tell me who you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d We\u2019re only a few yards away from The Bell, and there\u2019s a small crowd outside. A couple of people greet Nathaniel and he waves back; the atmosphere is casual and happy. I don\u2019t want to puncture the mood.</p><p>\u201cBut ... not right now.\u201d I smile at him. \u201cIt\u2019s too nice an evening to spoil with all my problems. I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><p>We make our way through the crowd. Some are standing by the door, others sitting at the wooden tables.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWaiting,\u201d he says. \u201cLandlord\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. I look around but all the tables are already taken. \u201cWell, never mind. We can sit here.\u201d</p><p>I perch on an old barrel\u2014but Nathaniel has already headed for the door of the pub.</p><p>And ... that\u2019s odd. Everyone is standing back to let him through. I watch in astonishment as he reaches in his pocket and produces a big bunch of keys, then looks around to find me.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He beckons with a grin. \u201cOpening time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou own a pub!\u201d I say in wonderment, as the initial melee of the evening dies down.</p><p>I\u2019ve watched for fifteen minutes as Nathaniel has pulled pints, bantered with customers, given instructions to the bar staff, and made sure everyone is happy. Now the initial rush is over, he\u2019s come round to where I\u2019m perched on a bar stool with a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cThree pubs,\u201d he corrects me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just me. It\u2019s our family business. The Bell, The Swan over in Bingley, and The Two Foxes.\u201d</p><p>Every seat seems to be full, with people spilling outside into the tiny garden and onto the forecourt. The chatter is tremendous. \u201cHow on earth do you keep the pubs running and have time to be a gardener?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOK, I\u2019ll come clean.\u201d Nathaniel lifts his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t serve very often. We have a great bar staff. But I thought it might be fun tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not really a gardener!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am really a gardener.\u201d He straightens a bar mat. \u201cThis is ... business.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s the same tone in his voice as before. As though I\u2019ve trodden on something sensitive. I look away\u2014and my attention is caught by a picture on the wall of a fair-haired middle-aged man. He has Nathaniel\u2019s strong jaw and blue eyes, and the same crinkles around his eyes as he smiles.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your dad?\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cHe looks wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was the life and soul.\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s eyes soften. \u201cEveryone here, they all loved him.\u201d He takes a deep slug of beer, then puts his glass down. \u201cBut listen. We don\u2019t have to stay. If you\u2019d rather go somewhere else, somewhere nicer ...\u201d</p><p>The pub is bustling. Some song I vaguely recognize as a current hit is playing above the noise of talk and laughter. A group of regulars are greeting each other by the bar with cheerful insults. A pair of elderly American tourists in Stratford T-shirts are being advised on local beers by a barman with red hair and twinkling eyes. Across the room a darts game has started. I can\u2019t remember the last time I was in such an easy, friendly atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stay. And I\u2019ll help!\u201d I slip off my bar stool and head behind the bar.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever pulled a pint before?\u201d Nathaniel follows me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I pick up a glass and put it under one of the beer taps. \u201cBut I can learn.\u201d</p> <p>Nathaniel comes round the bar. \u201cYou tilt the glass like this.... Now pull.\u201d</p><p>I pull the tap, and a burst of foam splutters out. \u201cDamn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlowly ...\u201d He puts his arms around me, guiding my hands. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Mmm, this is nice. I\u2019m in a blissful happy haze, enveloped in his strong arms. Maybe I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m very slow at learning how to pull pints. Maybe we can stand like this all evening.</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2014\u201d I begin, turning my head toward him. And then I stop as my eyes focus on something. There\u2019s an old wooden notice on the wall, stating no muddy boots, please and no working clothes. Underneath, another notice has been pinned. It\u2019s printed on yellowing paper in faded marker pen\u2014and it reads: no lawyers.</p><p>I\u2019m dumbfounded. No lawyers?</p> <p>\u201cThere we are.\u201d Nathaniel holds up the glass, full of gleaming amber liquid. \u201cYour first ever pint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... great!\u201d I say. I pretend to examine the pump, then gesture casually at the sign. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t serve lawyers,\u201d he replies.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel! Get over here!\u201d someone calls from the other end of the bar, and he clicks in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be a moment.\u201d He touches my hand, then moves away. Immediately I take a deep gulp of wine. He doesn\u2019t serve lawyers. Why doesn\u2019t he serve lawyers?</p><p>OK ... just calm down, I instruct myself firmly. It\u2019s a joke. Obviously it\u2019s a joke. Everyone hates lawyers, just like everyone hates estate agents and tax collectors. It\u2019s an accepted fact of life.</p><p>But they don\u2019t all put up signs about it in their pubs, do they?</p><p>As I\u2019m sitting there, the red-haired barman comes up to where I\u2019m standing and scoops some ice out of the tank.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says, holding out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Eamonn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d I shake it with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m here with Nathaniel.\u201d</p><p>Eamonn nods. \u201cWelcome to Lower Ebury!\u201d</p><p>I watch him serving for a moment, my mind working. This guy will know something about the sign.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I say when he comes back over. \u201cThat sign about lawyers. It\u2019s a ... joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Eamonn replies cheerfully. \u201cNathaniel can\u2019t stand lawyers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d Somehow I manage to keep on smiling. \u201cUm ... why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since his dad died.\u201d Eamonn hefts a crate of orange mixers onto the bar and I shift round on my stool so I can see him properly.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was some lawsuit between him and the council.\u201d Eamonn pauses in his work. \u201cNathaniel says it should never have been started in the first place, but Ben got talked into it by the lawyers. He got more and more stressed by it and couldn\u2019t think about anything else\u2014then he had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, how awful,\u201d I say in horror.</p><p>Eamonn resumes hefting crates. \u201cWorst thing was, after Ben died they had to sell off one of the pubs. To pay the legal bills.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m aghast.</p><p>\u201cThe last lawyer came in this pub ...\u201d Eamonn leans conspiratorially across the bar. \u201cNathaniel punched him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe punched him?\u201d My voice comes out a petrified squeak.</p><p>\u201cIt was on the day of his dad\u2019s funeral.\u201d Eamonn lowers his voice. \u201cOne of his dad\u2019s lawyers came in here and Nathaniel socked him one.

I\u2019ve had a plate of cod and chips and half a dish of sticky toffee pudding\u2014and beaten Nathaniel at darts, to loud cheers and whoops from everyone watching around.</p><p>\u201cYou said you hadn\u2019t played before!\u201d he says in disbelief after I nail my winning triple eight.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d I say innocently. There\u2019s no need to mention that I did archery at school for five years.</p><p>At last Nathaniel rings Last Orders with a resounding clang of the bell, and a good hour later the last few stragglers make it to the door, each pausing to say good-bye as they leave. He must know every single person in this village.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll clear up,\u201d says Eamonn firmly, as Nathaniel starts picking up glasses, five at a time. \u201cGive those here. You\u2019ll want to be enjoying the rest of the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... OK.\u201d Nathaniel claps him on the back. \u201cThanks, Eamonn.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>Almost reluctantly I slide down off my bar stool. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing evening,\u201d I say to Eamonn. \u201cBrilliant to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d He grins. \u201cSend us your invoice.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m still buoyed by the atmosphere; by my win at darts; by the satisfaction of having spent the evening actually doing something. I\u2019ve never had an evening out like this in my life.</p><p>No one in London ever took me to a pub for a date\u2014let alone to the other side of the bar. On my first evening out with Jacob he took me to Les Sylphides at Covent Garden, then left after twenty minutes to take a call from the States and never returned. The next day he said he was so bound up in a point of commercial contract law, he \u201cforgot\u201d I was there.</p><p>And the worst thing is, instead of saying \u201cYou bastard!\u201d and punching him, I asked what point of commercial contract law.</p><p>After the beery warmth of the pub, the summer night feels fresh and cool. I can hear the faint laughter of pub-goers up ahead, and a car starting in the distance. There are no street lamps; the only light comes from a big full moon and curtained cottage windows.</p><p>\u201cI really, really loved tonight,\u201d I say with enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s a great pub. And I can\u2019t get over how friendly it is. The way everyone knows you! And the village spirit. Everyone cares about each other. You can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the way everyone claps each other on the back,\u201d I explain. \u201cLike, if someone were in trouble, everyone would rally round in a heartwarming way. You can just see it.\u201d</p><p>I hear Nathaniel stifle a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWe did get the \u2018Most Heartwarming Village\u2019 award last year,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou can laugh,\u201d I retort. \u201cBut in London, no one\u2019s heartwarming. If you fell over dead in the street they\u2019d just push you into the gutter. After emptying your wallet and stealing your identity. That wouldn\u2019t happen here, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d says Nathaniel, straight-faced. \u201cIf you die here, the entire village gathers round your bed and sings the village lament.\u201d</p><p>My mouth twists into a smile. \u201cI knew it. Strewing flower petals?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d He nods. \u201cAnd making ceremonial corn dollies.\u201d</p><p>A small animal runs across the road, stops, and regards us with two tiny yellow headlamps, then skitters into the hedgerow.</p><p>\u201cHow does the lament go, then?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt goes something like this.\u201d Nathaniel clears his throat, then sings in a low, mournful monotone. \u201c \u2018Oh, no. He\u2019s gone.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about if it\u2019s a woman?\u201d I match his deadpan manner.</p><p>\u201cGood point. Then we sing a different lament.\u201d He draws a deep breath and sings again, on exactly the same tuneless note: \u201c \u2018Oh, no. She\u2019s gone.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cWell ... we don\u2019t have laments in London. We move on. Big on moving, Londoners. Big on staying ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about Londoners.\u201d Nathaniel runs his hand along a hedge. \u201cI lived in London for a time.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel lived in London? I try, and fail, to picture him straphanging on the tube, reading Metro.</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a waiter on my year off before uni. My flat was opposite a twenty-four-hour supermarket. It was lit up all night, with these bright fluorescent strips. And the noise ...\u201d He winces. \u201cIn ten months of living there, I never had a single moment of total darkness or total quiet. I never heard a bird. I never saw the stars.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively I tilt my head back to look up at the clear night sky. Slowly, as my eyes adjust to the blackness, the tiny pinpricks begin to appear, forming whorls and patterns that I can\u2019t begin to decipher. He\u2019s right. I never saw the stars in London either.</p><p>\u201cMy dad taught me the constellations,\u201d Nathaniel says, looking up too. \u201cHe had a telescope up in the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel ... what happened with your dad?\u201d I speak tentatively. \u201cEamonn told me there was a court case with the council?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice tightens. \u201cThere was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas he suing them? Or ... or ...\u201d I trail off.</p><p>\u201cIt was all so bloody pointless.\u201d He exhales. \u201cIt started when the council dug up the road outside one of our pubs for eight months. They ruined access to it, and business went down. So Dad sued them. And lost. That\u2019s when he had his first heart attack. That should have been the end of it.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. \u201cSo ... what went wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen some other lawyers made contact. More expensive.\u201d I can hear the bitterness in Nathaniel\u2019s voice. \u201cThey persuaded Dad he would win on appeal. They kept whipping him up, pressing the right buttons. They knew he was ill. Mum and I tried to talk him out of it ... but he just called us negative. Dad always believed he was in the right. He kept saying justice would prevail. He trusted those bastards.\u201d Nathaniel is silent for a moment, then adds, \u201cHe had the next heart attack a week after they lost the second appeal. It killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel ... I\u2019m really sorry. That\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says after a pause. \u201cIt was a pretty bad time.\u201d</p><p>I feel chastened after hearing his story. This is a side of the law I have no experience of. Genuine concerns and people. At Carter Spink the deals may have been huge\u2014but I was pretty much cushioned from real life.</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d His voice brings me back to earth. \u201cYou were going to tell me how you came to be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feel a spasm of nerves. \u201cYes, right. So I was.\u201d</p><p>This is impossible. I want to tell him. But ... how on earth can I now? How can I admit that I\u2019m a lawyer?</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI was in London. In this ... this ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationship,\u201d he prompts.</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes.\u201d I pause, racking my brains for a way to continue. \u201cWell. Things went wrong. I got on a train ... and I ended up here.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an expectant silence. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Nathaniel sounds incredulous. \u201cThat\u2019s the long story?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I turn to face him in the moonlight. \u201cI know I was going to tell you more. But are the details really important? Does it matter, what I used to do ... or be? The point is, I\u2019m here. And I\u2019ve just had the best evening of my life. Ever.\u201d</p><p>I can see he wants to challenge me; he even opens his mouth to speak. Then he relents and turns away.</p><p>I feel a plunge of despair. Maybe I\u2019ve ruined everything. Maybe I should have told the truth anyway. Or made up some convoluted story about a nasty boyfriend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We walk on again into the night without speaking. Nathaniel\u2019s shoulder brushes against mine. Then I feel his hand. His fingers graze against my own casually at first, as though by accident\u2014then, slowly, entwine round mine.</p><p>I feel an arching inside as my entire body responds, but somehow force myself not to catch my breath. There\u2019s no sound except our footsteps on the road and the hooting of an owl. Nathaniel\u2019s hand is sure and firm round my own. I can feel the roughened calluses on his skin, his thumb rubbing over mine.</p><p>We come to a stop at the entrance to the Geigers\u2019 drive. He looks down at me silently, his expression almost grave. I can feel my breath thickening. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s obvious I want him.</p><p>I was never any good at the rules, anyway.</p> <p>He releases my hand and puts both hands round my waist. Now he\u2019s slowly pulling me toward him. I close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor goodness sake!\u201d comes an unmistakable voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to kiss her?\u201d</p><p>I jump backward. Nathaniel looks equally shocked; his arms have dropped to his sides. I turn round\u2014and to my utter horror, Trish is leaning out of an upstairs window, holding a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a prude, you know,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are allowed to kiss!\u201d</p><p>I shoot furious daggers at her.

I\u2019m sorry, but Nathaniel and I are not having our first kiss with Trish as a spectator.

The mood is totally broken.</p> <p>\u201cUm ... thanks for a great evening,\u201d I say, trying to keep a straight face. \u201cI had a great time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d His eyes are almost indigo in the shadows. \u201cSo. Are we going to give Mrs. Geiger her kicks? Or leave her in an unbearable frenzy of frustration?\u201d</p><p>Trish is still leaning avidly out the window, as if we\u2019re the floor show.</p><p>\u201cOh ... I think she probably deserves the unbearable frenzy of frustration,\u201d I say with a tiny smile.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be at your mum\u2019s at ten o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>He holds out his hand and we barely brush fingertips before he turns and walks away. I watch him disappear into the darkness, then turn and head down the drive to the house, my whole body still pulsating.</p><p>It\u2019s all very well, getting one over on Trish. But what about my unbearable frenzy of frustration?</p> <p>Sixteen</p><p>I\u2019m woken the next day by Trish banging sharply on my door. \u201cSamantha! I need to speak to you! Now!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not even eight o\u2019clock on a Saturday morning. Where\u2019s the fire?</p><p>\u201cOK!

Nathaniel\u2019s arms around me ...</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Geiger?\u201d I open my door to see Trish standing there in a white robe. She puts her hand over the cordless phone in her hand.</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d There\u2019s a strange note of triumph in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve fibbed to me, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I feel a white flash of shock. How did she\u2014how could she\u2014</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d She gives me a penetrating look. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p><p>My mind frantically runs over all the fibs I\u2019ve ever told Trish, up to and including \u201cI\u2019m a housekeeper.\u201d It could be anything. It could be something small and insignificant. Or she could have found out the whole lot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to,\u201d I say in a throaty voice. \u201cMadam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Trish walks toward me, swishing her silk dressing gown crossly. \u201cAs you can imagine, I\u2019m rather upset that you never told me you\u2019d cooked paella for the Spanish ambassador.\u201d</p><p>My mouth hangs open.</p><p>\u201cI specifically asked in your interview if you had cooked for any notable persons.\u201d Trish arches her eyebrows in reproof. \u201cYou never even mentioned the banquet for three hundred at the Mansion House.\u201d</p><p>OK, has she been bipolar all this time? That would explain a lot.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Geiger,\u201d I say, a little nervous. \u201cWould you like to sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you!\u201d she says crisply. \u201cI\u2019m still on the phone with Lady Edgerly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Freya\u2019s on the phone?</p><p>\u201cLady Edgerly ...\u201d Trish lifts the phone to her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right, far too unassuming ...\u201d She looks up. \u201cLady Edgerly would like to have a word with you.\u201d</p><p>She hands me the phone and in a blur of incredulity I lift it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Freya\u2019s familiar, raspy voice erupts into my ear through a sea of static. \u201cAre you OK?

You cannot stay there. I\u2019m going to rescue you. I\u2019ll fly back tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say with more vehemence than I intended. \u201cNo!

Taking a deep breath, I click swiftly past the introduction, straight to Associates. The list comes up\u2014and Freya\u2019s right. The names segue straight from Snell to Taylor. No Sweeting.</p><p>I tell myself to be rational. Of course they\u2019ve taken me off. I\u2019ve been fired, what else did I expect? That was my old life and I\u2019m not concerned with it anymore. I should just close down, go to Iris\u2019s house, and forget about it. That\u2019s what I should do. Instead, I find myself reaching for the mouse and tapping Samantha Sweeting into the search box. No result pings up a few moments later.</p><p>No result? Nowhere on the whole Web site? But ... what about in the Media section? Or News Archives?</p><p>I quickly click onto the Done Deals box, and search for Euro-Sal, merger, DanCo. That was a big European deal last year, and I handled the financing. The report appears on the screen, with the headline carter spink advises on \u00a320bn merger. My eyes run down the familiar text. The Carter Spink team was led from London by Arnold Saville, with associates Guy Ashby and Jane Smilington.</p><p>I stop in disbelief, then go back and read the text more carefully, searching for the missing words: and Samantha Sweeting, it should read. But the words aren\u2019t there. I\u2019m not there. Quickly I click onto another deal, the Conlon acquisition. I know I\u2019m in this report. I\u2019ve read it, for Christ\u2019s sake. I was on the team, I\u2019ve got a tombstone to prove it.</p> <p>But I\u2019m not mentioned here either.</p><p>My heart is thudding as I click from deal to deal, tracking back a year. Two years. Five years. They\u2019ve wiped me out. Someone has gone painstakingly through the entire Web site and removed my name. I\u2019ve been erased from every deal I was involved with. It\u2019s as if I never even existed.</p><p>I try to stay calm, but anger is bubbling up, hot and strong. How dare they change history? How dare they wipe me out? I gave them seven years of my life. They can\u2019t just blot me out, pretend I was never even on the payroll.</p><p>Then a new thought hits me. Why have they bothered doing this? Other people have left the firm and haven\u2019t disappeared. Am I such an embarrassment? I look at the screen silently for a moment. Then, slowly, I type in</p><p>www.google.com</p><p>and enter Samantha Sweeting in the box. I add lawyer to be on the safe side, and press enter.</p><p>A moment later the screen fills with text. As I scan the entries I feel as though I\u2019ve been hit over the head.</p><p>... the Samantha Sweeting debacle ...</p> <p>... discovery, Samantha Sweeting went AWOL, leaving colleagues to ...</p><p>... heard about Samantha Sweeting ...</p><p>... Samantha Sweeting jokes. What do you call a lawyer who ...</p><p>... Samantha Sweeting fired from Carter Spink ...</p><p>One after another. From lawyers\u2019 Web sites, legal news services, law students\u2019 message boards. It\u2019s as if the whole legal world has been talking about me behind my back. In a daze, I click to the next page\u2014and there are still more. And on the next page, and the next.</p><p>I feel as though I\u2019m surveying a wrecked bridge. Looking at the damage, realizing for the first time quite how bad the devastation is.</p><p>I can never go back.</p><p>I knew that.</p><p>But I don\u2019t think I really knew it. Not deep down in the pit of my stomach. Not where it counts.</p><p>I feel a wetness on my cheek and jump to my feet, shutting all the Web pages down; clearing History in case Eddie gets curious. I shut down the computer and look around the silent room. This is where I am. Not there. That part of my life is over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Iris\u2019s cottage is looking as idyllic as ever as I dash up to the front door, out of breath. In fact, even more idyllic, as a goose is now wandering about with her hens.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Iris is sitting on the front step with a mug of tea. \u201cYou seem in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to get here on time.\u201d I glance around the garden, but there\u2019s no sign of Nathaniel.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel had to go and sort out a leaking pipe at one of the pubs,\u201d says Iris, as though reading my mind. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be back later. Meanwhile, we\u2019re going to make bread.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say. I follow her into the kitchen and put on the same stripy apron as last time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve started us off already,\u201d says Iris, going over to a large, old-fashioned mixing bowl on the table. \u201cYeast, warm water, melted butter, and flour. Mix together and you have your dough. Now, you\u2019re going to knead it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, looking blankly at the dough. She shoots me a curious glance.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Samantha? You seem ... out of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I will myself to concentrate. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know people have machines to do this for them,\u201d she says, hefting the dough onto the table. \u201cBut this is how we make it the old-fashioned way. You\u2019ll never taste better.\u201d</p><p>She kneads it briskly a couple of times. \u201cYou see? Fold it over, make a quarter turn. You need to use a bit of energy.\u201d</p><p>Cautiously I plunge my hands into the soft dough and try to imitate her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d says Iris, watching carefully. \u201cGet into a rhythm and really work it. Kneading\u2019s very good for releasing stress,\u201d she adds with wry humor. \u201cPretend you\u2019re bashing all your worst enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that!\u201d I manage a cheerful tone.</p><p>But there\u2019s a knot of tension in my chest, which doesn\u2019t dwindle away as I knead. In fact, the more I fold and turn the dough, the worse it seems to get. I can\u2019t stop my mind flipping back to that Web site.</p> <p>I did good things for that firm. I won clients. I negotiated deals. I was not nothing.</p><p>I was not nothing.</p><p>\u201cThe more you work the dough, the better the bread will be,\u201d says Iris, coming over to the table with a smile. \u201cCan you feel it becoming warm and elastic in your hands?\u201d</p><p>I look at the dough in my fingers, but I can\u2019t connect with it. I can\u2019t feel what she wants me to. My senses aren\u2019t plugged in. My mind is skittering about like a squirrel on ice.</p><p>I start kneading again, harder than before, trying to capture it. I want to find that contentment I had last time I was here, that feeling of simplicity and earthiness. But I keep losing my rhythm, cursing in frustration as my fingers catch on the dough. My upper arms are aching; my face is sweating. And the turmoil inside me is only getting worse.</p><p>How dare they wipe me out? I was a good lawyer.</p><p>I was a good fucking lawyer.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a rest?\u201d Iris comes over and touches my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work when you\u2019re not used to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d My words shoot out before I can stop them. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s the point of all this? Making bread. You make it and you eat it. And then ... it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>I break off abruptly, not quite knowing what\u2019s come over me. I don\u2019t feel totally on top of myself.</p><p>Iris gives me a careful look.</p><p>\u201cYou could say the same of all food,\u201d she points out gently. \u201cOr life itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I rub my forehead with my apron. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. Why am I picking a fight with Iris? I must calm down.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s enough kneading,\u201d she says, taking the dough from me and patting it into a round shape.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I say, trying to speak more normally. \u201cShall I put it in the oven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Iris places the dough back in the bowl and puts it on top of the stove. \u201cNow we wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cWhat do you mean, wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wait.\u201d She pops a tea towel over the bowl. \u201cHalf an hour should do it. I\u2019ll make a cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... what are we waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the yeast to rise and work its magic on the dough.\u201d She smiles. \u201cUnderneath that towel, a small miracle is happening.\u201d</p><p>I look at the bowl, trying to think miracles. But it isn\u2019t working. I can\u2019t feel calm or serene. My body is wound up too far; every nerve is hopping with tension. I used to be in control of my time to the minute. To the second. And now I\u2019m supposed to wait for yeast? I\u2019m supposed to stand here, in an apron, waiting for a ... fungus? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I hear myself say. \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d I head for the kitchen door and out into the garden.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Iris comes after me, wiping her hands on her apron. \u201cSweetie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d I wheel round. \u201cI can\u2019t just ... just sit around patiently, waiting for yeast to get its act together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s such a waste of time!\u201d I clutch my head in frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste of time.

I feel an urge to scream. It\u2019s OK for her, with her hens and her apron and no wrecked career on the Internet.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand anything,\u201d I say, close to tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you don\u2019t. Look ... I\u2019ll just leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d Iris\u2019s voice is surprisingly firm. The next moment she\u2019s in front of me, placing her two hands on my shoulders, looking at me with her penetrating blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, you\u2019ve had a trauma,\u201d she says in kind, even tones. \u201cAnd it\u2019s affected you very deeply\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a trauma!\u201d I wheel away, out of her grasp. \u201cI just ... I can\u2019t do this, Iris. I can\u2019t pretend to be this. I\u2019m not a bread maker, OK? I\u2019m not a domestic goddess.\u201d I look around the garden desperately, as though searching for clues. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I am anymore. I have no bloody idea.\u201d</p><p>A single tear rolls down my cheek and I wipe it away roughly. I\u2019m not going to cry in front of Iris.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d I exhale, more calmly. \u201cOr what my goal is ... or where I\u2019m headed in life. Or anything.\u201d</p><p>My energy\u2019s gone and I sink down on the dry grass. A few moments later Iris comes and squats down beside me.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she says, her voice soft. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up for not knowing all the answers. You don\u2019t always have to know who you are. You don\u2019t have to have the big picture, or know where you\u2019re heading. Sometimes it\u2019s enough just to know what you\u2019re going to do next.\u201d</p><p>For a while I let her words run through my head, like cool water on a headache.</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I going to do next?\u201d I say at last, with a hopeless shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to help me shell the beans for lunch.\u201d She\u2019s so matter-of-fact that I half smile in spite of myself.</p><p>Meekly, I follow Iris into the house, then collect a big bowl of broad beans and start splitting the pods as she shows me. Pods into a basket on the floor. New broad beans into the basin. Over and over and over.</p><p>I become a little calmer as I immerse myself in my task. I never even knew broad beans came from pods like this. To be honest, my total experience of broad beans has been picking them up in a plastic-covered packet from Waitrose, putting them in my fridge, taking them out a week after the sell-by date, and throwing them away.</p> <p>But this is the real thing. This is what they\u2019re like, dug straight out of the ground. Or ... picked off the bush. Whatever it is.</p><p>Each time I split one open it\u2019s like finding a row of pale green jewels. And when I put one in my mouth, it\u2019s like\u2014</p><p>Oh, OK. It needs to be cooked.</p><p>Yuck.</p><p>When I\u2019ve finished the beans we return to the dough, kneading it into loaves. We put the loaves into special tins and then have to wait another half hour for them to rise again. But somehow this time I don\u2019t mind. I sit at the table with Iris, hulling strawberries and listening to the radio until it\u2019s time to put the tins into the oven. Then Iris loads a tray with Cheshire cheese, bean salad, biscuits, and strawberries and we take it outside to a table set under the shade of a tree.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she says, pouring some iced tea into a tumbler made of bubbled glass. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about earlier. I just ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha, it\u2019s all right.\u201d She cuts a piece of cheese and puts it on my plate. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so wonderful ... and Nathaniel ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took you to the pub, I heard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was amazing!\u201d I say with enthusiasm. \u201cYou must be so proud, to have that in your family.\u201d</p><p>Iris nods. \u201cThose pubs have been run by Blewetts for generations.\u201d She sits down and helps us both to bean salad, dressed with oil and speckled with herbs. I take a bite\u2014and it\u2019s absolutely delicious.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been hard when your husband died,\u201d I venture cautiously.</p><p>\u201cEverything was in a mess.\u201d Iris sounds matter-of-fact. A chicken wanders over to the table and she shoos it away. \u201cThere were financial difficulties. I wasn\u2019t well. If it hadn\u2019t been for Nathaniel we might have lost all of the pubs. He made sure they got back on track. For his father\u2019s memory.\u201d Her eyes cloud a little and she hesitates. \u201cYou never know how things are going to turn out, however much you plan. But you already know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI always thought my life would be a certain way,\u201d I say, gazing down at my plate. \u201cI had it all mapped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... it didn\u2019t happen like that?\u201d</p><p>For a few seconds I can\u2019t answer. I\u2019m remembering the moment I heard I was going to be partner. That instant of undiluted, dazzling joy. When I thought my life had finally fallen into place, when I thought everything was perfect.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, trying to keep my voice level. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen like that.\u201d</p><p>Iris is watching me with such clear, empathetic eyes I almost believe she\u2019s able to read my mind.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself, chicken,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all flounder.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine Iris ever floundering. She seems so puttogether.</p><p>\u201cOh, I floundered,\u201d she says, reading my expression. \u201cAfter Benjamin went. It was so sudden. Everything I thought I had, gone overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... what did you ...\u201d I spread my hands helplessly.</p><p>\u201cI found another way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut ... it took time.\u201d For a moment she holds my gaze, then looks at her watch. \u201cSpeaking of which, I\u2019ll make some coffee. And see how that bread\u2019s getting on.\u201d</p><p>I get up to follow her, but she bats me down again.</p> <p>\u201cSit. Stay. Relax.\u201d</p><p>So I sit in the dappled sunlight, sipping my iced tea, trying to relax. Trying to enjoy the present, just sitting here in a beautiful garden. But emotions are still darting around me like unsettled fish.</p><p>Another way.</p><p>But I don\u2019t know any other way. I feel like the light\u2019s gone out and I\u2019m feeling my way forward, one step at a time. And all I know is I can\u2019t go back to what I was.</p><p>I clench my eyes shut, trying to clear my mind. I should never have looked at that Web site. I should never have read those comments.</p><p>\u201cHold out your arms, Samantha.\u201d Iris\u2019s voice is suddenly behind me. \u201cClose your eyes. Go on.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what she\u2019s up to, but I keep my eyes closed and hold out my arms. The next moment I feel something warm being put into them. A yeasty smell is rising up. I open my eyes to see a loaf of bread in my arms.</p><p>Proper bread. Real, proper bread like you\u2019d see in a baker\u2019s window. Fat and plump and golden-brown, with faint striations and a crusty, almost flaky top. It smells so delicious I can feel my mouth watering.</p> <p>\u201cTell me that\u2019s nothing,\u201d says Iris, squeezing my arm. \u201cYou made that, sweetie. And you should be proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Something hot is wadding my throat as I clutch the warm loaf. I made this bread. I made it. I, Samantha Sweeting, who couldn\u2019t even microwave a packet of soup. Who gave up seven years of her life to end up with nothing, to be wiped out of existence. Who has no idea who she even is anymore.</p><p>I made a loaf of bread. Right now I feel like this is the only thing I have to hold on to.</p><p>To my horror a tear suddenly rolls down my cheek, followed by another. This is ridiculous. I must get a grip on myself.</p><p>\u201cLooks good,\u201d comes Nathaniel\u2019s easy voice behind me, and I wheel round in shock to see him standing next to Iris.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, flustered. \u201cI thought you were ... fixing a pipe or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill am.\u201d He nods. \u201cI just popped home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get the other loaves out,\u201d says Iris, patting me on the shoulder and disappearing over the grass toward the house.</p><p>I stand up. Just the sight of Nathaniel is adding all sorts of new emotions into the mix: more fish darting around my body.</p><p>Although now I think about it, they\u2019re mainly varieties of the same fish.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he says, acknowledging my tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just been a strange day.\u201d I brush them away in embarrassment. \u201cI don\u2019t usually get so emotional about ... bread.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMum said you got a bit frustrated.\u201d He raises his eyebrows. \u201cAll that kneading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the rising.\u201d I raise a rueful smile. \u201cHaving to wait. I\u2019ve never been good at waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s steady blue eyes meet mine.</p><p>\u201cFor anything.\u201d Somehow I seem to be edging closer and closer to him, I\u2019m not entirely sure how. \u201cI have to have things now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re inches apart, and as I gaze up at him, breathing hard, all the frustrations and shocks of the last couple of weeks are distilling inside me. A huge block of pressure is growing, until I can\u2019t bear it. Unable to stop myself, I reach up and pull his face down toward mine.</p><p>I haven\u2019t kissed like this since I was a teenager. Arms wrapped around each other, oblivious of anything else in the world. Completely lost. Trish could be standing there with a video camera, issuing directions, and I wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>It seems hours later that I open my eyes and we draw apart. My lips feel swollen; my legs are staggery. Nathaniel looks equally shell-shocked.</p><p>The bread is totally squashed, I suddenly notice. I try to reshape it as best I can, putting it on the table like a deformed pottery exhibit while I gather my breath.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have long,\u201d Nathaniel says. \u201cI have to get back to the pub.\u201d His hand runs lightly down my back and I feel my body curving toward his.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take long,\u201d I say, my voice husky with desire.</p><p>When did I become so brazen, exactly?</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t have long.\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cAbout six minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only take six minutes,\u201d I murmur with an enticing glance, and Nathaniel smiles back, as though I\u2019m joking.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d I say, trying to sound modest yet sexy. \u201cI\u2019m fast. Six minutes, give or take.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence for a few moments. An incredulous expression is coming over Nathaniel\u2019s face. Somehow he doesn\u2019t look as impressed as I thought he would.</p><p>\u201cWell ... round here we take things a bit slower,\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying not to look at all disappointed. \u201cEr ... well ... I\u2019m sure ...\u201d I trail off.</p><p>I should not have started that sentence.</p><p>He looks at his watch again. \u201cI must be off. I have to drive over to Gloucester tonight.\u201d</p><p>I feel an inward drop at his businesslike tone. He\u2019s barely looking at me anymore. I should never have mentioned timing, I realize in dismay. Everyone knows, you never bring up any kind of numerical measurement during sex with a man. It\u2019s the most basic rule.</p><p>\u201cSo ... I\u2019ll see you,\u201d I say, trying to sound casual yet encouraging. \u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d He shrugs noncommittally. \u201cAre you around?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess so. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... I may see you.\u201d</p><p>And with that he\u2019s striding away again over the grass, and I\u2019m left with nothing but a misshapen loaf of bread and total confusion.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Like I said. There should be a different system. There should be some kind of universal arrangement that leaves no room for misunderstanding. It could involve hand signals, perhaps. Or small, discreet stickers placed on the lapel, color-coded for different messages:</p><p>AVAILABLE/NOT AVAILABLE</p><p>RELATIONSHIP ON/RELATIONSHIP OFF</p><p>SEX IMMINENT/SEX CANCELED/SEX MERELY POSTPONED.</p><p>How else are you supposed to know what\u2019s going on? How?</p><p>By the next morning I\u2019ve thought long and hard and have got nowhere. Either: a) Nathaniel was offended by my references to sex and isn\u2019t interested anymore. Or b) he\u2019s fine, it\u2019s all still on, he was just being a man and not saying much, and I should stop obsessing.</p><p>Or somewhere in between.</p><p>Or some other option I haven\u2019t even considered. Or ...</p><p>Actually, I think that might cover it. But still. I\u2019m totally confused just thinking about it.</p><p>I stumble downstairs in my robe at around nine, to find Eddie and Trish in the hall, dressed up very smartly. Eddie is in a blue blazer with shiny gold buttons, and Trish is in a white slub silk suit, with the biggest corsage of fake red roses I\u2019ve ever seen. She also seems to be having the teeniest problem doing up the buttons of her jacket. At last she edges the last one into its buttonhole and stands back to look at herself in the mirror, panting slightly.</p><p>Now she looks as though she can\u2019t move her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she says to Eddie.</p><p>\u201cYes, very nice,\u201d he says, frowning at a copy of Road Map of Britain 1994. \u201cIs it the A347? Or the A367?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm ...

And now Eddie\u2019s wandered off into the study.</p><p>\u201cShall I ...\u201d I offer.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her neck flames red. \u201cIf you would be so kind.\u201d</p><p>I move forward and undo the buttons as gently as I can, which is not very, given how stiff the fabric is. When I\u2019ve finished she takes a step backward and regards herself again, looking slightly dissatisfied, plucking at her silky shirt thing.</p><p>\u201cTell me Samantha,\u201d she says casually. \u201cIf you saw me now for the first time ... what word would you use to describe me?\u201d</p><p>Oh, bloody hell. I\u2019m sure this wasn\u2019t in my job description. I rack my brains hastily for the most flattering word I can come up with.</p><p>\u201cUm ... um ... elegant,\u201d I say at last, nodding as though to add conviction to what I\u2019m saying. \u201cI\u2019d say you were elegant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElegant?\u201d Something tells me I got it wrong.</p><p>\u201cI mean, thin!\u201d I amend, in sudden realization.</p><p>How could I have overlooked thin?</p><p>\u201cThin.\u201d She looks at herself a few moments, turning from side to side. \u201cThin.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t sound entirely happy. What\u2019s wrong with being thin and elegant, for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>Not that she\u2019s either, let\u2019s be honest.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about ...\u201d She shakes back her hair, deliberately avoiding my eye. \u201cWhat about ... young?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m too flummoxed to answer. Young?</p><p>Young compared to what?</p><p>\u201cEr ... absolutely,\u201d I say at last. \u201cThat ... goes without saying.\u201d</p><p>Please don\u2019t say, \u201cHow old do you think I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old would you say I am, Samantha?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s moving her head from side to side, flicking dust off her jacket, as though she\u2019s not really interested in the answer. But I know her ears are ready and waiting, like two giant microphones ready to pick up the slightest sound.</p><p>My face is prickling. What am I going to say? I\u2019ll say ... thirty-five. No. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. She can\u2019t be that self-deluded. Forty? No. I can\u2019t say forty. It\u2019s too near the truth.</p> <p>\u201cAre you about ... thirty-seven?\u201d I hazard at last. Trish turns round\u2014and from her smug expression of pleasure I reckon I hit the note of flattery about right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually ... thirty-nine!\u201d she says, two spots of color appearing on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaim, trying not to look at her crow\u2019s-feet. \u201cThat\u2019s ... amazing!\u201d</p><p>She is such a liar. She was forty-six last February. And if she doesn\u2019t want people to know, she shouldn\u2019t leave her passport out on her dressing table.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d she says, clearly cheered up. \u201cWe\u2019ll be out all day at my sister\u2019s party. Nathaniel will be coming over to work in the garden, but I expect you know that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel?\u201d I feel an electric jolt. \u201cHe\u2019s coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called this morning. The sweet peas need ... stringing or looping or something?\u201d She gets out a lip pencil and begins outlining her already lined lips.</p><p>\u201cRight. I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d I\u2019m trying to stay collected, but tentacles of excitement are creeping through me. \u201cSo ... he\u2019s working on a Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he often does. He\u2019s very dedicated.\u201d She stands back to look at her reflection, then starts shading in her lips with yet more lipstick. \u201cI heard he took you to his little pub?\u201d</p><p>His little pub. She is so patronizing.</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes. He did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so glad about that, really.\u201d She takes out a mascara wand. \u201cWe nearly had to look for another gardener, can you imagine. Although of course it was a great shame for him. After all his plans.\u201d</p><p>I must have missed a beat or three. What\u2019s she talking about?</p><p>\u201cWhat was a shame?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel. His nursery. Plant thing.\u201d She frowns at her reflection. \u201cOrganic something or other. He showed us the business proposition. In fact, we even considered backing him. We are very supportive employers, Samantha.\u201d She fixes me with a blue gaze as though daring me to disagree.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set?\u201d Eddie comes out of the study wearing a Panama hat. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be bloody sweltering, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEddie, don\u2019t start,\u201d snaps Trish, shoving her mascara wand back in the tube. \u201cWe are going to this party and that\u2019s final. Have you got the present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d I ask, trying to haul the conversation back on track. \u201cWith Nathaniel\u2019s plans?\u201d</p><p>Trish makes a small, regretful moue at herself in the mirror. \u201cWell, his father passed away very suddenly, and there was all that dreadful business with the pubs. And he changed his mind. Never bought the land.\u201d She gives herself another dissatisfied look. \u201cShould I wear my pink suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie and I say in unison. I glance at Eddie\u2019s exasperated face and stifle a laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYou look lovely, Mrs. Geiger,\u201d I say. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, between us, Eddie and I manage to chivvy her away from the mirror, out the front door, and across the gravel to Eddie\u2019s Porsche. Eddie\u2019s right, it\u2019s going to be a boiling day. The sky is already a translucent blue, the sun a dazzling ball.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will you be back?\u201d I ask as they get in.</p><p>\u201cNot until late this evening,\u201d says Trish. \u201cEddie, where\u2019s the present? Ah, Nathaniel, here you are.\u201d</p><p>I look over the top of the car. There he is, coming down the drive, in jeans and an old gray T-shirt, his rucksack over his shoulder. And here I am, in my dressing gown with my hair all over the place.</p> <p>And still not sure how things have been left between us. Although certain bits of my body are already responding to the sight of him. They don\u2019t seem to be in any confusion at all.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say as he gets near.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s eyes crinkle in a friendly way, but he doesn\u2019t make any attempt to kiss me or even smile. Instead, he just comes to a halt. There\u2019s something about his intent, purposeful gaze that makes me feel a bit wobbly around the legs.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I wrench my eyes away. \u201cYou\u2019re ... working hard today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do with some help,\u201d he says casually. \u201cIf you\u2019re at a loose end. Mum told me you weren\u2019t cooking today.\u201d</p><p>I feel a huge leap of delight, which I attempt to hide with a cough.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I shrug slightly, almost frowning. \u201cWell ... maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He nods to the Geigers and saunters off toward the garden.</p><p>Trish has been watching this exchange in increasing dissatisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not very affectionate with each other, are you?\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, in my experience\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave them alone, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d retorts Eddie, starting the engine. \u201cLet\u2019s get this bloody thing over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie Geiger!\u201d Trish shrills. \u201cThis is my sister\u2019s party you\u2019re talking about! Do you realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eddie revs the engine, drowning out her voice, and with a spattering of gravel the Porsche disappears out of the drive, leaving me alone in the silent, baking sunshine.</p><p>Right.</p> <p>So ... it\u2019s just Nathaniel and me. Alone together. Until eight o\u2019clock this evening. That\u2019s the basic scenario.</p><p>A pulse is starting to thud somewhere deep inside me. Like a conductor setting the beat, like an introduction.</p><p>Deliberately nonchalant, I turn on the gravel and start to make my way back toward the house. As I pass a flower bed I even pause and study a random plant for a moment, holding the green leaves between my fingers.</p><p>I guess I could wander down and offer a helping hand. It would be polite.</p><p>I force myself not to rush. I take a shower and get dressed and have breakfast, consisting of half a cup of tea and an apple. Then I go upstairs and put on a little makeup.</p><p>I\u2019ve dressed low-key. A T-shirt, a cotton skirt, and flip-flops. As I look in the mirror I feel almost shivery with anticipation. But other than that my mind is weirdly blank. I seem to have lost all my thought processes.</p><p>After the cool house, the garden feels scorching, the air still and almost shimmery. I keep to the shade, heading down the side path, not knowing where he\u2019s working, where I\u2019m heading. And then I see him, in the midst of a row of lavender and lilac-colored flowers, knotting a length of twine.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He looks up and wipes his brow. I\u2019m half-expecting him to drop what he\u2019s doing, come forward, and kiss me. But he doesn\u2019t. He just carries on knotting, then cuts the twine off with a knife.</p><p>\u201cI came to help,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTying up the sweet peas.\u201d He gestures at the plants, which are growing up what look like cane wigwams. \u201cThey need support, otherwise they just flop.\u201d He throws me a ball of twine. \u201cHave a go. Just tie them gently.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s not joking. I really am helping with the gardening. Cautiously I unwind a length of twine and follow what he\u2019s doing, cutting with a pair of secateurs he passes to me. The soft leaves and petals tickle me as I work and fill the air with an amazing sweet scent.</p><p>Nathaniel comes over to take a look. \u201cYou could tie a little tighter.\u201d His hand brushes briefly against mine as he turns away. \u201cLet\u2019s see you do the next one.\u201d</p><p>My hand tingles at his touch. Did he mean to do that? Uncertain, I tie up the next plant, knotting tighter than before.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s good.\u201d Suddenly Nathaniel\u2019s voice is behind me and I feel his fingers on the back of my neck, tracing around my earlobe. \u201cYou need to do the whole row.\u201d</p> <p>He definitely meant to do that. No question. I turn round, wanting to reciprocate, but he\u2019s already on the other side of the row, intent on a sweet pea plant, as though nothing happened.</p><p>He has a game plan, I suddenly realize.</p><p>Now I really am turned on.</p><p>The pulse is growing stronger inside me as I move from plant to plant. There\u2019s silence except for the rustling of leaves and faint snap of twine as I cut. Three more plants and I\u2019m at the end of the row.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d I say without turning round.</p> <p>\u201cGreat, let\u2019s see.\u201d He comes over to inspect my knotted twine. I can feel his other hand edging up my thigh, pushing up my skirt. I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m transfixed. Then suddenly he breaks away, businesslike again, picking up a pair of trugs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I can\u2019t even frame a sentence properly.</p><p>He kisses me briefly, hard on the mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s move on. Raspberries need picking.\u201d</p><p>The raspberry cages are further down the garden, like rooms of green netting, with dry, earthy floors and rows of plants. As we enter there\u2019s no sound except that of buzzing insects and the flapping of a trapped sparrow, which Nathaniel shoos away through the netting.</p><p>We work the first row wordlessly, picking the fruit off the plants. By the end of the row my mouth is tangy with the taste of them, my hands are scratched and aching from the constant plucking, and I\u2019m sweating all over. The heat seems more intense in this raspberry cage than anywhere else in the garden.</p><p>We meet at the end of the row. Sweat is pouring down our faces.</p> <p>\u201cHot work,\u201d he says. He puts his basket down and strips off his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There\u2019s a still beat between us. Then, almost defiantly, I do the same. I\u2019m standing there in my bra, inches from him, my skin pale and milky next to his.</p><p>\u201cHave we done enough?\u201d I gesture at the basket, but Nathaniel doesn\u2019t even glance down.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>His expression makes me damp and prickly behind my knees. I meet his eyes and it\u2019s like we\u2019re playing truth or dare.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t reach those ones.\u201d I point at a high cluster of fruit just out of reach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d He leans over me, skin against skin, and I feel his mouth on my earlobe as he picks the fruit. My entire body responds. I can\u2019t bear this; I need it to stop. And I need it not to stop.</p><p>But it goes on. We move up and down the rows like two performers in a courtly dance. Outwardly concentrating on our moves yet aware only of each other. At the end of every row, he brushes some part of me with his mouth or fingers. One time he feeds me raspberries and I graze his fingers with my teeth. I want to get at him, I want my hands all over him, but every time he turns away before anything can progress.</p> <p>I\u2019m starting to shiver all over with desire. He unhooked my bra two rows ago. I\u2019ve discarded my knickers. He\u2019s unbuckled his belt. And still, still we\u2019re picking raspberries.</p><p>The baskets are full and heavy and my arms are aching, but I\u2019m barely aware of them. All I\u2019m aware of is that my whole body is throbbing, that I can\u2019t stand this for much longer. As I reach the end of the last row I put the basket down and face him, unable to hide how desperate I am.</p><p>\u201cAre we done?\u201d</p><p>My breath is coming in short, hot bursts. I have to have him. He has to realize.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done pretty well.\u201d His gaze drifts toward the other fruit cages. \u201cThere\u2019s still more to do ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cNo more.\u201d</p><p>I stand there in the heat and the dusty earth, panting and aching. And just as I think I might explode, he comes forward and bends his mouth down to my nipple, and I nearly swoon. And this time he doesn\u2019t move away. This time is for real. His hands are moving over my body, my skirt is falling to the ground, his jeans are sliding off. Then I\u2019m shuddering, and clutching him, and crying out. And the raspberries are forgotten, scattered on the ground, squashed, crushed beneath us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We seem to lie still for hours afterward. I feel numb with euphoria. There are stones and dust embedded in my back and knees and hands and raspberry stains all over my skin. I don\u2019t mind. I can\u2019t even bring myself to lift a hand and remove the ant that is crawling up my stomach like a tickling dot.</p><p>My head is on Nathaniel\u2019s chest, his heart beating like a deep, comforting clock. The sun is hot on my skin. I have no idea what time it is. I don\u2019t care what time it is. I\u2019ve lost all sense of minutes and hours.</p><p>At last Nathaniel shifts his head slightly. He kisses my shoulder, then smiles. \u201cYou taste of raspberry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was\u2014\u201d I break off, almost too stupefied to frame any sensible words. \u201cYou know ... normally I ...\u201d A huge yawn suddenly overcomes me and I clap my hand over my mouth. I want to go to sleep now, for days.</p> <p>Nathaniel traces lazy circles around my back.</p><p>\u201cSix minutes isn\u2019t sex,\u201d I hear him saying as my eyes crash shut. \u201cSix minutes is a boiled egg.\u201d</p><p>By the time I wake up, the raspberry cages are in partial shade. Nathaniel has moved from underneath me, given me a pillow constructed from my crumpled, raspberry-stained skirt, put on his jeans, and brought down some beer from the Geigers\u2019 fridge. I sit up, my head still groggy, to see him leaning against a tree on the grass.</p><p>\u201cSlacker,\u201d I say. \u201cThe Geigers think you\u2019re tying up sweet peas.\u201d</p><p>He turns toward me with a flicker of amusement. \u201cSleep well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long was I asleep?\u201d I put my hand to my face and remove a small stone. I feel totally disoriented.</p><p>\u201cCouple of hours. You want some of this?\u201d He gestures to the bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>I get to my feet, brush myself down, put on my skirt and bra as a good compromise outfit and join him. I sink back against the tree trunk, my bare feet in the cool grass.</p><p>\u201cGod, I feel so ...\u201d I lift a hand and let it drop down with a heavy thump.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as twitchy as you were,\u201d says Nathaniel. \u201cYou used to jump a mile whenever I spoke to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh, you did.\u201d He nods. \u201cLike a rabbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was a badger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a rabbit\u2013badger cross. Very rare breed.\u201d He grins at me. For a while neither of us speaks. I watch a tiny plane high above, leaving a white trail in the sky.</p><p>\u201cMum says you\u2019ve changed too. She said she reckons whoever you\u2019ve run away from ... whatever happened ... they\u2019re losing their grip on you.\u201d</p><p>The question is there in his voice, but I don\u2019t respond. I\u2019m thinking of Iris yesterday. Letting me take all my frustrations out on her. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s had it easy herself.</p><p>\u201cYour mum\u2019s amazing,\u201d I say at last. I put the bottle down and roll onto the grass, staring up at the blue sky. I can smell the earth beneath my head and feel grass stems against my ears and hear a grasshopper chirruping nearby.</p><p>I have changed. I can feel it in myself. I feel ... stiller.</p><p>\u201cWho would you be?\u201d I say, twisting a grass stem round my finger. \u201cIf you could just run away. Become a different person.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be me,\u201d he says at last. \u201cI\u2019m happy as I am. I like living where I live. I like doing what I do.\u201d</p><p>I roll over onto my front and look up at him, squinting in the sunlight. \u201cThere must be something else you\u2019d like to do. Some dream you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the nursery you were going to set up?\u201d</p><p>I see the surprise on his face. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrish told me about it this morning. She said you had business plans and everything. What happened?\u201d</p><p>For a moment he\u2019s silent, his eyes averted from mine. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on inside.</p><p>\u201cIt was just an idea,\u201d he says finally.</p><p>\u201cYou gave it up for your mum. To run the pubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He reaches for a low-growing branch and starts stripping it of leaves. \u201cEverything changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you really want to run the pubs?\u201d I edge forward on the grass, trying to intercept his gaze. \u201cYou said it yourself, you\u2019re not a landlord. You\u2019re a gardener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of want.\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s voice has a sudden edge of frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s a family business. Someone has to run it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d I persist. \u201cWhy not your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ... different. He does his own thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou could do your own thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have responsibilities.\u201d His frown grows heavier. \u201cMy mum\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d want you to do whatever you want to do,\u201d I insist. \u201cI know she would.

What is it?\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel looks me directly in the eye and takes a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cDo you have kids?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so dumbfounded, I can\u2019t speak for a moment. He thinks I have kids? A gurgle of relieved laughter rises through me before I can stop it.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have kids! What, you think I\u2019ve left five starving little mouths behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He frowns, looking sheepish but defensive. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ... I mean ... do I look like I\u2019ve had five kids?\u201d I can\u2019t help a note of indignation, and he starts to laugh too.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not five ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I\u2019m about to hit him with his shirt when a voice pierces the air.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Trish. Coming from the house. They\u2019re home?</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d her voice trills again. \u201cAre you outside?\u201d</p> <p>Oh, fuck. I\u2019m naked except for a skirt and a bra, and covered in dust and raspberry stains. Nathaniel is much the same, except in jeans.</p><p>\u201cQuick! My clothes!\u201d I hiss, scrabbling to my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d says Nathaniel, looking around.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I\u2019m trying to control my laughter. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get the sack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d I can hear the clunk of the conservatory doors being opened.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I squeak. \u201cShe\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d says Nathaniel, retrieving his T-shirt from the raspberry cage. He pops it over his head and at once looks pretty together. \u201cI\u2019ll create a diversion. You sneak up the side, behind the shrubs, go in the kitchen door, run upstairs, and get changed. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cAnd what\u2019s our story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur story is ...\u201d He pauses as though thinking. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shag in the garden or help ourselves to beers from the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I can\u2019t help giggling. \u201cGood plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo swiftly, Brown Rabbit.\u201d He kisses me, and I dart across the lawn to the cover of a huge rhododendron bush.</p><p>I sneak up the side of the garden, keeping behind the shrubs, trying not to give myself away. My bare feet are cool on the damp, shaded earth; I step on a sharp pebble and wince in total silence. I feel about ten years old, playing hide-and-seek, the same mixture of terror and delight pounding in my heart.</p><p>When I\u2019m only ten yards from the house I crouch behind a shrub and wait. After a minute or two I see Nathaniel firmly leading the Geigers down the lawn toward the lily pond.</p><p>\u201cI think we could have a case of powdery mildew,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cI thought you should see it for yourselves.\u201d</p><p>I wait until they\u2019re well past, then sprint to the conservatory, in through the house, and up the stairs. When I\u2019m in my room and the door is safely closed, I collapse on the bed, wanting to laugh at my own relief, at the hilarity, at the silliness of it all. Then I get up and look out the window. I can just see them all down by the pond. Nathaniel is pointing at something with a stick.</p><p>I hurry into the bathroom, turn on the shower full blast, and stand under it for thirty seconds. I pull on clean underwear, a pair of fresh jeans, and a demure long-sleeved top. I even add fresh lipstick. Then, slipping on a pair of espadrilles, I head downstairs and out into the garden.</p><p>Nathaniel and the Geigers are by now making their way back up to the house. Trish\u2019s heels are sinking into the lawn and both she and Eddie look hot and irritated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say casually as they approach.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d says Nathaniel. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you all afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was studying recipes,\u201d I say innocently, and turn to Trish with a polite smile. \u201cDid you enjoy the party, Mrs. Geiger?\u201d</p><p>Too late I see Nathaniel making deathlike, finger-across-the-throat gestures behind their backs.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for asking, Samantha.\u201d Trish snaps her purse shut and dabs her nose with a tissue. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about the party, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Eddie makes an incensed spluttering sound. \u201cYou won\u2019t bloody give up, will you?

I raise my eyebrows at Nathaniel, who grins back over Trish\u2019s head.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like a nice cup of tea, Mrs. Geiger?\u201d I say soothingly. \u201cOr ... a Bloody Mary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Samantha,\u201d she replies, lifting her chin in a dignified manner. \u201cA Bloody Mary would be very nice.\u201d</p><p>As we walk up to the conservatory,Trish seems to calm down a little. She even mixes her own Bloody Mary instead of bossing me around as I do it, and makes one each for me and Nathaniel too.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she says, after we\u2019ve each taken a sip and sat down among the frondy plants. \u201cThere was something I needed to tell you, Samantha. We\u2019re having a visitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say, trying not to smile. Nathaniel is sitting next to me and is edging off my espadrille with his foot under the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cMy niece is coming to stay tomorrow for a few weeks. She\u2019s coming to get some peace and quiet in the country. She has some work to do, and it\u2019s very important she isn\u2019t disturbed, so Mr. Geiger and I offered her a place here. I\u2019d like you to get the spare room ready for her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery good.\u201d I nod dutifully.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need a bed made up and a desk\u2014I believe she\u2019s bringing a laptop computer with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Geiger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a very bright girl, Melissa.\u201d Trish lights up a cigarette with a Tiffany lighter. \u201cExtremely high-powered. One of these City girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say, trying to stay composed as Nathaniel finally manages to push my espadrille off. \u201cWhat does she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lawyer,\u201d says Trish\u2014and I look up, speechless. A lawyer?</p><p>A lawyer is coming to stay in this house?</p><p>Nathaniel is tickling the sole of my foot, but I can only respond with a weak smile. This could be bad.</p> <p>What if I know this lawyer?</p><p>As Trish mixes herself another Bloody Mary, I\u2019m racking my brains frantically. Melissa. It could be Melissa Davis from Freshwater. It could be Melissa Christie from Clark Forrester. It could be Melissa Taylor who worked on the DeltaCo merger. We spent hours in the same room together. She\u2019d recognize me straightaway.</p><p>\u201cSo ... is she a niece on your side, Mrs. Geiger?\u201d I ask casually as Trish sits down. \u201cIs she called Geiger too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s called Hurst.\u201d</p><p>Melissa Hurst. Doesn\u2019t ring any bells.</p><p>\u201cAnd where does she work?\u201d Please let it be abroad....</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s at some high-powered place in London.\u201d Trish gestures vaguely with her glass.</p><p>OK, so I don\u2019t know her. But if she\u2019s at any of the big law firms she\u2019s bound to have heard about me. She\u2019s bound to know about the Carter Spink lawyer who lost fifty million and ran away. She\u2019ll know every humiliating detail of my disgrace.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling cold all over at the thought of it. All it takes is for her to recognize my name, to put two and two together ... and the whole story will come out. I\u2019ll be as humiliated here as I was in London. Everyone will know what happened at Carter Spink. Everyone will know my lies. I glance at Nathaniel and feel a spike of dread.</p><p>I can\u2019t let things be spoiled. Not now.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>The crucial thing is that this lawyer doesn\u2019t recognize me. So the following afternoon, after I\u2019ve prepared the spare room, I hurry to my own room and pin my hair up on top of my head, allowing large tendrils to escape artistically and conceal my face. Then I find myself adding a pair of old tinted glasses I discovered in the dressing table drawer, which look like they date from the 1980s. As disguises go, this isn\u2019t exactly the most subtle job in the world\u2014but at least I look nothing like my old self.</p><p>As I come downstairs, Nathaniel is heading out of the kitchen, looking pissed off. He looks up at me and stops dead in surprise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSamantha ... what have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my hair?\u201d I touch it casually. \u201cI just wanted it in a different style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre those your sunglasses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a bit of a headache. So ... what\u2019s up?\u201d I add, hastily changing the subject.</p> <p>\u201cTrish.\u201d He scowls. \u201cShe\u2019s been lecturing me on noise. I can\u2019t mow the lawn between the hours of ten and two. I can\u2019t use the trimmer without giving warning. Could I please tiptoe on the gravel. Tiptoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of this blasted visitor. We all have to dance around her.

My work\u2019s important!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming!\u201d Trish\u2019s voice suddenly shrills from the kitchen and she comes hurrying out. \u201cAre we all ready?\u201d She flings open the front door and I hear the sound of a car door opening in the drive.</p><p>This is it. I pull a few more strands of hair over my face and clench my fists by my sides. If I recognize this woman I\u2019ll just keep my eyes down, mumble my words, and play my part. I\u2019m a housekeeper. I have never been anything but a housekeeper.</p> <p>\u201cNow, you should get lots of peace here, Melissa,\u201d I can hear Trish saying. \u201cI\u2019ve instructed the staff to look after you with extra special care....\u201d</p><p>I exchange looks with Nathaniel, who rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHere we are! Let me hold the door open ...\u201d</p><p>I hold my breath. A moment later Trish enters the house, followed by a girl in jeans and a tight white top, dragging a suitcase.</p><p>This is the top, high-powered lawyer?</p><p>She has long dark hair and a pert, pretty face, and can\u2019t be much out of her teens.</p> <p>\u201cMelissa, this is our wonderful housekeeper, Samantha\u2014\u201d Trish breaks off in surprise. \u201cSamantha ... what on earth are you wearing? You look like Elton John!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say awkwardly, removing the sunglasses. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fab to be here.\u201d Melissa has a boarding-school drawl. \u201cLondon was, like, sooo getting me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Geiger said you\u2019re a lawyer at some ... big place in London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYah.\u201d She gives me a smug smile. \u201cI\u2019m at Chelsea Law School.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>She\u2019s not even a qualified lawyer. She\u2019s a law student. She\u2019s a baby. I cautiously raise my head and meet her eyes\u2014but there\u2019s not a blink of recognition. Oh, for God\u2019s sake. I have nothing to worry about from this girl. I almost want to laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s this?\u201d Melissa bats her mascaraed eyelashes alluringly at Nathaniel, whose scowl deepens.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Nathaniel, our gardener,\u201d says Trish. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s under strict instructions not to disturb you. I\u2019ve told him, you need absolute quiet for your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I\u2019ve got loads of revision to do.\u201d Melissa gives a world-weary sigh and pushes a hand through her hair. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the workload, Auntie Trish. I\u2019ve been soooo stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it!\u201d Trish puts an arm around her shoulders and squeezes tight. \u201cNow, what would you like to do first? We\u2019re all at your disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you unpack all my things?\u201d Melissa turns to me. \u201cThey\u2019ll be creased, so they\u2019ll all need ironing.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not going to do her own unpacking? I\u2019m to be this girl\u2019s personal maid?</p><p>\u201cI might take my books out in the garden,\u201d she adds airily. \u201cMaybe the gardener could set up a table for me in the shade?\u201d</p><p>Trish is watching in total admiration as Melissa rummages in a backpack full of textbooks.</p><p>\u201cLook at all those books, Samantha!\u201d she exclaims as Melissa retrieves Beginner\u2019s Guide to Litigation. \u201cLook at all those long words!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... wow,\u201d I say politely.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make us all some coffee first?\u201d Trish turns to me. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it on the terrace.

I can see the words Math and English and Adult Learning.</p><p>I\u2019m totally speechless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Melissa will be delighted to help with anything tricky,\u201d chips in Trish. \u201cWon\u2019t you, love?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d says Melissa with a patronizing smile. \u201cWell done you, Samantha! It\u2019s never too late.\u201d She pushes her full cup of coffee toward me. \u201cMake me another coffee, will you? This one\u2019s too weak.\u201d</p><p>By the middle of the following day I have had just about enough of Melissa. I\u2019ve made her about fifty cups of coffee, half of which she hasn\u2019t bothered to drink. I\u2019ve brought her chilled water. I\u2019ve rustled up sandwiches. I\u2019ve washed all the dirty laundry, which it turned out her suitcase contained. I\u2019ve ironed her a white shirt to wear in the evening. Every time I try to start on one of my regular jobs I hear Melissa\u2019s high-pitched voice summoning me.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trish is tiptoeing around as though we have Cherie Blair herself in the garden, working on some vital human-rights case. As I dust the living room, she\u2019s watching Melissa, sitting at a table set up on the lawn.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working so hard. Such an intelligent girl, Melissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I grunt, noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not easy to get into law school, Samantha. Especially the best one! Melissa had to beat hundreds of people just to get the place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d I flick my cloth roughly over the TV. \u201cThat\u2019s great. So ... how long is she staying?\u201d I try to ask the question casually.</p><p>\u201cIt depends,\u201d replies Trish. \u201cHer exams are in a few weeks, and I\u2019ve said she\u2019s welcome to stay as long as she likes!\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks? It\u2019s only been one day, and already she\u2019s driving me mad.</p><p>I spend the afternoon in the kitchen, pretending to have selective deafness. Whenever Melissa calls me, I turn the blender on, or the radio up, or clatter around with baking trays. If she wants me she can find me herself.</p><p>At last, she appears at the kitchen door, her cheeks flushed with annoyance. \u201cSamantha, I\u2019ve been calling you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look up innocently from the butter I\u2019m chopping to make pastry. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a bell system or something.\u201d She exhales in impatience. \u201cThis is ridiculous, me having to stop what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy water jug is empty. And I need some kind of snack. To keep my energy levels up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have brought your jug into the kitchen,\u201d I suggest mildly. \u201cOr made your own snack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t have time to be making snacks, OK?\u201d snaps Melissa. \u201cI\u2019m under a great deal of time pressure right now. I have piles of work, I have exam deadlines ... you have no idea what my life is like.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m silent for a moment, trying to get my resentment under control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you out a sandwich,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says sarcastically, then stands with her arms folded, as though she\u2019s waiting for something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cGo on.\u201d She gestures with her head. \u201cCurtsy.\u201d</p><p>What? She can\u2019t be serious. \u201cI\u2019m not curtsying to you!\u201d I say, almost laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou curtsy to my aunt. And my uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my employers,\u201d I retort tightly. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d And believe me, if I could turn back the clock, curtsying would not be featured in any of our lives.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m living in this house. So I\u2019m your employer too. You should show me the same respect.\u201d</p> <p>I want to slap this girl. If she was my junior at Carter Spink I would ... annihilate her.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I put my knife down. \u201cI\u2019ll go and ask Mrs. Geiger, shall I?\u201d Before she can reply I stride out of the kitchen. I cannot tolerate this. If Trish takes her side, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m leaving.</p><p>I can\u2019t see Trish anywhere downstairs, so I head upstairs, heart racing. I arrive outside her room and knock. \u201cMrs. Geiger? I\u2019d like a word.\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, Trish opens the door a crack and pokes her head out, looking a little ruffled. \u201cSamantha! What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy with the current situation,\u201d I say, attempting a calm, civilized voice. \u201cI\u2019d like to discuss it, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat situation?\u201d She wrinkles her brow.</p> <p>\u201cWith Melissa. And her ... her constant needs. I\u2019m being taken away from my regular duties. The housekeeping will suffer if I have to keep attending to her.\u201d</p><p>Trish doesn\u2019t seem to have heard a word.</p><p>\u201cOh, Samantha ... not now.\u201d She waves a distracted, dismissive hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later.\u201d</p><p>I can hear Eddie mumbling something from inside the room. Great. They were probably having sex. She probably wants to get back to Turkish style.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I try to control my frustration. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just ... get on, then, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Trish suddenly seems to focus on me. \u201cSamantha, we\u2019ll be having champagne on the terrace in half an hour with some ... ahm ... friends. I\u2019d like you to wear something other than your uniform.\u201d Her eyes run over it with slight distaste. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most flattering garment you possess.\u201d</p><p>You bloody chose it! I want to yell back at her. But instead, I curtsy, turn away, and walk to my room, fuming.</p><p>Bloody Trish. Bloody Melissa. If she\u2019s waiting for a sandwich, she can just wait.</p> <p>I close the door, slump down on my bed, and look down at my hands, red and raw from hand-washing Melissa\u2019s delicate garments.</p><p>What am I doing here?</p><p>I can feel disappointment and disillusionment spreading through me. Maybe I was being naive\u2014but I honestly thought Trish and Eddie had come to respect me. Not just as their housekeeper but as a person. But the way Trish behaved just now ... it\u2019s plain I\u2019m just \u201cstaff\u201d to them. Like some sort of useful object, one notch above the Hoover. I almost feel like packing my bags and walking out.</p><p>I have a sudden vision of myself flouncing down the stairs, flinging open the door, shooting over my shoulder to Melissa, \u201cAnd by the way, I\u2019ve got a law degree too, and mine is better than yours.\u201d</p><p>But that would be petulant. No, worse. It would be pathetic.</p><p>I massage my temples, gradually getting things in perspective.</p><p>I chose to do this. No one forced me. And maybe it wasn\u2019t the most rational move in the world, and maybe I won\u2019t stay here forever. But it\u2019s up to me to make the most of it while I am here. It\u2019s up to me to be professional.</p><p>Or at least ... as professional as I can be, bearing in mind I still haven\u2019t a clue what a savarin mold is.</p><p>At last I summon some energy and get up off the bed. I change out of my uniform, into a dress, and brush out my hair. I even add some lipstick for good measure. Then I reach for my mobile and text Nathaniel:</p><p>hi! RU there? sam</p><p>I wait for a reply but none comes. He hasn\u2019t been around all afternoon, I realize. I wonder what he\u2019s up to.</p><p>As I descend the stairs into the hall, the house is still and silent. I don\u2019t know what time Trish\u2019s friends are coming, but there\u2019s no sign of them yet. Maybe I\u2019ve got time to finish my pastry quickly. I might even get the vegetables peeled.</p><p>I\u2019m hurrying toward the kitchen when Nathaniel appears out the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d He puts his arms round me and kisses me, pulling me under the stairs, which we\u2019ve discovered is quite a convenient hiding place. \u201cMmm. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel\u2014\u201d I protest, but his grip around me only gets tighter. After a few moments I manage to wriggle free.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel, I\u2019ve got pastry to make. I\u2019m already behind schedule, and apparently I\u2019ve got to serve drinks to some people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Nathaniel tugs me back, glancing at his watch. \u201cOne more minute.

Sweetheart, your secret\u2019s out. We know.\u201d</p><p>I feel a plunging dread. They know? What do they know?</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly\u2014\u201d I begin, but Nathaniel puts a finger to my lips.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, no. You\u2019re going to get your surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise?\u201d I falter.</p><p>\u201cNow come out. They\u2019re waiting for you. Close your eyes ...\u201d He puts one arm around my waist and the other hand over my eyes. \u201cCome this way ... I\u2019ll lead you....\u201d</p><p>As I walk forward in darkness, guided only by Nathaniel\u2019s arm, I feel almost sick with fear. My mind is ranging wildly about, trying to work out what might have been going on behind my back. Who\u2019s waiting for me out there?</p><p>Please, please, don\u2019t say they\u2019ve tried to fix my life up. Please don\u2019t say they\u2019ve arranged some kind of reunion. I have a sudden image of Ketterman standing on the lawn, his steel glasses glinting in the sunlight. Or Arnold. Or my mother.</p><p>\u201cHere she is!\u201d Nathaniel guides me out of the French doors and down the steps into the garden. I can feel sun on my face and hear some kind of flapping sound and ... jazz? \u201cAll right! Open your eyes!\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t open my eyes. Whatever it is, I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK!\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s laughing. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to eat you! Open them!\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and blink several times, wondering if I\u2019m dreaming.</p><p>What ... what\u2019s going on?</p><p>An enormous banner reading happy birthday, samantha! is tied between two trees. That\u2019s what\u2019s making the flapping noise. The garden table is laid with a white tablecloth, a bouquet of flowers, several bottles of champagne, and a bowl of strawberries. A bunch of shiny helium balloons reading Samantha is tethered to a chair. Eddie and Trish are standing on the grass, together with Iris, Eamonn, and Melissa\u2014and they\u2019re all beaming at me, apart from Melissa, who\u2019s pouting.</p><p>I feel as though I\u2019ve lurched into some parallel universe.</p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d they all cry out in unison. \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth but no sound comes out. I\u2019m too poleaxed to speak. Why do the Geigers think it\u2019s my birthday?</p> <p>\u201cLook at her,\u201d says Trish. \u201cShe\u2019s stunned! Aren\u2019t you, Samantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... yes,\u201d I stutter.</p><p>\u201cShe had no idea,\u201d confirms Nathaniel with a grin.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, sweetie.\u201d Iris comes over, clasps me tightly, and gives me a kiss.</p><p>\u201cEddie, open the champagne!\u201d I can hear Trish exclaiming impatiently behind me. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><p>What do I do? What do I say? How do you break it to the people who have organized your surprise birthday party that actually ... it\u2019s not your birthday?</p><p>Why would they think it\u2019s my birthday? Did I give them some made-up date of birth at the interview? But I don\u2019t remember doing that\u2014</p><p>\u201cChampagne for the birthday girl!\u201d Eddie pops open a bottle and the champagne froths into a glass.</p><p>\u201cMany happy returns!\u201d Eamonn proffers the bowl of strawberries. \u201cAh, you should have seen your face just now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPriceless!\u201d agrees Trish. \u201cNow, let\u2019s have a toast!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t let this go on any longer.</p><p>\u201cUm ... Mr. and Mrs. Geiger ... everyone ... this is lovely, and I\u2019m really touched.\u201d I swallow hard, screwing myself up to say it. \u201cBut ... it\u2019s not my birthday.\u201d</p><p>Everyone bursts into laughter.</p><p>\u201cI told you this would happen!\u201d Trish says in delight. \u201cShe said you\u2019d deny it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad, getting a year older,\u201d teases Nathaniel. \u201cNow, face it, we know.

Lady Edgerly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me that your birthday was coming up,\u201d says Trish, looking pleased. \u201cAnd she warned me you\u2019d try to keep it secret. Naughty, naughty!\u201d</p> <p>I do not believe Freya. I do not believe her.</p><p>\u201cShe also told me,\u201d Trish lowers her voice sympathetically, \u201cyour last birthday was rather a letdown?

Happy birthday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday!\u201d the others echo, lifting their glasses.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I want to laugh or cry. Or both. I look around at the banner and silvery balloons, bobbing in the breeze; at the champagne bottles; at everyone\u2019s smiling faces. There\u2019s nothing I can say. I\u2019ll have to go with it.</p><p>\u201cWell ... thank you,\u201d I say, looking around. \u201cI ... I really appreciate it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was a little short with you this afternoon,\u201d says Trish cheerfully. \u201cWe were rather struggling with the helium balloons. We\u2019d already lost one bunch this afternoon.\u201d She darts a baleful glance at Eddie.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tried to get helium balloons into a car boot?\u201d Eddie retorts hotly. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you do it! I haven\u2019t got three bloody hands, you know.\u201d</p><p>An image comes to me of Eddie battling with a load of shiny balloons, trying to stuff them into the Porsche, and I bite my lip hard.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t put your age on the balloons, Samantha,\u201d Trish adds in a breathy whisper. \u201cAs one woman to another, I thought you\u2019d appreciate that gesture.\u201d</p><p>I look from her vivid, over-made-up face to Eddie\u2019s fleshy pink one and suddenly feel so moved I don\u2019t know what to say. All the time, they were planning this. They were doing a banner. They were ordering balloons.</p><p>\u201cMr. Geiger, Mrs. Geiger, I\u2019m ... I\u2019m so bowled over ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet!\u201d says Trish, nodding over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday to you ...\u201d A voice behind me is singing and after a moment the others join in. I look over my shoulder to see Iris coming forward over the lawn, holding the most enormous, two-tier birthday cake. It\u2019s iced all over in palest pink, with sugar roses and raspberries and one elegant white candle. As she gets near I see, in silver writing: Happy Birthday Dear Samantha From Us All.</p><p>It\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. My throat is tight. No one\u2019s ever made a cake for me in my life before.</p><p>\u201cBlow out your candle!\u201d calls out Eamonn as the singing comes to an end. Somehow I puff feebly at the flame, and everyone cheers.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Iris smiles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... wonderful,\u201d I manage to say. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, chicken.\u201d She pats my hand. \u201cYou deserve it, if anyone does.\u201d</p><p>As Iris sets the cake down and begins to slice it up, Eddie tinkles his glass with the end of a pen.</p> <p>\u201cIf I could have your attention.\u201d He takes a step up onto the terrace and clears his throat. \u201cSamantha, we\u2019re all very glad you\u2019ve come into our family. You\u2019re doing a marvelous job and we all appreciate it.\u201d Eddie raises his glass to me. \u201cEr ... well done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Geiger,\u201d I falter. I look around at all the friendly faces, framed by blue sky and summer leaves. \u201cI\u2019m ... I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve come here too. You\u2019ve all been really welcoming and kind to me.\u201d Oh, God, I\u2019m starting to well up. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wish for better employers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop!\u201d Trish flaps her hands and dabs her eye with a napkin.</p><p>\u201cFor she\u2019s a jolly good fellow,\u201d Eddie begins gruffly. \u201cFor she\u2019s a jolly good fellow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie! Samantha doesn\u2019t want to hear your stupid singing!\u201d interrupts Trish shrilly, still dabbing her eyes. \u201cOpen some more champagne, for goodness sake!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s one of the warmest evenings of the year. As the sun slowly lowers in the sky, we all loll on the grass, drinking champagne and talking. Eamonn tells me about his girlfriend, Anna, who works in a hotel in Gloucester. Iris produces tiny feather-light tarts filled with chicken and herbs. Nathaniel rigs up a set of fairy lights in a tree. Melissa announces loudly several times that she can\u2019t sit around, she has to get back to work\u2014then accepts just one more champagne refill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sky is an endless, evening blue and there\u2019s the smell of honeysuckle in the air.

We can\u2019t afford to lose her, you know.\u201d</p><p>Melissa opens her mouth to retort.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is from me,\u201d says Nathaniel, stepping in quickly. He hands me a tiny present wrapped in white tissue paper, and everyone turns to see what it is.</p> <p>I unwrap the little parcel, and a pretty silver charm bracelet falls into my hand. There\u2019s only one charm on it: a tiny wooden spoon. I give another snuffle of laughter. A frilly apron, and now a wooden spoon.</p><p>Neither Nathaniel nor Iris knows the details of my real life\u2014and yet in some ways I feel they know me better than anyone else in the world. They\u2019ve seen me frazzled and incompetent, at my most vulnerable. I haven\u2019t had to put on a front or act efficient or pretend I know everything.</p><p>\u201cIt reminded me of the first time we met,\u201d says Nathaniel, his mouth curving into a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... fantastic.\u201d I put my arms round him and kiss him. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d I murmur into his ear.</p><p>Trish is watching with avid eyes as we draw apart.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s obvious what drew you to Samantha,\u201d she says to Nathaniel. \u201cIt was her cooking, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was her chickpeas,\u201d agrees Nathaniel gravely.</p><p>Eamonn has been up on the terrace. Now he bounds down the steps and hands me a bottle of wine. \u201cThis is from me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s lovely!\u201d I say, touched. \u201cThanks, Eamonn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was going to ask, would you be interested in waitressing ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the pub?\u201d I say in surprise, but he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cPrivate functions. We have a little concern going in the village. It\u2019s not really a business, more like passing on work to friends. Make a little extra money, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Passing on work to friends. I suddenly feel a little warm glow inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to. Thanks for thinking of me.\u201d</p><p>Eamonn grins. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a drink or two waiting for you behind the bar if you want to come along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... er ...\u201d I glance at Trish. \u201cMaybe later ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go!\u201d says Trish. \u201cEnjoy yourselves! Don\u2019t think about work! We\u2019ll put the dirty glasses in the kitchen,\u201d she adds, \u201cand you can deal with them tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mrs. Geiger.\u201d I force myself to remain straight-faced. \u201cThat\u2019s very ... good of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and Samantha.\u201d She beckons me over with her glass. \u201cI was thinking about what you said to me the other day. About finding myself a little project of my own. Not that my life isn\u2019t extremely busy already ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d She pauses momentously. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to hold a charity lunch for Save The Children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea!\u201d I say with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can help me organize it!

It\u2019s, like, how are you supposed to know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Geiger?\u201d I interrupt awkwardly. \u201cI just wanted to thank you very much for this evening. It\u2019s been absolutely incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fun!\u201d says Eddie.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice evening,\u201d says Melissa, heaving an enormous sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve still got work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be worth it, love.\u201d Eddie pats her hand reassuringly. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at ...\u201d He picks up a brochure from the table and peers at it through his reading glasses. \u201cCarter Spink.\u201d</p><p>Melissa is going for a job at Carter Spink?</p><p>\u201cIs that ...\u201d I try to speak naturally. \u201cIs that the name of the law firm where you\u2019re applying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Melissa, looking sulky. \u201cIt\u2019s the top one. But it\u2019s incredibly competitive. Hardly anyone gets a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks very swanky!\u201d says Eddie, flipping over the glossy pages, each illustrated with a photograph. \u201cLook at these offices!\u201d</p><p>As he flips through, I\u2019m transfixed. There\u2019s a picture of the foyer. There\u2019s one of the floor I used to work on. I can\u2019t tear my eyes away\u2014but at the same time I don\u2019t want to look. That\u2019s my old life. It doesn\u2019t belong here. And then suddenly, as Eddie flips another page over, I feel a jolt of disbelief.</p><p>It\u2019s a picture of me. Me.</p><p>I\u2019m in my black suit, my hair pinned up, sitting at a meeting-room table along with Ketterman, David Elldridge, and a guy who was over from the States. I remember that picture being taken. Ketterman was absolutely livid at being disturbed.</p><p>I look so pale. I look so serious.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s like ... do I want to give up all my time?\u201d Melissa is jabbing the page. \u201cThese people work every night! What about a social life?\u201d</p><p>My face is right there in full view. I\u2019m just waiting for someone to frown in recognition, to say, \u201cHang on a moment ...\u201d</p><p>But no one does. Melissa is still rabbiting on, gesturing to the brochure; Eddie is nodding. Nathaniel is staring upward, obviously bored.</p><p>\u201cAlthough, you know, the money is really good....\u201d Melissa sighs, and flips the page.</p><p>The picture\u2019s gone. I\u2019m gone.</p><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s warm hand tugs mine and I clasp it tightly back.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I smile up at him. \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>I don\u2019t see the Carter Spink brochure again for two weeks, when I\u2019m drifting into the kitchen to make lunch.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what happened to time. I barely recognize it anymore. The minutes and hours don\u2019t march past in rigid chunks, they ebb and flow and swirl around. I don\u2019t even wear a watch anymore. Yesterday I lay in a hay field all afternoon with Nathaniel, watching dandelion seeds float by, and the only ticking sound came from the crickets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I barely recognize myself anymore either. I\u2019m tanned from lying in the sun at lunchtimes. There are golden streaks in my hair. My cheeks are full. My arms are gaining muscles from all the polishing and kneading and carting heavy saucepans around.</p><p>The summer is in full throttle and each day is hotter than the last. Every morning, before breakfast, Nathaniel walks me back through the village to the Geigers\u2019 house from his flat above the pub\u2014and even at that hour the air is already warming up. I stay there most nights now, and it\u2019s almost got to feel like home. It\u2019s surprisingly spacious, with old sofas covered with cotton throws, and a tiny roof terrace that Nathaniel built himself.</p><p>We often sit up there as evening turns into night, listening to the babble of pub-leavers down below. Sometimes Nathaniel\u2019s doing the pub accounts, but he talks to me as he works: about the backgrounds of everyone in the village, about the plants he wants to put into the Geigers\u2019 garden, once explaining the entire geology of the local landscape. I tell him about the day I\u2019ve had with the Geigers and entertain him with stories about the latest catering job I\u2019ve done for Eamonn. It\u2019s become quite a regular event for me\u2014driving off in his scruffy Honda with a couple of other girls from the village, changing into black waitress outfits and serving canap\u00e9s at some posh party or other.</p><p>Everything seems slow and lazy, these days. Everyone\u2019s in holiday mood\u2014except Trish, who is in full frenzy. She\u2019s holding her charity lunch next week, and from the fuss she\u2019s making, you\u2019d think it was a royal wedding.</p> <p>I\u2019m tidying away the papers that Melissa has left littered on the table when I spot the Carter Spink brochure underneath a folder. I can\u2019t resist picking it up and leafing through the familiar pictures. There are the steps I went up every day of my life for seven years. There\u2019s Guy, looking as dazzling as ever. There\u2019s that girl Sarah from the litigation department, who was up for partnership too. I never even heard if she got it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Melissa has come into the kitchen without me hearing. She eyes me suspiciously. \u201cThat\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Right. Like I\u2019m going to steal a brochure.</p><p>\u201cJust tidying your things,\u201d I say pointedly, putting the brochure down. \u201cI\u2019ve got to use this table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d Melissa rubs her face. She looks haggard. There are shadows under her eyes, and her cheeks seem sunken. Could I have looked that stressed out even at her age?</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re working hard,\u201d I volunteer.</p><p>\u201cYah, well.\u201d She lifts her chin. \u201cIt\u2019ll be worth it in the end. They work you really hard to start, but after you qualify, it calms down.\u201d</p><p>I look at her tired, pinched, arrogant little face. Even if I could tell her what I know, she wouldn\u2019t believe me.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d The Carter Spink brochure is open at a picture of Arnold. He\u2019s wearing a bright blue spotted tie and matching handkerchief and is beaming out at the world. Of all the people at Carter Spink, he\u2019s the one I\u2019d like to see again.</p><p>\u201cSo are you applying to this law firm?\u201d I ask, stacking the papers on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYup. They\u2019re the best.\u201d Melissa is getting a Diet Coke from the fridge. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who was supposed to be interviewing me.\u201d She points to the picture of Arnold. \u201cBut he\u2019s leaving.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m astonished. Arnold\u2019s leaving Carter Spink?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I say before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Melissa regards me quizzically. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d I say, throwing down the brochure. \u201cI just meant ... he doesn\u2019t look old enough to retire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s going.\u201d She grabs the brochure and wanders out of the kitchen.</p><p>Arnold is leaving Carter Spink? But he\u2019s always said he\u2019d never retire. He\u2019s always boasted about lasting another twenty years. Why would he be leaving now?</p><p>I\u2019m totally out of touch. For more than a month I\u2019ve been living in a bubble. I haven\u2019t seen The Lawyer, I\u2019ve barely even seen a normal paper. I don\u2019t know any of the gossip, and I haven\u2019t cared a bit. But now, as I look at Arnold\u2019s familiar face, I can feel my curiosity rise.</p><p>So that afternoon, when I\u2019ve cleared up lunch, I slip into Eddie\u2019s study, switch on the computer, and click on Google. I search for Arnold Saville\u2014and sure enough on the second page I come across a little diary item about his early retirement. I read the fifty-word piece over and over, trying to glean clues. Why would Arnold retire early? Is he ill?</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I search for further items, but that\u2019s the only one I can find. Next I go to the search box and\u2014telling myself I shouldn\u2019t\u2014type in Samantha Sweeting. Immediately a zillion stories about me pop up again on the screen. I don\u2019t feel so freaked out this time, though. The person in these stories doesn\u2019t feel like me anymore.</p><p>I scan entry after entry, seeing the same details replayed. After clicking through about five pages I add Third Union Bank to my search, and scan the resulting entries. Then I type in Third Union Bank, BLLC Holdings, then Third Union Bank, Glazerbrooks. Then, with a beat of apprehension, I type in Samantha Sweeting, \u00a350 million, career over, and wait for all the really nasty stories to appear. It\u2019s like watching my own car crash on action replay.</p><p>God, Google is addictive. I sit there, totally absorbed, clicking and typing and reading, gorging on endless Web pages, automatically using the Carter Spink password wherever I need to. After an hour I\u2019m slumped in Eddie\u2019s chair like a zombie. My back is aching and my neck is stiff, and the words are all running into one another. I\u2019d forgotten what it was like to sit at a computer. Did I really used to do this all day?</p><p>I rub my tired eyes and glance at the Web page open in front of me, wondering how I even got to it. It\u2019s some obscure list of guests at a lunch held earlier this year at the Painters Hall. About halfway down is the name BLLC Holdings, which must have been the link. On autopilot, I move the cursor along the page\u2014and into view comes the name Nicholas Hanford Jones, Director.</p> <p>Something chimes inside my addled brain. Nicholas Hanford Jones. Why do I know that name? Why am I somehow associating it with Ketterman?</p><p>Is BLLC Holdings a client of Ketterman? No. It can\u2019t be. I\u2019d have heard of it before.</p><p>I screw my eyes up tight and concentrate as hard as I can. Nicholas Hanford Jones. I can almost see it in my mind\u2019s eye. I\u2019m grasping at an association ... an image ... come on, think ...</p><p>This is the trouble with having a nearly photographic memory. People think it must be useful, when in fact all it does is drive you insane.</p><p>And then suddenly it comes to me. The swirly writing of a wedding invitation. It was stuck up on the pin board in Ketterman\u2019s office about three years ago. It was there for weeks. I used to see it every time I went in.</p> <p>Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Savillerequest the pleasure of your companyat the wedding of their daughter Fionato Mr. Nicholas Hanford Jones</p><p>Nicholas Hanford Jones is Arnold Saville\u2019s son-in-law? Arnold has a family connection with BLLC Holdings?</p><p>I sit up in my chair, totally disconcerted. How come he never mentioned that?</p><p>And then another thought strikes me. I was on the BLLC Holdings Companies House page a minute ago. Why wasn\u2019t Nicholas Hanford Jones listed as a director? That\u2019s illegal, for a start.</p><p>I rub my brow, then out of curiosity type in Nicholas Hanford Jones. A moment later the screen is full of entries, and I lean forward.</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake. The Internet is crap. I\u2019m looking at other Nicholases and other Hanfords and other Joneses, mentioned in all sorts of different contexts. I peer at them in total frustration. Doesn\u2019t Google realize that\u2019s not what I\u2019m interested in? Why would I want to read about some Canadian rowing team list containing a Greg Hanford, a Dave Jones, and a Chip Nicholas?</p> <p>I\u2019m never going to find anything here.</p><p>Even so, I start picking my way down, skimming each chunk of text, clicking onto the next page and the next. And then, just as I\u2019m about to give up, my eye falls on an entry tucked away at the bottom of the page. William Hanford Jones, Finance Director of Glazerbrooks, thanked Nicholas Jenkins for his speech ...</p><p>This is incredible. The finance director at Glazerbrooks is called Hanford Jones too? Are they from the same family? Feeling like some kind of private detective, I log onto Friends-Reunited, and two minutes later I have my answer. They\u2019re brothers.</p><p>I feel a bit dazed. This is a pretty huge connection. The finance director of Glazerbrooks, which went bust owing Third Union Bank \u00a350 million. A director of BLLC Holdings, which lent it \u00a350 million three days before. And Arnold, representing Third Union Bank. All related; all in the same extended family.</p><p>I\u2019m almost certain nobody else knows. Arnold\u2019s never mentioned it. No one at Carter Spink has ever mentioned it. Nor have I seen it brought up in any of the reports on the whole affair. Arnold\u2019s kept all of this very quiet.</p><p>I rub my shoulders, trying to gather my jumbled thoughts. Isn\u2019t this a potential conflict of interest? Shouldn\u2019t he have disclosed the information straightaway? Why on earth would Arnold keep such an important thing secret? Unless\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. No.</p><p>I feel a bit light-headed, as though I\u2019ve suddenly swum over the ledge into mile-deep water. My mind is flying ahead, careening onto possibilities and shearing away again in disbelief.</p><p>Did Arnold discover something? Is he hiding something?</p><p>Is this why he\u2019s leaving?</p> <p>I get up and thrust my hands through my hair. OK, let\u2019s just ... stop all this, right now. This is Arnold I\u2019m talking about. Arnold. I\u2019m turning into some nutty conspiracy theorist. Next I\u2019ll be typing in aliens, Roswell, they live among us.</p><p>With sudden resolution I get out my phone. I\u2019ll call Arnold. I\u2019ll wish him well in his retirement. Then maybe I can get rid of all these ridiculous ideas floating round my head.</p><p>It takes me about six failed attempts before I muster the courage to dial the entire number and wait for a reply. The idea of talking to anyone at Carter Spink\u2014let alone Arnold\u2014makes me feel slightly sick. I keep bottling out before being connected, thrusting the phone down as though I\u2019ve had a narrow escape.</p><p>But at last I steel myself to press the digits and hold the line. I\u2019m never going to know unless I do this. I can talk to Arnold. I can hold my head up.</p><p>After three rings the phone is picked up by Lara. \u201cArnold Saville\u2019s office.\u201d</p> <p>I have a sudden vision of her, plump and shiny-haired, sitting at her pale wooden desk, in the burgundy jacket she always wears, tapping on the computer. It all seems a million miles away now.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lara,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s ... Samantha. Samantha Sweeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Lara sounds poleaxed. \u201cBloody hell! How are you? What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks. Really good.\u201d I quell a spasm of nerves. \u201cI just rang because I\u2019ve heard that Arnold\u2019s leaving? Is it true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d says Lara with relish. \u201cI was gobsmacked! Apparently, Ketterman took him out to dinner and tried to get him to stay, but he\u2019d made up his mind. Get this, he\u2019s moving to the Bahamas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bahamas?\u201d I say in astonishment.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s bought a house there! Looks lovely. His retirement party\u2019s next week,\u201d Lara continues. \u201cI\u2019ll be transferring to Derek Green\u2019s office\u2014you remember him? Taxation partner? Very nice guy, though apparently he can have a bit of a temper\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... great!\u201d I cut her off, suddenly remembering her ability to gossip for hours. \u201cLara, I just wanted to give Arnold my best wishes. If you could possibly put me through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lara sounds surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s incredibly ... generous of you, Samantha. After what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Arnold\u2019s fault, was it? He did what he could.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a strange silence.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Lara after a pause. \u201cWell. I\u2019ll put you through.\u201d</p><p>After a few moments Arnold\u2019s familiar voice is booming down the line.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, dear girl! Is it really you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... really me.\u201d I manage a smile. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite disappeared off the face of the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope not! Now, you\u2019re all right, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... fine,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cThanks. I was just surprised to hear you\u2019re retiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never a glutton for punishment!\u201d He gives an easy laugh. \u201cThirty-three years at the coal face of law. That\u2019s enough for any human. Let alone any lawyer!\u201d</p><p>Just his jovial voice is reassuring me. I must be crazy. Arnold couldn\u2019t be involved in anything untoward. He couldn\u2019t be hiding anything. He\u2019s Arnold.</p><p>I\u2019ll mention it to him, I decide. Just to prove it to myself.</p><p>\u201cWell ... I hope it all goes well,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I ... I guess you\u2019ll be seeing more of your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be lumbered with the blighters, yes!\u201d He booms with laughter again.</p><p>\u201cI never knew your son-in-law was a director of BLLC Holdings!\u201d I attempt an easy tone. \u201cQuite a coincidence!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a beat of silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d says Arnold. His voice is still as charming as ever, but the warmth has disappeared.</p><p>\u201cBLLC Holdings.\u201d I swallow. \u201cYou know, the other company involved with the Third Union Bank loan? The one that registered a charge? I just happened to notice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go now, Samantha!\u201d Arnold cuts me off smoothly. \u201cDelightful to chat, but I\u2019m leaving the country next week, and there\u2019s a lot to do. It\u2019s exceedingly busy here, so I wouldn\u2019t ring again if I were you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The line goes dead before I can say any more. I slowly put down the phone and stare at a butterfly fluttering outside the window.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t right. That wasn\u2019t a natural reaction. He got rid of me as soon as I mentioned his son-in-law.</p><p>Something is going on. Something is definitely going on.</p><p>I have totally abandoned the housework for the afternoon and am sitting on my bed with a pad of paper and pencil, trying to work out the possibilities.</p> <p>Who stands to gain? I stare at my scribbled facts and arrows of connection yet again. Two brothers. Millions of pounds being transferred between banks and companies. Think. Think ...</p><p>With a small cry of frustration I rip out the page and crumple it. Let\u2019s start again. Let\u2019s get everything in logical order. Glazerbrooks went into receivership. Third Union Bank lost their money. BLLC Holdings jumped ahead in the queue....</p><p>I tap my pencil impatiently on the paper. But so what? They only get back the money they loaned. They don\u2019t get any advantage, they don\u2019t get any benefit, it\u2019s pointless.</p><p>Unless\u2014unless they never paid over anything in the first place.</p><p>The thought comes to me out of nowhere. I sit bolt upright, unable to breathe. What if that\u2019s it? What if it\u2019s a scam?</p> <p>My mind starts to race. Suppose there are two brothers. They know that Glazerbrooks is in serious financial trouble. They know that the bank has just paid in fifty million but the bank\u2019s charge wasn\u2019t registered. That means there\u2019s a fifty-million unsecured loan swilling around in the company, up for grabs by anyone else who registers a charge....</p><p>I can\u2019t sit anymore. I\u2019m pacing backward and forward, feverishly gnawing my pencil, my brain sparking like an electrical circuit. It works. It works. They fiddle the figures. BLLC Holdings gets the money that Third Union Bank paid over, Carter Spink\u2019s insurers foot the bill\u2014</p><p>I pause in my striding. No. It doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m being stupid. The insurers are only covering the fifty million because I was negligent. That\u2019s the crucial element. The whole plan would have depended on me, Samantha Sweeting, making that particular mistake.</p><p>But I mean ... how on earth could they have planned that? It makes no sense. It\u2019s impossible. You can\u2019t plan a mistake in advance. You can\u2019t make someone forget to do something, you can\u2019t make someone fuck up\u2014</p><p>And then I stop dead. My skin suddenly feels clammy. The memo.</p><p>I never saw that memo on my desk until it was too late. I know I didn\u2019t.</p> <p>What if\u2014</p><p>Oh, my God.</p><p>I sink onto the window seat, my legs like rubber. What if someone planted that memo on my desk? Slipped it into a pile of papers after the deadline had passed?</p><p>What if I didn\u2019t make a mistake?</p><p>I feel like everything is cracking and reshaping around me. What if Arnold deliberately didn\u2019t register the bank charge\u2014and made it look like my fault?</p><p>Like a looped tape, my conversation with Arnold that day is playing over and over in my mind. When I said I couldn\u2019t remember seeing the memo on my desk. And he immediately changed the subject.</p><p>I assumed the memo was there all the time. I assumed it was my error. My inefficiency. But what if it wasn\u2019t? Everyone at Carter Spink knew I had the messiest desk in the firm. It would be easy to slip it into a pile of papers. Make it look as if it had been there for weeks.</p><p>I\u2019m breathing harder and harder, till I\u2019m almost hyperventilating. For the first time I\u2019m realizing the huge strain I\u2019ve been under. I have lived with that mistake for more than a month. It\u2019s been there every morning when I wake up and every day when I go to bed. Like a constant background ache that I\u2019ve gotten used to, like a chorus in my head: Samantha Sweeting ruined her life. Samantha Sweeting fucked up.</p> <p>But ... what if I was used? What if it wasn\u2019t my fault? What if I didn\u2019t make a mistake after all?</p><p>I have to know. I have to know the truth. Right now. With a shaking hand I reach for my mobile phone and punch in the number again.</p><p>\u201cLara, I need to speak to Arnold again,\u201d I say as soon as I\u2019m connected.</p><p>\u201cSamantha ...\u201d Lara sounds awkward. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Arnold won\u2019t take any more calls from you. And he asked me to tell you that you\u2019re not to pester him about your job anymore.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in shock. What has he been saying about me?</p><p>\u201cLara, I\u2019m not pestering him about my job,\u201d I say, trying to keep my voice steady. \u201cI just need to talk to him about a ... matter. If he won\u2019t talk to me, I\u2019ll come to the office. Can you make me an appointment, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d She sounds even more embarrassed than before. \u201cArnold told me to inform you ... if you try to come here to the offices, Security will eject you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEject me?\u201d I stare at the phone in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.

Does Lara know the memo was planted?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what do you mean?\u201d I stammer.</p> <p>\u201cThe way he got you fired!\u201d says Lara.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I feel like all the breath has been squeezed from my chest. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did wonder if you knew.\u201d She lowers her voice. \u201cHe\u2019s leaving now, so I can say it. I took the minutes at that meeting, after you ran off. And Arnold talked round all the other partners. He said you were a liability and they couldn\u2019t risk taking you back and all sorts. A lot of them wanted to give you another chance, you know.\u201d She clicks her tongue. \u201cI was appalled. Of course, I couldn\u2019t say anything to Arnold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I manage. \u201cThanks for telling me, Lara. I ... had no idea.\u201d</p><p>Everything is distorted. Arnold didn\u2019t fight my corner at all. He got me fired. I don\u2019t know this man at all. All that genial, affable charm\u2014it\u2019s an act. It\u2019s a bloody act.</p> <p>With a sickening lurch I suddenly recall him the day after it happened, insisting I should stay where I was, not come back. That\u2019s why. He wanted me out of the way so I couldn\u2019t fight for myself. So he could stitch me up.</p><p>And I trusted him. Totally and utterly. Like a stupid, stupid gullible fool.</p><p>My chest is heaving painfully. All my doubts have disappeared. Arnold is in on something crooked. I know it. He planted that memo, knowing it would destroy my career.</p><p>And in a week he\u2019ll have disappeared to the Bahamas. I feel a stab of panic. I need to take action now.</p><p>\u201cLara,\u201d I say, trying to sound calm. \u201cCould you put me through to Guy Ashby?\u201d</p><p>I know Guy and I had a row. But he\u2019s the only person I can think of right now who\u2019ll be able to help me.</p> <p>\u201cGuy\u2019s in Hong Kong,\u201d says Lara in surprise. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, my heart plummeting. \u201cNo. I ... didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll have his BlackBerry with him,\u201d she adds helpfully. \u201cYou could send him an e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cYes, maybe I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>I can\u2019t do it. I just can\u2019t. There is no way of writing this e-mail without sounding like a paranoid crazy.</p><p>I look in despair at my tenth attempt.</p><p>Dear Guy,</p> <p>I need you to help me. I think I have been set up by Arnold. I think he planted that memo on my desk. Something is going on. He has family links with both BLLC Holdings and Glazerbrooks, did you know that?? Why did he never tell anyone? And now he\u2019s banned me from the building, which in itself is suspicious\u2014</p><p>I sound delusional. I sound like some bitter, twisted ex-employee with a grudge.</p><p>Which of course is what I am.</p><p>As I run my eyes over my words, I\u2019m reminded of nothing more than the wild-eyed old woman who used to stand at the corner of our street, muttering, \u201cThey\u2019re coming to GET me.\u201d</p><p>I have total sympathy for that old woman now. They probably were coming to get her.</p><p>Guy will just laugh. I can see him now. Arnold Saville a crook? It sounds insane. Maybe I am insane. It\u2019s only a theory. I don\u2019t have evidence; I don\u2019t have anything solid. I lean forward and rest my head hopelessly on my hands. No one\u2019s ever going to believe me. Or even listen to me.</p><p>If I only had some proof. But where am I supposed to get that from?</p><p>A bleeping from my mobile phone makes me jump, and I look up blearily. I\u2019d almost forgotten where I was. I pick it up and see that I\u2019ve got a text.</p><p>I\u2019m downstairs. have a surprise to show you. nat</p><p>As I head downstairs, I\u2019m really not with it. Flashes of anger keep overwhelming me as I think of Arnold\u2019s jocular smile, the way he encouraged my messy desk, the way he told me he\u2019d do his very best for me, the way he listened as I blamed myself, as I apologized and groveled ...</p><p>The worst thing is, I never even tried to defend myself. I never questioned the fact that I couldn\u2019t remember seeing the memo. I immediately assumed the worst of myself, assumed it was my fault for having such a messy desk.</p><p>Arnold knows me pretty well. Maybe that\u2019s what he was counting on.</p><p>Bastard. Bastard.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Nathaniel waves a hand in front of my face. \u201cEarth to Samantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... Sorry. Hi!\u201d Somehow I muster a smile.</p><p>\u201cCome this way.\u201d He grins and ushers me out to his car, which is an ancient Beetle convertible.

Nathaniel seems in a cheerful mood and tells me stories about each farm and pub that we pass. But I barely hear a word. My mind is still churning.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what I can do. I can\u2019t even get into the building. I have no credibility. I\u2019m powerless. And I only have three days. Once Arnold disappears off to the Bahamas that\u2019ll be it.</p><p>\u201cHere we are!\u201d Nathaniel turns off the road into a gravel drive. He maneuvers the car into place by a low brick wall, then stops the engine. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>With an effort I wrench my mind back to the present time. \u201cUm....\u201d I peer around blankly. \u201cYes. Lovely.\u201d</p><p>What am I supposed to be looking at?</p><p>\u201cSamantha, are you OK?\u201d Nathaniel shoots me a curious glance. \u201cYou seem on edge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I try to smile. \u201cJust a bit tired.\u201d</p><p>I open the car door to get out, away from his gaze. I shut the door behind me and look around.</p><p>We\u2019re in some kind of courtyard. There\u2019s a ramshackle old stone house to the right, with a for sale post. Ahead are banks of greenhouses, glinting in the low sunlight. There are plots filled with rows of vegetables, there\u2019s a Portakabin marked garden center ...</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>I turn to see that Nathaniel has got out of the car too and is holding a sheaf of papers in his hand.</p><p>\u201cA horticultural business opportunity,\u201d he reads aloud. \u201cFour acres of land, with ten more available, subject to negotiation. Ten thousand square feet of glasshouses. Four-bedroom farmhouse, needs work ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re buying this?\u201d I say, my attention fully grabbed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it. I wanted to show you first.\u201d He spreads an arm around. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good concern. Needs building up, but the land\u2019s there. We can get some polytunnels going, extend the offices ...\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t take all this in.</p><p>\u201cBut what about the pubs? How come you\u2019re suddenly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you. What you said in the garden that day.\u201d He pauses, the breeze ruffling his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Samantha. I\u2019m not a landlord, I\u2019m a gardener. I\u2019d be happier doing what I really want to do. So ... I had a long talk with Mum and she understood. We both reckon Eamonn can take over. Not that he knows yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I look around again, taking in a pile of wooden crates, stacks of seed trays, a tattered poster advertising Christmas trees. \u201cSo you\u2019re really going to do it?\u201d</p><p>I can see the excitement in his face. \u201cYou only get one chance at life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s fantastic!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a house.\u201d He nods toward it. \u201cOr at least, there will be a house. It\u2019s a bit run-down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I take in the old stone house again. The paintwork is peeling and there\u2019s a shutter hanging off one hinge. \u201cIt does look a bit of a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to see it first,\u201d says Nathaniel. \u201cGet your approval. I mean, one day you might\u2014\u201d He stops.</p><p>All of a sudden my relationship sensors are swiveling round madly, like the Hubble spotting an alien ship. What did they just pick up? What was he going to say?</p><p>\u201cI might ... stay over?\u201d I supply at last.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Nathaniel rubs his nose. \u201cShall we have a look?\u201d</p><p>The house is bigger than it seems from the outside, with bare boards and old fireplaces and a creaking wooden staircase. One room has practically no plaster, and the kitchen is totally old-fashioned, with 1930s cupboards.</p><p>\u201cGreat kitchen.\u201d I shoot him a teasing look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I could refit it to your Cordon Bleu standards,\u201d he returns.</p><p>We make our way upstairs and into a huge bedroom overlooking the rear of the house. From above, the vegetable plots look like an orderly patchwork quilt, stretching away into the green meadow. I can see a little terrace down below and a tiny private garden belonging to the house, all clematis and tangled roses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place,\u201d I say, leaning on the windowsill. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>Standing here, looking out at the view, I feel like London is on another planet. Carter Spink and Arnold and all of them suddenly seem part of another life.</p><p>But even as I\u2019m gazing out at the restful country scene, I can\u2019t relax. All it would take is one phone call to the right person ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If I had some proof ...</p><p>Anything ...</p><p>My mind starts turning over the facts again, like a bird turning over empty snail shells.

In fact I think he could have been speaking for a while\u2014and I haven\u2019t heard a word. I hastily turn round, to see him facing me.

What have I agreed to?</p><p>\u201cEven about the chimpanzees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chimpanzees?\u201d I suddenly see Nathaniel\u2019s mouth twitching. He\u2019s on to me.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t listen to a word I was saying, did you?\u201d he says, in matter-of-fact tones.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were saying something important!\u201d I wail, hanging my head. \u201cYou should have warned me!\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel looks at me incredulously. \u201cThat took some nerve, you know, saying all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d I beg. \u201cSay it all again! I\u2019ll listen!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d He laughs, shaking his head. \u201cMaybe one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nathaniel. Really I am.\u201d I turn away to press my head against the window glass. \u201cI was just ... distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He comes over and puts his arms around me, over my own. I can feel his steady heartbeat against me, calming me down. \u201cSamantha, what\u2019s up? It\u2019s your old relationship, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I mutter after a pause.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me about it? I could help.\u201d</p><p>I turn round to face him. The sun is glowing in his eyes and on his burnished face. He\u2019s never looked more handsome.</p><p>I know I can\u2019t hide my past forever. I could tell Nathaniel the whole story, right here, right now. But at the same time, I know that the minute I tell him who I was, he\u2019ll look at me differently. Everything will change between us. I won\u2019t be Samantha anymore. I\u2019ll be a lawyer.</p><p>And it\u2019s all so perfect as it is. I can\u2019t bear to rock the boat just yet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring that world into this one,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI just don\u2019t.\u201d Nathaniel opens his mouth again, but I turn away before he can speak. I stare out at the idyllic view, blinking against the rays of the sun, my mind in total turmoil.</p><p>Maybe I should just give up on the whole nightmare. Forget about it. Let it go. The chances are I\u2019ll never be able to prove anything. Arnold has all the power; I have none. The chances are if I try to stir things up again all I\u2019ll get is more humiliation and disgrace.</p><p>I could so easily do nothing. I could just put it from my mind, as I\u2019ve tried to do all this time. Close the door on my old life and leave it behind forever. I have a job. I have Nathaniel. I have a possible future here.</p><p>But even as I\u2019m thinking it\u2014I know that\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do. I can\u2019t forget about it. I can\u2019t let go.</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>The city isn\u2019t the way I remember it. I can\u2019t believe how dirty it is. How rushed it is. As I arrived at Paddington Station this afternoon I felt almost bewildered by the commuter crowds moving like a swarm of ants over the concourse. I could smell the fumes. I saw the litter. Things I never even noticed before. Did I just filter them out? Was I so used to them, they faded into the background? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But at the same time, the minute my feet hit the ground I felt the buzz. By the time I reached the Underground station I\u2019d already picked up my pace: matching the stride of everyone else; feeding my travel card into the machine at exactly the right angle; whipping it out with not a second to spare.</p><p>And now I\u2019m in the Starbucks around the corner from Carter Spink, sitting at the counter in the window, watching City-suited businesspeople walking past, talking and gesticulating and making phone calls. The adrenaline is catching. My heart\u2019s already beating more quickly\u2014and I haven\u2019t even got inside the building yet.</p><p>I glance at my watch yet again. Nearly time. The last thing I want to do is arrive early. The less time I spend in there, the better.</p><p>As I drain my latte, my phone bleeps, but I ignore it. It\u2019ll be yet another message from Trish. She was livid when I told her I had to go away for a couple of days; in fact, she tried to stop me. So I told her I had a foot complaint that needed urgent attention from my specialist in London.</p> <p>In hindsight this was a huge mistake, as she wanted to know every single gory detail. She even demanded I take off my shoe and show her. I had to spend ten minutes improvising about \u201cbone misalignment\u201d while she peered at my foot and said, \u201cIt looks perfectly normal to me,\u201d in tones of great suspicion.</p><p>She looked at me with mistrust for the rest of the day. Then she left a copy of Marie-Claire casually open at the Pregnant? Need Confidential Advice? advertisements. Honestly. I have to knock that one on the head or it\u2019ll be all over the village and Iris will be knitting booties.</p><p>I told Nathaniel in private that I had a situation to sort out with my old relationship. I could tell he wanted to know more details, that he was finding it hard being shut out, but he didn\u2019t press me. I think he saw how strained I was already.</p><p>I look at my watch again. Time to go. I head for the Ladies, face the mirror, and check my appearance. Unfamiliar blond hair: check. Tinted glasses: check. Magenta lipstick: check. I look nothing like my former self.</p><p>Apart from the face, of course. If you looked really closely.</p> <p>But the point is, no one\u2019s going to look closely at me. This is what I\u2019m counting on, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I practice in a low, guttural voice. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>I sound like a drag queen. But never mind. At least I don\u2019t sound like a lawyer.</p><p>Keeping my head down, I leave Starbucks and walk along the street, until I round the corner and see the distinctive granite steps and glass doors of Carter Spink. I feel unreal being back here. The last time I saw those doors I was pushing my way out of them, gibbering with panic, convinced I\u2019d wrecked my own career, convinced my life was over.</p><p>Fury starts boiling up again and I close my eyes briefly, trying to keep my emotions in line. I don\u2019t have any proof yet. I have to stay focused on what I\u2019m doing. Come on. I can do this.</p><p>I know my plan is slightly insane; I know my chances aren\u2019t great. It\u2019s unlikely Arnold has left proof of his misdemeanors just lying about. But I couldn\u2019t just give up, tamely stay in Lower Ebury, and let him get away with it. My anger is like a huge driving force inside me. I had to come here and at least try to find out what I can.</p> <p>And if they won\u2019t let me in the building as a lawyer ... then I\u2019ll just have to go in as something else.</p><p>I cross the road and resolutely head up the steps. I can almost see myself that day, a ghostlike figure, running down them in a state of bewildered shock. It all seems like a lifetime ago now. I don\u2019t just look like a different person, I feel like a different person. I feel like I\u2019ve been rebuilt.</p><p>With a deep breath, I pull my mac around me and push open the glass doors. As I step into the foyer I feel a sudden giddy wave of disbelief. Am I actually doing this? Am I actually trying to blag my way, incognito, into the Carter Spink offices?</p><p>My legs are wobbling and my hands feel damp, but I\u2019m walking steadily forward over the shiny marble floor, my eyes fixed downward. I head toward the new receptionist, Melanie, who started only a couple of weeks before I left.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say in my drag-queen voice.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Melanie smiles at me. There\u2019s not a glimmer of recognition in her face. I can\u2019t believe this is so easy.</p><p>In fact, I feel a tad insulted. Was I so nondescript before?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for the party?\u201d I mumble, my head down. \u201cI\u2019m waitressing. Bertram\u2019s Caterers,\u201d I add for good measure.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes. That\u2019s all happening up on the fourteenth floor.\u201d She taps on her computer. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... Trish,\u201d I say. \u201cTrish Geiger.\u201d Melanie peers at the computer screen, frowning and tapping her pen on her teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not on my list,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cWell, I should be there.\u201d I keep my head well down. \u201cThere must be a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me call up....\u201d Melanie taps on her phone and has a brief conversation with someone called Jan, then looks up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be down to see you.\u201d She gestures to the leather sofas with a smile. \u201cPlease take a seat.\u201d</p> <p>I head toward the seating area\u2014then veer in a sharp U-turn as I see David Spellman from Corporate sitting on one of the sofas with a client. Not that he seems to have recognized me. I walk toward a rack of glossy leaflets on Carter Spink\u2019s philosophy and bury my head in one on Dispute Resolution.</p><p>I\u2019ve never actually read any of these leaflets before. God, they really are a load of meaningless crap.</p><p>\u201cTrish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes?\u201d I swivel round to see a woman in a tuxedo with a raddled face. She\u2019s holding some typed sheets and regarding me with a frown.</p><p>\u201cJan Martin, head of waiting staff. You\u2019re not on my list. Have you worked for us before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m new,\u201d I say, keeping my voice low. \u201cBut I\u2019ve worked for Ebury Catering. Down in Gloucestershire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know it.\u201d She consults her paper again and flips to the second page, her brow creased in impatience. \u201cLove, you\u2019re not on the list. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke to a guy,\u201d I say without flickering. \u201cHe said you could do with extra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy?\u201d She looks perplexed. \u201cWho? Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember his name. But he said to come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have said\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is Carter Spink, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I look around. \u201c95 Cheapside? A big retirement party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I see the beginnings of doubt on the woman\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was told to come here.\u201d I allow just the faintest belligerence into my voice.</p><p>I can see the calculation going on in this woman\u2019s head: if she turns me away I might cause a scene, she\u2019s got other pressing stuff to think about, what\u2019s one extra waitress ...</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d she says at last, with an irritated noise. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to change. What\u2019s your name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrish Geiger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She scribbles it down. \u201cWell you\u2019d better come up, Trish.\u201d</p><p>I feel almost elated as I travel up in the service elevator with Jan, a plastic label reading Trish Geiger attached to my lapel. Now all I need is to keep my head down, bide my time, and, when the moment is right, get onto the eleventh floor.</p> <p>We come out in the kitchens attached to the executive function rooms, and I look around in surprise. I had no idea there was all this back here. It\u2019s like going backstage at a theater. Chefs are working busily at the cooking stations, and waiting staff are milling around in distinctive green and white striped uniforms.</p><p>\u201cThe outfits are in there.\u201d Jan points to a huge wicker basket full of folded uniforms. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to get changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I rummage around for an outfit in my size and take it off to the Ladies to change. I touch up my magenta lipstick and pull my hair further round my face, then look at my watch.</p><p>It\u2019s five-forty now. The party\u2019s at six. By about ten past, the eleventh floor should be clearing. Arnold is a very popular partner; no one\u2019s going to miss his farewell speech if they can help it. Plus, at Carter Spink parties, the speeches always happen early on, so people can get back to work if they need to.</p><p>And while everyone\u2019s listening I\u2019ll slip down to Arnold\u2019s office. It should work. It has to work. As I stare at my own bizarre reflection, I feel a grim resolve hardening inside me. He\u2019s not going to get away with everyone thinking he\u2019s a cheery, harmless old teddy bear. He\u2019s not going to get away with it.</p><p>At ten to six we all gather in one of the kitchens and receive our orders. Hot canap\u00e9s ... cold canap\u00e9s ... I barely listen to any of it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m intending to do any actual waiting. After Jan\u2019s lecture is over, I follow the herd of waiting staff out of the kitchen. I\u2019m given a tray of champagne glasses to carry, which I put down as soon as I can, then head back to the kitchen and grab an open bottle of champagne and a napkin. As soon as I\u2019m sure no one\u2019s looking, I escape to the Ladies.</p><p>OK. This is the difficult bit. I lock myself in a cubicle and wait for fifteen minutes in utter silence. I don\u2019t clatter anything and I don\u2019t sneeze and I don\u2019t giggle when I hear a girl rehearsing her breakup speech to someone called Mike. It\u2019s the longest fifteen minutes of my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last I cautiously unbolt the door, make my way out, and peer round the corner. From where I\u2019m standing I can see the entrance to the big function room. A crowd has already gathered and I can hear laughter and lots of loud talking. People are still coming down the corridor in a steady stream. I recognize the girls from PR ... a couple of trainees ... Oliver Swan, a senior partner. They all head into the party, taking a glass as they do so.</p><p>The corridor\u2019s clear. Go.</p><p>With trembling legs I walk straight past the entrance to the function room, toward the lifts and the door to the stairwell. Within thirty seconds I\u2019m safely through the door and walking as quietly as I can down the stairs. No one ever uses the stairs at Carter Spink, but still.</p><p>I reach the eleventh floor and peer out of the glass panel in the door. I can\u2019t see anyone. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no one there. There could be a whole crowd of them, just out of my line of vision.</p> <p>Well, that\u2019s a risk I\u2019ll have to take. I take a few deep breaths, trying to psych myself up. No one will ever recognize me in my green-and-white waitress gear. And I even have a story if anyone challenges me: I\u2019m on this floor to place this bottle of champagne in Mr. Saville\u2019s room as a surprise.</p><p>Come on. I can\u2019t waste any more time.</p><p>Slowly I push the door open, step out onto the blue carpeted corridor, and exhale in relief. It\u2019s empty. The whole floor is pretty much dead. Everyone must have gone up to the party. I can hear someone on the phone a few yards away\u2014but as I start nervously walking toward Arnold\u2019s office, all the surrounding workstations are empty. All my senses are on red alert.</p><p>The crucial thing is to use my time efficiently. I\u2019ll start with the computer and take it from there. Or maybe I should start with the filing cabinet. Have a quick look while the computer is warming up. Or I\u2019ll search his desk drawers. His BlackBerry could be in there. I hadn\u2019t thought of that.</p><p>Suddenly I can hear voices behind me, coming out of the lifts. In panic, I pick up my pace. I reach Arnold\u2019s office, wrench the door open, slam it behind me, and duck down underneath the glass panel. I can hear the voices getting closer. David Elldridge and Keith Thompson and someone I don\u2019t recognize. They pass by the door, and I don\u2019t move a muscle. Then they\u2019re receding into the distance. Thank God.</p> <p>I let out my breath, slowly rise to my feet, and peep through the glass. I can\u2019t see anyone. I\u2019m safe. Only then do I turn around and survey the office.</p><p>It\u2019s empty.</p><p>It\u2019s been cleared out.</p><p>Bewildered, I take a few steps into the room. The desk is empty. The shelves are empty. There are faint squares on the walls where framed photos have been taken down. There\u2019s nothing in this office apart from one piece of industrial tape on the floor and some drawing pins still stuck into the pin board.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. After all this effort. After making it this far. There\u2019s nothing to bloody search?</p><p>There must be boxes, I think in sudden inspiration. Yes. It\u2019s all been put into boxes to be moved, and they\u2019ll all be stacked outside. I hurry out of the office and look around wildly. But I can\u2019t see any boxes. No crates. Nothing. I\u2019m too late. I\u2019m too fucking late. I feel like punching something with frustration.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>I freeze. Shit. Shit.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I turn round, pulling my hair over my face and gazing firmly downward.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a trainee. Bill ... what\u2019s his name? He used to do occasional bits of work for me.</p><p>It\u2019s all right. He hasn\u2019t recognized me.</p><p>\u201cI was delivering a bottle of champagne, sir,\u201d I mumble in my best drag-queen voice, nodding to the bottle where I left it on the floor. \u201cSurprise for the gentleman. I was just wondering where to put it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d just leave it on the desk,\u201d says Bill curtly. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t be in here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was just going back. Sir.\u201d I dump the bottle on the desk, bow my head, and scuttle out. Bloody hell. That was close.</p><p>I head to the stairwell and hurry up the stairs, flustered. It\u2019s time to exit this building, before anyone else sees me.</p><p>The party\u2019s still in full swing as I creep out of the stairwell door and hurry toward the room where I left my clothes. I won\u2019t bother to change. I can always mail the waitress gear back\u2014</p><p>\u201cTrish?\u201d Jan\u2019s voice hits the back of my head. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Reluctantly I turn round to face her. She looks hopping mad. \u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... serving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. I haven\u2019t seen you in there once!\u201d she snaps. \u201cYou\u2019re not working for me again, I can tell you. Now, take these and pull your weight.\u201d She thrusts a plate of tiny little \u00e9clairs into my arms and pushes me roughly toward the doors of the party. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. I can\u2019t go in there. No way.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! I just have to ... get some cocktail napkins....\u201d I try to back away, but she grabs me.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t! You wanted this job! Now work!\u201d</p><p>She shoves me hard, and I stagger into the crowded room. I feel like a gladiator being pushed into the arena. Jan\u2019s standing at the door, her arms folded. There\u2019s no way out. I\u2019m going to have to do this. I grip the tray more tightly, lower my head\u2014and advance slowly into the crowded room.</p> <p>I can\u2019t walk naturally. My legs feel like boards. The hairs on the nape of my neck are standing on end; I can feel the blood pulsating through my ears. I edge past expensive suits, not daring to look up, not daring to pause in case I attract attention. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. I\u2019m dressed up in a green-and-white uniform, serving mini-\u00e9clairs to my former colleagues.</p><p>But one thing I\u2019ve learned from doing parties with Eamonn is, the waiting staff are invisible. And sure enough, no one seems to have noticed.</p><p>Several hands have plucked \u00e9clairs from the tray, without even glancing at me. Everyone\u2019s too busy laughing and chatting. The din is tremendous.</p><p>I can\u2019t see Arnold anywhere. But he has to be here somewhere. I\u2019m compelled to look for him, to raise my head and search him out. But I can\u2019t risk it. Instead, I keep on moving steadily around the room. Familiar faces are everywhere. Snatches of conversation are making my ears prick up.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ketterman?\u201d someone is asking as I pass by.</p> <p>\u201cIn Dublin for the day,\u201d replies Oliver Swan. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be at the partners\u2019 farewell dinner tomorrow night.\u201d I breathe out in relief. If Ketterman were here I\u2019m sure his laser eyes would pick me up at once.</p><p>\u201c\u00c9clairs. Fab!\u201d</p><p>About eight hands dive into my tray at once and I come to a standstill. It\u2019s a group of trainees. Hoovering food, as trainees always do at parties.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to feel edgy. The longer I stand here without moving, the more exposed I feel. But I can\u2019t get away. Their hands keep plunging in for more.</p><p>\u201cAre there any more of the strawberry tarts, do you know?\u201d a guy with rimless glasses asks me.</p><p>\u201cUm ... I don\u2019t know,\u201d I mutter, staring down.</p> <p>Shit. Now he\u2019s peering at me more closely. He\u2019s bending down to get a good look. And I can\u2019t pull my hair over my face because both hands are holding the tray.</p><p>\u201cIs that ... Samantha Sweeting?\u201d He looks agog. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha Sweeting?\u201d One of the girls drops her \u00e9clair. Another gasps and claps her hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cUm ... yes,\u201d I whisper at last, my face boiling. \u201cIt\u2019s me. But please, don\u2019t tell anyone. I want to keep a low profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... this is what you do now?\u201d The rimless-glasses guy looks aghast. \u201cYou\u2019re a waitress?\u201d</p><p>The trainees are all staring at me as though I\u2019m the Ghost of Failed Lawyers Future.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad.\u201d I attempt an upbeat smile. \u201cYou get free canap\u00e9s!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you make one mistake\u2014and that\u2019s it?\u201d gulps the girl who dropped her \u00e9clair. \u201cYour legal career is ruined forever?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr ... pretty much.\u201d I nod. \u201cCan I offer you another?\u201d</p><p>But no one seems hungry anymore. In fact, they all look rather green about the gills.</p><p>\u201cI might just ... pop back to my desk,\u201d stammers the guy with rimless glasses. \u201cJust check I haven\u2019t got anything outstanding ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d says the girl, thrusting down her glass.</p><p>\u201cSamantha Sweeting is here!\u201d I suddenly hear another of the trainees hissing to a group of junior associates. \u201cLook! She\u2019s a waitress!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I gasp. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone else\u2014\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s too late. I can see all the people in the group turning to look at me with identical expressions of embarrassed horror.</p><p>For an instant I\u2019m so mortified I want to curl up on the spot. These are people I used to work with. These are people who respected me. And now I\u2019m dressed up in stripes, serving them.</p><p>But then, slowly, I begin to feel defiant.</p><p>Fuck you, I find myself thinking. Why shouldn\u2019t I work as a waitress?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, shaking back my hair. \u201cCare for a dessert?\u201d</p><p>More and more people are turning to gasp at me. I can hear the whispering round the room. The other waitstaff are all clustered together, goggling at me. Heads are swiveling everywhere now, like iron filings in a magnetic field. There isn\u2019t one friendly face among them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d I hear someone murmur. \u201cLook at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould she be here?\u201d exclaims someone else.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, trying to sound composed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I make to leave, but the melee is all around me now. I can\u2019t find a way out. And then my stomach plunges. Through a gap in the throng, I spot a familiar shock of woolly hair. Familiar ruddy cheeks. A familiar jovial smile.</p> <p>Arnold Saville.</p><p>Our eyes meet across the room, and although he keeps smiling, there\u2019s a hardness to his gaze that I\u2019ve never seen before. A special anger, just for me.</p><p>I feel sick. Almost scared. Not of his anger\u2014but of his duplicity. He\u2019s fooled everyone. To everyone else in this room, Arnold Saville is on a par with Father Christmas. A way has parted in the crowd, and he\u2019s coming toward me, a glass of champagne in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d he says, in pleasant tones. \u201cIs this appropriate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had me banned from the building,\u201d I hear myself bite back. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much choice.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, God. Wrong answer. Too chippy.</p><p>I have to get control of myself, or I\u2019m going to lose this confrontation. I\u2019m already at enough of a disadvantage, standing here in waitress gear, being peered at by the entire room as if I\u2019m something the dog dragged in. I need to be calm and steely and inspired. But seeing Arnold in the flesh after all this time has thrown me off balance. As hard as I try to stay calm, I can\u2019t. My face is burning, my chest feels tight. All the traumas of the last few weeks are suddenly erupting inside me in a whoosh of hatred.</p><p>\u201cYou had me fired.\u201d The words burst out before I can stop them. \u201cYou lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha, I know this must have been a very difficult time for you.\u201d Arnold has the air of a headmaster dealing with a wayward pupil. \u201cBut really ...\u201d He turns to a man I don\u2019t recognize and rolls his eyes. \u201cFormer employee,\u201d he says in an undertone. \u201cMentally unstable.\u201d</p><p>What? What?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mentally unstable!\u201d I cry. \u201cI just want to know the answer to one simple question. When exactly did you put that memo on my desk?\u201d</p> <p>Arnold laughs, seemingly incredulous.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, I\u2019m retiring. Is this really the time? Could someone get rid of her?\u201d he adds as an aside.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want me to come back to the office, isn\u2019t it?\u201d My voice is trembling with indignation. \u201cBecause I might start asking tricky questions. Because I might work it out.\u201d</p><p>A little frisson travels around the room. But not in a good way. I can hear people murmuring, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d and \u201cHow did she get in here?\u201d If I want to retain any credibility or dignity at all I have to stop talking right now. But I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make that mistake, did I?\u201d I walk toward him. \u201cYou used me. You wrecked my career, you watched my whole life go into free fall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d snaps Arnold, turning away. \u201cThis is getting beyond a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question!\u201d I yell at his back. \u201cWhen did you put that memo on my desk, Arnold? Because I don\u2019t believe it was ever there before the deadline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it was there.\u201d Arnold turns briefly, bored and dismissive. \u201cI came into your office on May twenty-eighth.\u201d</p> <p>May 28th?</p><p>Where did May 28th come from? Why does that feel wrong?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d I say with a helpless anger. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe you. I think you set me up. I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Someone pokes me on the shoulder and I wheel round to see Ernest the security guard. His familiar, gnarled face is awkward. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave the premises.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re seriously throwing me out of the offices? After practically living here for seven years of my life? I can feel my last shreds of composure disappearing. Hot tears of rage and humiliation are pressing against my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust leave, Samantha,\u201d says Oliver Swan pityingly. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass yourself any further.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him for a few seconds, then transfer my gaze to each of the senior partners in turn, searching for a shred of empathy. But there\u2019s none.</p><p>\u201cI was a good lawyer,\u201d I say, my voice shaking. \u201cI did a good job. You all know it. But you just wiped me out, like I never existed.\u201d I swallow down the lump in my throat. \u201cWell, your loss.\u201d</p><p>The room is totally silent as I put the tray of \u00e9clairs down on a nearby table and stalk out of the room. The moment I\u2019m out the door I can hear an animated conversation breaking out behind me. I\u2019m even more of a joke than I was before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I travel down in the lift with Ernest in total silence. If I opened my mouth, I might burst into tears.</p><p>When I get out of the building I check my mobile. There\u2019s a text from Nat on my phone, asking how things went. I read it several times, but I can\u2019t bring myself to reply. Nor can I bring myself to go back to the Geigers\u2019 house. Even though I could probably still catch a train, I can\u2019t face them tonight.</p><p>On automatic pilot, I head down to the Underground and onto a tube. I can see my face in the window opposite, pale and expressionless. And all the way, my mind is buzzing. May 28th. May 28th.</p><p>I don\u2019t hit on the answer until I\u2019m arriving at my building. May 28th. Chelsea Flower Show. Of course. We were at Chelsea all day on May 28th. Arnold, Ketterman, Guy, and I, doing some corporate entertaining. Arnold arrived straight from Paris and afterward he was driven home. He wasn\u2019t even in the office.</p> <p>He lied. Of course he did. I feel a wave of weary anger rising inside me. But there\u2019s nothing I can do now. No one will ever believe me. I\u2019ll live the rest of my life with everyone convinced it was my mistake.</p><p>I get out at my floor, already fumbling for the key, hoping against hope that Mrs. Farley won\u2019t hear me, already planning a long, hot bath. And then, as I\u2019m almost at my door, I stop dead, thinking hard.</p><p>Slowly I turn and head back to the lift. There\u2019s one more chance. I have nothing to lose.</p><p>I rise up two floors and come out of the lift. It\u2019s almost identical to my floor\u2014same carpet, same wallpaper, same lamps. Just different numbers on the apartment doors. 31 and 32. I can\u2019t remember which one I want, so in the end I plump for 31. It has a softer doormat. I sink down on the floor, put my bag down, lean against the door, and wait.</p><p>By the time Ketterman appears out of the lift doors I\u2019m drained. I\u2019ve been sitting here for three solid hours without anything to eat or drink. I feel wan and exhausted. But at the sight of him I scramble to my feet, clutching the wall as I feel a wash of fatigue.</p> <p>For a moment Ketterman looks shocked. Then he resumes his usual stony expression.</p><p>\u201cSamantha. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>As I stand there I wonder if he\u2019s heard about me going to the offices. He must have. He\u2019ll have heard the whole gory tale. Not that he\u2019s giving anything away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he repeats. He\u2019s holding an enormous metal briefcase in one hand and his face is shadowed under the artificial lights. I take a step forward.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m the last person you want to see.\u201d I rub my aching neck. \u201cBelieve me, I don\u2019t want to be here either. Out of all the people in the world I could turn to for help ... you would be the last. You are the last.\u201d</p><p>I break off for a moment. Ketterman hasn\u2019t even flickered.</p> <p>\u201cSo the fact that I\u2019m here, coming to you ... should prove it to you.\u201d I look at him desperately. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I have something to tell you, and you have to listen. You have to.\u201d</p><p>I can hear a car braking in the street outside and someone laughing raucously. Ketterman\u2019s face is still rigid. I can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s thinking. Then, at last, he reaches in his pocket for a key. He walks past me, unlocks the door to flat 32\u2014and finally turns.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>I wake up to the view of a cracked, grubby ceiling. My eye runs along to a huge cobweb in the corner of the room, then down the wall to a rickety bookshelf stuffed with books, tapes, letters, old Christmas decorations, and the odd bit of discarded underwear.</p><p>How did I live in this mess for seven years?</p><p>How did I not notice it?</p><p>I push back the bedcover, get out of bed, and look around blearily. The carpet feels gritty under my feet and I wince. It needs a good Hoover. I guess the cleaner stopped coming after the money stopped appearing.</p> <p>There are clothes lying all over the floor, and I search around until I find a dressing gown. I wrap it around myself and head out to the kitchen. I\u2019d forgotten how bare and cold and spartan it was in here. There\u2019s nothing in the fridge, of course. But I find a chamomile tea bag and fill the kettle, and perch on a bar stool, looking out at the brick wall opposite.</p><p>It\u2019s already nine-fifteen. Ketterman will be at the office. He\u2019ll be taking whatever action he\u2019s going to take. In spite of everything, I feel weirdly calm. Matters are out of my hands now; there\u2019s nothing further I can do.</p><p>He listened to me. He actually listened, and asked questions, and even made me a cup of tea. I was there for over an hour. He didn\u2019t tell me what he thought or what he was going to do. He didn\u2019t even say whether he believed me or not. But the fact that he took me seriously made all the difference. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The kettle\u2019s coming to the boil when the doorbell rings.

Who else?</p><p>I open the door. \u201cHello, Mrs. Farley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha, I thought it was you!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAfter all this time! I had no idea ... I didn\u2019t know what to think ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been away.\u201d I muster a neighborly smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t let you know I was going away. But I didn\u2019t really have any warning myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Mrs. Farley\u2019s eyes are darting all around, at my blond hair, at my face, and past me into the flat, as though searching for clues.</p><p>\u201cThanks for taking in my parcels.\u201d I hold out my hands. \u201cShall I ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Of course.\u201d She hands over a couple of Jiffy bags and a cardboard box, still obviously avid with curiosity. \u201cI suppose these high-powered jobs do send you girls abroad with no notice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been abroad.\u201d I put the boxes down. \u201cThanks again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s no trouble! I know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019ve had a ... a difficult family time?\u201d she hazards.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a difficult family time,\u201d I say politely.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d She clears her throat. \u201cWell, anyway. You\u2019re back now. From ... whatever you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Farley.\u201d I try to keep a straight face. \u201cWould you like to know where I\u2019ve been?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley recoils.</p><p>\u201cDear me! No! It\u2019s absolutely none of my business! Really, I wouldn\u2019t dream of ... I must be getting on....\u201d She starts backing away.</p> <p>\u201cThanks again!\u201d I call as she disappears back into her flat.</p><p>I\u2019m just closing the door as the phone rings. I pick up the receiver, suddenly wondering how many people must have rung this number over the last few weeks. The machine is crammed with messages, but after listening to the first three, all from Mum and each more furious than the last, I gave up.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d comes a businesslike voice. \u201cJohn Ketterman here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Suddenly my calmness is replaced by a serious case of nerves. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to ask that you keep yourself available today. It may be necessary for you to speak to some people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a slight pause, then Ketterman says, \u201cInvestigators.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I feel like punching the air or bursting into tears. But somehow I keep my composure.</p><p>\u201cSo have you found something out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say anything at the moment.\u201d Ketterman sounds as distant and formal as ever. \u201cI just need to know that you\u2019ll be available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Where will I have to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like you to come here, to the Carter Spink offices,\u201d he says, without any trace of irony.</p><p>I look at the phone, almost wanting to laugh. Would that be the same Carter Spink offices I was thrown out of yesterday? I feel like saying. The same Carter Spink offices I\u2019ve been banned from?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d adds Ketterman. \u201cKeep your mobile with you. It could be a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. I will.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cAnd please, just tell me. You don\u2019t have to go into specifics, but ... was my theory right?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a crackling silence down the phone. I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cNot in every detail,\u201d says Ketterman at last, and I feel a painful thrill of triumph. That means I was right with some details, at least.</p><p>The phone goes dead. I put the receiver down and look at my reflection in the hall mirror, my eyes bright.</p><p>I was right. And they know it.</p><p>They\u2019ll offer me my job back, it suddenly hits me. They\u2019ll offer me partnership. At the thought I\u2019m seized with excitement\u2014and at the same time, a kind of fear.</p><p>I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I come to it.</p><p>I walk into the kitchen, keyed up, unable to stand still. What the hell am I going to do for the next few hours? I pour hot water onto my chamomile tea bag and stir it round with a spoon. And then I have an idea.</p><p>It takes only twenty minutes to pop out and get what I need. Butter, eggs, flour, vanilla, icing sugar. Baking tins. Mixers. A set of scales. Everything, in fact. I cannot believe how badly equipped my kitchen is. How did I ever do any cooking in here?</p><p>Well. I didn\u2019t.</p><p>I don\u2019t have an apron so I improvise with an old shirt. I don\u2019t have a mixing bowl and I forgot to buy one\u2014so I use the plastic basin given to me as part of an aromatherapy kit. Two hours of whisking and baking later, I\u2019ve produced a cake. Three tiers of vanilla sponge, sandwiched with buttercream, iced with lemon glac\u00e9, and decorated with sugar flowers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take it in with a glow of satisfaction. This is my fifth cake ever, and the first time I\u2019ve done more than two tiers. I take off my old shirt, check that my mobile is in my pocket, pick up the cake, and head out of the flat.</p><p>As Mrs. Farley answers the doorbell, she looks startled to see me.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you something. To say thank you for looking after my post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She looks at the cake in astonishment. \u201cSamantha! That must have been expensive!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy it,\u201d I say proudly. \u201cI made it.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley looks staggered.</p><p>\u201cYou ... made it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I beam. \u201cShall I bring it in and make you some coffee?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley looks too thunderstruck to answer, so I head past her into the flat. To my shame I realize I haven\u2019t been in here before. In three years of knowing her, I never once set foot over the threshold. The place is immaculately kept, full of little side tables and antiques and a bowl of rose petals on the coffee table.</p> <p>\u201cYou sit down,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll find what I need in the kitchen.\u201d Still looking dazed, Mrs. Farley sinks into an upholstered wing chair.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she says faintly. \u201cDon\u2019t break anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to break anything! Would you like frothy milk? And do you have any nutmeg?\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later I emerge from the kitchen, bearing two coffees and the cake.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I cut Mrs. Farley a slice. \u201cSee what you think.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley takes the plate.</p> <p>\u201cYou made this,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley takes the slice to her mouth. Then she pauses, an anxious expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe!\u201d I say, and take a bite of my own slice. \u201cSee? I know how to cook! Honestly!\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley takes a tiny bite. As she\u2019s chewing, her eyes meet mine in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... delicious! So light! You really made this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI whisked the egg whites separately,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt keeps cakes really light. I can give you the recipe if you like. Have some coffee.\u201d I hand her a cup. \u201cI used your electric beater for the milk, if that\u2019s OK. It works fine, if you get it to just the right temperature.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley is gazing at me as though I\u2019m talking gobbledygook.</p> <p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d she says at last. \u201cWhere have you been these last weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ... away somewhere.\u201d My eye falls on a duster and can of Pledge, sitting on a side table. She must have been in the middle of cleaning when I rang. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use those dusters if I were you,\u201d I add politely. \u201cI can recommend some better ones.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley puts down her cup and leans forward in her chair. Her brow is wrinkled in concern.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, you haven\u2019t joined some sort of religion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I can\u2019t help laughing at her face. \u201cI\u2019ve just been ... doing something different. More coffee?\u201d</p><p>I head into the kitchen and froth up some more milk. When I return to the sitting room, Mrs. Farley is on her second slice of cake.</p><p>\u201cThis is very good,\u201d she says between bites. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... you know.\u201d I shrug, a little awkward. \u201cThanks for looking out for me all that time.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Farley finishes her cake, puts her plate down, and regards me for a few moments, her head cocked to one side like a bird.</p><p>\u201cDear,\u201d she says finally. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve been. Or what you\u2019re doing. But whatever it is, you\u2019re transformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my hair\u2019s different\u2014\u201d I begin, but Mrs. Farley shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cI used to see you, rushing in and out, arriving home late at night, always looking so weary. So troubled. And I used to think you looked like ... like the empty shell of a person. Like a dried-up leaf. A husk.\u201d</p><p>A dried-up leaf? I think in indignation. A husk?</p><p>\u201cBut now you\u2019ve blossomed! You look fitter, you look healthier ... you look happy.\u201d She puts her cup down and leans forward. \u201cWhatever you\u2019ve been doing, dear, you look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well ... thanks,\u201d I say bashfully. \u201cI suppose I do feel different. I suppose I\u2019m more relaxed these days.\u201d I take a sip of coffee and lean back in my chair, mulling it over. \u201cI enjoy life a bit more than I used to. I notice more than I used to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t noticed your phone\u2019s ringing,\u201d Mrs. Farley interrupts mildly, nodding at my pocket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d I say in surprise, and grab my phone. \u201cI should get this. Excuse me.\u201d</p><p>I flip it open and immediately hear Ketterman\u2019s voice in my ear.</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d</p><p>I spend three hours at the Carter Spink offices, talking in turn to a man from the Law Society, two of the senior partners, and a guy from Third Union Bank. By the time we finish I feel drained from repeating the same things over and over to the same carefully blank faces. The office lights are making my head ache. I\u2019d forgotten how airless and dry the atmosphere is here.</p> <p>I still haven\u2019t worked out exactly what\u2019s going on. Lawyers are so bloody discreet. I know someone\u2019s been to see Arnold at his home and that\u2019s about it. But even if no one\u2019s going to admit it, I know I was right. I\u2019ve been vindicated.</p><p>After the last interview, a plate of sandwiches is brought to the small conference room I\u2019m in, together with a bottle of mineral water and a muffin. I get to my feet, stretch out my arms, and wander over to the window. I feel like a prisoner in here. There\u2019s a tapping at the door and Ketterman comes into the room.</p><p>\u201cHave we finished yet?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWe may need to speak to you again.\u201d He gestures to the sandwiches. \u201cHave something to eat.\u201d</p><p>I cannot stay in this room a moment longer. I have to stretch my legs, at least.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go and freshen up first,\u201d I say, and hurry out of the room before he can object.</p><p>As I enter the Ladies, all the women in there stop talking immediately. I disappear into a cubicle and hear the sound of excited whisperings and murmurings outside. As I come out again, not one person has left the room. I can feel all the eyes on me, like sunlamps.</p><p>\u201cSo are you back now, Samantha?\u201d says an associate called Lucy.</p><p>\u201cIs it true you were a waitress?\u201d chimes in a secretary from Litigation.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d I turn away to the sink, feeling self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cYou look so different,\u201d says another girl.</p> <p>\u201cYour arms!\u201d says Lucy as I wash my hands. \u201cThey\u2019re so brown. And toned. Have you been to a spa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... no.\u201d I pull down some paper towel. \u201cBut thanks. So, how\u2019s life been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Lucy nods a few times. \u201cReally busy. Clocked up sixty-six billable hours last week. Two all-nighters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had three,\u201d puts in another girl. I can see the pride in her face. And the dark gray shadows under her eyes. Is that what I used to look like? All pale and strained and tense?</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say politely, drying my hands. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better get back now. See you.\u201d</p><p>I exit the Ladies and am walking back to the conference room, lost in my own thoughts, when I hear a voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Samantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuy?\u201d I look up in shock to see him hurrying down the corridor toward me, his smile even more dazzling than ever.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t expecting to see Guy here. In fact, I feel a bit thrown by the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He grips my shoulders tightly and scans my face. \u201cYou look fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were in Hong Kong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot back this morning. I\u2019ve just been briefed on the situation. Bloody hell, Samantha, it\u2019s incredible.\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cOnly you could work all that out. Arnold, of all people. I was shell-shocked. Everyone is. Those who know,\u201d he adds, lowering his voice still further. \u201cObviously it\u2019s not out yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what the \u2018situation\u2019 is,\u201d I reply, with a touch of resentment. \u201cNo one\u2019s telling me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they will.\u201d Guy reaches into his pocket, gets out his BlackBerry, and squints at it. \u201cYou are flavor of the month right now. I knew it all along.\u201d He looks up. \u201cI knew you could never make a mistake.\u201d</p><p>What? How can he say that?</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d I reply at last, finding my words. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. If you remember, you said I\u2019d made errors. You said I was \u2018unreliable.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I can feel all the old hurt and humiliation starting to rise again and look away.</p><p>\u201cI said other people had said you made errors.\u201d Guy pauses in tapping at his BlackBerry and looks up, frowning. \u201cShit, Samantha. I did stand up for you. I was on your side. Ask anyone!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why you wouldn\u2019t have me to stay.</p><p>But I don\u2019t say anything out loud. I really don\u2019t want to get into it. It\u2019s history.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>We start walking along the corridor together, Guy still engrossed in the BlackBerry. God, he\u2019s addicted to that thing, I think with slight irritation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo where the hell did you disappear to?\u201d At last he stops tapping. \u201cWhat have you been doing all this time? You\u2019re not really a waitress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I can\u2019t help smiling at his expression. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019ve got a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d get snapped up.\u201d He nods with satisfaction. \u201cWho\u2019s employed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... no one you\u2019d know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the same area, though?\u201d He puts his BlackBerry away. \u201cDoing the same kind of work?\u201d</p><p>I have a sudden vision of me in my blue nylon overall, mopping Trish\u2019s bathroom floor.</p><p>\u201cEr ... as it happens, not really.\u201d Somehow I keep a straight face. Guy seems surprised.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still in banking law, right? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve made a complete change?\u201d He suddenly looks galvanized. \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone into commercial law, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no ... not commercial law. I\u2019d better go.\u201d I cut him off and open the door to the interview room. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p> <p>I eat my sandwiches, I drink my mineral water. For half an hour no one disturbs me. I feel a bit like I\u2019m in quarantine for some deadly illness. They could have given me some magazines, at least. I\u2019ve developed quite a habit for gossip, after being surrounded by Trish\u2019s endless supply of Heat and Hello!</p><p>At last I hear a knock at the door and Ketterman comes in.</p><p>\u201cSamantha. We would like to see you in the boardroom.\u201d</p><p>The boardroom?</p><p>I follow Ketterman down the corridors, aware of the nudges and whisperings from everyone we pass. He opens the huge double doors to the boardroom and I walk in to see about half the partners standing there, waiting for me. There\u2019s silence as Ketterman closes the doors. I glance at Guy, who grins back encouragingly but says nothing.</p><p>Am I supposed to speak? Did I miss the instructions? Ketterman has joined the group of partners. Now he turns to face me.</p> <p>\u201cSamantha. As you know, an investigation of ... recent events is under way. The results have not yet been fully determined.\u201d He breaks off, looking tense, and I can see some of the others exchanging sober looks. \u201cHowever, we have come to one conclusion. You were ... wronged.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stupefied. He\u2019s admitting it? Getting a lawyer to admit they\u2019ve made a mistake is like getting a movie star to admit they had liposuction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I say, just to force him to repeat it.</p><p>\u201cYou were wronged.\u201d Ketterman frowns, clearly not enjoying this part of the conversation at all. I almost want to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI was ... wrong?\u201d I hazard, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWronged!\u201d he snaps. \u201cWronged!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wronged. Well, thank you.\u201d I smile politely. \u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019ll probably offer me some kind of bonus, it crosses my mind. A luxury gift basket. Or even a holiday.</p> <p>\u201cAnd therefore\u2014\u201d Ketterman pauses. \u201cWe would like to offer you full equity partnership in the firm. Effective immediately.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so shocked I nearly sit down on the floor. Full equity partnership?</p><p>I open my mouth\u2014but I can\u2019t speak. I feel winded. I look around helplessly, like a fish on the end of a line. Full equity partnership is the highest pinnacle, way above the first rung of partnership. It\u2019s the most prestigious job in law. I never, ever, ever expected that.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, Samantha,\u201d says Greg Parker.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d chime in a few others. David Elldridge gives me a warm smile. Guy gives me the thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cWe have some champagne.\u201d Ketterman nods to Guy, who opens the double doors. The next moment two waitresses from the partners\u2019 dining room are coming in with trays of champagne glasses. Someone puts one in my hand.</p><p>This is all going too fast.</p><p>\u201cEr ... excuse me?\u201d I call out. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually said if I\u2019ll accept it.\u201d</p><p>The whole room seems to freeze, like a videotape on pause.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Ketterman turns to me.</p><p>Oh, God. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re going to take this very well.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is ...\u201d I break off and take a sip of champagne for Dutch courage, trying to work out how to put this tactfully.</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking about it all day, over and over. Being a partner at Carter Spink is the dream I\u2019ve had all my adult life. The glittering prize. It\u2019s everything I ever wanted ...</p><p>Except all the things I never knew I wanted. Things I had no idea about until a few weeks ago. Like fresh air. Like evenings off. Unburdened weekends. Making plans with friends. Sitting in the pub after my work is done, drinking cider, with nothing to do, nothing hanging over me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even if they\u2019re offering me full equity partnership, it doesn\u2019t change the way I feel. It doesn\u2019t change me. Mrs. Farley was right: I\u2019ve blossomed. I\u2019m not a husk anymore.</p><p>Why would I go back to being a husk?</p><p>I clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous honor to be offered such an amazing opportunity,\u201d I say earnestly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very grateful. Truly. However ... the reason I came back wasn\u2019t to get my job back. It was to clear my name. To prove that I didn\u2019t make a mistake.\u201d I can\u2019t help shooting a look at Guy. \u201cThe truth is, since leaving Carter Spink I\u2019ve ... well ... moved on. I have a job. Which I very much enjoy. So I won\u2019t be taking up your offer.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a stunned silence.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I add again, politely. \u201cAnd ... er ... thanks for the champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she serious?\u201d says someone at the back. Ketterman and Elldridge are exchanging frowns.</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d says Ketterman, coming forward. \u201cYou may have found opportunities elsewhere. But you are a Carter Spink lawyer. This is where you trained, this is where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a question of salary,\u201d adds Elldridge, \u201cI\u2019m sure we can match whatever you\u2019re currently\u2014\u201d He glances at Guy. \u201cWhich law firm has she gone to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWherever you are, I\u2019ll speak to the senior partner,\u201d says Ketterman in a businesslike way. \u201cThe personnel director ... whoever would be appropriate. We\u2019ll sort this out. If you give me a number.\u201d He\u2019s taking out his BlackBerry.</p><p>My mouth twists. I desperately want to laugh.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a personnel director,\u201d I explain. \u201cOr a senior partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a senior partner?\u201d Ketterman looks impatient. \u201cHow can there not be a senior partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was working as a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve said I think the world is flat. I have never seen so many flummoxed faces in my life.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re ... not working as a lawyer?\u201d says Elldridge at last. \u201cWhat are you working as, then?\u201d</p><p>I was hoping it wouldn\u2019t come to this. But on the other hand, why shouldn\u2019t they know?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working as a housekeeper.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Housekeeper?\u2019 \u201d Elldridge peers at me. \u201cIs that the new jargon for \u2018troubleshooter\u2019? I can\u2019t keep up with these ridiculous job titles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on the compliance side?\u201d says Ketterman. \u201cIs that what you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not what I mean,\u201d I say patiently. \u201cI\u2019m a housekeeper. I make beds. I cook meals. I\u2019m a domestic.\u201d</p><p>God, I wish I had a camera. Their faces.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re literally ... a housekeeper?\u201d stutters Elldridge at last.</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I look at my watch. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fulfilled and I\u2019m relaxed and I\u2019m happy. In fact, I should be getting back. Thank you,\u201d I add to Ketterman. \u201cFor listening to me. You\u2019re the only one who did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning down our offer?\u201d says Oliver Swan incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning down your offer.\u201d I give an apologetic shrug. \u201cSorry. Bye, everyone.\u201d</p><p>As I head out of the room I feel slightly wobbly about the legs. And slightly manic inside. I turned it down. I turned down full equity partnership of Carter Spink.</p><p>What the hell is my mother going to say?</p><p>The thought makes me want to burst into hysterical laughter.</p><p>I feel too keyed up to wait for the lift, so I head down the stairwell, clattering down the cold stone steps.</p><p>\u201cSamantha!\u201d Guy\u2019s voice suddenly echoes above me.</p><p>Oh, honestly. What does he want?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d I yell back. \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go!\u201d</p><p>I can hear him accelerating down the steps, so I pick up speed myself. I\u2019ve said my piece\u2014what more is there to talk about? My shoes are clacking on the steps as I tear down, gripping on the handrail for balance. But even so, Guy\u2019s gaining on me.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, this is crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you ruin your career out of ... out of ... pique!\u201d he calls, and I wheel round indignantly, nearly falling down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this out of pique!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry with us all!\u201d Guy joins me on the staircase, breathing hard. \u201cI\u2019m sure it makes you feel really good to turn us down, to say you\u2019re working as a housekeeper\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am working as a housekeeper!\u201d I retort. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not turning you down because I\u2019m angry.

You\u2019ve worked for it for all these years. You can\u2019t throw it away! It\u2019s too valuable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t value it anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been less than two months! Everything can\u2019t have changed!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has.

We\u2019ll talk about it. The human-resources department has come on board. You lost your job ... you were badly treated ... it\u2019s no wonder you can\u2019t think straight. They\u2019re suggesting counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need counseling!\u201d I turn on my heel and start down the stairs again. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t want to be a lawyer, what, I\u2019m crazy?\u201d</p> <p>I reach the bottom of the stairwell and burst into the foyer with Guy in hot pursuit. Hilary Grant, head of PR, is sitting on a leather sofa with some red-suited woman I don\u2019t recognize, and they both look up in surprise.</p><p>\u201cSamantha you cannot do this!\u201d Guy is shouting after me as he emerges into the foyer. \u201cYou are one of the most talented lawyers I know. I cannot let you turn down partnership to be a fucking ... housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, if it\u2019s what I want to do?\u201d I come to a halt on the marble and spin round to face him. \u201cGuy ... I\u2019ve found out what it\u2019s like to have a life! I\u2019ve found out what it\u2019s like not working every weekend. Not feeling pressure all the time. And ... I like it!\u201d</p><p>Guy isn\u2019t listening to a word I say. He doesn\u2019t even want to understand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to stand there and tell me you prefer cleaning loos to being a partner at Carter Spink?\u201d His face is flushed with outrage.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cYes, I do!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d says the woman in the red suit with interest.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, you\u2019re making the biggest mistake of your entire existence!\u201d Guy\u2019s voice follows me as I reach the glass doors. \u201cIf you walk out now\u2014\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wait to hear any more. I\u2019m out the door. Down the steps. Gone.</p><p>You\u2019re making the biggest mistake of your entire existence. As I sit on the train back to Gloucestershire, Guy\u2019s words keep ringing in my ears.</p><p>Once upon a time, just that thought would have sent me into a tailspin. But not anymore. He has no idea.</p><p>If I\u2019ve learned one lesson from all that\u2019s happened to me, it\u2019s that there is no such thing as the biggest mistake of your existence. There\u2019s no such thing as ruining your life. Life\u2019s a pretty resilient thing, it turns out.</p><p>When I arrive at Lower Ebury I head straight to the pub. Nathaniel is behind the bar, wearing a chambray shirt I\u2019ve never seen before, talking to Eamonn. For a few moments I just watch him from the doorway. His strong hands; the slant of his neck; the way his brow furrows as he nods. I can tell at once he disagrees with whatever Eamonn is saying. But he\u2019s waiting, wanting to be tactful about making his point. He knows how people work.</p><p>As if he can sense me watching him, he looks up and his face jolts. He smiles in welcome\u2014but I can see the tension underneath. This last couple of days can\u2019t have been easy for him. Maybe he thought I\u2019d get suckered in to my old relationship, that I wasn\u2019t coming back.</p> <p>A roar goes up from the dartboard. Bill, a local farmer I\u2019ve gotten to know, turns and spots me walking toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cSamantha!\u201d he shouts. \u201cAt last! We need you on our team!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a sec!\u201d I call over my shoulder. \u201cHi,\u201d I say as I reach Nathaniel. \u201cNice shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says casually. \u201cGood trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d I nod. Nathaniel lifts up the bar for me to come through, his eyes searching my face as though for clues.</p><p>\u201cSo ... is it over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I put my arms around him and hug him tight. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>And at that moment, I truly believe it is.</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>Nothing happens until lunchtime the next day.</p><p>I make the breakfast for Trish and Eddie as usual. I hoover and dust as usual. Then I put on Iris\u2019s apron, get out the chopping board, and start squeezing oranges. I\u2019m going to make bitter chocolate and orange mousse for the charity lunch tomorrow. We\u2019re going to serve it on a bed of crystallized orange slices, and each plate is going to be garnished with a real silver-leaf angel from a Christmas-decoration catalog. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was Trish\u2019s idea.

It\u2019s all under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I\u2019ve been through, the last few days?\u201d She clutches her head. \u201cMore and more people keep accepting. I\u2019ve had to change the seating plan ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I say soothingly. \u201cTry to relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sighs, holding her head between two lacquered fingernails. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll just go and check the goody bags ...\u201d</p><p>I cannot believe how much Trish is spending on this lunch. Every time I question whether we really need to canopy the dining room in white silk or give every guest an orchid buttonhole, she shrills, \u201cIt\u2019s all in a good cause!\u201d</p><p>Which reminds me of something I\u2019ve been meaning to ask her for quite a while now.</p><p>\u201cEr ... Mrs. Geiger,\u201d I say casually. \u201cAre you charging your guests for entrance to the lunch?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s rather tacky, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you holding a raffle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She wrinkles her nose. \u201cPeople loathe raffles.\u201d</p><p>I hardly dare ask this next question.</p><p>\u201cSo ... um ... how exactly are you planning on making money for Save The Children?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the kitchen. Trish has frozen, her eyes wide.</p> <p>\u201cBugger,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>I knew it. She hadn\u2019t given it a thought. Somehow I manage to keep my respectful housekeeper\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we could ask for voluntary donations?\u201d I suggest. \u201cWe could hand round a little bag with the coffee and mints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes.\u201d Trish peers at me as though I\u2019m a genius. \u201cThat\u2019s the answer.\u201d She exhales sharply. \u201cThis is really very stressful, Samantha. I don\u2019t know how you stay so calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... I don\u2019t know.\u201d I feel a sudden wave of fondness for her. When I arrived back at the house last night it was like coming home. Even though Trish had left a mountain of dirty crockery on the counter for my return, and a note saying, Samantha, please polish all silver for luncheon.</p><p>Trish heads out of the kitchen and I start whisking up egg whites for the mousse. Then I notice a man sidling down the drive. He\u2019s wearing jeans and an old polo shirt and has a camera slung round his neck. He disappears from view and I frown in puzzlement. Maybe he\u2019s a deliveryman. I measure out the caster sugar, with half an ear out for the doorbell, and start folding it into the egg whites, just the way Iris taught me. Then suddenly the man is standing at the kitchen door, peering in through the window.</p><p>I\u2019m not ruining my mixture for some door-to-door salesman. He can wait a few moments. I finish folding in the sugar\u2014then head to the door and open it.</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d I say politely.</p> <p>\u201cAre you Samantha Sweeting?\u201d he says, glancing down at a folded-up tabloid newspaper in his hand.</p><p>I look back at him warily. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from the Cheltenham Gazette.\u201d He flashes an ID card at me. \u201cI\u2019m after an exclusive interview with you. \u2018Why I Chose the Cotswolds as My Secret Hideaway.\u2019 That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>I look at him blankly for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cEr ... what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen it?\u201d He looks surprised. \u201cHaven\u2019t your friends been on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. At least, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, confused. My mobile phone\u2019s upstairs in my bedroom. If it has been ringing, I haven\u2019t heard it.</p><p>\u201cI take it this is you?\u201d He turns the newspaper round and my stomach seizes up.</p><p>It\u2019s a picture of me. In the Daily World. A national tabloid.</p><p>It\u2019s my official Carter Spink portrait. I\u2019m wearing a black suit and my hair is screwed up. Above it, in bold black letters, is the headline: \u201ci\u2019d rather clean loos than be a partner at carter spink.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is going on?</p><p>With trembling hands I grab the paper from the guy and scan the text.</p><p>They are the Masters of the Universe, the envy of their peers.

How did\u2014what did\u2014How?</p><p>A flash interrupts me and I lift my head to see the guy pointing his camera at me.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I say, putting my hands up in front of my face.</p> <p>\u201cCan I have a picture of you holding a toilet brush, love?\u201d he says, zooming his lens in. \u201cIt was a waitress in Cheltenham pointed me in the right direction.

You ... you\u2019ve made a mistake!\u201d I shove the paper back at him in a mess of pages. \u201cMy name\u2019s Sarah. I\u2019m not a lawyer.

Then I pull the curtain across the window and lean back against the door, my heart thudding. Fuck. Fuck. What am I going to do?</p><p>OK. The important thing is not to panic. The important thing is to stay rational.</p><p>On the one hand, my entire past has been exposed in a national tabloid. On the other hand, Trish and Eddie don\u2019t read that particular tabloid. Or the Cheltenham Gazette. It\u2019s one silly story in one silly paper and it will die away by tomorrow. There\u2019s no reason to tell them anything. There\u2019s no need to rock the boat. I\u2019ll just carry on making my chocolate-orange mousses as though nothing has happened. Yes. Total denial is the way forward.</p><p>Feeling slightly better, I reach for the chocolate and start breaking chunks into a glass bowl.</p><p>\u201cSamantha! Who was that?\u201d Trish pokes her head round the door.</p> <p>\u201cNo one.\u201d I look up with a fixed smile. \u201cNothing. Why don\u2019t I make you a cup of coffee and bring it out to the garden?\u201d</p><p>Keep calm. Denial. It\u2019ll all be fine.</p><p>OK. Denial\u2019s not going to work, because there are three more journalists in the drive.</p><p>It\u2019s twenty minutes later. I\u2019ve abandoned my chocolate mousses and am peering out the hall window in rising dismay. Two blokes and a girl have appeared out of nowhere. They all have cameras and are chatting to the guy in the polo shirt, who\u2019s gesticulating toward the kitchen. Occasionally one of them breaks off and takes a shot of the house. Any minute one of them is going to ring the doorbell.</p><p>I cannot let this develop. I need a new plan. I need ...</p><p>Diversion. Yes. At least it might buy me some time.</p><p>I head to the front door, grabbing one of Trish\u2019s floppy straw hats on the way. Then I cautiously step outside and make my way down the gravel drive to the entrance, where the four journalists crowd around me.</p><p>\u201cAre you Samantha Sweeting?\u201d says one, thrusting a tape recorder in my face.</p><p>\u201cDo you regret turning down partnership?\u201d demands another.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Sarah,\u201d I say, keeping my head down. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong girl.

I\u2019m also still wearing Trish\u2019s floppy straw hat.</p><p>I grab it off my head and dump it on the table, just as Trish comes into the kitchen.

I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a protest.\u201d She wrinkles her brow. \u201cI do hope they\u2019re not still there tomorrow.

At once Trish claps her hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cJoanna Lumley! I heard a rumor she was buying in the village!

I just ... didn\u2019t tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were in an abusive relationship.\u201d He bows his head, clenching his hands behind his neck. \u201cI thought that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want to talk about your past.

My mobile is so jammed with messages from journalists who have got hold of the number, I\u2019ve given up listening to them. As I enter the kitchen, Melissa and Eddie are sitting at the table, which is covered in newspapers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in every single paper,\u201d Melissa informs me. \u201cUncle Eddie went down to the shop for them. Look.\u201d She shows me a double-page spread in the Sun. There\u2019s a picture of me superimposed on the background of a loo, and someone\u2019s drawn a toilet brush in one of my hands. \u201ci\u2019d rather clean loos!\u201d is in huge letters next to my face.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d I sink into a chair and stare at the picture. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s August,\u201d says Eddie, flicking through the Telegraph. \u201cNothing else in the news. Says here you\u2019re a casualty of today\u2019s work-obsessed society.\u201d He turns the paper around to show me a small item topped with the headline carter spink high-flyer chooses drudgery after rumors of scandal.</p><p>\u201cIt says here you\u2019re a Judas to career women everywhere.\u201d Melissa is reading the Herald. \u201cThis columnist Mindy Morrell is really angry with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAngry?\u201d I echo, bewildered. \u201cWhy would anyone be angry with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in the Daily World you\u2019re a savior of traditional values.\u201d Melissa reaches for the paper and opens it. \u201cSamantha Sweeting believes women should return to the hearthside for the sake of their own health and that of society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I never said that!\u201d I grab the paper and scan the text in disbelief. \u201cWhy are they all so obsessed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly season,\u201d says Eddie, reaching for the Express. \u201cIs it true you single-handedly uncovered Mafia connections at your law firm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I look up. \u201cWho said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t remember where I saw it now,\u201d he says, riffling through the pages. \u201cThere\u2019s a picture of your mother in this one. Nice-looking lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mother?\u201d I stare in dismay.</p><p>\u201cHigh-flying daughter of a high-flying mother,\u201d Eddie reads aloud. \u201cWas the pressure to succeed too much?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Mum is going to kill me.</p><p>\u201cThis one has a poll, look.\u201d Eddie has opened another paper. \u201cSamantha Sweeting: Heroine or Fool? Phone or text your vote. Then they give a number to call.\u201d He reaches for the phone and frowns. \u201cWhich shall I vote for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool,\u201d says Melissa, grabbing the phone. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha! You\u2019re up!\u201d</p><p>I raise my head to see Trish coming into the kitchen, holding a bundle of newspapers under her arm.

I\u2019ve learned a lot living here. I\u2019ve changed as a person. And I\u2019ve found a fulfilling way of life. Yes, I could make a lot more money being a lawyer in London. Yes, I could have some high-powered, pressurized career. But it\u2019s not what I want.\u201d I spread my arms around the kitchen. \u201cThis is what I want to do.

Hello?\u201d As she listens, her expression changes and she puts her hand over the receiver.</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d she hisses. \u201cIt\u2019s an ad company. Are you willing to appear in a TV commercial for Toilet Duck?

I don\u2019t want to be in any commercials!\u201d I can see Eddie opening his mouth to argue. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do any interviews,\u201d I add quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a role model. I just want everything to go back to normal.\u201d</p><p>But by lunchtime everything is even more surreal than before.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had three more requests to appear on TV and one to do a \u201ctasteful\u201d photo shoot for the Sun in a French maid\u2019s uniform. Trish has given an exclusive interview to the Mail. Callers to a radio phone-in that Melissa insisted on listening to have described me as \u201can antifeminist moron,\u201d a \u201cMartha Stewart wannabe,\u201d and \u201ca parasite on the taxpayers who paid for my education.\u201d I was so furious I almost phoned up myself.</p><p>But instead I switched the radio off and took three deep breaths. I\u2019m not going to let myself get hassled. I have other things to think about. Fourteen guests have arrived for the charity lunch and are milling around on the lawn. I have wild-mushroom tartlets to bake, asparagus sauce to finish, and salmon fillets to roast.</p><p>I desperately wish Nathaniel were here to keep me calm. But he\u2019s gone off to Buckingham to pick up some koi carp for the pond, which Trish has suddenly decided she must have. Apparently they cost hundreds of pounds and all the celebrities have them. It\u2019s ridiculous. No one ever even looks in the pond.</p><p>The doorbell rings just as I\u2019m opening the oven, and I sigh. Not another guest. We\u2019ve had four late acceptances this morning, which has totally thrown my schedule. Let alone the journalist from the Mirror who dressed up in a pink floral suit and tried to tell Eddie she was new to the village.</p><p>I put the tray of tarts in the oven, gather up the remaining scraps of pastry, and start to wipe down my rolling pin.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Trish taps at the door. \u201cWe have another guest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d I turn round, wiping flour off my cheek. \u201cBut I\u2019ve just put the starters in the oven\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a friend of yours. He says he needs to speak to you urgently. About business?\u201d Trish raises her eyebrow at me significantly\u2014then steps aside.</p> <p>It\u2019s Guy. Standing in Trish\u2019s kitchen. In his immaculate Jermyn Street suit and starched cuffs.</p><p>I\u2019m utterly flabbergasted. Judging by his expression, he\u2019s pretty gobsmacked too.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d he says slowly, his eyes running over my uniform, my rolling pin, my floury hands. \u201cYou really are a housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I lift my chin. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha ...\u201d says Trish from the door. \u201cNot that I want to interrupt, but ... starters in ten minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mrs. Geiger.\u201d I automatically bob a curtsy as Trish leaves, and Guy\u2019s eyes nearly fall out of his head.</p><p>\u201cYou curtsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe curtsying was a bit of a mistake,\u201d I admit, catching his appalled expression. \u201cGuy, what are you doing here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here to persuade you to come back.\u201d</p><p>Of course he is.

Excuse me.\u201d I reach for the broom and dustpan and start sweeping the flour and pastry scraps off the floor. \u201cMind your feet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d Guy awkwardly moves out of the way.</p> <p>I dump the pastry bits in the bin, then get my asparagus sauce out of the fridge, pour it into a pan, and set it on a gentle heat. Guy is watching me in bemusement.</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d he says as I turn round. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d The kitchen timer goes off with a shrill ring and I open the bottom oven to take out my rosemary-garlic rolls. I feel a surge of pride as I see them, all golden brown and wafting a delicious, herby scent. I can\u2019t resist taking a nibble out of one, then offering it to Guy.</p><p>\u201cYou made these?\u201d He looks astounded. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. I learned.\u201d I reach into the fridge again for some unsalted butter and break a knob into the foaming asparagus sauce. Then I glance at Guy, who\u2019s standing by the utensil rack. \u201cCould you pass me a whisk?\u201d</p> <p>Guy looks helplessly at the utensils.</p><p>\u201cEr ... which one is the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I say, clicking my tongue. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a job offer for you,\u201d says Guy as I grab the whisk and start beating in the butter. \u201cI think you should look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d I don\u2019t even raise my head.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even seen it yet.\u201d He reaches into his inside pocket and produces a white letter. \u201cHere. Take a look.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested!\u201d I repeat in exasperation. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I don\u2019t want to be a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be a housekeeper instead.\u201d His tone is so dismissive, I feel stung.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I thrust my whisk down. \u201cI do! I\u2019m happy here. I\u2019m relaxed. You have no idea. It\u2019s a different life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I got that,\u201d says Guy, glancing at my broom. \u201cSamantha, you have to see sense!\u201d He takes a phone out of his inside pocket and starts dialing. \u201cThere\u2019s someone you really should speak to. I\u2019ve been in contact with your mother over the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d I stare at him in horror. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha, I only want the best for you. So does she. Hi, Jane,\u201d he says into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m with her now. I\u2019ll pass you over.\u201d</p><p>I cannot believe this. For an instant I feel like throwing the phone out the window. But no. I can deal with this.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mum,\u201d I say, taking the phone from Guy. \u201cLong time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d Her voice is as icy as it was the last time we spoke. But somehow this time it doesn\u2019t make me feel tense or anxious. She can\u2019t tell me what to do. She has no idea about my life anymore. \u201cWhat exactly do you think you\u2019re doing? Working as some kind of domestic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m a housekeeper. And I suppose you want me to go back to being a lawyer? Well, I\u2019m happy here and I\u2019m not going to.\u201d I taste the asparagus sauce and add some salt.</p><p>\u201cYou may think it\u2019s funny to be flippant,\u201d she says curtly. \u201cThis is your life, Samantha. Your career. I think you fail to understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand! None of you do!\u201d I glare at Guy, then turn the hob down to a simmer and lean against the counter. \u201cMum, I\u2019ve learned a different way to live. I do my day\u2019s work, and I finish\u2014and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m free. I don\u2019t need to take paperwork home. I don\u2019t need to have my BlackBerry switched on twenty-four/seven. I can go to the pub, I can make weekend plans, I can go and sit in the garden for half an hour with my feet up\u2014and it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t have that constant pressure anymore. I\u2019m not stressed out. And it suits me.\u201d I reach for a glass, fill it with water, and take a drink. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve changed. I\u2019ve made friends. I\u2019ve got to know the community here. It\u2019s like ... The Waltons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Waltons?\u201d She sounds startled. \u201cAre there children there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in frustration. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! They just ... care. Like, a couple of weeks ago they threw me the most amazing birthday party.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I wonder if I\u2019ve touched a sensitive spot. Maybe she\u2019ll feel guilty ... maybe she\u2019ll understand ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow very bizarre,\u201d she says crisply. \u201cYour birthday was almost two months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it was.\u201d I sigh. \u201cLook, Mum, I\u2019ve made up my mind.\u201d The cooker suddenly pings, and I reach for an oven glove. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha, this conversation is not over!\u201d she snaps furiously. \u201cWe have not finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have, OK?

An elderly woman at the end turns to Trish, looking bewildered.</p><p>\u201cAre all your help lawyers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all,\u201d says Trish airily, taking a deep gulp of champagne. \u201cBut you know, having had a Cambridge-educated housekeeper ... I could never go back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere do you get them from?\u201d a red-haired woman asks avidly. \u201cIs there a special agency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Oxbridge Housekeepers,\u201d says Guy, placing a mushroom tart in front of her. \u201cVery choosy.

I can make enough money in a few years to retire!\u201d</p> <p>Nathaniel doesn\u2019t seem as impressed as he should. He just looks at me steadily. \u201cAt what cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I avoid his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI mean that when you turned up here, you were a nervous wreck. You were like some freaked-out rabbit. White as a sheet. Stiff as a board. You looked like you hadn\u2019t ever seen the sun, you looked like you hadn\u2019t ever enjoyed yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Can\u2019t you see how much you\u2019ve changed? You\u2019re not edgy anymore. You\u2019re not a bundle of nerves.\u201d He picks up my arm and lets it fall down. \u201cThat arm would have stayed there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK ... so I\u2019ve relaxed a bit!\u201d I throw up my hands. \u201cI know I\u2019ve changed. I\u2019ve calmed down and I\u2019ve learned to cook and iron and pull pints\u2014and I\u2019ve had a wonderful time. But it\u2019s like a holiday. It can\u2019t last forever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His persistence is unnerving me.</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d I say, rattled. \u201cIf I stay as a housekeeper I\u2019ll be unfulfilled!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what your lawyer friend told you?\u201d There\u2019s a hostile edge to his tone. \u201cThat you\u2019ll be more fulfilled working twenty-four hours a day? That they\u2019re only thinking of your own good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, it\u2019s obvious. I can\u2019t clean loos forever!\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel shakes his head in despair.</p><p>\u201cSo after all this you\u2019re just going to go back, pick up the reins, and carry on as though nothing happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be different this time!

You live in the same village you grew up in, you run the family business, you\u2019re buying a nursery down the road ... you\u2019re practically still in the womb. So before you lecture me on the way to live my life, try living one of your own, OK?\u201d</p><p>I break off, panting, to see Nathaniel looking as though I\u2019ve slapped him.</p><p>\u201cI ... didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>I take a few steps away, feeling near to tears. This isn\u2019t the way things were supposed to go. Nathaniel was supposed to support me and give me a hug and tell me I was making the right decision. Instead here we are, standing yards apart, not even looking at each other.</p> <p>\u201cI thought about spreading my wings.\u201d Nathaniel suddenly speaks, his voice stiff. \u201cThere\u2019s a nursery in Cornwall I\u2019d die to own. Fantastic piece of land, fantastic business\u2014but I didn\u2019t look at it. I preferred not to be six hours away from you.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. That was pretty narrow-minded of me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to reply. For a while there\u2019s silence, except for the cooing of pigeons down at the end of the garden. It is the most spectacular evening, I suddenly realize. Evening sun is slanting through the willow tree and the grass smells sweet underneath my feet.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel ... I have to go back.\u201d My voice isn\u2019t quite steady. \u201cI don\u2019t have any choice. But we can still be together. The two of us. We can still make it work. We\u2019ll have holidays ... weekends ... I\u2019ll come back for Eamonn\u2019s party ... You won\u2019t know I\u2019ve gone!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent for a moment, fiddling with the handle of the bucket.

You look absolutely washed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep that well,\u201d I admit, and flip on the kettle.</p><p>I spent the night at Nathaniel\u2019s. We cooked mushroom omelets together and watched the end of an old war movie and had slow, tender sex. We didn\u2019t talk any more about my going. But at three o\u2019clock, when I looked over at him, he was awake too, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cYou need energy!\u201d says Trish, perturbed. \u201cIt\u2019s your big day! You need to look your best!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I try to smile. \u201cI just need a cup of coffee.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s going to be a huge day. The Carter Spink PR department swung into action as soon as I made my decision and has turned my return into a full media event. There\u2019s going to be a big press conference at lunchtime in front of the Geigers\u2019 house, where I\u2019ll say how delighted I am to be going back to Carter Spink. Several of the partners are going to shake my hand for the photographers and I\u2019ll give a few short interviews. And then we\u2019re all going back to London on the train.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Eddie as I spoon coffee into the pot. \u201cAll packed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. And Mrs. Geiger ... here.\u201d I hand Trish the blue uniform, which I\u2019ve been carrying, folded, under my arm. \u201cIt\u2019s clean and pressed. Ready for your next housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>As Trish takes the uniform she looks suddenly stricken. \u201cOf course,\u201d she says, her voice jumpy. \u201cThank you, Samantha.\u201d She clasps a napkin to her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere, there,\u201d says Eddie, patting her on the back.

The entire PR team from Carter Spink is standing on the doorstep, all in identical trouser suits.</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d Hilary Grant, head of PR, runs her eyes over me. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>By twelve o\u2019clock I\u2019m wearing a black suit, black tights, black high heels, and the crispest white shirt I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve been professionally made up and my hair has been scraped back into a bun.</p><p>Hilary brought the clothes and the hairdresser and makeup artist. Now we\u2019re in the drawing room while she preps me on what to say to the press. For the thousand millionth time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the most important thing to remember?\u201d she\u2019s demanding. \u201cAbove anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to mention loos,\u201d I say wearily. \u201cI promise, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they ask about recipes?\u201d She wheels round from where she\u2019s been striding up and down.</p><p>\u201cI answer, \u2018I\u2019m a lawyer. My only recipe is the recipe for success.\u2019 \u201d Somehow I manage to utter the words straight-faced.</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten how seriously the PR department takes all of this. But I suppose it\u2019s their job. And I suppose this whole business has been a bit of a nightmare for them. Hilary has been outwardly pleasant ever since she got here\u2014but I get the feeling there\u2019s a little wax doll of me on her desk, impaled by drawing pins.</p><p>\u201cWe just want to make sure you don\u2019t say anything else ... unfortunate.\u201d She gives me a slightly savage smile.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t! I\u2019ll stick to the script.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then the News Today team will follow you back to London.\u201d She consults her BlackBerry. \u201cWe\u2019ve given them access for the rest of the day. You\u2019re OK about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... yes. I suppose.\u201d</p><p>I cannot believe how big this whole thing has become. A news discussion program actually wants to do a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary section about my return to Carter Spink. Is there nothing else happening in the world?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at the camera.\u201d Hilary is still briskly issuing instructions. \u201cYou should be good-humored and positive. You can talk about the career opportunities Carter Spink has given you and how much you\u2019re looking forward to getting back. Don\u2019t mention your salary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance of a coffee round here?\u201d Guy\u2019s voice interrupts us and he comes in, wearing a pair of expensive shades. He takes them off and grins at me. \u201cMaybe you could rustle up some scones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d I say politely.</p><p>\u201cHilary, there\u2019s some trouble outside.\u201d Guy turns to her. \u201cSome TV guy kicking up a fuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Hilary looks at me. \u201cCan I leave you for a moment, Samantha?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I try not to sound too eager. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p><p>As she leaves I breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Guy raises his eyebrows. \u201cHow are you? Excited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I smile.</p><p>Actually I feel a little surreal, wearing a black suit again, surrounded by Carter Spink PR people.

You\u2019re going to blow them away.\u201d He perches on a sofa arm opposite me and sighs. \u201cJesus, I missed you, Samantha. It hasn\u2019t been the same.\u201d</p><p>Does he have any sense of irony? Or did they fix that at Harvard too?</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re my best friend again.\u201d I can\u2019t help a slight edge. \u201cFunny, that.\u201d</p><p>Guy blinks at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Guy.\u201d I almost want to laugh. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to know me when I was in trouble. Now suddenly we\u2019re chums again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfair,\u201d retorts Guy hotly. \u201cI did everything I could for you, Samantha. I fought for you in that meeting. It was Arnold who refused to have you back. At the time we had no idea why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let me in your house, though, would you?

His brown eyes are becoming more intense.</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d he says, not moving his gaze from mine. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt ...\u201d He thrusts his hands in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt we somehow ... missed our chance.\u201d</p><p>No. This can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>We missed our chance?</p><p>Now he says this?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always really admired you.

How many millions of times have I imagined Guy saying these words to me? But now that he\u2019s actually doing it ... it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s all wrong.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I realize I\u2019m staring at him like a zombie.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d I try to pull myself together. \u201cWell ... yes.

Since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gardener,\u201d says Guy without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I look up in surprise. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the journalists were talking about it outside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Well, it\u2019s true. His name\u2019s Nathaniel.\u201d I feel myself blush.</p><p>Guy frowns. \u201cBut that\u2019s just a holiday romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a holiday romance!\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cIt\u2019s a relationship. We\u2019re serious about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he moving to London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... no.

As I venture out the front door with Hilary and two PR managers, there are what looks like hundreds of people in the drive. A row of TV cameras is trained on me, photographers and journalists are in a crowd behind, and Carter Spink PR assistants are milling around, keeping everyone in line and handing out coffee from a refreshments stand that seems to have sprung up from nowhere. At the gate I can see a group of regulars from the pub peering in curiously, and I shoot them a mortified grin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a few more minutes,\u201d says Hilary, listening to her mobile. \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for the Daily Telegraph.\u201d</p><p>I can see David Elldridge and Greg Parker standing by the cappuccino machine, both typing on their BlackBerrys. The PR department wanted as many partners as possible, but none of the others could make it. Frankly, they were lucky to get this many. As I\u2019m watching, to my disbelief I see Melissa approaching them, dressed up smartly in a beige suit and holding ... is that a CV?</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I hear her begin. \u201cI\u2019m a very good friend of Samantha Sweeting, and she recommended I apply to Carter Spink.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling.

This is the right way for me, Iris. I\u2019m a lawyer. I always was. It\u2019s a great opportunity. I\u2019d be ...

I\u2019m going to visit as many weekends as I can....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, let me.\u201d She takes my tissue from me and dabs my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smile but I\u2019m still shaky. \u201cThis makeup has got to last all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Hilary calls me from the refreshment stand, where she\u2019s talking to David Elldridge and Greg Parker. \u201cCan you come over here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there!\u201d I call back.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, before you go ...\u201d Iris takes hold of both my hands, her face filled with concern. \u201cSweetie ... I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for you. But just remember, you only get your youth once.\u201d She looks at my hand, smooth against hers. \u201cYou only get these precious years once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She pats my hand. \u201cOff you go.\u201d</p><p>As I walk over to the refreshment stand, Nathaniel\u2019s hand is tightly in mine. We\u2019re going to have to say good-bye in a couple of hours.</p><p>No. I can\u2019t think about that.</p><p>Hilary is looking a little stressed as I approach.</p><p>\u201cGot your statement?\u201d she says. \u201cFeeling prepared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set.\u201d I take out the folded sheet of paper. \u201cHilary, this is Nathaniel.\u201d</p><p>Hilary\u2019s eyes run over him without interest. \u201cHello,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, Samantha, let\u2019s just run over the order again. You read your statement, then questions, then photos. We\u2019ll start in about three minutes. The team are just distributing press packs\u2014\u201d Suddenly she peers more closely at me. \u201cWhat happened to your makeup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... I was just saying good-bye to someone,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s not too bad, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to redo it.\u201d Her voice is jerky with annoyance. \u201cThis really is all I need.\u201d She strides away, calling to one of her assistants.</p><p>Three more minutes. Three minutes before my old life begins again.</p><p>\u201cSo ... I\u2019ll be back for Eamonn\u2019s party,\u201d I say, still clutching Nathaniel\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s only a few days away.

Five days in Hong Kong and then on to Singapore. You and I are going to be wooing some new clients.\u201d He takes a sip of coffee. \u201cYou need to start pulling in business, Samantha Sweeting, equity partner.

Up in Scotland; should be fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.

I thought I\u2019d have more control.</p><p>\u201cChristmas,\u201d echoes Nathaniel at last, looking thunderstruck.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say at once. \u201cHe\u2019s exaggerating.

Things might be busy\u2014but I\u2019ll do it somehow.

It feels like everything is disintegrating between us.</p> <p>\u201cNathaniel, just tell me.\u201d My voice trembles. \u201cTell me before I go. That day in the farmhouse\u2014what did you say to me?\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel looks at me for a long moment, then something in his eyes seems to close up.</p><p>\u201cIt was long and boring and badly put.\u201d He turns away with a half shrug.</p><p>\u201cPlease do something with those smudges!\u201d Hilary is saying. \u201cCould you please move?\u201d she adds sharply to Nathaniel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get out of your way.\u201d Nathaniel lets go of my hand and retreats before I can say anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in my way!\u201d I call after him, but I\u2019m not sure he hears.</p><p>As the makeup artist begins her work, my mind is spinning so fast I feel faint. Suddenly all my certainty has vanished. Am I doing the right thing?</p><p>Oh, God. What is wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cClose, please.\u201d The makeup artist is brushing at my eyelids. \u201cNow open ...\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes to see Nathaniel and Guy standing together, some way away. Guy\u2019s talking and Nathaniel is listening, his face taut. I feel a sudden stab of unease. What\u2019s Guy saying?</p><p>\u201cClose again,\u201d says the makeup artist. Reluctantly I close my eyes and feel her brushing yet more shadow on. For God\u2019s sake. Hasn\u2019t she finished? Does it matter what I look like?</p><p>At last she withdraws her brush. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes to see Guy standing in the same spot, a few yards away. But Nathaniel\u2019s vanished. Where\u2019s he gone?</p><p>\u201cPut your lips together ...\u201d the makeup artist instructs, producing a lipstick brush.</p><p>My eyes are darting in panic around the crowded drive, looking for Nathaniel. I need him. I need to talk to him before this press conference goes ahead.</p><p>\u201cReady for your big moment? Got your statement?\u201d Hilary is upon me again, smelling of freshly applied scent. \u201cThat looks a lot better!

I need more time to think....\u201d I trail off at Hilary\u2019s expression.</p> <p>She comes toward me and brings her face very close to mine. She\u2019s still smiling, but her eyes are snapping and her nostrils flared and white. I take a step back, quailing, but she grabs my shoulders so hard I can feel her nails digging into my flesh.</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d she hisses. \u201cYou will go out there, you will read your statement, and you will say Carter Spink is the best law firm in the world.

I\u2019m going to announce you.\u201d</p><p>She marches onto the lawn. I just stand there, shaking.</p> <p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the press!\u201d Hilary\u2019s voice is blaring through the microphone. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to welcome you all here this morning.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I spot Guy, helping himself to a mineral water. \u201cGuy!\u201d I call urgently. \u201cGuy! Where\u2019s Nathaniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d says Guy insouciantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to him? When you were talking just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to say much,\u201d Guy replies. \u201cHe could tell the way the wind was blowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I feel like I\u2019ve missed something. \u201cThe wind wasn\u2019t blowing any way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSamantha, don\u2019t be naive.\u201d Guy takes a swig of water. \u201cHe\u2019s a grown man. He understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201c... our newest partner at Carter Spink, Samantha Sweeting!\u201d Hilary\u2019s voice and the applause breaking out barely touch my consciousness.</p><p>\u201cUnderstands what?\u201d I say in horror. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha!\u201d Hilary interrupts with a sweetly savage smile. \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting! Lots of busy people!\u201d She grabs my hand with an iron grip and drags me with surprising force onto the grass. \u201cOff you go! Enjoy!\u201d She gives me a sharp dig in the back and walks away.</p><p>I\u2019m stranded in front of the nation\u2019s press.</p><p>\u201cMove it!\u201d Hilary\u2019s tense undertone makes me jump. I feel like I\u2019m on a conveyor belt. The only way is forward.</p><p>With wobbling legs I make my way into the middle of the lawn, where a microphone has been set up on a stand. The sun is glinting off all the camera lenses and I feel half blinded. I search the crowd as best I can for Nathaniel, but I can\u2019t spot him anywhere. Trish is standing a few yards away to my right, in a fuchsia pink suit, and waves frantically. Beside her, Eddie is holding a camcorder.</p><p>Slowly I unfold my statement and smooth it down.</p> <p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d I say into the microphone, my voice stilted. \u201cI am delighted to be able to share my exciting news with you. After being made a wonderful offer by Carter Spink, I will be returning to the firm today as a partner. Needless to say ...

And excellence.\u201d</p><p>A titter goes through the crowd of journalists.

Samantha, carry on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnspeakable, were they?\u201d shouts the ruddy-cheeked guy with a guffaw of laughter.</p><p>\u201cSamantha, carry on,\u201d spits Hilary, looking livid.</p><p>\u201cThey certainly were not unspeakable!\u201d Trish comes striding onto the lawn, her fuchsia heels sinking into the grass. \u201cI will not have my toilets maligned! They\u2019re all Royal Doulton. They\u2019re Royal Doulton,\u201d she repeats into the microphone. \u201cHighest quality.

I need to talk to him. Where is he? Guy!\u201d I suddenly spot Guy at the side of the lawn. \u201cWhere did he go? What did you say to him?\u201d I hurry toward him over the grass, almost tripping. \u201cYou have to tell me. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI advised him to keep his dignity.\u201d Guy gives an arrogant shrug. \u201cTo be honest, I told the guy the truth.

Is that why he left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Samantha, give it a rest,\u201d snaps Guy impatiently. \u201cHe\u2019s a gardener.\u201d</p><p>My fist acts before I can think.

How can he have given up on us? Whatever Guy said to him, whatever he thought. How can he have just left?</p> <p>We could have made it work. Didn\u2019t he know that? Didn\u2019t he feel it, deep down?</p><p>I hear a sound and look up to see Guy and a crowd of journalists gathered around me. I hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I say in a muffled voice. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d says Guy, his voice low and conciliatory. \u201cI know you\u2019re hurt. I\u2019m sorry if I upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hit you again.\u201d I wipe my eyes with the back of my hand. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings may seem bad at the moment.\u201d Guy glances at the note. \u201cBut you have a fantastic career to get on with.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. My shoulders are hunched over, my nose is running, and my hair is falling around my face in lacquered strands.</p><p>\u201cBe reasonable. You\u2019re not going back to cleaning loos. There\u2019s nothing to keep you here now.\u201d Guy takes a step forward and puts my glossy high-heeled shoes on the table beside me. \u201cCome on, partner. Everyone\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-six</p><p>I feel numb. It really is all over. I\u2019m sitting in a first-class compartment on the express train to London, with the other partners. In a couple of hours we\u2019ll be back. I have a new pair of tights on. My makeup has been repaired. I\u2019ve even given a fresh statement to the press, hastily constructed by Hilary: \u201cAlthough I will always feel affection for my friends in Lower Ebury, nothing is more exciting and important in my life right now than my career with Carter Spink.\u201d</p><p>I was pretty convincing. I even found a smile from somewhere as I shook David Elldridge\u2019s hand. It\u2019s just possible they might print a picture of that, rather than the one of me punching Guy. You never know.</p><p>As the train pulls out of the station I feel a painful stab and close my eyes for a moment, trying to stay composed. I\u2019m doing the right thing. Everyone\u2019s agreed. I take a sip of cappuccino, then another. If I drink enough coffee maybe it\u2019ll jolt me alive. Maybe I\u2019ll stop feeling as though I\u2019m in a dream.</p><p>Wedged in the corner opposite me is the TV cameraman for the news documentary, together with the producer, Dominic, a guy with trendy glasses and a denim jacket. I can feel the camera lens on me, following every move, zooming in and out, catching every expression. I could really do without this.</p><p>\u201cAnd so lawyer Samantha Sweeting leaves the village where she was known only as domestic help,\u201d Dominic is saying into his microphone in a low, TV-commentary voice. \u201cThe question is\u2014does she have any regrets?\u201d He gives me a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were supposed to be fly-on-the-wall,\u201d I snap with a baleful look.</p><p>\u201cHere you go!\u201d Guy dumps a heavy set of contracts on my lap. \u201cHere\u2019s the Samatron deal. Get your teeth into that.\u201d</p><p>I look at the piles of paper, inches thick. Once upon a time, seeing a brand-new, fresh contract gave me a rush of adrenaline. I always wanted to be first to spot an anomaly, first to raise a query. But now I feel blank. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everyone else in the carriage is working away.

Once I get back into the swing of it I\u2019ll start to enjoy it again, surely.</p><p>But the words are jumbling in front of my eyes. I can\u2019t concentrate. All I can think about is Nathaniel. I\u2019ve tried calling him but he isn\u2019t answering. Or replying to texts. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t want to know anymore.</p><p>How can everything be over? How can he have just left?</p><p>My eyes are starting to blur with tears again and I furiously blink them away. I can\u2019t cry. I\u2019m a partner. Partners do not cry. Trying to get a grip, I look out the window instead. We seem to be slowing down, which is a bit weird.</p> <p>\u201cAn announcement for all passengers.\u201d A voice suddenly comes crackling out of the loudspeakers. \u201cThis train has been rescheduled as a slow train. It will be stopping at Hitherton, Marston Bridge, Bridbury ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Guy looks up. \u201cA slow train?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d David Elldridge scowls. \u201cHow much longer will it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201c ... and will arrive at Paddington half an hour after the scheduled time,\u201d the voice is saying. \u201cApologies for any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour?\u201d David Elldridge whips out his mobile phone, looking livid. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to reschedule my meeting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to put off the Pattinson Lobb people.\u201d Guy looks equally pissed off, and is already jabbing at the speed-dial on his phone. \u201cHi Mary? Guy. Listen, total cock-up on this train. I\u2019m going to be half an hour late\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRearrange Derek Tomlinson\u2014\u201d David\u2019s instructing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to push back Pattinson Lobb, cancel that guy from The Lawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavina,\u201d Greg Parker is saying into his phone. \u201cFucking train\u2019s slow. Tell the rest of the team I\u2019ll be half an hour late, I\u2019m sending an e-mail\u2014\u201d He puts down his phone and immediately starts typing into his BlackBerry. A moment later Guy is doing the same.</p><p>I\u2019m watching all this frenzied action incredulously. They all look so stressed. So the train\u2019s going to be late. It\u2019s half an hour. It\u2019s thirty minutes. How can anyone get so het up over thirty minutes?</p><p>Is this what I\u2019m supposed to be like? Because I\u2019ve forgotten how. Maybe I\u2019ve forgotten how to be a lawyer altogether.</p> <p>The train pulls into Hitherton station and slowly comes to a halt. I glance out the window\u2014then gasp aloud. A huge hot-air balloon is hovering just a few feet above the station building. It\u2019s bright red and yellow, with people waving from a basket. It looks like something out of a fairy tale.</p><p>\u201cHey, look!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cLook at that!\u201d</p><p>No one moves their head. They\u2019re all frantically tapping at their keyboards.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d I try again. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing!\u201d There\u2019s still no response. No one is interested in anything except the contents of their BlackBerry. And now the balloon\u2019s soared away again. In a moment it\u2019ll be out of sight. They all missed it.</p><p>I look at them, the cream of the legal world, dressed in their thousand-pound handmade suits, holding state-of-the-art computers. Missing out. Not even caring that they\u2019re missing out. Living in their own world.</p><p>I don\u2019t belong here. This is not my world anymore. I\u2019m not one of them.</p><p>I suddenly know it, with the deepest certainty I\u2019ve ever felt. I don\u2019t fit; I don\u2019t relate. Maybe I did once, but not anymore. I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t spend my life in meeting rooms. I can\u2019t obsess about every little chunk of time. I can\u2019t miss out on any more.</p><p>As I sit there, the contracts still piled on my lap, I feel tension rising inside me. I\u2019ve made a mistake. I\u2019ve made a huge mistake. I shouldn\u2019t be here. This isn\u2019t what I want from my life. This isn\u2019t what I want to do. This isn\u2019t who I want to be.</p> <p>I have to get out. Now.</p><p>Up and down the train, people are stepping in and out, banging doors, hefting bags. As calmly as I can I reach for my suitcase, pick up my bag, and stand up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI made a mistake. I\u2019ve only just realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Guy looks up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve wasted your time.\u201d My voice wavers slightly. \u201cBut ... I can\u2019t stay. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He clutches his head. \u201cNot this again, Samantha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and talk me round,\u201d I cut across him. \u201cI\u2019ve decided. I can\u2019t be like the rest of you. It\u2019s just not right for me.

I don\u2019t want to be someone who doesn\u2019t look out the window.\u201d</p><p>Guy\u2019s face doesn\u2019t register an iota of understanding.

And you\u2019re a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, Guy!\u201d My words burst out in a surge of sudden anger. I pull my arm out of his and slam the door shut, shaking all over. The next moment it opens again and Dominic and the cameraman pile out after me.</p><p>\u201cAnd so!\u201d Dominic is murmuring excitedly into his microphone. \u201cIn a shocking turn of events, Samantha Sweeting has rejected her glittering legal career!\u201d</p><p>As the train pulls out of the station I can see Guy and the other partners on their feet staring out at me in consternation. I guess I\u2019ve ruined all my chances of a comeback now.</p><p>The other passengers start melting away from the platform, leaving me all alone. All alone on Hitherton station with only a suitcase for company. I don\u2019t even know where Hitherton is. The TV camera is still trained on me, and as people pass by they give me curious glances.</p> <p>What am I going to do now?</p><p>\u201cAs she gazes down onto the railway tracks, Samantha finds herself at a low ebb.\u201d Dominic\u2019s voice is low and sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I mutter back.</p><p>\u201cThis morning she was devastated to lose the man she loved. Now ... she has no career either.\u201d He pauses, then adds in sepulchral tones, \u201cWho knows what dark thoughts are going through her mind?\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s he trying to imply? That I\u2019m going to throw myself under the next train? He\u2019d love that, wouldn\u2019t he? He\u2019d probably win an Emmy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I lift my chin and clutch my suitcase more tightly. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fine. I\u2019ve ... I\u2019ve done the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>But as I look around the empty station I feel flurries of panic as I take in my situation properly. I have no idea when the next train will be. I have no idea where I want to go even.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a plan, Samantha?\u201d asks Dominic, thrusting his microphone at me. \u201cA goal?\u201d</p><p>Into my mind come Iris\u2019s words that day we made the bread.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t need a goal in life,\u201d I reply, lifting my chin. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know the big picture. You just need to know what you\u2019re going to do next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... I\u2019m ... working on it.\u201d I turn and march away from the camera, toward the waiting room. As I near it, I see a guard coming out.</p><p>\u201cUm, hello,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how to get to ...\u201d I trail off, uncertainly. Where am I going? \u201cTo ... um ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ...\u201d prompts the guard helpfully.</p> <p>\u201cTo ... Cornwall,\u201d I hear myself saying.</p><p>\u201cCornwall?\u201d He looks taken aback. \u201cWhereabouts in Cornwall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I swallow. \u201cNot exactly. But I need to get there as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>There can\u2019t be that many nurseries for sale in Cornwall. I\u2019ll track down the right one. I\u2019ll find him. Somehow.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d The guard\u2019s brow creases. \u201cI\u2019ll have to consult the book.\u201d He disappears into his room, then emerges, holding a piece of paper covered in pencil. \u201cSix changes, I\u2019m afraid, to Penzance. And it\u2019ll be one hundred and twenty pounds fare. Train\u2019ll be a while,\u201d he adds as I hand over a wodge of cash. \u201cPlatform two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I take my ticket, pick up my suitcase, and head over the footbridge.</p><p>I know this is a crazy plan. I don\u2019t have an address. I don\u2019t have any backup. Nathaniel may not even want to see me again.</p><p>But ... I have to try.</p><p>It seems like hours before I hear the sound of the train in the distance. But it\u2019s the wrong side. It\u2019s another train for London. As it pulls in I can hear the slam of doors and people disgorging on the other side.</p><p>\u201cLondon train!\u201d the guard is shouting. \u201cTrain for London, platform one.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the train I should be on. If I was sane. If I hadn\u2019t taken leave of my senses.

Am I dreaming?</p><p>It\u2019s Nathaniel. On the London train. He\u2019s three yards away, sitting in a window seat, staring ahead rigidly.</p><p>What\u2014Why is he\u2014</p><p>\u201cNathaniel!\u201d I try to shout, but my voice has turned into a croak. \u201cNathaniel!\u201d I wave my arms frantically, trying to get his attention.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, it\u2019s him!\u201d exclaims Dominic, who has followed me onto the platform. \u201cNathaniel!\u201d he yells, his voice like a foghorn. \u201cOver here, mate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathaniel!\u201d At last my voice is working. \u201cNa-than-iel!\u201d</p><p>At my desperate scream he finally looks up. For a moment his expression is sheer disbelief. Then his whole face seems to expand in a slow explosion of delight.</p><p>I can hear train doors slamming. It\u2019s about to leave.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d I yell, beckoning urgently.</p> <p>I can see him getting up inside the train, grabbing his rucksack, squeezing past the woman in the next seat. Then he disappears from view, just as the train starts pulling out of the station.</p><p>I can\u2019t move, or even breathe. All I can do is stare at the departing train, moving past carriage by carriage, speeding up, faster and faster ... until finally it\u2019s gone.</p><p>And Nathaniel is standing on the platform. He\u2019s there.</p><p>Without moving my eyes from his I begin to walk along the platform, speeding up as I reach the footbridge. On the opposite side he does the same. We reach the top of the steps, walk forward a way, and both come to a halt, a few feet apart. I feel shell-shocked and exhilarated and uncertain all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going down to Cornwall,\u201d I say at last. \u201cTo buy your nursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d Nathaniel looks pretty shell-shocked himself. \u201cThought I might ... visit a friend in London instead.\u201d He glances at my suitcase. \u201cWhere were you going?\u201d</p> <p>I clear my throat. \u201cI was thinking ... Cornwall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCornwall?\u201d He stares at me.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I show him my timetable, suddenly wanting to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all.</p><p>Nathaniel leans against the barricade, his thumbs in his pockets, and surveys the wooden slats of the bridge. \u201cSo ... where are your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. Gone. And they\u2019re not my friends. I hit Guy,\u201d I add proudly.</p><p>Nathaniel throws back his head and laughs. \u201cSo they fired you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fired them,\u201d I correct him.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d says Nathaniel in amazement. He reaches out for my hand but I don\u2019t take it. Underneath my joy I\u2019m still feeling unsettled. The hurt of this morning hasn\u2019t gone. I can\u2019t pretend everything\u2019s OK.</p> <p>\u201cI got your note.\u201d I lift my eyes to his and Nathaniel flinches.</p><p>\u201cSamantha ... I wrote you a different one on the train. In case you wouldn\u2019t see me in London.\u201d</p><p>He fishes awkwardly in his pocket and pulls out a letter several sheets long, both sides of the paper covered in writing. I hold it for a few moments without reading it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what does it say?\u201d I raise my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... long and boring.\u201d His gaze burns into mine. \u201cAnd badly put.\u201d</p><p>I turn the pages slowly over in my fingers. Here and there I glimpse words that make my eyes fill instantly.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s arms come round my waist; his warm mouth is on mine. As he holds me tight I can feel the tears spilling onto my cheeks. This is where I belong. This is where I fit. I finally draw away and look up at him, wiping my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere now?\u201d He looks down over the bridge and I follow his gaze. The railway track extends in both directions, far into the distance. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>I look along the endless line, squinting in the sunshine. I\u2019m twenty-nine years old. I can go anywhere. Do anything. Be anyone I like.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no rush,\u201d I say at last, and reach up to kiss him again. </p> </body></html>"]
