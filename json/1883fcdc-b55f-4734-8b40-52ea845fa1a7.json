I knew right where the gun was, of course, but pulling it straight out just seemed so ... obscene. The smell of dinner on the stove filled my nose. Chicken chili, with whole-grain corn bread in the oven for a side because it\u2019s healthier.</p><p>It\u2019d been baking for ten minutes already, which meant I had about twelve more minutes to end his life before the bread burned.</p><p>Reese sat out in the dining room, reading one of his motorcycle magazines and drinking his favorite beer while he waited for food. I\u2019d been sure to buy a half rack earlier, and I\u2019d met him at the door with a cold one open and ready to go. He was on his second now. I wasn\u2019t under any illusions\u2014two beers wouldn\u2019t be enough to slow him down if he came after me, or ease his pain if my aim was off.</p> <p>Still, a man deserves a beer before dying, right?</p><p>My fingers brushed the cold metal of the gun. I pulled out my phone instead and looked at Jessica\u2019s picture, studying her pretty, smiling face on graduation day. So full of hope and promise. She\u2019d raised her right arm to wave at the camera. Her pinkie curled forward, offering a glimpse of the sparkling tips on her new acrylics. She\u2019d wanted them for graduation so badly. They hadn\u2019t been in the budget, but I couldn\u2019t tell her no.</p><p>You have to understand\u2014none of us ever expected Jessica to graduate.</p><p>Hell, she shouldn\u2019t even be alive. My bitch of a cousin had done drugs all through both pregnancies, yet somehow Jessie pulled through. Not unscathed. She had the usual developmental quirks ... poor impulse control, bad judgment. Quick to anger. They came from fetal drug effects\u2014the gift that keeps on giving for a child\u2019s whole life. But at least she had a life. Her little sister died in the NICU two days after her birth. Never got a chance.</p><p>Fuck you, Amber. Fuck you very much for doing that to your kids.</p><p>I glanced up at the oven timer and realized I\u2019d wasted nearly three minutes thinking about Jess. I supposed I could kill him after pulling out the bread, but putting it off would just make things harder.</p> <p>Or maybe I should feed him first?</p><p>No. He\u2019d had his beer, but if I had to sit across from Reese over a meal I\u2019d never make it. I couldn\u2019t look into those blue eyes and laugh. I\u2019d never been a good liar. This past month had been heaven and hell rolled into one big bad joke.</p><p>Right. Time for the punch line.</p><p>I pulled out the small pistol and stuck it into the pocket of the loose sweater I\u2019d picked so carefully for just this moment. I also took out my keys, my ID, and my cash, stuffing them into my jeans. Just in case. I didn\u2019t really expect to survive the night, but it never hurts to hope. The van was even gassed up and ready to go, on the off chance that I managed to get away.</p><p>Of course, I had no idea where I\u2019d drive. Burn that bridge when you get to it ...</p><p>Things started going wrong as soon as I walked into the dining room. Reese wasn\u2019t sitting at the head of the table, where I\u2019d left him. Damn. I could\u2019ve shot him in the back without warning if he\u2019d just stayed put. Now he sat facing me, leaning casually in his chair, beer in hand. The magazine lay open before him and he looked up, offering me that mocking smile of his. God, I loved that smile, despite the fact that it could be cruel as all fuck.</p><p>\u201cSomething you want to talk about?\u201d he asked, cocking his head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured, wondering what he\u2019d say if I shared my thoughts. Gee, Reese, I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m about to kill you, but if it makes you feel any better I hate myself for doing it\u2014not a hundred percent sure I won\u2019t shoot myself next.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t, though. Not yet. Not until I saw Jessica for myself, made sure they\u2019d kept their promises and she was safe and sound. After that?</p><p>Well. We\u2019d just have to see.</p><p>He sighed, eyes flicking to my pocket, where my hand shifted nervously on the gun.</p><p>Paranoia hit yet again.</p><p>He knew. He knew all about it, I could see it in his face. Fuck. I\u2019d failed her ... Don\u2019t be ridiculous. How could he possibly know?</p><p>\u201cBabe, you look like you could use a day off,\u201d he said finally. \u201cHave you considered hitting the spa? Maybe get a massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat costs too much,\u201d I said automatically, biting back a hysterical laugh. Because money mattered now, right?</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting that you pay for it,\u201d he said, frowning at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, you\u2019re totally independent and you like it that way. Blah, blah. Just let me do something for you, for once. Fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Why did he have to be so nice?</p><p>I felt my eyes start to water and I looked away, forcing myself to detach again and focus. I needed to kill him, and I couldn\u2019t give him any warning. But he was facing me and all the way across the room, which was a bigger problem than it sounds. Pistols aren\u2019t exactly known for accuracy, and it\u2019s not like I had much in the way of experience.</p><p>I needed to get closer.</p><p>If I came up behind him, rubbed his shoulders ... That would be close enough. God, I was a shitty human being.</p><p>\u201cThe food won\u2019t be ready for another ten minutes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou look sort of tense. Want a neck rub?\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow as I circled the table.</p><p>\u201cI think you should stay back,\u201d he said slowly. I paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d hate to make it too easy for you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened. I offered a weak smile, because like I said\u2014I\u2019m a shit liar.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re planning to shoot me in the back of the head,\u201d he said quietly, and that\u2019s when I realized he wasn\u2019t relaxed at all. He might be leaning back casually, but every one of those solid muscles roping his body had drawn tight, poised to attack. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad idea. You shoot that close, you\u2019ll be all covered in blood spatter. Means you\u2019ll have to risk tracking more evidence out of the house or taking time to clean up. Either way, complicates things.\u201d</p><p>Well. At least it was all finally out in the open. Almost a relief. I pulled out the gun and held it up, using my left hand to brace my right as I carefully sighted on him. I expected him to explode up at me, to fight back. Instead he just sat, waiting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo ahead, do it,\u201d he said, a sad smile toying with the corners of his mouth. \u201cShow me what you\u2019re made of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know how much I wish this weren\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do it. Whatever it is, we can work through it. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed, then looked past me and jerked his chin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, babe,\u201d I heard a man say from behind. Huh. I guess it was. Fortunately, I had just enough time to pull the trigger before he hit me.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>EIGHTEEN DAYS EARLIER</p><p>LONDON</p> <p>My back was killing me.</p><p>It was nearly two in the morning, and I\u2019d just finished up the late-night cleaning shift at the pawn shop. I\u2019d been letting myself get soft the past couple of months. Too much time spent managing the business, not enough time scouring bathrooms, because I\u2019d forgotten just how much work scrubbing a toilet really is.</p><p>Well, scrubbing toilets, floors, dusting, vacuuming. London\u2019s Cleaning Service did it all, and while we might not be the cheapest crew in town, we were the best. I knew this because I turned down more accounts than I took these days. Thanks to my hard-earned reputation, finding new clients was easy. Workers? Not so much. Most people aren\u2019t fans of spending their nights wiping up after others, and even with my higher-than-average starting pay, people flaked on me.</p><p>Tonight, for example.</p><p>I\u2019d gotten a call from Anna\u2014one of my crew leads\u2014to say she had two no-shows. Because the life of a cleaning lady is nonstop glamour, that meant I got to spend my Friday evening scraping dried pee off the floor in a men\u2019s bathroom.</p><p>Charmed existence, I know.</p> <p>At least my aching back and I could crawl into bed soon.</p><p>I pulled up to the house and noticed a blue Honda Civic parked in front. Mellie\u2019s car\u2014my young cousin\u2019s best friend. She must be spending the night with Jessie, I realized. I bit back the surge of annoyance. On the one hand, I really preferred it when Jess cleared stuff like this with me ahead of time.</p><p>On the other, there were worse things than having the girl home on a Friday. Most of them were worse, actually. God, I loved her so much, but Jessica was impossible. I reminded myself yet again that it wasn\u2019t entirely her fault\u2014the counselors told me over and over that I needed to help her learn to cope with her limitations, because it\u2019s not like she\u2019d grow out of them.</p><p>Decision making wasn\u2019t Jessica\u2019s strong suit.</p><p>According to the experts, that part of her brain just hadn\u2019t developed quite right, thanks to her mother\u2019s ongoing chemical romance. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about that. I knew she wasn\u2019t like other kids. But you know what? We all have to learn to get along in this world. Nobody\u2019s born with a clean slate, and she wasn\u2019t a little girl anymore.</p><p>I unlocked the front door to find Mellie sitting on the couch. Her knees were drawn up, her eyes were huge, and she clutched a can of Diet Coke like a shield.</p><p>My parent radar crackled to life.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were at a party,\u201d Mel whispered. \u201cIt was around ten o\u2019clock. She ran into some girls who graduated a couple years ago\u2014Terry Fratelli and her friends\u2014and they invited us out to the Armory for a party with the Reapers motorcycle club.\u201d</p><p>I swayed, grabbing the back of my old, green wing-backed chair to catch myself.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Mellie\u2019s eyes got even wider. I didn\u2019t cuss. She knew I didn\u2019t cuss. Ever.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d</p><p>The girl looked away, biting her lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for leaving her,\u201d she said, guilt written all over her face. \u201cBut there was no way I\u2019d go out there and she didn\u2019t listen to me. She actually got kind of ...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off and I filled in the gaps. Jessica liked to make fun of Mel when she wouldn\u2019t follow along like a well-trained puppy. Classic Jess. Such an idiot child\u2014I wasn\u2019t quite sure how she managed to keep a friend like Melanie around, given the shit she pulled.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, she promised me she\u2019d text, and I told her I wouldn\u2019t say anything as long as she stayed in touch. But she stopped texting me around midnight and I could tell she was really drunk. Her messages weren\u2019t even making sense. I\u2019m really scared for her, London.\u201d</p><p>This last was said with a sniffle, and I realized the poor girl was terrified. I came over and sat down next to her, giving her a hug. Mel spent so much time over here that she felt like my own sometimes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gonna be so pissed I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing, baby,\u201d I said, running a hand across her hair. \u201cShe\u2019s being a selfish brat, putting you into this position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, on the bright side she\u2019ll forgive me,\u201d Mel muttered. She sniffed and pulled back, looking up at me with a wavering smile. \u201cShe always does.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back, but my thoughts were grim. Mel was too nice. Sometimes I wished she\u2019d ditch Jessie and find a new best friend. Then I felt guilty, because even with her issues, Jess was my heart.</p><p>\u201cI need to go find her,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you want to stay here or head home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I could sleep here tonight?\u201d she asked. I nodded, already knowing the rest of the story. Friday nights at Mel\u2019s house weren\u2019t pretty, especially on paydays. Her dad liked to celebrate the end of the week a little too much.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>I tried calling Bolt Harrison from my van so Mellie wouldn\u2019t hear me. He managed Pawns, the same store I\u2019d been cleaning that night. It happened to be owned by the Reapers MC. Bolt was their vice president.</p><p>I\u2019d had the cleaning contract there for about six months now. They were becoming one of my most valuable accounts and had dropped hints about offering a second contract for The Line, their strip club. We\u2019d already come in a few times when they needed extra help, and I had high hopes it would grow into something bigger. I originally ran the Pawns crew myself, but two months ago I\u2019d turned it over to Jason, an older guy who\u2019d been with me for almost five years. He was reliable, worked hard, and did a great job managing the people under him.</p><p>The MC paid well, and they paid in cash, which was convenient. In return, we kept our mouths shut about anything we might see, which honestly wasn\u2019t as much as you\u2019d think. I thought there might be some prostitution happening in the back rooms out at The Line, but I\u2019d never seen any sign of women being forced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not my job to tell consenting adults what to do with their bodies.</p><p>Even so, I made sure that none of the younger girls ever came out with me. Just because I didn\u2019t call the cops doesn\u2019t mean I wanted my people getting sucked into anything.</p><p>Anyway, I figured Bolt was the first place to start if I wanted to extract Jess from whatever trouble she\u2019d gotten herself into this time. I liked Bolt and felt relatively comfortable around him\u2014and he was my only choice, really. My other contact was Reese Hayes, the club\u2019s president. That man scared the heck out of me and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it. Something about him ... The way his eyes followed me. Like he wanted to eat me, and not in a nice flowers and candlelit dinner kind of way. A hint of gray at his temples said he was probably just a little older than me, but his body was built like a man in his twenties. I don\u2019t know what bothered me more, his inherent scariness or the fact that his scariness sort of secretly turned me on. (Pathetic, I know.)</p><p>There was no way on earth I\u2019d talk to him if I didn\u2019t have to.</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Bolt answered. I heard music in the background, loud music.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Harrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any point in telling you to call me Bolt?\u201d</p><p>I would\u2019ve smiled if I hadn\u2019t been so stressed\u2014we\u2019d been dancing this same dance since I\u2019d started. None of the club members understood why I insisted on being so formal, but I had my reasons. Just because the MC paid well wasn\u2019t any reason to cozy up to them. I liked my boundaries.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I said, my voice betraying my worry.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked, picking up on my tone. That was Bolt\u2014he saw and heard everything, whether you wanted him to or not.</p><p>\u201cI have a personal problem I\u2019m hoping you can help me with.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I\u2019d probably startled him. I\u2019d never come asking for help before. In fact, I rarely saw him these days. The first few months he\u2019d watched us like hawks, but lately we\u2019d started to blend into the background. Nobody pays attention to the cleaners, something I\u2019ve always found fascinating. You wouldn\u2019t believe the things I\u2019ve seen or the secrets I hold.</p><p>Of course, that might be why I found Reese so unsettling\u2014six months into the job and I still hadn\u2019t disappeared yet.</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know this, but I\u2019m my cousin\u2019s guardian,\u201d I said, pushing forward. \u201cOne of her friends just told me that she went to a party out at your clubhouse tonight. I\u2019m worried about her\u2014she\u2019s a great kid, but not the best at making good decisions. Is there any chance you can help me track her down?\u201d</p> <p>More silence, and I cringed. I\u2019d insulted him, I realized. Implied things about the parties at his clubhouse that we all knew were true but nobody liked to talk about or admit. That they weren\u2019t safe for young women. That the club couldn\u2019t be trusted.</p><p>\u201cIs she an adult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s eighteen, but she just graduated two weeks ago and she\u2019s young for her age.\u201d</p><p>Bolt snorted.</p><p>\u201cHate to tell you this, sweetheart, but she\u2019s old enough to make her own decisions about where to party.\u201d</p><p>Now it was my turn to fall silent. I could say plenty\u2014that she might be old enough to party, but she wasn\u2019t old enough to drink legally. That they could find themselves in a heap of trouble for providing her with booze. Of course, for all I knew the cops were out there partying with them ... But I kept my mouth shut, because I\u2019d learned a long time ago that if you give someone enough silence, eventually they\u2019ll fill it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI get where you\u2019re coming from. I\u2019m not out there tonight, but Pic is.\u201d</p><p>Darn. \u201cPic\u201d was short for \u201cPicnic,\u201d and that was Reese\u2019s nickname. I had no idea why they called him that and I sure as heck hadn\u2019t asked. He was the least picnicky person I\u2019d ever met in my life.</p> <p>\u201cGo out to the Armory and ask for him. Tell him I sent you, tell him it\u2019s a personal favor. Maybe he\u2019ll track her down for you, maybe not. Like I said, the girl\u2019s an adult. You know how to get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Everyone in Coeur d\u2019Alene knew where the Armory was.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Harrison,\u201d I said quickly, hanging up before he could change his mind. Then I turned the keys in the ignition and my van roared to life, along with the check engine light that had been haunting me for the last week. I chose to ignore it, because even if I had someone look at it for me, I couldn\u2019t afford to fix the stupid thing.</p><p>If it could still drive places, it wasn\u2019t really broken. At least, that was the theory.</p><p>I shifted into reverse and backed out of the driveway. Oh, Jessie was going to hate this. Auntie London riding to the rescue in a minivan with the cleaning service logo on the side.</p><p>Ha. Not like it was the first time.</p><p>The Reapers clubhouse was about ten miles northeast of Coeur d\u2019Alene, back on a private road twisting through the heavily forested hills. I\u2019d never been there, although they\u2019d invited me to a couple of parties when I first started cleaning Pawns.</p><p>I\u2019d politely refused, preferring to maintain my wall of privacy. I\u2019d cut back on socializing after my ex-husband, Joe, left. Not that I blamed him for ending it\u2014he\u2019d been clear from the start that he didn\u2019t want kids in the house. When Amber OD\u2019d and nearly died six years ago it came down to him or Jessie, because I couldn\u2019t stand the situation any longer. The choice had been clear and the divorce had been amicable enough.</p><p>Still, I\u2019d needed to lick my wounds for a while. Between building my business and raising my cousin, I hadn\u2019t even tried dating until I met Nate a few months back. On nights like this, I wondered if those years alone had been worth it. It wasn\u2019t that Jess was bad. It\u2019s just that she never quite figured out the whole cause-and-effect thing, and probably never would.</p><p>By the time I pulled up to the Armory it was nearly three in the morning. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d expected from the Reapers clubhouse. I knew it was an old National Guard building, but somehow that hadn\u2019t translated into \u201cfort\u201d in my head. But that\u2019s essentially what this was. Big, solid building, at least three stories tall. Narrow windows, parapets on the roof. There was a gate through a side wall leading to what looked like a courtyard behind the building.</p><p>Directly in front of the building was a line of bikes, watched over by a couple of younger men wearing the signature leather vests I\u2019d seen around town over the years. Off to the right was a gravel parking lot with a good number of cars in it. I pulled into the end of the line and turned off the ignition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It occurred to me that I\u2019d be crashing a party right after cleaning for six hours. Great. I probably looked like an escapee from an insane asylum. I flipped down my mirror\u2014sure enough, my blonde hair was ratty and my makeup had long since disappeared. Oh well ... Wouldn\u2019t be the first time chasing down Jess had dragged me out when I needed a shower and bed.</p><p>Although she\u2019d never dragged me anywhere quite as intimidating at this place.</p><p>I got out of the car and started toward the main door. One of the men walked across the gravel to meet me. I looked him over, feeling old. He had to be twenty at the most, and the scraggly beard he wore with obvious pride had hardly filled in. He wasn\u2019t muscular like his friend manning the door, but all wiry and pointing bones.</p><p>\u201cYou here for the party?\u201d he asked, studying me skeptically. I couldn\u2019t blame him\u2014my ratty jeans might not stand out too much, but my tank top had seen better days and the bandanna holding back my hair was stained with sweat. I probably had dirt streaks on my face, too. The light in the car had been so poor they wouldn\u2019t have shown up.</p> <p>Oh, and did I mention the feeling-old part? At thirty-eight, I was pretty sure I could\u2019ve been this kid\u2019s mom.</p><p>I decided I didn\u2019t like him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here to speak with Mr. Hayes,\u201d I said politely. \u201cMr. Harrison suggested I come here to see him.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me blankly.</p><p>\u201cI got no idea who you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about,\u201d he said finally. The oversized infant masquerading as an adult turned and hollered at his friend. \u201cBB, you got any idea who \u2018Mr. Hayes\u2019 is?\u201d</p> <p>BB lumbered over toward us like a bear, dark hair hanging down his back in a braid. He seemed to be older than this one, but not much. I sighed. Good lord, they were just babies. Dangerous babies, I reminded myself, eyeing the chains hanging from their pants and the bulky rings decorating their hands.</p><p>Those were essentially brass knuckles.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Picnic, dumbfuck,\u201d BB said, looking at me critically. \u201cWhy you callin\u2019 him Mr. Hayes? You got papers to serve? He\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I wished it were something that simple.</p><p>\u201cI call him that because I work for him,\u201d I said, keeping my voice matter-of-fact and composed. \u201cI own London\u2019s Cleaning Service\u2014several of your businesses are our accounts. Mr. Harrison sent me out here to find Mr. Hayes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBolt sent her,\u201d BB told the little one. He nodded at me. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you in. See if we can find him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and steeled myself to follow. I\u2019d heard so many stories about this place that I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. If you believed the rumors, the Armory was a combination whore-house/underground fighting pit, with piles of stolen goods packing every room to the ceiling. Fifty percent pirate cave, fifty percent drug den, one hundred percent dangerous.</p><p>BB opened the door and I followed him in, getting my first good look at the clubhouse.</p><p>Well.</p><p>The rumors were certainly wrong about the stolen goods. I\u2019d like to think if they furnished the place with stuff they\u2019d taken, they would\u2019ve picked out things that were a little nicer than what I saw before me.</p><p>The room was large, and from the central location of the door it seemed to span the entire front half of the building. On the far right was a bar. Ancient couches and cast-off chairs lined the walls, and several battered, mismatched tables filled the center. To the left was a pool table, darts, and a jukebox that was either forty years old or a damned good replica. The place wasn\u2019t dirty ... just very well worn.</p><p>It\u2019s funny, but looking around, my very first thought was that I was overdressed\u2014and by overdressed, I meant there was literally too much fabric covering my body.</p><p>Wayyy too much.</p> <p>The women ranged from full-on naked to dressed casually in tight jeans and low-cut tank tops. I stuck out like a ... well, like a cleaning lady at a biker party. Half the guys had women on their laps, partially clothed and otherwise, and off in the corner I was pretty sure was a couple having full-on sex.</p><p>I snuck another quick look out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>Make that definitely having sex. Disgusting ... yet strangely mesmerizing ... I had to force myself to look away, hoping to hell I wasn\u2019t blushing like a little girl.</p><p>You\u2019re thirty-eight and you know where babies come from, I reminded myself firmly. Just because you\u2019re not getting any doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>People started to notice me\u2014big guys covered in tattoos, wearing leather vests with the Reaper colors on them. Their gazes ranged from curious to outright suspicious. Shit. This was a mistake. So Bolt sent me out there. That didn\u2019t mean it was safe, or a good idea. Bolt wasn\u2019t my friend. Sure, he probably valued me as a worker, but the club valued their strippers, too. Certainly didn\u2019t stop them from firing their asses right and left when their personal drama got out of hand.</p><p>Snap out of it.</p><p>I took another deep breath and smiled brightly at BB. He\u2019d been watching me expectantly, almost like he thought I\u2019d run away or something. I\u2019m no wimp, though. I might choose not to cuss, but I know what the words mean.</p><p>I looked up to see a tall man with shoulder-length, wavy hair and so much scruff on his face he\u2019d entered beard territory. He wore another of those vests. The name on his was \u201cGage,\u201d and below it was a smaller patch that said \u201cSgt at Arms.\u201d I\u2019d never seen him at the shop, but that wasn\u2019t saying much\u2014we came in after hours for a reason.</p><p>\u201cSays she\u2019s here to see Pic,\u201d BB said. \u201cBolt sent her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d he asked, eyes speculative. He swept them down my figure and I forced myself to smile at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for my cousin\u2019s daughter,\u201d I said. \u201cShe came out here for the party with some friends, apparently. Mr. Harrison suggested that Mr. Hayes might be able to help me.\u201d</p><p>The man smirked.</p><p>\u201cDid he? Imagine that.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how to interpret his words, so I chose to take them at face value, forcing myself to wait for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cBack outside, BB,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019ve got her from here. You\u2019re the cleaner, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at my filthy clothing.</p><p>\u201cHow could you tell?\u201d I asked, my tone dry. He laughed, and I felt some of my tension break.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gage,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find Pic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate to bother him,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI mean, if he\u2019s busy right now. I see you\u2019re one of the club officers. Maybe you can help me?\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cBolt sent you to talk to Picnic, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wondering if I\u2019d made a mistake. Well played, London. Alienate the one guy who stepped up to help you.</p> <p>\u201cThen you should talk to Picnic.\u201d</p><p>I offered another smile, wondering if he could see how close my face was to cracking from the effort. He turned and I followed him across the room, avoiding catching anyone\u2019s eyes. Some seemed interested in me, but most were too busy drinking, talking, and doing more intimate things to pay attention to one grubby woman. In the center of the back wall was an open hallway leading farther into the building. He passed through it and I followed, growing even more nervous. Walking into the building had been bad enough, but somehow this felt worse. Like I\u2019d hit the point of no return.</p><p>Certainly the point of no witnesses.</p><p>A door opened up ahead and two girls stumbled out, giggling. Jessica? No, but I recognized one.</p><p>\u201cKimberly Jordan, does your mother know where you are right now?\u201d I asked, my voice cracking like a whip.</p> <p>Everyone in the hallway froze, including Gage.</p><p>Kim stared at me, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d she said. She peered around me, as if wondering if her mother might jump out at her next. Good. Maybe that would make her think.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna talk to the prez or not?\u201d Gage asked, his voice cool. \u201cPick your battles, babe. You want this one or your cousin\u2019s kid?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, realizing that the Parental Voice of Authority might not be so welcome here. Oops.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for Jessica,\u201d I told him. He smiled at me, his teeth bright and shiny in the dim light.</p> <p>\u201cGreat, so let\u2019s leave them alone, all right? Girls, get out of here.\u201d</p><p>They brushed past us quickly, whispering with thrilled and excited eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you always have underage girls out here drinking?\u201d I asked him, unable to just let it go completely.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not serving anyone underage,\u201d he said flatly. I raised a brow, wordlessly calling him on his bullshit. He grinned. \u201cYou wanna look me in the eye and tell me you never had a drink until after you were twenty-one?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. Of course I had. Not only that, I\u2019d had lots of them and I hadn\u2019t turned into an alcoholic or gotten pregnant or anything horrible.</p><p>Nancy Reagan had been wrong\u2014at least in my case. Amber probably should\u2019ve just said no.</p><p>\u201cCan we just get on with it?\u201d</p><p>Gage shook his head, not even bothering to hide his amusement, then stepped forward and knocked on the unmarked door to our left.</p> <p>\u201cPic? You busy?\u201d</p><p>REESE</p><p>I sat on my office couch, wondering why the hell I didn\u2019t give a shit that a beautiful girl was currently sucking my cock. Sure, I enjoy a good blow job as much as the next guy. But tonight I wasn\u2019t engaged, just couldn\u2019t bring myself to care. This was unfortunate, because the babe kneeling between my legs had a mouth like a Hoover and a very loose sense of morals. She was the new headliner over at The Line\u2014the boys had brought her out tonight just for me.</p><p>Birthday present.</p><p>Forty-three fucking years old.</p><p>Her fingers dropped low, running under my balls with a light touch as her tongue swirled around my dickhead. I reached over and grabbed my beer, taking a long, slow pull. The cold liquid slid down my throat and I decided I didn\u2019t give a fuck if she finished or not.</p><p>I want you happy, baby, but you can do better ... Heather seemed to whisper in my ear.</p><p>I\u2019d been hearing her voice since the day she died. Christ, I missed that woman, and I wished to hell those little whispers were more than my own sick subconscious. But I knew they weren\u2019t, because if Heather\u2019s spirit was really beside me offering advice, I wouldn\u2019t have fucked up so bad with my daughters.</p><p>I glanced across the room to the black metal filing cabinet. A picture sat on top of it, in a tarnished silver frame. My old lady. The shot was from one of the last family parties we\u2019d had\u2014right after she recovered from the mastectomy, but before that final round of chemo. Her arms wrapped tight around our two beautiful girls, all three of them laughing at something just out of the frame.</p><p>Hoover chose that moment to suck me in deep down into her throat and I closed my eyes. Damn, Bolt had told me she sucked cock like a pro, but he hadn\u2019t given her full credit. The woman had a gift. Every inch squeezed tight and I wasn\u2019t small. I groaned, letting my head fall back.</p><p>Why did it still feel like I was cheating on Heather?</p><p>Hoover popped back up, giggling at me annoyingly. I opened my mouth to tell her to shut up, but she sucked me back in before I had the chance. Shit, that was good. My boredom disappeared, leaving the clarity I only got during sex or a good fight. My body felt incredible, but my mind floated, blessedly detached. No guilt over Heather, no worry about the club, not even thoughts of my girls could touch me here.</p><p>I was like a machine, powerful and free.</p><p>My phone buzzed next to me on the couch and I glanced down to see a text.</p><p>BOLT: Enjoying your party? I sent you another present. Try not to break it.</p><p>I glanced down at the brown-haired head bobbing in my lap and decided that my life might not be perfect, but damned if my friends didn\u2019t take care of me. If there was a God in heaven, I was about to meet this bitch\u2019s twin sister.</p><p>A loud knock came from the door.</p><p>\u201cPic? You busy?\u201d Gage called. \u201cYou got company. Bolt sent her.\u201d</p><p>Reaching down, I caught the stripper\u2019s hair and gripped it, slowing her down.</p><p>\u201cSend her in.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and a short, curvy blonde dressed in a dirty T-shirt and ragged jeans stumbled into the room, her eyes going wide as she took in the scene. Generous tits filled out the design on the front of her shirt, which read \u201cLondon\u2019s Cleaning Service.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. FUCK.</p><p>That cocksucking bastard. Bolt was gonna pay for this, because London Armstrong was the last woman who should be in this building. This bitch and her gorgeous rack had been making my life a living hell for the past six months, because she was the last thing I needed in my life and I\u2019d never wanted to fuck anyone more.</p><p>Not even Heather.</p><p>And that was a problem.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter how nice London\u2019s tits would look squeezing my dick until I came all over that pretty face of hers. She was too nice, too clean, and way the fuck too grown up. Ms. Armstrong was a regular citizen walking the straight and narrow, and she had no place in my world. She\u2019d run off screaming in the darkness if I cut loose with her ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To make things worse, I sort of liked her as a person, too.</p><p>Hoover made a sudden choking noise, and I realized I\u2019d trapped her head, cutting off her air. I let her go and she jerked back, looking up at me in confusion as she panted, mouth red and wet. I patted her head, reassuring her.</p><p>Like a dog. Christ.</p><p>What the hell was Bolt thinking, sending London here? I sucked in a deep breath, because the woman\u2014who was staring at me across my office as if I was an ax murderer\u2014looked like she was about to turn and run for the hills.</p> <p>I wanted to chase her when she did it ... run her down, rip off her jeans, and shove deep inside while she screamed at me. Yeah, nothin\u2019 wrong with that scenario.</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>Six months I\u2019d jerked off picturing her boobs, but I\u2019d done the right thing and left her alone. Not my fault she walked into my damned office and not my responsibility to save her now that she\u2019d come here. Clarity washed through me again and I decided there was only one way to end this.</p><p>I offered her a predatory smile and raised a hand, waving her toward the couch.</p><p>Happy birthday to me.</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>LONDON</p><p>I\u2019d never considered myself a prude.</p><p>I was wrong. I was definitely a prude, because I had nowhere in my head to put what I saw when I walked through that door. I don\u2019t know why it was so shocking. It wasn\u2019t like I hadn\u2019t seen people going at it publicly in the other room, and of course a private office like this would be perfect for a quick blow job ... But when Reese Hayes yelled that he was busy, I\u2019d expected him to be busy with some sort of nefarious, biker gang\u2013related activity.</p><p>You know, laundering money or something.</p><p>Then he smiled at me, the kind of smile a shark gives a castaway right before it rips her leg off. He raised his hand, beckoning me toward the couch.</p> <p>I stared at him (oh my God he\u2019s got a woman\u2019s head in his lap!) feeling something like panic, and opened my mouth to say I could come back later. Then it hit me\u2014no, I couldn\u2019t come back later. I needed to find Jess and I needed to find her right now before she started wreaking havoc. And as much as I wanted to judge the club members for leading her astray, I knew darned well she could find trouble all on her own. If anything, taking her out of here would be an act of mercy.</p><p>They had no idea what kind of destruction she was capable of.</p><p>You can do this.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Hayes,\u201d I said briskly, deciding a businesslike tone was the best way to set myself apart from his other ... friend. Nope. I was a woman with a purpose and I didn\u2019t have time for fooling around.</p><p>Still, it took everything I had not to look at his lap, see if I could catch a glimpse of his endowments. This would be so much easier if I hadn\u2019t spent at least two or three sessions with my vibrator picturing a scenario just like this one, but with me playing the staring role. Pull it together, Armstrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m London Armstrong and I run the cleaning service that works for your club.\u201d</p><p>I stepped into the office but didn\u2019t go so far as to walk over and offer my hand for him to shake.</p><p>There\u2019s only so much a woman can handle at once.</p> <p>Hayes gave me the same look he always gave me. Calculating. Hungry with just a hint of speculation as his eyes swept down my body. He lingered a bit on my breasts, but didn\u2019t make a show of it. Nope. He was all business, except for the uncomfortable fact that a woman was actively giving him a blow job. I swallowed, feeling my cheeks flush.</p><p>His eyes flickered back up to mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d he asked, his voice low and gravelly. Sexy. I shivered, because I could think of all kinds of things I\u2019d like him to do for me. Maybe even to me, although I hated to admit it. It\u2019d been a long six years, and I hadn\u2019t slept with Nate yet ... We\u2019d been dating for nearly two months, but between our schedules we didn\u2019t get to see each other all that often. Hell of a dry spell.</p><p>I forced myself to consider Hayes\u2019s question seriously, despite the squelching, squishy noises coming from his lap. How did that woman keep sucking on him like that, oblivious to what was going on? It was very distracting.</p><p>\u201cYou needed something, sweetheart?\u201d Hayes asked again, taking a swig of his beer. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to join in, fine, but otherwise come sit down and tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>Join in?</p><p>My cheeks radiated heat and I knew I was lost. I\u2019d done so well staying matter-of-fact up to this point, but there are limits. Just get it over with! Then you can go home and have a very large glass of wine.</p><p>I\u2019d need a bucket to hold all the wine I\u2019d be drinking tonight, I decided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for my cousin\u2019s daughter. She lives with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d he told me again. Gage gave a laughing snort behind me, shutting the door on us. I glanced down at the couch, an old plaid monstrosity that had to be twenty years old. With my luck, I\u2019d catch a disease from it.</p><p>\u201cI can stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit. Down.\u201d</p><p>His voice snapped, and I felt myself tremble. Reese Hayes was a scary man. He\u2019d been playing nice so far, but I was all too aware of the rumors surrounding him. Nate was a sheriff\u2019s deputy, and he was full of stories about the Reapers, particularly their president. I\u2019d blown him off, because the MC were good clients and I figured he was just prejudiced against them. No criminal gang could just exist in the middle of the community so openly, could it? Looking at Hayes now, I realized those stories might have been true after all.</p><p>His eyes were like cold chips of blue ice, and the hint of gray at his temples and in the scruff covering his chin gave him an air of authority that I wanted to obey almost instinctively. His arms were thick, banded with heavy muscles, and his thighs ... I glanced away quickly, because those thick thighs of his framed the half-naked woman sucking his penis perfectly. Like I\u2019d walked into a particularly high-definition porn shoot.</p><p>I wanted to die.</p><p>Under the best of circumstances this man made me uncomfortable, and I\u2019d done my best to avoid him. So far I\u2019d done a pretty good job, too\u2014wasn\u2019t like he hung around Pawns in the evenings when my crew came in. Well, sometimes he did, but he stayed back in the office.</p><p>Maybe that was where he did his money laundering?</p><p>Feeling just a smidge hysterical, I wondered exactly how one would go about washing money. I flashed briefly on a vision of Hayes working an old-fashioned, crank-handled washing machine while a group of aproned bikers carefully hung hundred-dollar bills on clotheslines in a sunny meadow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBabe?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, trying to remember why the hell I\u2019d thought this could be a good idea.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna sit down or not?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really uncomfortable with\u201d\u2014I gestured toward the woman\u2014\u201cthis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly my problem,\u201d he said, dropping a hand to rest on her head. \u201cBut if it\u2019s an issue, you can take her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said quickly.</p><p>\u201cThen sit the fuck down and tell me why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>His voice tightened, and I realized he was running out of patience. Fair enough\u2014he obviously had other things on his ... ahem ... mind. I carefully perched on the edge of the couch, facing the door. This was actually better, I realized. I didn\u2019t have to look at him now. Although I could feel the woman\u2019s movements through the furniture frame and that was very creepy.</p> <p>\u201cMy cousin\u2019s daughter is somewhere at this party,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cHer name is Jessica, and she has very poor judgment. I\u2019d really like to get her out of here and home before she does something completely stupid.\u201d</p><p>Like set the building on fire.</p><p>\u201cYou got shit timing.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond, because what the hell would I say? So far as I knew, Hallmark didn\u2019t make a \u201cSorry I Interrupted Your Oral Sex\u201d card.</p><p>Maybe I should write their corporate office to suggest it?</p><p>Hayes grunted, and the movement of the couch stopped.</p> <p>\u201cGo find Gage,\u201d he muttered to the woman, who pulled free with a smacking noise I really, really didn\u2019t need to hear. A second later she stood and wiped her mouth, glaring at me. I shrugged, offering a faintly apologetic smile. The couch trembled again as Hayes shifted, and for one horrible minute I thought he was actually going to grab me and push me down into her place. Then I heard the sound of a zipper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>I turned to look at him. He\u2019d swiveled to face me, propping one booted ankle over his knee and stretching his arm out along the backrest. It was way too close for comfort. If I leaned over I\u2019d be able to touch him. There was nothing on his face to indicate I\u2019d just ruined his happy ending. No emotion at all.</p><p>Nada. Yikes!</p><p>\u201cTell me about her,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is this a problem?\u201d</p><p>Now there was a loaded question ...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a problem because she\u2019s young and stupid,\u201d I said, feeling fatalistic. \u201cShe\u2019s self-destructive and does idiotic things, and if I let her run loose out here, something bad will happen, trust me.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s our fault?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou afraid we\u2019re gonna corrupt her?\u201d</p><p>I snorted, biting back an edgy laugh and shaking my head. God, if only ...</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied. \u201cOkay, yes. Probably. But the danger goes both ways. Jessica is\u2014\u201d</p><p>I paused, unsure how much family business I wanted to share with him. As little as possible, I decided.</p><p>\u201cJessie has a lot of issues. She makes bad decisions and drags other people into them. For example, she got her best friend arrested for shoplifting, even though the poor kid had no idea what was going on. I know you have no reason to do this, but would you please consider helping me find her so I can take her home?\u201d</p><p>He watched me, eyes trailing over my face. I wished he\u2019d show some sort of emotion. Anything. I couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking, and that freaked me out.</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d he asked thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cEighteen. Just graduated from high school. But believe me, she\u2019s not an adult.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to do what you say,\u201d he said. \u201cLotta kids that age live on their own already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to do what I say if she\u2019s going to be in my home,\u201d I replied carefully. \u201cAnd she\u2019s definitely not taking any steps to support herself just yet, so I\u2019m guessing my place is it for now. I\u2019d just as soon not be responsible for a newborn, too, but knowing my luck, she\u2019s actively getting pregnant even as we speak. Nobody needs that.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly, some unfathomable emotion in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t control this,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have daughters. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you at all,\u201d I said, which wasn\u2019t entirely true. I could still remember the first time I saw him, because he was beautiful and if I weren\u2019t a mature, sensible woman I\u2019d have said I had a crush on him. I definitely felt a strong physical pull\u2014at least, when I wasn\u2019t terrified of him.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t okay.</p><p>I had a boyfriend. Nate. He was nice and he liked me and I liked him and he made me feel safe. I had a good life. I took care of Jessica and ran my business. I took care of her friends sometimes, too, and inconvenient crushes on bikers\u2014ones I worked for, no less\u2014weren\u2019t on the table.</p><p>But as fabulous as Nate was, I hadn\u2019t been able to keep myself from watching Reese Hayes these past months, and there was more than enough gossip about him floating around town to feed my fascination once I started listening. Hayes had two grown daughters, he\u2019d been president of the Reapers for the past decade, and his wife, Heather, had died from breast cancer six years back. Right after I\u2019d won custody of Jessica, actually.</p><p>I knew about Heather Hayes\u2019s death because I\u2019d attended her funeral.</p><p>She\u2019d gone to high school with Amber, and while we hadn\u2019t really known each other back in the day, I\u2019d wanted to pay my respects. I\u2019d never seen a man look more devastated than Reese Hayes had that cold, dark March afternoon at the cemetery. We\u2019d gotten late snow, and his girls had been crying hysterically the whole time.</p><p>He didn\u2019t cry, though. Nope. Reese Hayes had looked like a man who\u2019d lost his soul. Since then he\u2019d gotten a reputation around town as a total slut, a reputation that seemed to be well deserved, based on what I\u2019d seen here.</p><p>Not your place to judge, I reminded myself.</p><p>When I started my cleaning business, I learned early that everyone has secrets to hide and it wasn\u2019t my job to uncover them. Get in, do the job, get out, go home. Easy and simple.</p><p>\u201cIf you knew me, you\u2019d know I feel sympathetic toward you,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I said, I have daughters. But I\u2019ve learned the hard way that you can\u2019t control them. I\u2019m a hard man and not even I can control them. You don\u2019t stand a chance with this kid. Why don\u2019t you just go home?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Enough. I stood quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving without her. Will you help me, or do I need to start searching by myself?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move and his expression didn\u2019t change, but the air in the room cooled.</p><p>\u201cSit your ass down,\u201d he said, his brilliant blue eyes flashing. The absolute authority and will in his tone was indisputable, reminding me that this was a very dangerous man.</p> <p>I sat.</p><p>Hayes rose to his feet, coming to stand in front of me. Then he leaned down and rested his hands on the back of the couch on either side of my head. His gaze pinned me, and my adrenaline surged.</p><p>What the hell was he planning to do?</p><p>\u201cYou do realize where you are?\u201d he asked softly, which was way scarier than it would\u2019ve been if he\u2019d yelled at me. Quiet menace, carrying visions of bodies buried in shallow graves ...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my club. Outside this room are twenty men who will do anything to back me up. Anything. And outside this building are forests and mountains that reach all the way to Montana. Only witnesses out there are deer and maybe a moose or two. You sure you wanna piss me off? I just pulled my dick out of a willing woman\u2019s mouth for you, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m in a good mood to start with.\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t breathe. My heart beat so fast that I thought it might explode out of my chest, and I knew for a fact that pissing him off was definitely the last thing I wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cNow ask me nicely to help you,\u201d he said, the words slow and deliberate. I nodded, taking a minute to steel myself.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hayes, will you please help me find my cousin Jessica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Sudden moisture filled my eyes, and I felt myself quivering. I blinked quickly and forced back the tears through sheer will. I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d give him any more satisfaction. Silence fell between us, his face six inches from mine, palpable tension hanging in the air. In the distance I heard music and noise from the party, all too aware that I was utterly at his mercy.</p><p>\u201cCan I go?\u201d I asked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>At least he was direct. I licked my lips nervously and his eyes followed the movement. I couldn\u2019t look at him anymore, so I lowered my gaze.</p><p>That was a mistake.</p><p>\u201cLower\u201d was his body, and one glance was enough to tell me that just because he\u2019d sent his girlfriend away didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d lost interest in sex. Nope. Nice big bulge in those jeans.</p><p>Yikes.</p><p>My eyes skittered away, stopping at the big knife strapped to his leg. A hunting knife. Inside at a party. Nothing scary about that at all, right?</p><p>\u201cConvince me to help you,\u201d he said softly, his voice growing smooth, almost silky.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to think. Sex. He was talking about sex. Okay. It wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t know about sex ... Was I willing to sleep with a man to find Jessica? Give up on my relationship with Nate?</p><p>My gut twisted, because I\u2019d already given up so much for her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very bad idea to mix work and personal business,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019ve got two crews working for you right now. I think getting involved would be a big mistake. Not only that, I\u2019m seeing someone already.\u201d</p><p>Hayes gave a low chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved and I don\u2019t give a shit about your boyfriend. But I wouldn\u2019t mind fucking your tits\u2014that\u2019d motivate me to help. Your call.\u201d</p><p>I gasped.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t exactly a secret that I had a decent-sized chest, but I\u2019d never had someone be so ... crude ... about it. I didn\u2019t know what to say. My eyes flew around the room, desperate to look at anything but his face hanging over me. Then I spotted a picture up on the file cabinet. A beautiful woman stood next to two teenage girls. Heather Hayes and her daughters. Those girls were grown up and moved out now, one of them in the past year.</p><p>Now Hayes lived alone. Inspiration struck.</p><p>\u201cWho cleans your house?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cleans your house?\u201d I asked again, my thoughts coming together quickly. \u201cIf you help me find Jessica, I\u2019ll come out to your place and have my crew do a full cleaning, no charge. You can sleep with anyone, but how many of those women can you trust to clean your house?\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on his heels, cocking his head at me. A strange light came into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see that one coming,\u201d he said, his mouth quirking at one corner. \u201cBut any of those girls out there will clean for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet they expect something in return, don\u2019t they?\u201d I asked, sensing I had him. \u201cI\u2019ll bet they want to be your girlfriend or whatever it\u2019s called ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet they want to be your old lady,\u201d I continued, getting into it. I leaned forward, willing him to agree with me. \u201cAnd I bet they get annoying after a while. My crew comes in, we clean, we leave. No stress, no fuss, and no strings attached. How\u2019s that for something of value?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your crew, just you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him. He sat back on his heels, seeming relaxed enough, but I still felt the coiled tension in the air.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, figuring I should stop while I was ahead. I held my hand out and he took it, wrapping his strong fingers around mine. They were warm and solid. I\u2019d bet his arms would be, too.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say he wanted to hold you, I reminded myself firmly. He said he wanted to \u201cfuck your tits,\u201d and that\u2019s a place we don\u2019t need to go.</p><p>Obviously I should start sleeping with Nate sooner rather than later, before my hormones destroyed me entirely.</p><p>Don\u2019t question. Just find Jessica.</p><p>\u201cSo what does she look like?\u201d he asked. I dug into my pocket and pulled out my phone, flipping quickly to her graduation picture.</p><p>Good lord, my little cousin was stunning.</p><p>Jessica was tall, with long legs toned from running. Her hair was a rich, chestnut-brown and her eyes were bright with thick lashes. She looked like an all-American princess.</p><p>He gave a low whistle.</p><p>\u201cPretty girl,\u201d he said slowly, and I glanced quickly at his face, hoping desperately I wouldn\u2019t see lust in his eyes. He took the phone and abruptly turned and walked out of the office, leaving me to scamper after him like a puppy. I followed him back into the main lounge area where I\u2019d first come in. I spotted Gage leaning against the wall, eyes seeing everything as he surveyed the party. Reese walked over to him and handed him the phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo we lookin\u2019 for her?\u201d Gage asked.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s goin\u2019 home with London, just as soon as we find her. And she\u2019s out for good after that, got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Gage said casually. \u201cBut she\u2019s upstairs right now with Banks and Painter. Probably already on her back.\u201d</p><p>I shivered, closing my eyes. Please, please, please be using condoms ...</p> <p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Hayes said, and I followed him through the partiers and across the room. The crowd parted for him like a wave, making it all too clear who was the boss.</p><p>At the far end of the room, past the bar, was a staircase leading upstairs. Hayes started climbing and I followed. On the second level we passed through a large game room holding a pool table, old couches, a giant TV, and several generations of video game consoles. There were people here, too, although not as many. Just the occasional couple on a couch.</p><p>Eyes forward. Not your place to judge.</p><p>Hayes led me up one more level, into a narrow hallway lined on each side by narrow wooden doors.</p><p>\u201cArmory used to have barracks space up here,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was ever really used, but that\u2019s how they built them back then. Now they\u2019re our guest rooms. She\u2019s probably in the one at the far end, because it\u2019s the only one open.\u201d</p> <p>He strolled down the hallway casually, as if we weren\u2019t in a race to stop my cousin from getting pregnant. I forced myself to follow with measured footsteps, coming to a halt next to him in front of the last door. I heard moaning inside, and I closed my eyes, wishing I were at home in bed, where I belonged.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d Hayes asked, and something softened in his hard eyes.</p><p>I frowned at him. \u201cOf course\u2014what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can just go downstairs, have a drink,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cRelax a little. Because if we go in there and drag her out, it\u2019s not gonna change anything. If the kid\u2019s determined to get herself in trouble, she\u2019ll do it. You can\u2019t stop her.\u201d</p><p>I clenched my teeth. Part of me whispered he was right\u2014after all, it wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d been able to change Amber. My cousin hadn\u2019t started out as the kind of person who\u2019d shoot up heroin in front of her twelve-year-old daughter.</p><p>But I wanted more for Jessica. Better.</p> <p>\u201cShould I knock on the door or should you?\u201d I asked him, determined. He shrugged, then rapped hard against the wood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Pic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d a man shouted, his voice hoarse. I could imagine why, too.</p><p>\u201cYou got a girl in there named Jessica?\u201d</p><p>I heard muffled voices, then another man spoke again.</p><p>\u201cShe says no, but she looks guilty. Give us a sec.\u201d</p><p>We waited for what couldn\u2019t have been more than a couple of minutes but felt like an eternity as I heard rumbles and thumps coming from the room.</p><p>Two male voices. Then Jessica\u2019s, raised in argument. Dear God, why did she do things like this?</p> <p>Hayes leaned back against the wall the whole time, crossing his big arms and studying me like a trapped mouse. Then the door opened, revealing a tall, dark-haired young man with rumpled hair. I looked past him to find a very plain room with an ancient, sagging bed. Jessica stood at the foot, her face full of fury. Behind her was another man, this one with short, spiky blond hair. He wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt, just a pair of jeans loosely fastened, and he pulled on heavy leather boots with a look of profound annoyance.</p><p>There were smears of lipstick on his chest, trailing down across his stomach.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to be here,\u201d Jess hissed at me. My eyes flicked back to her. God, she looked awful. Ragged, torn tights, uber short skirt, and two tops layered in a way that somehow covered nothing while still giving the appearance of clothing. Her eyes were smudged with thick, dark black liner, her hair was tangled and wild, and the slash of red across her mouth matched the trail she\u2019d left on the man behind her.</p><p>\u201cJess, it\u2019s time to go home,\u201d I said, and suddenly I felt every minute of my thirty-eight years. The blond pulled on a shirt then brushed past her and out the door, practically growling in his frustration. Hayes stepped forward and slapped his back as they exchanged a look I couldn\u2019t begin to read.</p><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d Jess snarled.</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Hayes said, his voice annoyed. \u201cGet your ass out here, you little shit. I don\u2019t have time for this and neither does London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you. I\u2019m an adult. I can do whatever I want, and I want to stay here with Banks.\u201d</p><p>The young man holding the door\u2014presumably Banks\u2014gave an incredulous snort. Hayes didn\u2019t do anything, but somehow the air changed. Darkened. Jessica had made a very serious mistake and suddenly I felt scared for her. I reached over, catching his arm without thinking, my fingers curling into his warm skin as I whispered, \u201cPlease ...\u201d</p><p>Hayes glanced down at my hand, then caught my gaze, holding it captive.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that little bitch doesn\u2019t talk to me like that, you got it? Never again.\u201d</p><p>He turned his attention back to Jess, whose face had started to reflect some concern. Maybe she was finally realizing this wasn\u2019t a game?</p><p>\u201cYou get your ass out here and apologize to your cousin,\u201d Hayes said, his voice so quiet and low I felt it all the way down my spine. \u201cThen go downstairs and get in her car. You\u2019re gonna drive home and you\u2019re never coming out here again. You do, I\u2019ll teach you a lesson you won\u2019t forget\u2014and don\u2019t think for a second that smiling and flashing your tits will make a difference. I\u2019ve seen it all before. We clear?\u201d</p><p>Jessica nodded, eyes wide. She stepped out of the room, moving instinctively to stand behind me, as far from the Reapers\u2019 president as she could get without making an obvious break for freedom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to leave now, Loni,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I turned to leave, but Hayes\u2019s voice cut like the slash of a whip.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>We turned back slowly. His stare flayed me, stripping through my defenses, and I realized he was much, much angrier with Jessica than I\u2019d realized. Somewhere down in the depths of my brainstem the monkey screamed in fear, absolutely convinced a predator was about to eat us.</p><p>\u201cBanks will take her down,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and I aren\u2019t done.\u201d</p><p>The boy stepped out of the room quickly, pulling on his Reapers vest before catching Jessica\u2019s arm and dragging her down the hallway. If you\u2019d seen them from a distance, you\u2019d almost believe they were a young couple holding hands ... In reality, he was more like a guard escorting a prisoner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you very much for helping me,\u201d I told Hayes once they were gone, forcing myself to breathe steadily. Show no fear. \u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you at my place on Monday at three,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe can work you into my schedule,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have my calendar with me. Can I get in touch with you tomorrow, when I\u2019m not so tired?\u201d</p><p>Definitely the best idea. Maybe I\u2019d even find a way out of this, because I knew darned well going to his house by myself wouldn\u2019t be safe. Not after seeing him like this\u2014if anything, the man was more dangerous than all the rumors combined. He smiled at me wolfishly.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll see you at three on Monday. Bolt will give you the address. That\u2019ll cover our original deal, but have you forgotten you owe me more now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I asked blankly.</p><p>\u201cI just gave your girl a damned big pass,\u201d he said slowly, taking a step toward me. I backed up warily. \u201cBut someone has to pay for what she did.\u201d</p><p>Hayes took another step forward, and I felt my back hit the wall. Not good. His face was cold, eyes full of ice. He towered over me, hands coming to rest on either side of my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you mean by pay?\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday,\u201d he said slowly, his chest grazing the tips of my breasts. My nipples hardened without permission. \u201cAnd instead of getting my dick sucked by a stripper, I just cock-blocked two of my brothers for you.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself starting to panic.</p><p>\u201cYou did get ...\u201d I cleared my throat nervously. \u201cYou did have oral sex. I mean, if you want to be technical about it. You just didn\u2019t finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d</p><p>His hips pushed down, demonstrating just how aware he was. I swallowed as I felt his hard length press my stomach. Heat rushed through me, twisting down between my legs, because no matter what else Reese Hayes might be, he was incredibly sexy. His mouth lowered toward mine, and then his nose brushed up and along the length of mine. I felt his warm breath whisper across my cheek. His lips hovered a fraction of an inch over mine and I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust a taste,\u201d he whispered. I nodded. I couldn\u2019t help myself.</p> <p>His mouth brushed mine as one of his hands slid into my hair, loosening the bandanna. His tongue traced the crack of my lips, wordlessly asking to come inside.</p><p>Sighing, I let him.</p><p>The kiss was surprisingly gentle in its intensity. His tongue reached deep, exploring in a game of hunt and chase that sent tendrils of desire all the way down to my toes and back up again. Without thinking, I pressed my breasts against his chest, startled and thrilled by just how good he felt around me. His hips moved in a slow, steady grind as he slipped a knee between mine. I felt a hand grip my rear and then he boosted me effortlessly, pinning me against the wall as my legs wrapped around him oh so naturally.</p><p>Reality hit.</p><p>Reese Hayes\u2019s penis nestled right up against my opening, and as my body strained toward his I realized we were perilously close to the point of no return.</p><p>I pictured Nate\u2019s smiling face and forced myself to pull away from the kiss. Hayes released my mouth, holding my body firm, resting his forehead against mine and breathing heavily. I pushed my spine back into the wall, adrenaline surging, but there wasn\u2019t anywhere to go. Not that the kiss had been violent or rough or even that passionate ... I\u2019d just never experienced anything quite like this man\u2019s quiet intensity.</p><p>And I\u2019d never wanted anyone more than I wanted Reese Hayes in that moment.</p><p>\u201cI need to go,\u201d I whispered. \u201cJessie is waiting for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. She needs me. You\u2019re a parent\u2014you understand. I know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fix her,\u201d he whispered into my ear, the heat of his mouth brushing against the lobe. \u201cShe\u2019s a big kid and she has to make her own decisions. Sooner or later we have to let them grow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you did with your girls?\u201d I asked. He stilled, then shook his head with a low laugh.</p><p>\u201cFuck no,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI tried everything I could to protect them and keep them safe. Didn\u2019t do a damned bit of good in the end. Kit\u2019s running wild, and Em\u2019s shacked up with a bastard I\u2019d give anything to put in the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know why I have to leave now.\u201d</p><p>He lowered me slowly and we studied each other for long seconds, sharing a kind of understanding that I\u2019d never have believed possible ten minutes earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the car,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A strange mixture of awareness and tension followed as we walked down the stairs and passed through the club\u2019s main lounge. Speculative gazes touched us, which I ignored.</p><p>I could ignore the humming of my body, too\u2014I\u2019d accomplished my goal.</p><p>Outside, a very subdued Jessica waited next to the van in the parking lot, Banks standing near enough to watch her but not close enough to talk comfortably. He looked bored but alert, clearly determined to follow his president\u2019s orders.</p><p>So much for young love.</p><p>I unlocked the van with my key fob and Jess slid in as I reached for my own door. Hayes caught my shoulder, turning me toward him.</p><p>\u201cThree o\u2019clock Monday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check my schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d he said with a slow, sly grin, because we both knew damned well I\u2019d be there, on time and ready to work. I had a feeling he\u2019d hunt me down if I didn\u2019t. I opened the van door and climbed in, sliding the key into the ignition.</p><p>Jess refused to look at me, which worked out well because I really didn\u2019t feel like dealing with her. We\u2019d made it halfway home before she broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cMom would never embarrass me like that.\u201d</p><p>After all that, she was going to throw Amber at me? Something ugly inside me snapped.</p><p>\u201cNope, she would\u2019ve charged them to screw you because she never gives anything away for free.\u201d</p><p>Jessica gasped and I immediately felt horrible. It might be true, but I had no business tearing down Amber to her daughter. I knew better ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she said, her voice cold, dark, and so full of hate I flinched. \u201cI want to go live with her. My real mother.\u201d</p><p>I slowed the van to pull over, because I\u2019d messed up and I knew it. Jess turned away.</p><p>\u201cJust drive. I don\u2019t want to talk. You\u2019re not my mom and you\u2019re not my boss. I\u2019m an adult. Fuck you ...\u201d she repeated, but this time she didn\u2019t sound strong. Nope. It was a pained whisper. My heart tore in half, because no matter how damaged Jess was, it wasn\u2019t her fault. From the instant of conception she\u2019d been bathed with chemicals in her mother\u2019s toxic womb, and now she had to live with that the rest of her life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the privacy of my mind, I allowed myself a second curse for the night.</p><p>Fuck you, Amber.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>MONDAY</p> <p>LONDON</p><p>\u201cHave to admit, I thought you might have a problem with this ...\u201d I said, running a finger around the rim of my water glass. We were supposed to have a date that night, but Nate had called earlier saying he\u2019d been scheduled to work, so we\u2019d met downtown for lunch instead.</p><p>He stole one of my fries, and I smacked his hand playfully. I\u2019d missed having a man around, as much as I hated to admit it. Looking at him across the table, I felt a wave of warmth, because being with him always made me happy. He was so strong and sexy in his deputy\u2019s uniform ... Like something out of a romance book. Nate even had the tousled hair and dimples to complete the package.</p><p>The memory of Reese Hayes\u2019s kiss flashed through my mind, and I flushed. I hadn\u2019t told Nate about it. We weren\u2019t officially exclusive ... or at least we\u2019d never discussed it.</p><p>The implication was certainly clear, though.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not thrilled,\u201d he admitted. \u201cHayes is a criminal and we all know it\u2014but he\u2019s not under investigation for anything right now. I do question his motives in asking you to come out personally.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I wasn\u2019t going to touch that ...</p><p>\u201cWell, it should be interesting,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as always, I guess. I\u2019m trying to get her job hunting. She needs to be thinking about her future, and she says she doesn\u2019t want to do any more school. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be,\u201d Nate said, his voice sympathetic but noncommital. He\u2019d made it clear from the start that whatever went on between me and Jess was our business. Totally hands off, which I found alternately reassuring and frustrating, because I was in over my head. \u201cYou think it\u2019s safe to leave the house for a night? I\u2019d love to take you up to Sandpoint this weekend. There\u2019s a beautiful B&amp;B I think you\u2019d like.\u201d</p> <p>I flushed, because we both knew what he was really asking. Was I ready to spend the night with him? For some reason I\u2019d been stalling, which was strange, given how sexually frustrated I was. I couldn\u2019t think of a single good reason not to sleep with him ... Might as well just do it, I decided. Rip off that bandage, get back in the saddle.</p><p>Great. Now I was thinking in cliches.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can leave overnight,\u201d I replied, offering him a smile. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019d have a party and burn the place down or something. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t take some time for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>His face brightened.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked. Nate never pushed, which was one of the things I loved about him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He reached across the table and caught my hand, pulling it up for a gentle kiss. I heard a little sigh and glanced over to find our waitress watching raptly.</p><p>I leaned forward and whispered in his ear.</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019s waiting for you to propose,\u201d I said, giggling.</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d he replied, turning his head just enough to allow his lips to graze my jawline.</p><p>Did he just say what I thought he said?</p><p>Oh, wow ... I knew Nate wanted to get married again. He\u2019d been divorced for three years and had been clear he was looking for a serious relationship. Still, seemed a little early to say something like that.</p><p>I tugged away, staring down at my food.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cYou think too much, Loni. Just enjoy the moment, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So ... Maybe we should make a plan. How about I come over to your place on Friday? We could fix dinner and maybe watch a movie or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the \u2018or something\u2019 option,\u201d he said, eyes sparkling.</p><p>I stirred my ketchup with a fry, pretending I had to consider the suggestion carefully.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward to kiss me properly, right in the middle of the restaurant. Our silly waitress started clapping. Ugh. Had I ever been that young and romantic?</p><p>No. I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Amber had been the romantic, always chasing her dreams, right up to the point where she fell down a rabbit hole and never found her way out. I\u2019d been trailing after her ever since, doing damage control.</p><p>Maybe it was time for me to chase some of my own dreams. Starting with Nate.</p><p>I deserved a little happiness.</p><p>Why the hell am I here?</p><p>I stood on Reese Hayes\u2019s porch later that afternoon, questioning my sanity. Jessica would just get herself in trouble again\u2014I hadn\u2019t solved anything, just delayed the inevitable. The relaxed glow I\u2019d carried from my lunch with Nate had evaporated the minute I pulled up to the house, replaced with a sort of horrible anxiety and excitement about seeing Hayes again all mixed together in my stomach.</p><p>Of course that could\u2019ve just been the fries I\u2019d eaten for lunch.</p><p>Yeah. Right.</p><p>The big biker met me at the door with a lazy smile guaranteed to melt the panties right off a girl. Faded jeans hung low on his hips and an old T-shirt did far too little to hide the bulk of his muscles. Those ice blue eyes of his missed nothing, sweeping down my figure to take in the baggy shirt and hole-filled jeans I\u2019d deliberately chosen to wear this afternoon. Possibly the least sexy outfit in human history and that was no coincidence.</p><p>There would be no repeats of the weekend\u2019s unfortunate events in the hallway.</p><p>Reese\u2019s mouth quirked and his face held none of the intimidating coldness of the last time I\u2019d seen him. Nope, today he was pretending to be a seminormal human being, but only partially succeeding. I knew what was under the surface\u2014a hard man who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do whatever he needed to do to get his way. Unfortunately, my lady parts stopped listening to my brain right after the \u201chard man\u201d part, because they were less focused on the work ahead and more focused on remembering how his mouth had felt on mine.</p><p>\u201cGlad you could fit me into your schedule,\u201d he said slyly as I stepped inside. I bit my tongue. Literally. I couldn\u2019t afford to make him mad for any number of reasons, not least of which was the fact that the MC was my best-paying client. If I got the strip club contract, they\u2019d be the biggest, too. All cash. I might not be suffering for work\u2014but there\u2019s work and there\u2019s work. The club wasn\u2019t afraid to pay well in exchange for good service, and they didn\u2019t cheap out when it came to getting what they wanted. Expanding to take on their account would be worth the hassle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But business aside, I was also pretty sure that if Reese got angry enough, bad things might start happening. Stabby, shooty things. I based this on the impressive display of collectible knives and guns hanging over the mantel in the living room.</p><p>\u201cNice weapons,\u201d I muttered, eyes wide. He laughed.</p><p>\u201cMost of those were my dad\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve picked up a few along the way myself, too.\u201d</p><p>Lovely.</p> <p>I turned to face him, offering my most businesslike smile.</p><p>\u201cCan you show me around the house?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to get a feel for the place, see how much work I have ahead of me. I have five hours before I need to pick up Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doing okay?\u201d</p><p>Hmm ... How to answer that? I met his gaze, wishing his eyes weren\u2019t so bright and blue. It wasn\u2019t fair for a man to have muscles like that and such gorgeous eyes. And those lips, all framed in just a scruff of beard ...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s angry at me and angry at the world,\u201d I said finally. \u201cAnd I said something stupid to hurt her feelings, which didn\u2019t help things. Hard to know what direction we\u2019re going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>That startled me. I coughed, looking away. Why on earth would he offer to talk to me about Jessica? Second man to ask today, I realized, thinking back to Nate at lunch. Great. I was surrounded by sexy men and all they wanted to do was discuss my shitty parenting techniques.</p><p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s just get this done, okay?\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow, holding up his hands in amused surrender.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d he said. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>We started by going up the narrow stairs to the second floor, which had three bedrooms and a bathroom. The place was old, a farmhouse built at least a hundred years ago, and wasn\u2019t anything fancy\u2014just comfortable and homey. Colorful rag rugs covered wooden floors, and two of the bedrooms obviously belonged to his daughters. The third held a guest bed.</p> <p>I figured it said something positive about him that he hadn\u2019t boxed up their things or redecorated when they moved out.</p><p>Guess nobody is all bad.</p><p>The homey vibe continued downstairs, despite the display of weaponry in the living room. The dining room held a china cabinet full of things that must\u2019ve been Heather\u2019s. Pictures covered the walls and there were even some plants, although they weren\u2019t looking particularly healthy at the moment.</p><p>I wondered if his daughter had been the one to take care of them?</p><p>The plants weren\u2019t the only things suffering from neglect. Dust had settled on most of the surfaces, water spots covered the faucets, and the kitchen garbage seemed to be full of paper plates and old carryout containers. A few unwashed glasses sat in the sink ... no other evidence that any cooking had taken place in the past month.</p><p>\u201cI take it you eat out a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy life. Bedroom is back here.\u201d</p><p>The bedroom.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be a dork, I told myself. You\u2019ve cleaned hundreds of strangers\u2019 rooms over the years and it\u2019s no big deal.</p><p>\u201cI need to get my supplies,\u201d I said, chickening out. I\u2019d look at his bedroom later, after I got the rest of the house whipped into shape. Thankfully it shouldn\u2019t be that hard a job\u2014there might be a lot of dust, but the place wasn\u2019t filthy. I got the impression he didn\u2019t spend much time there at all, which had to limit the mess.</p><p>\u201cYou need help carrying anything?\u201d he asked, trailing me to the door.</p><p>\u201cNope. In fact, it will be easier for me if you go away for a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>He studied me speculatively, and I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do\u2014steal your guns? I don\u2019t even like guns. It\u2019s going to be noisy and dusty and you\u2019ll be in my way.\u201d</p><p>Hayes gave a startled snort, and I realized he was holding back a laugh. Okay. That was better than him menacing me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in the shop,\u201d he said. \u201cCome find me if you have any questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d I replied, taking another quick look around.</p><p>The sooner I got this done the better.</p><p>Nearly three hours later I\u2019d scrubbed, dusted, wiped, and washed the entire house. Not deep cleaning\u2014no windows\u2014but the surfaces were dirt-free and sanitized, the carpets were vacuumed, and the dust bunnies had been executed for crimes against humanity.</p><p>Now all that remained was the back addition where he slept, which I\u2019d saved for last. Why? I have no idea. I guess it just felt too intimate, and I didn\u2019t want to get any closer to him than I needed to. This was crazy, because I\u2019d cleaned bedrooms through the years and never felt more than mild curiosity about their residents.</p><p>Get over yourself.</p><p>Walking into his room was like entering a different world. It was all new construction, so that was a big contrast right there, but the place was sparse and barren, too. Modern furniture, and not much of it. A dresser and an entertainment center with a giant flatscreen on it. Mirrored panels covering big double closet doors. A slider opened out the back, hung with heavy, dark curtains that weren\u2019t quite black but weren\u2019t quite anything else, either.</p><p>And the bed? Wowza.</p><p>Reese Hayes had a bed big enough for six people, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019d had that many in here a time or two. The image of him lying back on it, naked and beckoning took my breath away for an instant. Down, hormones! Silky black sheets covered it, another modern touch deeply out of sync with the rest of the house. It felt like some sort of dark den, which I supposed it was. He\u2019d obviously erased any hints that his wife had ever slept in here.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s depressing,\u201d I muttered softly to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s depressing?\u201d</p><p>I jumped, adrenaline spiking as I whirled to find the man himself watching me. He leaned against the door frame, his big arms crossed, which flexed the muscles in a way that sent a thrill down my spine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sneak up on me like that!\u201d</p><p>Hayes cocked a brow, and I realized I\u2019d yelled at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said quickly, remembering how he\u2019d responded to Jessica\u2019s blowup. I didn\u2019t have any reason to believe he\u2019d be dangerous, at least not under these circumstances. That didn\u2019t mean I should feel comfy and safe around him, though.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut what did you mean by that comment?\u201d</p><p>Love that deer-in-the-headlights feeling. I tried to think, come up with some kind of safe lie, but the truth came out instead and it was horrible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s depressing because it\u2019s obvious that you removed every trace of Heather from your room.\u201d</p><p>He froze, and for the first time I saw something like real emotion on his face. He looked ... stunned. Like he couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d actually said that.</p><p>Fair enough. I couldn\u2019t quite believe it, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered. He turned and walked out, slamming the door behind him.</p> <p>Well played, London. Kick the widower in the emotional balls. Classy. What the hell was wrong with me?</p><p>I turned back and set down my supply bucket. Might as well get to work, because there was no way I\u2019d be leaving this room any time soon. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to face him for a while ... I walked into the bathroom and flipped on the light, looking around. Oh, dear God. It was disgusting. Not moldy or anything, but really obvious that it hadn\u2019t seen a good cleaning in weeks, maybe even months. Much worse than the bathroom upstairs had been, but I guess that made sense. Nobody lived up there anymore.</p><p>He\u2019d have plenty of time to forgive me before I\u2019d get out of here, I realized. My phone buzzed.</p><p>JESSICA: Getting done an hour early and need ride.</p><p>I rubbed my temple, frustrated. I\u2019d never finish this in one shot, and now I had even less time, unless I made Jess walk home from the community center. Knowing my luck, she\u2019d pick up a bunch of new friends along the way and bring them back to the house for a party ...</p> <p>Wonderful.</p><p>President Friendly and I would need to schedule at least one more session, which meant more time spent with him than I\u2019d ever imagined when we struck our deal. And that was before I insulted him about his dead wife in their bedroom.</p><p>Jessie is worth it, I reminded myself. This is nothing. Just get to work and keep your mouth shut. Think about Nate and Friday night. With any luck, you\u2019ll go back to seeing Reese Hayes once or twice a month from a safe distance.</p><p>Just the way it should be.</p><p>I was only partially finished with the bathroom when my phone timer went off, reminding me to pick up Jess. I packed up my supplies and looked around in dissatisfaction.</p><p>At least the toilet was clean.</p> <p>Walking past his freshly changed bed, I tried not to think about how soft and comfortable that silky fabric would feel against my skin ... I suspected it would be fabulous, especially if his body was covering mine and I got to taste those lips of his again. My cheeks warmed, and I wondered how\u2014exactly\u2014I\u2019d gone from being a sensible, responsible woman to one who could lust after two men in one day.</p><p>I tried to think of a way to blame that one on Jessica, but not even I could pull it off. I had to own up to the facts\u2014I\u2019d become a perv. I guess all those articles about women hitting their sexual peak in their thirties hadn\u2019t been exaggerating.</p><p>When I entered the kitchen, I heard voices from the living room.</p><p>Hayes and a woman. I smelled food, too. Pizza. The hot-cheese-and-tomato scent wafting toward me was heavenly. I\u2019d worked up an appetite, which I guess was one good thing about my job. I burned plenty of calories on a daily basis, no question of that.</p><p>As I approached the living room, I could see the back of Hayes\u2019s head from where he sat on the couch. A woman straddled him, facing me. For one horrid, wretched moment I thought I might be about to walk in on him having sex again. She glanced up at me, curiosity written all over her face, saying something to him I couldn\u2019t quite make out. He pushed her off gently. Thankfully, she was fully clothed.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said, walking into the room, feeling unspeakably awkward. An open box of pizza sat on the coffee table, along with two open beers and a couple of empties.</p><p>Hayes stood, his thick thighs and heavy arms even sexier than I remembered, which seemed rather unfair. His companion gave me a friendly smile. She was young, cute, and apparently nice, too. Girls like that are the worst. I had a feeling I looked disgusting, and knowing my luck, I probably didn\u2019t smell too good right now, either.</p><p>Oh, and old. I felt old.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m almost done with your bathroom,\u201d I said, realizing I should apologize for what I\u2019d said earlier. I just didn\u2019t know how. \u201cBut not quite. I\u2019ll need to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be here tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. But I can come on Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWednesday isn\u2019t good for me. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can come on Wednesday,\u201d I repeated. \u201cI have to take Jess over to the hospital in Spokane tomorrow. She has an appointment with a specialist and it\u2019s not like you can just reschedule those.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she need to see a specialist for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her business,\u201d I replied, straightening myself. \u201cI appreciate your help the other night, but that\u2019s not a license to invade our privacy.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><p>\u201cI need to go get something out of my car,\u201d she said quickly. I started forward, deciding retreat was the better part of valor, but Hayes stood in my way. The man was like a brick wall. A really frustrating brick wall. I tried to slip past him, but he wrapped one big hand around my upper arm, stopping me. Shoot. I\u2019d forgotten to be afraid of him.</p><p>This was a mistake, because he could turn on scary just like that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with your girl?\u201d he asked again, his voice soft. \u201cI know she\u2019s a wild kid, but this sounds like more.\u201d</p><p>I stared at his broad chest, refusing to meet his eyes. He wore a torn T-shirt that had seen better days, and it didn\u2019t do much to hide the latent strength of his muscles or just how easily he could hold me here indefinitely. Not only that, he smelled good. So unfair.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help, London?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou work for us now. If there\u2019s a problem, you should tell me. Even if there isn\u2019t, I should know if you\u2019ve got something big going on. Everything that touches the club is my business.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. Now he was interested in learning more about our lives?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing important,\u201d I replied, forcing my voice to stay smooth, because it wasn\u2019t nothing and never would be. \u201cWe just need to get her checked out. But I can come back on Wednesday right after lunch. Would that work for you?\u201d</p><p>He studied me a moment longer, then slowly rubbed his hands up and down my arms before letting me go. This was fortunate, because I\u2019m pretty sure I got goose bumps and the last thing I needed was him figuring out how I reacted to his touch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t be here on Wednesday,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can program in a code for you to use.

Night!\u201d</p><p>I darted out the door before he could respond, then stopped on the porch. Shit. As much as I wanted to get the hell away, I needed to apologize. What I\u2019d said about his room and Heather had been so wrong on so many levels ... I turned to face Reese, meeting his eyes directly.</p><p>\u201cThat comment about your bedroom? That was wrong. I have no right to say anything about your home or your room\u2014or your wife. I\u2019m sorry. It was thoughtless and hurtful.\u201d</p> <p>Reese didn\u2019t respond right away, just studied my face. Then he nodded his head slowly. Good enough for me, so I turned and moved quickly toward my van. The woman I\u2019d seen inside leaned against her car, smoking and watching me with openly concerned eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, throwing down the butt and twisting it under her foot. She walked back to the house as I loaded my supplies. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her go to Reese. He guided her into the house, shutting the door behind them. I started to climb into my vehicle, then glanced over at the butt on the dirt.</p><p>Leave it.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t. Being a neat freak is a curse sometimes, but darned if I could just drive away and leave that nasty little thing lying there. I gave the house a quick glance to make sure I was all clear before stomping over to pick it up. Clutching it carefully between two fingers, I carried it around the side of the house to the trash can.</p><p>It took two seconds to toss it in, and then another for a quick squirt of hand sanitizer from the little tube in my pocket.</p><p>Better.</p><p>So what if I couldn\u2019t control Jessica and I felt awkward and uncomfortable around Reese? At least that particular cigarrette butt wouldn\u2019t pollute anything today. I decided to count it as a victory.</p><p>\u201cShe has a gift, you know.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at Maggs, the new volunteer coordinator at the community center.</p> <p>\u201cJess?\u201d</p><p>Maggs nodded, her messy blonde hair styled exactly the way I\u2019d tried to get mine that unfortunate time that I\u2019d cut it all off. She looked sort of like Meg Ryan at her cutest. I\u2019d resembled a horrific clown who\u2019d been attacked with scissors. I glanced across the room at my little cousin, watching her crawl around on the floor with a little girl.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her before,\u201d I said, nodding toward the child.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s new, only been coming for a couple weeks now,\u201d Maggs said. \u201cFamily just moved to the area. She\u2019s got a shunt\u2014congenital hydrocephalus. Jessica has taken a special interest in her.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught. Of course she had ...</p><p>\u201cJess is hell on wheels, but she\u2019s a good volunteer,\u201d I said, which was the truth. No matter how crazy everything else got, Jess never missed a shift at the center. \u201cShe loves working with the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she considered going into early-childhood education or a related field?\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s considered anything beyond her next party.\u201d</p><p>Maggs cocked her head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause she\u2019d be really good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I replied, smiling. \u201cHey, Jess! You ready?\u201d</p><p>Jess looked up at me and smiled, hopping up and offering the kid her hand for a high five. The little girl jumped up to smack her, obviously thrilled to get such attention from a big girl.</p><p>\u201cSee ya on Wednesday,\u201d Jess told her, then loped across the game room floor toward me. \u201cSorry, I lost track of the time. Hey, they\u2019re having a party for the kids and their families on Wednesday night. I signed you up to bring chicken and dumplings. They want it here by six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for asking first,\u201d I replied, my tone dry. She grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cWould you have said no?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and she giggled, sounding young and carefree.</p><p>\u201cHa! I know you too well. You always come through.\u201d</p><p>That was the truth ...</p><p>\u201cSo, I thought you were going to be done early today? Seemed like you weren\u2019t quite ready to leave after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I planned to get out early, but then we got caught up in a game,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cI do want to go home, though. Mellie\u2019s coming over. We\u2019re going to a movie tonight out in Hayden\u2014she\u2019s got her mom\u2019s car. You said you\u2019d pay for a movie with her this week, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I said, figuring Mellie deserved something nice after what she\u2019d been through last weekend. Jess had blown up at her for calling me, although they\u2019d made up again by Sunday night. That\u2019s the thing with Jess. For better or for worse, she doesn\u2019t hold on to things. Every once in a while that worked out so the good guys won.</p><p>\u201cDo you have plans for dinner?\u201d Jess asked casually as we started across the parking lot. Too casually. What was she up to now?</p><p>\u201cNot really. I was thinking we could have soup and sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about pizza?\u201d she asked, and my mouth watered. I hadn\u2019t gotten the smell of the pizza at Reese\u2019s house out of my mind since I\u2019d left. So I\u2019d been intimidated by him ... but I\u2019d also been hungry.</p><p>\u201cNot sure that\u2019s in the budget,\u201d I said slowly, mentally calculating where we were in the month. Between the mortgage and the medical bills, there wasn\u2019t much extra.</p><p>\u201cWho said you\u2019re paying?\u201d Jess asked, pulling out a wadded green bill from her pocket. She stretched it out and waved it triumphantly in my face.</p><p>A fifty.</p><p>My eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d I asked, stunned. Dear God, was she picking pockets now?</p><p>\u201cIt was a thank-you gift,\u201d she said, grinning broadly. \u201cYou saw that little girl I was playing with? Well, her mom talked to me last week and she really likes how I\u2019m working with Ivy. She\u2019s behind the other kids developmentally, and it\u2019s hard for her. I know how that feels, so I\u2019ve been spending extra time with her. Today her mom gave me this and thanked me. She asked if I do babysitting, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie, that\u2019s fantastic!\u201d I said, pulling her in for an impulsive hug. She tugged away from me immediately, scowling, but I could see the pleasure in her eyes. This was a huge win for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe an opportunity, too.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Ms. Dwyer said you have a gift with the kids,\u201d I told her. She radiated pride even as she kicked a rock, pretending not to care. \u201cShe thinks you should go into early-childhood education. You\u2019re really good with them, especially the special-needs kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like them, that\u2019s all,\u201d Jess said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to do more school. I already told you that\u2014I don\u2019t like school. It\u2019s too hard for me.\u201d</p><p>I sobered.</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard for you. But when you take the time, you do a really good job. You graduated with a 3.1, and that\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d</p><p>She grunted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just because I took all the easy classes. I\u2019m a retard and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>I stopped dead and grabbed her, turning her toward me. Catching her gaze, I studied her face. What I saw there killed me. She believed it. No matter how many times I told her otherwise, she still couldn\u2019t forget what those little bitches in middle school had starting calling her. Not even changing schools had helped.</p><p>\u201cI never want to hear you say that word again,\u201d I told her, the words slow and forceful. \u201cA learning disability doesn\u2019t make you stupid\u2014it just means you have to work harder. You have a perfectly normal IQ. I\u2019m incredibly proud of you, Jess, and when I suggested you go to more school it\u2019s only because I know you can handle it.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes, and I fought the urge to shake her.</p><p>\u201cJess, listen to me. Ms. Dwyer said you have a gift\u2014and you know what? You do have a gift. Would you call the kids you work with here retards?\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s eyes narrowed and her face flushed.</p><p>\u201cNo. I would never say that and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the hell would you say it about yourself? You\u2019ll either go to more school or you won\u2019t, but don\u2019t for one minute tell me that it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t smart enough. You\u2019re smart, Jess.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, and I practically saw the wheels turning in her head.</p> <p>\u201cYou said \u2018hell.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, feeling suddenly sheepish. \u201cI guess I did.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile crept across her face. Then she leaned forward, catching me up tight in a hug.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Loni,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I drive you crazy, but I love you. Thank you for always being on my side.\u201d</p><p>I hugged her back, tears filling my eyes. Why couldn\u2019t Jess be like this all the time? This was the girl I\u2019d given up so much for. Imperfect and frustrating, but worth all the sacrifices and then some.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna buy me pizza or what?\u201d I asked finally, pulling away.</p><p>\u201cFirst one to the car gets to pick the restaurant,\u201d she said, then took off across the parking lot, long legs pumping. I started after her, but I never had a shot. The girl was six inches taller than me with the stride to prove it.</p><p>Good lord, I loved that kid, and every time I started to forget why, she\u2019d do something beautiful to remind me.</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>REESE</p><p>Wednesday was the shits.</p><p>One of the girls working at The Line OD\u2019d right after lunch, right on the stage. They called the ambulance and Gage started CPR, but she didn\u2019t make it. We\u2019d all known Pepper was using, but not how much, and apparently she left behind a son, too. I\u2019d banged her the weekend before, but she never said a word about having a kid. Not that I\u2019d given her the chance to talk much, or would\u2019ve listened if she had tried.</p><p>I hated myself a little bit for that.</p><p>Now social services would step in and I hoped to hell she had family somewhere. We\u2019d probably do a little fund-raiser for the boy, which would change exactly nothing because he didn\u2019t need money\u2014he needed a mom.</p><p>Fucking sucked.</p><p>Then we got word out of La Grande that they\u2019d intercepted a major cartel shipment, which was farther north than we\u2019d realized they\u2019d started running product. This also fucking sucked, because it meant things were heating up faster than we\u2019d anticipated. I guess technically we\u2019d been at war with them for six months, but it wasn\u2019t an active war. More of a wait-and-see while making plans for payback.</p><p>Clearly the waiting game was over.</p><p>To top it all off, I\u2019d smashed my thumb at the shop fixing my bike because I\u2019m a fucking dumbass. Now my thumb hurt like hell and the bike still wasn\u2019t up and running. On the bright side, watching me cuss and punch the walls in frustration seemed to entertain the guys.</p><p>Nice to provide some comic relief, I guess.</p><p>When I pulled up to the house, all I wanted was a hot shower, followed by a cold beer and maybe some TV. We\u2019d already had church that afternoon\u2014just a quick meeting to cover events down south\u2014but there wasn\u2019t anything else going on tonight and I needed some time to myself. Normally I\u2019d bring some bitch home for a fuck after a crap day, but Pepper put a stop to that. She\u2019d been the last girl in my bed.</p><p>Pretty sure she shot up in my bathroom, too, now that I thought about it.</p><p>That\u2019s when I saw the goddamned minivan in my driveway. Shit. The Ice Princess had said she\u2019d be out by early afternoon, and I wasn\u2019t in the mood to listen to her prissy voice while staring at her off-limits boobs.</p><p>\u201cGod damn it,\u201d I muttered, slamming my hand down on the steering wheel for emphasis. That sent a wave of pain shooting up from my swollen thumb and I stiffened, groaning.</p><p>Could anything go right today?</p><p>When I walked into the house I froze, disoriented. I smelled food cooking\u2014good food. Some kind of savory chicken thing filled the air and my stomach growled. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cLondon, you in here?\u201d I called, throwing my shit down on the couch and moving toward the kitchen. No answer ... but up on the kitchen counter I spotted the biggest Crock-Pot I\u2019d ever seen full of whatever the hell smelled so good. I looked around for her, then moved toward my bedroom. The bathroom door was closed and I heard the shower running.</p><p>Still cleaning. I decided I\u2019d forgive her for being so late, seeing as she\u2019d cooked. I went back into the kitchen and pulled the lid off the Crock-Pot, taking a deep whiff.</p><p>Holy fuck, that was amazing.</p><p>Thirty seconds later I had a giant bowl of bubbling chicken and dumplings in one hand and a beer in the other, \u2019cause I don\u2019t believe in fucking around when it comes to food. I went back to my room and sat back on my bed, leaning against the pillows she\u2019d artfully arranged over the comforter. I hadn\u2019t even known I had that many pillows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The shower was still running. Interesting. I swapped the beer for a remote and flipped on the set. Then I took a bite and actually moaned, because the food was that fucking good.</p><p>Christ, I\u2019d needed this. I had no idea what\u2019d compelled her to fix me dinner, but the woman was a goddess and I regretted every nasty thing I\u2019d ever thought about her. The shower turned off, and I heard her singing softly to herself. My dick perked up as I took another bite.</p><p>Fuck it, because I really didn\u2019t regret any of the nasty shit I\u2019d thought about her ... at least not the screwing-her parts, which had been the nastiest of all. The only thing better than eating this food would be if she fed it to me naked.</p><p>After a minute the bathroom door opened and London stepped out, a towel wrapped loosely around her body. She saw me and screamed, which made her tits jiggle in a way that was nothing less than outstanding.</p> <p>She\u2019d been taking a shower. In my room. Naked.</p><p>I set the bowl down and rose to my feet, stalking toward her. Clearly London operated a full-service business.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>LONDON</p><p>Crazy day.</p> <p>Not one single thing had gone right ... No, that wasn\u2019t true. The doctor\u2019s trip yesterday had been great. All good with Jess, no signs of complications and no need to come back in for another six months unless she had symptoms. It was easy to lose perspective on how far we\u2019d come over the years, get impatient with her for doing stupid things. The fact of the matter was she\u2019d been born a miracle baby and now she was a miraculously healthy adult.</p><p>I needed to remember that.</p><p>That morning I\u2019d been scheduled to finish at Hayes\u2019s house, but I\u2019d gotten called to the hospital instead. One of my girls was pregnant and she\u2019d gone into preterm labor at four a.m. It looked like she\u2019d be on bed rest for the duration, which wasn\u2019t exactly good news for me but at least she was doing okay. Fortunately I\u2019d gotten six applications in this week, and I\u2019d already set up interviews with two of them. Hopefully one or both would work out\u2014they both looked good on paper.</p><p>That left me in a bind with Hayes. I had to bring food for the potluck at six, and there was no way I\u2019d be able finish up at his place and get back home in time to fix it, let alone make myself presentable, so I\u2019d thrown the chicken into a Crock-Pot and grabbed the ingredients for biscuits to take with me. I figured I could clean, throw together the biscuits, and then take a quick shower before grabbing the pot and running out the door.</p><p>Was it appropriate? Not even a little, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers and it\u2019s not like he was paying me. Fortunately he wasn\u2019t even home, so it seemed to be a non-issue. The last of the cleaning went smoothly enough, and showering at his place was a treat. The house might be old, but he\u2019d gone all out in the addition and the bathroom was luxe.</p><p>Beyond luxe, actually. It was big, almost as big as one of the little bedrooms upstairs. There was a sunken tub built for two and a large, glassed-in shower stall with one of those fancy adjustable shower heads that go up and down. I\u2019d lowered it for myself, making careful note of where he\u2019d had it set. I\u2019d make sure it was back where it was supposed to be when I finished, but it was still a pleasure to use a shower that was actually the right height for me.</p> <p>By the time my hair was all washed and I stepped out, I was in a pretty good mood. I couldn\u2019t wait to see Jessica in her element at the community center again. Life with her was a series of ups and downs, but I had a good feeling about tonight.</p><p>Maybe she could even get a job down there, because for all her faults she really did have something to offer those kids that a more typical young woman wouldn\u2019t bring to the table. Maggs Dwyer might be new, but she was smart. When she looked at Jessica, she saw the same potential that I did.</p><p>My mood stayed good as I toweled off my hair, and then I looked around for my backpack and realized I\u2019d left it in the bedroom. Humming brightly, I opened the door and screamed.</p><p>Reese Hayes was sitting back on his bed holding a bowl of food, eyes trailing down my figure speculatively. A slow, predatory smile crossed his face and he set the bowl on the bedside table, pushing to his feet.</p><p>Run! my brain screamed, but my feet didn\u2019t move. Seriously. No movement at all, just like in one of those dreams where a giant dinosaur suddenly appears in the grocery store parking lot and you can\u2019t seem to start running away or even throw a package of chicken thighs to create a diversion, no matter how hard you try.</p><p>Chicken thighs? Where did that come from? Why couldn\u2019t I focus?</p><p>Hayes stalked toward me, and then one of his fingers slid down the front of my towel, right between my breasts. My nipples perked up, acting against orders. He tugged gently at the fabric, and finally my body started listening to me. I clamped down my arms against the towel, holding it firm as I took a step back.</p><p>He let me go, a strange smile teasing his lips.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be shy,\u201d he said. \u201cWet and naked\u2019s a good look on you. Gotta say, between this and the food you\u2019ve turned my day right around.\u201d</p><p>Food?</p><p>I glanced over at the bowl, then realized he\u2019d been in the chicken and biscuits. Crap. I loved it when the biscuits formed a perfect, unbroken layer across the top while the broth bubbled up along the edges. Now there\u2019d be a gap. Of course, I couldn\u2019t exactly begrudge the man some dinner, given that I\u2019d essentially taken over his house without permission.</p><p>In retrospect, I think I might have subconsciously set myself up. From the beginning he\u2019d fascinated me ... He scared me, too, but he\u2019d also gotten under my skin like a bur. Maybe if I hadn\u2019t been so out of practice, I\u2019d have figured it out sooner.</p><p>Holding the towel firmly, I gave him a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I got delayed this morning. One of my employees is in the hospital, and I have a potluck after this. I figured you wouldn\u2019t mind, seeing as I didn\u2019t even charge you for the cleaning ...\u201d</p><p>A flash of pain crossed his face.</p><p>\u201cHad an employee in the hospital this morning myself,\u201d he said. \u201cHope yours turned out better than mine. If you aren\u2019t gonna take off that towel, then you should get dressed now, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the goal,\u201d I said dryly, deciding not to follow up on the hospital comment. It didn\u2019t sound like a happy story.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to get involved.</p><p>\u201cCan you hand me my bag?\u201d I asked, nodding toward the backpack I\u2019d left sitting near the door. He walked casually over to grab it, and I couldn\u2019t help but watch the movement of his legs under those jeans. His thighs were thick, and not with fat. He had a tight butt, broad shoulders, and a back that I wanted to rub my cheek against. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he turned back toward me, my eyes widened. I have a thing for muscular men, no question, and his body pushed every one of my buttons. Broad chest, thick arms and thighs ... And his stomach? Holy cow, I just knew that under that tight black shirt would be the perfect six-pack. The man\u2019s body was ideal\u2014not like a twenty-year-old\u2019s, though. No, he had the solidity that only comes with age and endurance and maturity.</p><p>My eyes had just drifted lower, below the belt, when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cHow important is this potluck thing?\u201d he asked softly. Huh? I blinked, then glanced back up at his face. Oh, wow. He\u2019d totally caught me checking him out. He liked it, too. I saw heat in his eyes, the kind of heat that only means one thing. This is why I shouldn\u2019t be let out in public, I decided. I just couldn\u2019t be trusted to handle myself.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, my throat ever so slightly dry.</p> <p>\u201cBecause if you look at me like that for even one more second, I\u2019m gonna throw you down on that bed and fuck every part of you, starting with your tits. Unless that\u2019s on the menu, you need to grab your shit and leave while you still can. This is the only warning you\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>I gave a strangled gasp, because there was absolutely no question he was dead serious. I reached out for my pack, which he handed over wordlessly. Then I turned and bolted back into the bathroom, slamming the door shut and locking it. I heard him laugh behind me, but there wasn\u2019t even a hint of humor in the sound.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think a lock could keep me out, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Ha. No danger of me feeling safe in his home anyway. Five minutes later I was dressed and ready to go. I\u2019d planned to wipe down the bathroom after I finished, leave it perfect so he\u2019d never know I\u2019d taken advantage of the situation. Unfortunately that ship had well and truly sailed, so I decided escape was probably more important than preventing water spots.</p><p>Like he\u2019d notice them anyway ...</p> <p>Thankfully Hayes wasn\u2019t in the bedroom when I cautiously stepped out again, and I didn\u2019t find him in the kitchen, either. Perfect. I took my damp towel and wrapped it around the Crock-Pot, preparing to haul it to the car.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he said behind me.</p><p>I froze. Was the man a ninja? \u201cI think we\u2019ve talked enough. I\u2019ve finished the job for you and it\u2019s really time for me to get going.\u201d</p><p>I heard him step forward, then felt his heat surround me. Big hands came to rest against the edge of the counter on either side of me and his breath whispered across my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou should come back here next week,\u201d he said, his voice low and growly. It slithered down my spine, sending tendrils of heat swirling through me.</p><p>No, I definitely shouldn\u2019t come back. Not even a little bit.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a great idea,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember, but I actually have a boyfriend. We\u2019re starting to get serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean you should come back to fuck, although I\u2019m all over that idea, too, if you change your mind. Don\u2019t give a damn about your boyfriend, either, that\u2019s between you and him. Nope, I want you back to clean again, maybe make more of that food. It\u2019s really fuckin\u2019 good, and tonight I realized just how much nicer it is to come home to a house that smells like people actually live here.\u201d</p><p>My brain froze.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do houses,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, this was a special deal. But I run a commercial business and I use crews. I manage things and fill in\u2014I\u2019m not interested in being someone\u2019s housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days a week,\u201d he murmured. I felt his lips brush and it took everything I had not to moan. \u201cYou come here two days a week and I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>He leaned into me, and I felt his hardness touch my rear so lightly I wondered if I\u2019d imagined it. This was not a legitimate business proposition. I needed to tell him where to go. Unfortunately my mouth wouldn\u2019t work. It was too busy imagining what licking his nipples would feel like.</p><p>Bad London!</p><p>\u201cYour crew came in and did cleanup after that last big party at The Line, remember? Did a real good job, too.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, still unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cI think Gage mentioned we might be looking for a long-term contract,\u201d he continued. \u201cSomething more regular so we don\u2019t have to count on the waitresses to shut down at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should really consider it,\u201d I answered quietly. \u201cA business like that needs to be cleaned thoroughly every day if you want to keep it up right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContract\u2019s all yours if you do my house, too. You cook two meals a week and you\u2019ll do some grocery shopping. I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>Then he whispered a number that made my eyes widen. That was pizza money and then some.</p><p>\u201cThat per visit or per week?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and we both knew he had me.</p><p>\u201cPer visit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you work around my schedule. I can be flexible, but I don\u2019t want you out here cooking on nights I won\u2019t be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get one of your club girlfriends to do it?\u201d I asked, wondering if I\u2019d lost my mind. But having my crews seven days a week out at The Line? That would add up fast ... The club paid top dollar, and like I said\u2014they paid it in cash.</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re little girls with dreams and plans and bullshit,\u201d he said, a hint of humor in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re a grown-up. You know this doesn\u2019t end with wine and roses, whatever happens between us. When I don\u2019t need you anymore, you keep the shifts at The Line so long as things stay drama-free. Got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is going to happen but cleaning and cooking,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Hayes pressed forward into me, and I felt the hard heat of him all along my back, so hot I thought my spine might melt. His erection dug into my bottom and I bit my lip to distract myself\u2014otherwise I\u2019d start grinding back against him like a cat in heat. Then he kissed my neck, tongue tracing along my jaw, and his teeth caught my ear. I moaned, desire twisting up from between my legs, swelling my breasts and hardening my nipples.</p><p>\u201cUnless you plan on skipping your potluck, time to go,\u201d Hayes whispered, giving his hips a slow twist. \u201cAnd next time you see your boyfriend? Tell him I said hi.\u201d</p><p>FRIDAY NIGHT</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Nate asked, softly ending our kiss. We were at his place and I\u2019d had a couple of glasses of wine, along with the very nice steak dinner he\u2019d cooked for me. Now we were out on his back deck, me on a lounger and him on me, legs tangled together in the warm summer air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was it. Tonight we\u2019d be having sex.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t I more excited about this? Guilt.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d I said, running a hand up and around his neck. Studying his face, I tried to smile but it felt all off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, pulling away.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, then flopped down on his back next to me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t lie for shit, Loni,\u201d he said. \u201cJust spit it out, okay?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, but figured if I really wanted to build something with this man, I owed him the truth. \u201cI felt very attracted to someone else this week and now I feel guilty and horrid.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I expected\u2014maybe that he\u2019d be upset? Nate didn\u2019t even blink.</p><p>\u201cDid you do anything about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t. But I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cReese Hayes,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cAnd he wants me to keep coming out to his place to clean. He offered me a really good cleaning contract for the MC\u2019s strip club, too.\u201d</p><p>Nate frowned, but he didn\u2019t blow up at me. In fact, I couldn\u2019t read him at all. Rolling over, I leaned up on my elbow and reached down hesitantly to trace the lines of his face. He seemed lost in thought, and I wondered if I\u2019d ruined everything.</p><p>I hoped not.</p><p>Nate was perfect for me\u2014sexy and smart with a good job and plans for the future. And I wanted him physically, there was no question about that. We\u2019d been making out for ten minutes and my panties were soaked, but lying was no way to build a relationship.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d he said, sitting up. Then he caught my hand and pulled me to my feet, gesturing toward a deck chair. I sat as he handed me my glass of wine. He sighed, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI really blew it, didn\u2019t I?\u201d I asked hesitantly. I felt moisture prickling my eyes. Why had I been so stupid?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cDid you? You say you didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cI got the hell out. But I don\u2019t feel right sleeping with you unless I\u2019m honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you actually want to sleep with me? Or do you want Hayes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to sleep with you,\u201d I said firmly, because it was true. \u201cI think maybe I\u2019ve gone so long without sex it\u2019s making me crazy. I like you a lot, Nate. I can see us together in the future and it\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t want to mess that up before it even starts. But I\u2019m not sure where we even stand. Are we exclusive? I realized this week that we\u2019ve never even talked about it. Maybe we should.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze pinned mine, eyes assessing.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t exclusive,\u201d he said finally, and my heart clenched. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have any right to say you did something wrong. But I\u2019d like to be exclusive. What would you think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been seeing anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for the past couple weeks. But I won\u2019t lie\u2014up to that point I was still going out on the occasional date. And I think it\u2019s normal\u2014even healthy\u2014to experience attraction toward other people. Just because you\u2019re in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean your body turns off.\u201d</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t exactly romantic. I\u2019m not sure why I felt so let down ... It wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d expected a declaration of undying love. In fact, it should\u2019ve made me feel better, because obviously I hadn\u2019t done anything too heinous. Not if he\u2019d been seeing other women up until two weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cSo where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>Nate laughed.</p><p>\u201cBed, hopefully,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be with you, Loni. Exclusively. But only if you want that, too. We\u2019re both adults here, and I\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve outgrown our romantic delusions. Being with you makes me happy and I can see a future for us. If that\u2019s how you feel, I\u2019d love to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Now my heart clenched in a good way. I smiled at him and he grinned back, reaching forward to catch my hand. Lifting, he kissed my palm.</p><p>\u201cOf course, if you insist on just using me for sex, I\u2019ll make the best of it.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing as he pulled me up and caught me in a long, hard kiss. This time it felt right, like a bubble had popped and whatever lingering guilt and weirdness I felt about Reese evaporated. I dug my fingers into Nate\u2019s beautiful hair and gave myself over to the sensation of his tongue exploring my mouth.</p><p>So what if Reese was utterly lickable in every way? He wasn\u2019t real, not like Nate. Reese wanted a quick roll in the sheets, no strings. Nate wanted a partner.</p><p>My boyfriend was perfect. I didn\u2019t need\u2014or want\u2014anyone else.</p><p>Parenting sucks.</p><p>My phone started blaring Jessica\u2019s ringtone thirty seconds after we fell into bed, Nate\u2019s leg thrust between mine and his hands burrowing under my bra. I ignored it because she was eighteen years old and she could darned well survive on her own for an hour or two.</p><p>Then the phone rang again.</p><p>Nate groaned.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but maybe you should check it?\u201d he said. \u201cCould be an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe better be dying,\u201d I said with a scowl, reaching out for it blindly and almost knocking over Nate\u2019s bedside lamp in the process. I found the phone right as it went to voice mail, flopping back on the bed and staring at the little screen in disgust.</p><p>Then Nate\u2019s phone went off.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? I\u2019m not on call this weekend. If I have to go in to work, someone\u2019s getting shot tonight,\u201d he muttered, climbing over me as he grabbed for his shirt, digging through the pockets.</p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s what we get for trying to have a real date,\u201d I said, feeling a deeply inappropriate laugh fighting to escape. Nate just looked so ... frustrated. Poor man.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if I can get disability for blue balls?\u201d he said, grabbing the phone and answering it. \u201cEvans here.\u201d</p><p>He stalked off to the bathroom as I looked back at my own phone. Might as well see what fresh trouble Jessica had gotten herself into. There were two missed calls, one from Jess and one from Mellie. No messages. Great. I hit the callback button and Jessica answered.</p><p>\u201cLoni, I need you to come and get me,\u201d she said, sounding defiant. Fantastic\u2014I recognized that tone. Jess had gotten herself into trouble and she didn\u2019t want to admit she\u2019d made a mistake, so she was going on the attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut at the Reapers clubhouse.\u201d</p><p>I froze. \u201cWhat are you doing out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come and get me,\u201d she said, hanging up the phone. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Nate stepped out of the bathroom, his face a mixture of annoyance and apology.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go in,\u201d he said. \u201cApparently we had two guys on work release from the jail walk off this afternoon. Not violent offenders, but it\u2019ll be a PR nightmare if the paper gets hold of it before we\u2019ve got them back in custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica\u2019s got herself in trouble again, too,\u201d I said, sighing. \u201cSome date. We can\u2019t catch a break, can we?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and then I started giggling. He glared at me, a reluctant smile crossing his face.</p><p>\u201cI think the universe is determined to keep me from getting laid,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>\u201cWould love to say you\u2019re imagining that,\u201d I told him, pulling on my shirt. \u201cBut I think you might be right. Call me tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he muttered. He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cSorry. Shitty timing tonight.\u201d</p><p>He stepped into me and I wrapped my arms around him in a long hug. It turned into a kiss that didn\u2019t exactly help the situation. Nate might not be Reese Hayes, but he was here and he was mine and I wanted to have sex with him. Instead I tugged free and reached for my jeans.</p><p>Like I said, being a parent sucks.</p><p>My mood was ugly as I drove out to the Reapers clubhouse for the second weekend in a row. Sure, Nate and I had managed to end our date with a laugh, but I\u2019d just about had it with Jess and her games.</p><p>Reese Hayes pissed me off, too.</p><p>He\u2019d promised Jess wouldn\u2019t be allowed back into the clubhouse, and I\u2019d scrubbed his stupid toilets to seal the deal. Apparently his promises didn\u2019t mean shit, because here we were again. That\u2019s when my phone rang again. I grabbed it, answering without even looking to see who it was.</p> <p>\u201cGot your girl here,\u201d Hayes\u2019s voice purred in my ear. \u201cI\u2019m taking her over to your house. She says you\u2019re on a date. Think you can ditch lover boy long enough to meet us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d I said, frowning at myself. Of course he\u2019d call being all helpful right after I\u2019d been thinking bad things about him ... \u201cI\u2019m headed out to the Armory right now. I\u2019ll grab her there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready in the truck,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re having a nice little chat along the way\u2014I\u2019m explaining what the words \u2018stay the hell away\u2019 mean. See you in a few.\u201d</p><p>He hung up on me and I groaned. Jessica would pay for this. I. Was. Done. Done. I couldn\u2019t keep fighting her\u2014if the girl was truly determined to destroy herself, I couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>The realization hit me so suddenly that I swerved the van and nearly went off the road.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t control Jess and I needed to stop trying.</p><p>Holy cow. That changed everything.</p><p>My job had been to raise her and I\u2019d given it my all, but the little brat was actually right about one thing. Legally she was an adult. I could offer her advice and make sure she had access to health care, but I really couldn\u2019t stop her from destroying herself.</p> <p>The thought was both terrifying and liberating.</p><p>Implications swirled through my brain as I pulled up to my little house, which was located right on the edge of town, near Fernan. I could be free now ... Free to move on with life. Free to stop living my entire life around one young woman\u2019s whiplash hormones and emotions and crazy mood swings.</p><p>Shivering, I wondered if that made me a horrible person, because my overriding feeling on this was relief.</p><p>I parked next to Reese Hayes\u2019s big black truck. Light blazed through the windows of my place, a 1950s cinder block with three tiny bedrooms, one bath, and zero character. I\u2019d grown up in it with Amber, who\u2019d come to live with us when her mom went to prison. In some ways it was more Jessica\u2019s home than mine, because she\u2019d been there on and off since birth. I\u2019d only moved back in six years ago when Mom had passed on. She\u2019d had a heart attack, right after Amber\u2019s near-fatal overdose. Suddenly I\u2019d been left alone with a child who needed a real parent, one who knew what she was doing.</p><p>Instead she got me.</p><p>I heard voices as I approached the door, which was open a crack. (The frame had swollen up last winter and never quite gone back to normal, so you really had to fight to close it all the way. It was sandwiched on the repair list between fixing the car and replacing the oven.)</p><p>\u201cYour cousin deserves better than this,\u201d I heard Hayes saying, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile. Glad someone noticed my efforts. \u201cIf she\u2019s smart, she\u2019ll kick you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll never kick me out,\u201d Jess declared, and her voice sounded a little smug. A little slurred, too ... Had she been drinking? Probably. \u201cShe\u2019d feel guilty. She\u2019ll always take care of me because she has to\u2014you don\u2019t know shit about us.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou think she takes care of you out of guilt?\u201d he asked. \u201cNope\u2014she loves you, although I can\u2019t quite figure out why. You need to decide what you want to do with your life, because you can\u2019t just drain her dry forever. Sooner or later she\u2019ll be done with you.\u201d</p><p>His words sounded so close to my own thoughts it was almost creepy. It also made me feel guilty, because the statement was so cold and hard. Not to mention true.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon is my business, little girl,\u201d he said, and his tone was anything but nice. \u201cI have plans for her, and they don\u2019t include her crying over your bullshit. Don\u2019t piss me off.\u201d</p><p>Yikes. I pushed through the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jess,\u201d I said, spotting my young cousin. She\u2019d flopped back on the couch, one arm draped melodramatically over her eyes like a silent movie heroine. Clearly, her life was simply too dreadful to tolerate.</p><p>\u201cMake him go away,\u201d she muttered. I glanced over at Hayes, who leaned against the little bar separating the living room from the kitchen. His eyes heated when they touched me, and I wondered what exactly he meant when he said he had plans for me ... No, I took that back. I really didn\u2019t want to know what he meant. I just wanted him gone.</p><p>No, you want him in bed, my brain insisted. You want more kisses like the one he gave you at the Armory.</p><p>Unacceptable. I ignored Jess, walking over to him, determined to take control of the situation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks for bringing her home,\u201d I said, forcing myself to be polite even though\u2014like usual\u2014he simultaneously scared the crap out of me and turned me on. I also resented the fact that he\u2019d invaded my space, which made no sense at all considering he was only trying to help out. Of course, it could be the fact that I was still a little worked up from my makeout session with Nate. Hayes was just so big and rugged ... Every time he moved, his arms flexed, and I wanted to wrap my hand around his bicep and feel those muscles working.</p><p>Snap out of it!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got things from here,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He jerked his chin toward my teenage drama queen.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d he asked. \u201cKid needs a wake-up call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d I repeated. \u201cLet me walk you to the door.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, then pushed himself off the counter.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks, Pic, sure nice of you to bring her home. You wanna sit for a bit, maybe have a drink?\u201d he muttered sarcastically as I pulled the door open. I rolled my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got all the drama I need,\u201d I said, unable to stop a rueful smile. He didn\u2019t smile back. Nope. He just looked at me for long seconds, something heavy and tangible growing in the air between us. I could almost see the wheels spinning in his head. Then he shook his head slowly, as if making a decision.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do drama, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Hayes stepped toward me and I bit back a startled squeak as he stalked across the floor, the ancient carpet allowing him to move silently, like some kind of great predator.</p><p>Please go out the door. Please go out the door. Please go out the door!</p><p>He didn\u2019t go out the door. He came to a halt about two inches from me, then reached over and caught the back of my head, burrowing his fingers into my hair. Then Hayes tugged me toward him, fingers tightening almost painfully. I stopped breathing as he lowered his head to mine.</p><p>His lips brushed across my cheekbone and I shivered. I swear to God, if he\u2019d touched me between my legs it couldn\u2019t have felt better than that slight whisper of sensation.</p><p>I wanted him more than Nate, I realized. A lot more.</p><p>\u201cYou have fun on your date?\u201d he asked, his voice low and heated. \u201cJess gave me all the details on the way back. She thinks your deputy boyfriend is a douche. Have to say I agree. Nate Evans is a pissant little shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re talking about me!\u201d Jessie yelled, startling me so much I jerked in his hold, hair pulling painfully. I\u2019d sort of forgotten about her playing Camille on the sofa. \u201cStop telling lies about me. I\u2019m going to my room.\u201d</p><p>She threw herself off the couch and stomped down the hallway, snorting and shaking her head. Probably just as well\u2014she was self-absorbed enough that she obviously didn\u2019t even notice what was happening between me and Hayes. Best to keep it that way.</p><p>His other hand wrapped around my waist, tugging me deep into his body. His hips pushed into mine suggestively and I felt the coiled strength in his arms. My nipples hardened (traitorous little bitches) and my eyes widened.</p><p>Hayes offered a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cYour girl told me he\u2019s no good for you,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, that might just be because he arrested two of her friends last week. Let one of them off, booked the other. Girl who walked free was real pretty, too. He tell you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he?\u201d I gasped as his hand slid down my rear, fingers cupping and tightening on me. He tilted my head as casually as if I were a doll, studying my mouth. Nate, I reminded myself frantically. Less than an hour ago you were in bed with your boyfriend. Good guy, not a thug, unlike some. \u201cHe arrests people all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the sheriff\u2019s a good friend of the club?\u201d he asked, his voice mesmerizing. I shook my head as much as I could, wondering where he was going with this. \u201cHe and I like to get together every week or so, share a beer. He\u2019s got lots to say about your boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNate\u2019s not a boy.\u201d</p><p>Hayes\u2019s lips ghosted across mine, and then he sucked my lower lip into his mouth. My legs clenched and in that instant I wanted him far more than I\u2019d ever wanted anyone else. More than Nate, more than my ex ... more than my high school boyfriend who took my virginity in a frantic, pawing frenzy when I was seventeen years old at a party out at Hauser Lake. I wanted that big, hard weapon of his deep inside me, spreading me open and pinning me down and making me scream until my voice broke.</p><p>I needed to get rid of him and go talk to Jessie.</p><p>Call Nate.</p><p>Be a good girl.</p><p>\u201cHe says Deputy Dick has problems following the rules,\u201d Hayes murmured, pulling free of my mouth. His lips traced along my jaw, nipping and sucking. I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t do anything, because all I could think about was ripping off his clothes and jumping him.</p><p>No! Bad London!</p><p>\u201cHe also says there\u2019s been several complaints about him harassing young girls. Nate ever mention any of that to you? How about Jessica? She have any problems with him?\u201d</p><p>His words hit me like a slap across the face, waking me up.</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, his eyes cool and calculating ... The hard length against my stomach stayed hot, though. And the hands still holding me captive against him?</p><p>They burned.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should learn a little more about your boyfriend before getting too involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you have any room to judge?\u201d I hissed, thinking of the girls I\u2019d seen out at the Armory. \u201cJess doesn\u2019t like Nate because she doesn\u2019t like me having any kind of life outside of her. Just an immature teen being selfish\u2014it doesn\u2019t go any deeper than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuck anyone unless they want me to,\u201d he said, slowly shaking his head. \u201cYou sure Natie-poo can say the same thing? You seem to think I\u2019m the enemy, but I\u2019ve always been straight up with you. I\u2019m straight up with everyone I stick my cock into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t sticking your ...\u201d I clenched my teeth, because I didn\u2019t let myself use words like that. I wouldn\u2019t let him win by tempting me to, either.</p><p>\u201cCock,\u201d he said, relishing the word. \u201cI want to stick my cock into your pussy. Don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll get you nice and ready first. Open you up with my fingers, make sure you\u2019re so wet and hot that when you wrap around me, it\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m fucking a goddess because you\u2019re goddamn perfect, London. I can\u2019t wait to feel your cunt squeezing me. Lick your clit, taste you ... It\u2019ll be good between us. You know it will.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My knees weakened\u2014like, weakened for real. Not just a figure of speech. I literally wanted Reese Hayes inside me so badly I had trouble supporting my own weight, which was a huge problem. Then his hand squeezed my butt almost spasmodically, and I saw a hint of sweat start to bead on his forehead.</p><p>If Reese Hayes wanted me even half as much as I wanted him ... Stop thinking about it! I needed him out of here. Now. Before I did something really, truly insane like drag him back into my bedroom and ride him until I completely forgot about Nate.</p><p>The man I\u2019d almost had sex with less than an hour ago.</p><p>Oh. My. God. When had I become such a faithless slut?</p> <p>I put up my hands and shoved against his chest\u2014hard\u2014until he let me go. Reese stepped back, holding up his hands, a mocking smile on his face. He obviously saw right through me. My eyes darted away, which was a huge mistake because they caught on his jeans instead. The giant bulge in his pants made me feel even more unsteady, everything melting and mixed up deep inside.</p><p>How could this be? Why could a man I didn\u2019t even like drive me crazy like this? Make me doubt Nate, who\u2019d never done a thing to make me suspect him?</p><p>You. Have. A. Boyfriend.</p><p>I rubbed my face with one hand, leaning back against the wall for support.</p><p>\u201cJust go,\u201d I told him, refusing to meet his gaze. Instead I stared at the door, pointedly. \u201cThank you for bringing Jess home.\u201d</p> <p>Hayes laughed harshly, the sound a rough rasp along my spine.</p><p>\u201cSleep tight,\u201d he said, tapping the tip of my nose with his finger. Then he casually strolled out the door to his truck, as if he owned the place. I watched him, completely unable to look away from that beautiful butt of his. Why was he so helpful and hateful at the same time? And who was he to imply nasty things about Nate? I didn\u2019t believe it for a minute\u2014Nate was a total gentleman, and if the sheriff wasn\u2019t happy with him, he could just fire him. Hayes was a tainted source. Nobody even pretended the Reapers were on the up-and-up, so why he thought he could get away with making accusations like that I couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><p>I shoved the front door shut hard, wood scraping as it settled into the warped frame. Loud music burst suddenly out of Jessica\u2019s room, pushing me over the edge. Stalking down the hallway, I grabbed her doorknob.</p><p>Locked.</p><p>I pounded on the door and yelled at her, \u201cOpen up, Jess! We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Long seconds passed and the music got louder. Oh my God, was she really doing this? I thought my head might explode, I had so many conflicting emotions swirling around inside. Enough. I prowled through the kitchen and out the side door. The electrical panel was mounted on the wall right next to it. I ripped the small metal door open, slamming the breakers to the side.</p> <p>Instantly the house fell dark. And silent.</p><p>Hah!</p><p>I probably shouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it quite so much, but it was the first thing that\u2019d gone right for me that night. Then I stomped back in, bashing into the stove top with my hip. Ouch. I rubbed the small hurt as I jerked open the junk drawer. Slight miscalculation, I realized, peering down at it in the darkness. I should\u2019ve grabbed the little flathead screwdriver I\u2019d need to pop Jessica\u2019s lock before cutting the power. I dug my phone out of my pocket, flipping on the flash-light app. There it was.</p><p>I snatched the tool and stomped back to Jessica\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cYou going to let me in?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou can go to hell! You have no right to tell me what to do! I\u2019m an adult!\u201d</p><p>My blood pressure rose. \u201cMy house, my rules. Open the damned door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d</p> <p>I growled, sliding the tiny screwdriver into the hole in the knob, popping it open easily enough. Wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d had to break into her room.</p><p>I opened it to find Jess glaring at me by the light of a candle. \u201cI asked you not to burn things in here,\u201d I said, even more frustrated than I\u2019d been before. She\u2019d nearly set the place on fire a couple of months ago. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die in my sleep because you like candles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, fuck you,\u201d I snapped back at her. Jess froze, because I didn\u2019t cuss. Not that I couldn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019d just made a conscious decision when I first took custody of her not to set a bad example with my language. So much for that. \u201cI\u2019m about done with your shit, Jessica. You think you\u2019re an adult? Fine. Starting this month you pay rent. You follow the rules or you\u2019re out on your ass. How\u2019s that for treating you like an adult?\u201d</p><p>She gaped at me, then quick as a snake she grabbed a picture frame off her dresser and threw it at me. I ducked as she started screaming, darting out of the room and slamming the door behind me.</p><p>What the hell had just happened?</p><p>Another crash hit the wood behind me and then another. The kid must be tearing apart her room. I heard yet another shriek, then the door flew open. Jess stood there, bag in one hand and her phone in the other.</p><p>\u201cYou can go fuck yourself,\u201d she hissed, pushing past me to stomp down the hall. \u201cI don\u2019t need you.\u201d</p><p>I followed her, a detached part of my brain observing that she really needed to expand her vocabulary.</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2014exactly\u2014do you think this will play out?\u201d I asked her, crossing my arms in determination.</p><p>Jess ignored me, jerking open the front door and marching out across the porch. Then she started down the driveway, frantically texting as she kicked the occasional rock out of her path.</p><p>Just like her mother, I realized. I should go after her, make her stop.</p><p>No.</p><p>I should make sure that candle was out and then I should go to bed. Why keep fighting? She\u2019d come home sooner or later. She wants to be an adult? Let her figure it out for herself. She just saw the doctor, she should be safe enough ...</p><p>So instead of chasing down the girl I\u2019d spent the last six years raising, I poured myself a glass of wine and drank it, pondering how I\u2019d lost control of my life.</p><p>Nate. Reese. Jessica and Amber.</p><p>Right now I didn\u2019t want to see or talk to any of them.</p><p>Defiantly, I poured a second glass, followed by a third. Then\u2014feeling warm and giddy and relaxed for the first time in forever\u2014I called my college roommate, Dawn, and we talked for two hours, laughing like we were still twenty years old. By three in the morning I still hadn\u2019t heard anything from Jess, but for once I didn\u2019t care. I just collapsed into bed, reveling in the peace and quiet.</p><p>It was fantastic.</p><p>You know, there\u2019s a party game I\u2019ve played before, where people try to decide where they\u2019d go or what they\u2019d do if they could travel back in time. Some people say they\u2019d go back and meet Jesus, or kill Hitler, or talk to Albert Einstein ... But if I could go back and change one thing, it\u2019d be the fact that I went to bed that night without finding my girl first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead, I\u2019d use my time machine to smash that damned wine bottle and chase Jessica down the road. Stop her. Find some way to convince her that she deserved better\u2014more\u2014than following her mother\u2019s path.</p><p>But did I do it?</p><p>No, I went to sleep and didn\u2019t get up until nearly noon on Saturday. Then I went to the gym, following my workout up with a pedicure. I felt all empowered about it, too, because I knew she\u2019d be back.</p><p>Only Jessica never came back.</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>REESE</p><p>I spent my weekend horny and pissed off.</p><p>London\u2019s mouth, her smell, those amazing tits ... I wanted those lips wrapped around my cock, I wanted those hands buried in my hair, and I wanted my dick in her cunt. Maybe her ass. Hell yes. Then I\u2019d fuck her boobs because I wouldn\u2019t want them to feel left out, now would I?</p><p>Instead I jerked off and tried to remind myself of all the reasons getting involved with her would be a massive mistake.</p> <p>Then I\u2019d picture her touching Nate Evans. Nearly sent me over the fuckin\u2019 edge, because I\u2019d actually smelled him on her Friday night. Like gangrene.</p><p>Gave serious thought to killing him for touching what was mine.</p><p>But London wasn\u2019t mine. The thought drove me crazy, because I had zero desire to claim a woman, at least not for longer than a night. Still, my gut insisted she should belong to me \u0327 which scared me shitless. Wanting someone like that leads to needing them, and loving them leads to ... hell.</p><p>Heather died slowly.</p><p>I remembered everything about that day\u2014worst fuckin\u2019 hours of my life. Her frail body, nothing more than pale skin stretched tight over bones gone brittle. Our daughters drifting in and out of the room, crying and begging while the light in her eyes faded. Then the beautiful girl I\u2019d fallen in crazy love with my senior year of high school left me.</p><p>Forever.</p> <p>Never wanted more than one woman and then I had to put her in the ground, cold and alone. I\u2019d sworn that day to never let myself care like that again.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t risk it.</p><p>But London filled my head until I couldn\u2019t hardly think straight. Apparently I wasn\u2019t a joy to be around, either, because by Sunday afternoon the guys actually kicked me out of the Armory. Said I could come back when I stopped being an asshole, and that situation wasn\u2019t looking promising.</p><p>I\u2019d stomped around the courtyard, yelling at the prospects until Bolt took pity on me, dragging me up into the National Forest lands behind the clubhouse to harvest some firewood. We\u2019d make the prospects split and stack it for seasoning once we got back, but there\u2019s something very primal and satisfying about felling a tree and cutting it up with a chainsaw. Gotta love power tools and destruction. Not quite as good as getting laid, but better than losing your mind imagining a very unavailable cunt squeezing some other man\u2019s dick.</p><p>Never cared for the good deputy. Taking him out would be a public service, right? But ultimately not even I could justify taking out a lawman over a woman. Maybe I should just steal her out from under him, maybe rub it in his face. Yeah. That\u2019d work. I liked that idea a lot, and the more I considered it, the more it grew on me.</p><p>Now Bolt and I were out in the middle of nowhere and things were coming clear. I felt sweaty, tired, and more sane than I had since leaving London\u2019s place, thanks to my club brother\u2019s timely intervention. Nobody ever really understood me like Bolt and I\u2019d missed the hell out of him while he was doing time these past three years. He was more than a solid vice president\u2014he was the man I trusted more than anyone else on earth.</p><p>He\u2019d come back different, though. Harder, more cynical than I\u2019d ever seen him before. I guess getting locked up for a crime you didn\u2019t commit changes a man.</p><p>Didn\u2019t help that his old lady, Maggs, had ditched his ass.</p> <p>Sore subject, and not one he liked to talk about. She had her reasons and I guess from her perspective leaving him made sense. But a man inside does whatever it takes to get by. Bolt hadn\u2019t had any allies to protect him during that final stretch, so he\u2019d done what he had to do. She never quite understood that.</p><p>Shit happens, I guess.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for tonight?\u201d I asked him as he tossed the chainsaw into the back end of the truck. Between it and the trailer, we\u2019d cut and loaded nearly two cords. Good haul for an afternoon\u2019s work.</p><p>\u201cNo plans,\u201d he said, opening the crew cab and digging into the cooler. He pulled out a beer and cracked it, offering one to me. I turned it down, grabbing a water instead. \u201cThought I might head over to The Line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen spendin\u2019 a lot of time there,\u201d I said casually.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 quite like pussy,\u201d he replied, pulling up his shirt to wipe the sweat off his face. He\u2019d acquired some new ink inside, of varying quality. \u201cWent a long time without, gotta make up for that.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, although it wasn\u2019t entirely the truth. He might not\u2019ve gotten the one he wanted, but he hadn\u2019t gone without, either. Got me thinking.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the baby?\u201d</p><p>Bolt snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhat baby? Startin\u2019 to doubt it was real.\u201d</p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cSo Maggs left you over nothin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she left me because I cheated on her. Now that cunt Gwen says she lost the kid\u2014assuming she was actually knocked up in the first place. I don\u2019t know what to believe about that anymore.\u201d</p><p>I stilled.</p><p>\u201cYou think she wasn\u2019t really pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d he asked, taking another drink. \u201cAt least I\u2019m rid of the bitch, so I guess that\u2019s something. And tonight I\u2019ll get laid, so life is good.\u201d</p><p>I nodded slowly, knowing life was anything but good for my club brother. He missed the hell out of his old lady. We all did. She\u2019d been solid the entire time he was gone, stood by him when he went down in the first place and then worked day and night to bring him home again. Women like that weren\u2019t easy to find.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna come with me?\u201d Bolt asked. \u201cGet laid. Clear your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Bolt was right\u2014The Line was a great place to find no-strings snatch, which was exactly what I needed. If I spent one more night jerking off while imagining London, I\u2019d have to shoot myself. Couldn\u2019t stop thinkin\u2019 of those tits, the way she\u2019d melted under my touch.</p><p>Did she have pink nipples or brown?</p><p>Maybe Evans was sucking on them right now. Fucker wasn\u2019t working this weekend. Already checked, even tried to get Bud to call him in, but the bastard had taken personal leave and not even the sheriff could cancel that. Not without a state of emergency. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Probably spending that time with London. Comforting her.</p><p>Maybe even fuckin\u2019 her right at this minute.</p><p>I imagined slowly strangling the man, watching his face turn purple and his eyes bulge while his legs kicked and bucked in desperation. Nothin\u2019 fucked up about that, right?</p><p>Christ, but I wanted inside that woman.</p> <p>Knew from the minute I\u2019d seen her six months ago she\u2019d be the end of me. Put her off bounds that same night, although I\u2019d been hell-bent on staying away from her. Women like that were trouble\u2014definitely not club whore material, which meant she\u2019d probably get all pissy about a one-night stand, and not in the market to be an old lady, either. Nope, women like her wanted picket fences and nine-to-five husbands so pussy-whipped they forgot their own names.</p><p>Add in the fact that she was the first reliable cleaner we\u2019d found in nearly three years? Recipe for disaster.</p><p>Now I\u2019d hit uncharted territory, because I\u2019d tasted her and the taste wasn\u2019t going away\u2014time to face reality. Sooner or later I\u2019d take her, and that fuckwad of a boyfriend wasn\u2019t going to get in my way. Hell, if she knew all the games he was playing, she\u2019d get down on her knees and beg me to step in.</p><p>The image of her down on her knees ... now that was a thing of beauty.</p><p>Maybe I should blow off The Line, track her down. Evans was the biggest problem\u2014so far as she knew, he was still Prince Charming. I\u2019d planted the seed, but now I had to step back, wait for him to fuck things up.</p> <p>He would, of course.</p><p>Man like that could only pretend for so long. London needed to see his shit for herself, otherwise she\u2019d always wonder, which would be damned inconvenient for me.</p><p>Fuck me ... Why should I give a shit about her regrets?</p><p>Losing my damned mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hit the strip club with you,\u201d I told Bolt. \u201cSee if the brothers want to join us. Been a while since we all went out.\u201d</p><p>Bolt grunted and we climbed into the truck, big diesel engine roaring to life. I felt the weight of the trailer tug at the rig as I started cautiously down the mountain. By the time we hit the halfway mark my phone came to life, pinging as the messages and texts I\u2019d gotten while we were out of range downloaded.</p> <p>\u201cShit, sounds like Grand Central,\u201d Bolt said, raising a brow. \u201cYou think we got a problem?\u201d</p><p>I slowed the truck to a stop in the center of the narrow logging road, grabbing the phone for a quick look. First up was a text from Horse saying we needed to talk\u2014maybe news from the south? Seemed like we heard new stories about the cartel every day now. They were plowing through the Devil\u2019s Jacks\u2019 territory way too fast, which was very bad news for the Reapers. The Jacks were our buffer zone, the first line of defense against the southern gangs.</p><p>But Horse\u2019s message wasn\u2019t what really caught my attention.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>The fact that London Armstrong had called three times and left two voice mails stopped me dead in my tracks. I hit the button.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Hayes,\u201d she said, voice strained but still full of that strange formality she used to distance herself. Fuckin\u2019 ridiculous\u2014I\u2019d sucked on her lips and dug my fingers into her ass. Time to start using first names. Instead of pissing me off, though, it kind of turned me on. \u2019Course everything she did turned me on.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s London. I have a favor to ask\u2014do you think you could ask around about Jessica? See if maybe she\u2019s gotten in touch with anyone in your club? She was pretty angry Friday night after you left. In fact, she took off. I thought she\u2019d come back by now, but she hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then spoke again, her voice shaking. \u201cI\u2019m starting to get worried.\u201d</p> <p>Fucking great. Not enough that the little brat got herself into constant trouble\u2014now she had to go running off, too? I seriously doubted that she\u2019d talked to anyone at the club. They all knew she was hands off, not than anyone gave a shit. Girls like her came and went, and nobody paid much attention. If one disappeared, there was always another to take her place.</p><p>London was in a different class and I didn\u2019t like the idea of her worrying. Woman had enough shit to deal with already. I hit play on the second message, which she\u2019d only left about half an hour ago. This time she dropped the pretense of formality.</p><p>\u201cReese, I\u2019m really worried about Jess. Can you call or message me? I know things are ... awkward ... between us, but I\u2019d like to rule out whether she\u2019s with someone from the club. Nobody has seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I muttered, then glanced over at Bolt. \u201cGive me a sec?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and I stepped out of the truck, hitting the callback button. She answered on the fourth ring.</p><p>\u201cReese?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was tense, but I still liked the sound of my name on her tongue. Of course, it\u2019d sound sweeter if she was screaming it into a pillow while I pounded her from behind. Funny how that worked.</p><p>\u201cGot your messages, sweetheart,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll check with the brothers, but if she\u2019d shown up at the Armory, they would\u2019ve told me. They know she\u2019s not supposed to be out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think she could\u2019ve gone to someone\u2019s house?\u201d she asked, her voice tentative. \u201cMaybe one of those men we found her with the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Painter and Banks wouldn\u2019t touch her, not after I put her off-limits. Hate to break it to you, but she\u2019s nothing special. Not worth a fight at the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, although she probably didn\u2019t. Outsiders never did.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Deputy Dick have to say? He helpin\u2019 you out?\u201d</p><p>She made a strange, strangled noise, which she tried to cover with a cough.</p><p>\u201cNate told me kids her age take off all the time and not to worry about it. And no, he\u2019s not around. I\u2019ve only talked to him once\u2014he didn\u2019t return my calls yesterday, and he\u2019s working this morning. I guess they\u2019ve got a lot going on this weekend. Mandatory overtime.\u201d</p><p>Lying asshole. What kind of game was he playing with her? My inner caveman decided it didn\u2019t matter. Fuck safety, and fuck picket fences. London Armstrong obviously couldn\u2019t take care of herself, which meant someone needed to step in and fix this shit. If that meant claiming her, so be it. As for Evans, I\u2019d put that fucker in the ground a hundred miles from the nearest town with a clear conscience the next time he decided to play games.</p><p>Proud of you, baby, Heather murmured.</p><p>I growled, because my dead wife didn\u2019t get a vote. If she really cared about me, she wouldn\u2019t have died. And London? I\u2019d had enough of her shit, too. That bitch was gonna be mine and I didn\u2019t share. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You do realize you\u2019re crazy, right?</p><p>At least crazy worked for me. Always had.</p><p>\u201cReese? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Poor woman was scared and alone, and now I was growling at her because I\u2019d lost my fucking mind, apparently. I rubbed my chin, thinking quickly. I needed to play things smart, nudge her in the right direction if I wanted to do this right. All Evans really needed was enough rope to hang himself. He\u2019d do the rest for me ...</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s some truth to what he said,\u201d I said, trying to sound somewhat sane and sympathetic. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not exactly a comfort. Is there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to all her friends. I can\u2019t imagine where she went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably holed up with some boy somewhere. Jess is a pretty girl\u2014wouldn\u2019t be hard for her to find someone to take her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would\u2019ve told one of her friends, though. None of them have heard from her.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, rubbing the bridge of my nose, torn between laughter, frustration, and a hint of crazed exaltation. Christ, but London was naive. No idea how she\u2019d pulled that off at her age, but there was no question the woman was clueless. I wondered if that cluelessness extended to her sexual experience, too. Might be fun to teach her new things. Of course, if she already had some tricks, that\u2019d be nice, too.</p> <p>\u201cThey won\u2019t tell you, honey. They\u2019ll cover for her because that\u2019s what teenage girls do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe most of them, but not Melanie,\u201d London said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one Jessica relies on the most, and she\u2019s completely freaked out. Said she got some weird text from her about heading south.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s down south?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that I can think of,\u201d London said. \u201cI mean, the last time I heard from her mother, she was living near San Diego, but I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d lift a finger for Jess, let alone invite her to come and stay with her. Amber is a selfish bitch who doesn\u2019t want the men in her life to know she\u2019s old enough to have an adult daughter. Jess doesn\u2019t have the money to get down there anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come over?\u201d I asked her, and in that moment my intentions were almost decent. Didn\u2019t like her being scared, and not even I was such a dick that I\u2019d use her little cousin running away to fuck her. Probably. Maybe.</p><p>Who was I kidding? Of course I would.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t alone,\u201d I said. \u201cI have daughters, remember? They\u2019re good kids but sometimes it\u2019s hell\u2014that\u2019s when things are going right. I\u2019ll grab some food and we can hang out for a while, help pass the time. Unless you have other plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning to pace and look at my phone,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can pace and look at your phone while we eat. I\u2019ll be over around seven, need to unload my truck and get a shower first. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know ... I don\u2019t want anything happening between us, Reese. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll behave,\u201d I told her. Unlikely. \u201cAnd try calling your cousin, see if she\u2019s heard anything. Never hurts to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, sounding defeated.</p><p>I hung up and climbed back into the truck, considering the situation. No idea where the kid was, but Nate Evans was sure as hell making things easy for me.</p> <p>Fuckin\u2019 idiot to leave his woman open and ripe for the taking.</p><p>London needed sympathy, someone to take care of her. Dumbass should\u2019ve picked up on that. Of course, Deputy Dick didn\u2019t have a reputation for being the most sensitive of guys. He\u2019d put the pressure on more than one of our dancers during late-night \u201ctraffic stops\u201d before we\u2019d come to an understanding about his behavior.</p><p>We\u2019d come to an understanding about London, too. Soon.</p><p>\u201cAll good?\u201d Bolt asked.</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d I told him. \u201cGotta bail on tonight, though. Something came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness or pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. Stopping by to see London Armstrong.\u201d</p><p>Bolt grinned. \u201cI knew you were into her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly a secret I\u2019m lookin\u2019 to fuck her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat what you\u2019ll be doing tonight? Fuckin\u2019 her?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, because I honestly had no idea. Last time I\u2019d felt this way, I\u2019d been eighteen years old and crazy over Heather.</p><p>\u201cDepends. She\u2019s havin\u2019 a shitty weekend. Not sure what the best strategy is just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually your strategy involves getting them naked and then pushing them out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation with London is a little more complicated than that,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cIs this the point where I sing the little song about Pic and London sittin\u2019 in a tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want the tree shoved up your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be worth it,\u201d Bolt said, his voice sly. I flipped him off, suddenly in a very good mood.</p><p>No fool like an old one, I guess, but damned if I didn\u2019t feel like I was eighteen all over again.</p><p>LONDON</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her mother\u2014she belongs with me,\u201d Amber declared, her voice smug with triumph. I\u2019d called her knowing Reese had to be wrong. Jessica would never go to Amber, even if she was furious with me. She knew better ... But apparently she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Nothing made sense anymore.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want your boyfriend to know you\u2019re old enough to have a grown daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows I got pregnant young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got pregnant at twenty-two, not twelve.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed.</p><p>\u201cDid she at least take her health insurance card with her? You have to keep a close eye on her\u2014things can go south so fast. I really think you should send her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShove it up your ass, Loni,\u201d she said, just like we were in middle school again. I could almost see her rolling her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sick of your lectures and bullshit. Go back to your boring life cleaning up other people\u2019s shit. I have a maid now, you know. My boyfriend hired her for me. Guess you were wrong about how I\u2019d turn out, hmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I at least talk to her?\u201d</p><p>Instead of replying, Amber hung up. I sighed, studying my phone with mixed emotions. Jess was safe. Somehow she\u2019d gotten a flight down to San Diego, something I would\u2019ve said was impossible. The last time we\u2019d spoken, my cousin made it clear she had no interest in seeing her daughter. None. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>I decided to call Nate again, because the more I thought about it, the more suspicious I got. I knew he was working, so I figured I\u2019d have to leave a voice mail. When he answered, it took me off guard.</p><p>\u201cHey Loni\u2014what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found Jessica,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good news,\u201d he said \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown in San Diego with her mother. I didn\u2019t actually talk to her myself. She still isn\u2019t answering her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, rubbing my temple. Nate just didn\u2019t seem to feel any urgency about the situation, and it frustrated me.</p><p>\u201cNot much of a relief,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. Amber is living with some rich boyfriend and she doesn\u2019t want him knowing she has a daughter Jessica\u2019s age. I tried to take Jess to visit her last summer and she wouldn\u2019t let us come. I think Amber is up to something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHon ...\u201d he said, and his voice was patient, loving, and condescending as hell. \u201cYou sound crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not,\u201d he replied soothingly. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why this sounds so crazy, because it\u2019s not like you. I know you\u2019ve given everything for Jessica, but kids pull shit like this all the time. She\u2019s with a family member. At least you know she\u2019s safe, so maybe you should just enjoy the fact that she\u2019s finally out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a normal eighteen-year-old,\u201d I insisted, walking toward the kitchen. I found the wine I\u2019d picked up at the store earlier and grabbed my corkscrew. \u201cHer brain doesn\u2019t work right, you know that. And she has health issues. She doesn\u2019t even have a doctor down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody who\u2019s eighteen years old has a brain that works right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that\u2014we all know that. Kids are wonderful but they do stupid shit. Sooner or later she\u2019ll call you, ready to apologize. Until then fighting with her is pointless.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep swig straight from the bottle, because a glass just seemed like extra work at this point.</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything you can do to check on her?\u201d I asked, frustrated by his lack of sympathy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t cops have ways of finding people? Like, calling in favors from old friends or something? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve been watching too much TV,\u201d he said firmly, his voice going from condescending to annoyed. \u201cWe could call in a welfare check, but that\u2019s a waste of time and resources because you already know she\u2019s fine. You have to let this go and I have to get back to work. We\u2019ve started something good here, babe, but I\u2019m not interested in drama. Time to get over this shit.\u201d</p><p>He was probably right, but he didn\u2019t need to be a jerk about it.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I bothered you at work.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a moment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. But don\u2019t do it again, okay? Not unless it\u2019s a real emergency. It sucks that things aren\u2019t going like you hoped, but this doesn\u2019t qualify and I\u2019ve got shit going on. I\u2019m hanging up now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you still want to try to get together sometime this week?\u201d I asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014are we going to pick up where we left off on Friday?\u201d</p><p>The question startled me.</p><p>\u201cProbably ...\u201d</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cLoni, I like you a lot and I\u2019ve been a good guy, but I\u2019m tired of this. You\u2019re so caught up in Jessica that you don\u2019t have the energy for me. I\u2019m exhausted, I\u2019m grumpy, and I\u2019m not in the mood. Let\u2019s talk later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, so sorry that my family obligations are getting in your way,\u201d I snapped. \u201cBut I actually give a damn about Jessica. She\u2019s my responsibility. That doesn\u2019t just go away because she turned eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re still talking about Jess,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Then he hung up on me.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Nate hadn\u2019t been himself the past two days, not even a little bit. He\u2019d always been so concerned and supportive of me, even over the smallest things ... and he\u2019d never pressured me for sex. But now that I needed him, he\u2019d checked out. I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it.</p><p>You sure you really know him?</p><p>Reese\u2019s nasty little insinuations burrowed through my thoughts. I shouldn\u2019t leap to judgments, though, not while I was this upset\u2014my perspective was all messed up. I wasn\u2019t thinking straight.</p><p>Still, I\u2019d expected a little more sympathy from Nate. Isn\u2019t that what boyfriends do?</p><p>I sucked down another mouthful of wine, contemplating my unpleasant conversation with Amber. Apparently Jessica had flown down there yesterday, although it hadn\u2019t occurred to either of them that this was information I might like to have. I had no clue where the money for the plane ticket had come from, either.</p><p>Selfish, both of them. And Nate was selfish, too ... although maybe he was right in his own way. For better or worse, Jessica was an adult and she\u2019d made her decision. I should probably just accept it and let it go, because all this stress and worry wasn\u2019t accomplishing jack shit anyway.</p><p>At least the wine was still on my side.</p><p>An hour later I\u2019d finished the bottle and things were looking up. For example, with Jess gone, I wouldn\u2019t be stuck at home every weekend. I could go places, do things ... Sleep with Nate any time I wanted.</p><p>Assuming I still wanted to sleep with him.</p><p>But the more I thought about it, the less interested I was in following up on that. Sure, it wasn\u2019t like we were engaged or anything, but what\u2019s the point of having a boyfriend if he blows you off the first time you need him?</p><p>On the other hand, finally getting laid would be nice ...</p><p>I\u2019d completely forgotten about Reese until the doorbell rang just after seven that evening. By that point I was halfway through a second bottle of wine, which was half a bottle firmly over my limit. I opened the door to find him standing on my porch with a bag of Chinese in one hand and a six-pack of beer in the other. I ran my eyes up and down his strong form, deciding he looked fantastic.</p><p>I wanted to bite him.</p><p>Yeah, definitely over my limit on the vino\u2014I\u2019d had more to drink in this one weekend than the past two months combined. Too bad I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Biting Reese Hayes wouldn\u2019t be a problem if you ditched the boyfriend, my brain whispered insidiously. I decided my brain was right. If Nate gave a shit about being in a relationship with me, he wouldn\u2019t have been such a dick.</p><p>Oooh, and now I was cussing in my head. Fun!</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon in,\u201d I told Reese, suddenly starving. That bag of little white cartons smelled fantastic and I couldn\u2019t wait to rip into them. His eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be in a good mood,\u201d he murmured. I held up my wine bottle for him to see.</p> <p>\u201cI decided I needed a distraction,\u201d I told him bluntly. \u201cI called my cousin Amber. She\u2019s a bitch and I hate her ... Also Jessica is with her. She\u2019s fine, perfectly safe. Flew down there yesterday and they didn\u2019t bother to tell me. I\u2019m washing my hands of both of them.\u201d</p><p>I tried to rub my hands together like I was washing them and dropped my bottle in the process. Reese lunged, catching it midair. The motion set me off balance and I fell on my ass, laughing. He stared at me, a slow grin crawling across his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d I told him. \u201cFeels great, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to work tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the boss,\u201d I informed him proudly. \u201cI make my own schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he murmured, then reached down to catch my hand, pulling me to my feet. I lurched into him, rubbing my face against the hard muscles of his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou smell really good,\u201d I told him. \u201cReeallly good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a coffeepot?\u201d</p><p>I blinked up at him, running my hands up and over his shoulders. They were nice and hard, like silk stretched over ... something hard. I giggled because I couldn\u2019t think of the right word.</p><p>\u201cCoffeepot?\u201d he asked again.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to sober up, I think. What the hell is that smell?\u201d</p><p>I beamed at him, feeling pleased with myself.</p><p>\u201cThe self-cleaning cycle on the oven. I like to clean when I get frustrated, and there\u2019s nothing quite like a sparkly oven. You just turn it up to a million degrees, bake it, and then vacuum it out. Gas does all the hard work for you. Very cathartic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna kill me,\u201d he muttered, running a finger down my cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s get some coffee in you and eat. No more wine.\u201d</p><p>I pouted, because wine was my favorite. Then I forgot to pout because he smelled all yummy, and I wanted to see if he tasted as good as he smelled.</p><p>Now if I could just catch his lip and find out ...</p><p>REESE</p> <p>This was officially the most fucked-up dinner date I\u2019d ever had in my life.</p><p>London\u2014</p><p>Everyone calls me Loni, Reese, but I hate it. I like how you use my real name ... Can I touch your stomach?</p><p>\u2014was drunk off her ass, and I had a very bad feeling that if I fucked her, things wouldn\u2019t end well. Not normally a factor for me, really. I liked it when things didn\u2019t work out with women. Generally that was the goal.</p><p>Unfortunately, karma\u2019s a bitch and she had a lot on me.</p><p>I stared at the TV, pretending to watch the world\u2019s least interesting movie with London passed out all over me. Her tits smashed up against my chest, her legs straddled my thigh, and her hand lay on my stomach, precisely six inches from the top of my straining dick. I knew this because exactly once every sixty seconds I looked away from the screen to make sure it hadn\u2019t ripped a hole through my pants. Then I\u2019d start counting down again, because the counting was the only thing keeping me from rolling her over and shoving my cock so far up her cunt it hit the back of her throat. Yeah, that\u2019d wake her up ...</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t I doing this? Good question.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t because I\u2019m a good guy or she was too drunk or any of that shit. I\u2019ve never been a decent human being and didn\u2019t see a whole lot of reason to change things up at this stage of the game.</p><p>Decency isn\u2019t really my thing. This was about strategy.</p><p>London sighed in her sleep, pulling me a little closer as her hand slipped down. I groaned, and somehow my dick got harder, something I would\u2019ve bet a hundred dollars wasn\u2019t even possible. It actually hurt, and the smell of her hair drifting up toward my nose didn\u2019t exactly help.</p><p>She smelled like vanilla cookies.</p><p>I asked myself again why I wasn\u2019t currently fucking her. I had her at my mercy\u2014she was all over me. I should just take what she offered and enjoy it. Strategy was overrated.</p><p>She might actually make you happy, Heather told me sternly. Don\u2019t blow it, asshole.</p><p>Goddamn ghosts in my head.</p><p>Heather needed to back the fuck off, because I wasn\u2019t down with this shit. I hadn\u2019t actually died with her, despite the fact that it occasionally felt that way. She\u2019d left me to raise our girls all by myself and sometimes I hated her for it.</p><p>Fortunately, thinking of my girls made me smile.</p><p>Didn\u2019t even have the words to describe how much they meant to me. Somewhere along the way I\u2019d reengaged with life, for their sake if not my own. Biggest fight of my life, not crawling down into that grave with my wife. London was fighting the same kind of battle, in her own way. When shit hit the fan, she\u2019d charged life head-on, taken in Jessica and fought for her, despite the fact that she had an easy out. Nobody could have blamed her for passing Jess along to social services. I respected the way she threw down for her kid, even though Jess wasn\u2019t technically hers. She understood loyalty, and that family isn\u2019t always about blood.</p><p>Much as I hated to admit it, that was the kind of strength and loyalty it took to make a good old lady ... Then I shook my head, because I sure as shit wasn\u2019t going there. Claim her? Okay. But nobody could ever take Heather\u2019s place, let alone wear her patch.</p><p>Maybe I could find a happy medium, though, and that\u2019s where London came in. Screwing her tonight would complicate things in a way that could end with her hating me. I\u2019m nothing if not decisive, and I don\u2019t fuck around once I\u2019ve made up my mind. I wanted London and I definitely planned to keep her for a while.</p><p>That meant I should start things off right.</p><p>First order of business\u2014remove Deputy Dick from her life without scaring the hell out of her. If I had to suck it up for a while to make that happen, I had no doubt she\u2019d make it up to me down the line. Thus I found myself lying on a couch watching some dumbass movie with a dick harder than a diamond and no happy ending in sight.</p><p>London stirred against me again, letting out a soft snore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christ, her mouth was right by my nipple.

Respect only went so far.</p><p>The brothers would laugh their asses off if they saw me now.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sweetheart,\u201d I muttered, cradling her as I sat up awkwardly. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>London snuggled deeper into me, making protesting noises. She really wasn\u2019t very big, despite those fabulous tits of her. I lifted her easily enough and carried her back toward the bedrooms. Her door was open, revealing a neatly made queen-size bed. The room was decorated in what was probably thrift shop furniture, but it\u2019d been polished up and laid out in a way that looked put together and purposeful.</p> <p>Nothing like my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cStill pissed at you,\u201d she muttered as I tugged back the covers and tucked her in. Well, look at that. Sleeping Drunky was waking up, and I didn\u2019t even have to kiss her first.</p><p>\u201cDo I wanna know why?\u201d I asked. She frowned, eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cYou know why, Nate. But you can spend the night anyway ...\u201d</p><p>Nate? She thought I was Nate Evans?</p> <p>That fucking cockwad was not getting credit for this good deed.</p><p>My good intentions disappeared in an instant, brain turning off as instinct kicked in. Didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d decided to keep my hands off\u2014she didn\u2019t get to dream about Deputy Dick while I held her. That was a straight-up deal breaker, something both I and my cock felt very strongly about.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t Nate,\u201d I growled, sliding my fingers into her hair, gripping her head tight. She woke with a jerk, eyes wide and confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Nate,\u201d I growled. She blinked at me.</p><p>\u201cReese? What are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>Holy shit. I\u2019d brought her food, listened to her cry, and then held her half the night\u2014and she didn\u2019t even remember. Karma could suck my ass. I dropped down on the bed, shoving a knee between her legs, covering her with my body. My dick found her pubic bone, and I rotated my hips.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>Fucking hell that was sweet relief, even if it wasn\u2019t a money shot.</p><p>\u201cOh my God ...\u201d she whispered, eyes wide. \u201cReese, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I groaned, grinding against her so hard it hurt. She bucked back, whimpering, and I completely forgot about keeping things simple. I needed inside her. Now. The rest could wait. I caught her lips with mine, nipping them before thrusting my tongue deep in her mouth. Her hips bucked again, her hands digging into my chest.</p><p>Then she bit my tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I gasped, jerking away from her. Her eyes were wide and full of shock, which was right about the time I realized her hands weren\u2019t digging into my chest to rip off my shirt.</p><p>Nope.</p> <p>They were pushing against it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head. \u201cNate and I agreed not to see other people. I\u2019m still with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re with Nate, why the fuck wasn\u2019t he here when you needed him?\u201d</p><p>London closed her eyes, taking a deep breath. Unfortunately that forced her breasts up and into my chest. I thought my cock might actually explode, and not because I blew my wad. Nope, it might split from the sheer volume of blood trapped in there.</p><p>\u201cHe and I need to talk,\u201d she said, and I growled. Talk? She looked almost as frustrated as I felt. I rotated my hips into hers one more time, both of us gasping in need.</p><p>\u201cFuck that. Your cunt wants me inside as bad as my cock wants in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like Deputy Dick,\u201d I growled. \u201cBut you don\u2019t see me putting a bullet in him, do you? Stop bitching and let me fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and she shoved at my shoulders, hard. I rolled off her, chest heaving as I tried to make my brain work. Almost impossible, what with the complete lack of available blood. My cock throbbed. Literally. I felt each pulsing heartbeat hit it like a sledgehammer.</p><p>I wanted to kill her. Fuck her, then kill her. Then kill Nate Evans for putting me through this. Teach that cocksucker to move in on a Reaper\u2019s woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry that I got drunk and made an idiot of myself,\u201d London said after a long pause. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlow job would be nice.\u201d Throw in a fifth of vodka and a pole dance and maybe I\u2019d reconsider killing her ... but I wouldn\u2019t be happy until I\u2019d split her cunt wide open. I slammed my fist down on the bed. Fuck!</p><p>She squeaked. Like a mouse. It was cute, which pissed me off even more.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think you\u2019ve done enough,\u201d I said, closing my eyes and trying to think of something\u2014anything\u2014to distract me from the pain between my legs.</p><p>\u201cIt was really nice of you to come over and bring me dinner.\u201d</p><p>Nice.</p><p>Fucking bitch thought I was nice. If she thanked me for being her friend, it was over. I\u2019d have to go on a killing spree.</p><p>I gotta get out of here.</p><p>Jackknifing off the bed, I stalked out into the living room, looking for my keys. They were on the kitchen counter, right next to the empty take-out containers. She could buy her own fucking dinner and cry alone next time.</p><p>I heard her bare feet padding up behind me.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess this probably means our deal is off?\u201d</p><p>Her voice sounded uncertain, almost scared. Still a little slurred, too. I turned to glare at her, taking in her tangled blonde hair, the curve of her generous hips in those tight jeans, and the way her shirt drooped low enough to show plenty of cleavage.</p><p>\u201cNot if you want to keep the club accounts,\u201d I growled, wondering why the hell I didn\u2019t just fire her ass. My cock reminded me that we weren\u2019t finished with her yet. \u201cI\u2019ll see you out at my place on Tuesday. Make enough food for leftovers and maybe we\u2019ll have a talk about getting a crew into The Line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cEat shit,\u201d I said, and then slammed out the door.</p><p>Seems like a bit of an overreaction, Heather gloated as I climbed into my truck.</p><p>She could eat shit, too. Fucking women. Even dead, they stuck together.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>LONDON</p><p>\u201cSo, where does this leave us?\u201d Nate asked me Monday night. We sat at a table in the back of the restaurant \u0327 where the light hardly reached and the flickering of candlelight was supposed to make everything look romantic. Instead it felt claustrophobic and damning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHonestly? I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you needed me and I wasn\u2019t there. Do you think you can forgive me?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, wondering whether it mattered.</p><p>So he hadn\u2019t been there for me. I resented that. But he\u2019d had to work, and in his defense he dealt with runaways all the time. From his perspective, this was probably a pretty good outcome. She was with a family member, not kidnapped and murdered by a serial killer.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t even the real issue, though. I\u2019d been hot as hell for Reese Hayes, whether I liked to admit it or not. Nate and I had decided to make things exclusive\u2014then I crawled all over another man.</p><p>What kind of person does that?</p><p>Not a woman who\u2019s in love. Or even infatuated ... And if I\u2019d fallen out of infatuation in less than two months, that was pretty much it for me and Nate. Both of us deserved better, although I hadn\u2019t decided what that should look like. It\u2019d been fourteen years since I lived on my own. Was that why I\u2019d been so eager to hook up with Nate? Fear of being alone?</p><p>Why was I falling into that trap?</p><p>I kind of liked the idea of doing what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it. Maybe I should try eating ice cream for breakfast for a while, or color my hair bright red. Maybe I should buy a car that didn\u2019t have a cleaning service logo on the side of it.</p> <p>A red Miata. I\u2019d always wanted one of those.</p><p>Now came the hard part.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d I said slowly. Nate frowned, his hand covered mine, squeezing it tightly.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I think you\u2019re overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d I started to say, but then stopped myself. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me. Such a cliche, but in this case painfully true. Nate might not be perfect, but he was pretty great. He just wasn\u2019t the man I wanted. All I could think about was Reese and how he\u2019d felt between my legs.</p><p>Amazing.</p> <p>I wanted to feel that again. Alive and awake.</p><p>Was I actually going to sleep with him? I really hadn\u2019t decided ... The thought definitely appealed. He wasn\u2019t relationship material, but maybe I didn\u2019t need a relationship just yet.</p><p>Maybe I just needed to get laid.</p><p>Yup. Ice cream for breakfast, color hair, get laid, buy Miata. Then more ice cream. I had a plan.</p><p>\u201cLondon?\u201d</p><p>I focused on Nate again, blinking rapidly. His face was so earnest, so full of concern.</p><p>\u201cI think we should stop seeing each other,\u201d I said firmly, and the words felt right. Slightly painful, but liberating, too.</p><p>He frowned.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking up with me?\u201d he asked slowly, as if he couldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019d just said. \u201cJesus, Loni. I get that I fucked up, but this seems kind of harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve just realized that what I feel for you isn\u2019t strong enough. I\u2019m sorry. I wish I could change things\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Reese Hayes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, although part of me knew I was lying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about us,\u201d I told him. \u201cWe just aren\u2019t going to work, so it\u2019s best to end it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to sleep with me, not marry me,\u201d he snapped. \u201cGod, what the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Good question. I swallowed, because he was starting to look angry and I couldn\u2019t blame him for that. But I couldn\u2019t date someone out of guilt, either. Nope. A clean break was the only decent course of action.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said carefully. \u201cThere\u2019s no future here and I respect you too much to lead you on.\u201d</p><p>Nate threw his napkin on the table and leaned forward, eyes narrowed. His face was getting red and I realized I\u2019d never seen him upset before. What Reese had told me about him ran through my mind, but I pushed it away. This was Nate. Sweet Nate. He was hurt, and no wonder. None of this was fair to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Loni? You don\u2019t want to lead me on? What the hell do you think you\u2019ve been doing the last eight weeks? Is your cunt made of gold? Because I swear to God, women don\u2019t pull this shit with me and get away with it.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open and I gasped. Nate didn\u2019t talk like that. What on earth had happened here?</p><p>\u201cNate, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re over.\u201d He stood, glaring at me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much time I wasted on you.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned and walked away stiffly, rage all but radiating through the air around him.</p><p>Well. That was special.</p><p>I glanced around, hoping nobody had noticed our little scene. Amazingly they hadn\u2019t, despite the fact that it\u2019d felt pretty dramatic and spectacular to me. I\u2019d just gotten publicly dumped and it sort of hurt. Why it hurt, I had no idea. He\u2019d done to me what I\u2019d planned to do to him, so what right did I have to feel anything but relief?</p><p>Just be glad it\u2019s over.</p><p>The waiter walked over carrying two enormous platters of Mexican food, and I realized that not only had Nate dumped me, he\u2019d stuck me with the bill, too. Always look on the bright side. Without Jess to feed, I wouldn\u2019t have to cook for the next week. I\u2019d just work my way through Nate\u2019s jumbo carne asada entree.</p><p>\u201cCan you wrap those up to go?\u201d I asked the waiter. He cocked a brow, but wisely kept his mouth shut. I decided to give him a thirty percent tip, because someone should get something out of this date.</p><p>Then I took my overpriced takeout and swung by the grocery store, because I had ice cream to buy.</p><p>Ice cream and hair dye.</p><p>Two hours later I swirled in front of my bathroom mirror, a new woman.</p><p>Ruby Fusion.</p><p>I looked like Christina Hendricks on acid (okay, not quite as statuesque, and my boobs were smaller ... but still very curvy!). The new hair was gorgeous. Crazy. Fun. I wondered if Reese would like it, and then decided I didn\u2019t care, because I liked it.</p><p>That\u2019s when it hit me.</p><p>For the first time in forever, I was doing something for myself.</p><p>It felt good.</p><p>The high lasted until about noon the next day, when I carefully sorted through my finances. Counting all my savings, the business emergency funds, and the secret vacation stash, I was still broke. Okay. So no new Miatas just yet. But if I got the contract for The Line, maybe I could revisit the idea in a year or two. Assuming Reese didn\u2019t fire me.</p><p>Powerful motivation.</p><p>I\u2019d just have to get that contract no matter what. So what if I had to sleep with him to do it ... I\u2019d just call it a bonus and roll with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessica got in touch right after I went to bed Tuesday night.</p><p>\u201cHey, Loni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d I responded, biting back the \u201cSo, I see your phone still works\u201d comment hovering on my lips. Silence fell between us, all weird and uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cHow are things with your mom?\u201d I asked finally.</p> <p>\u201cThings are good, I guess. I mean, she isn\u2019t here very much. She\u2019s really busy with her friends and stuff, and she doesn\u2019t like me to be around when her boyfriend comes home. I don\u2019t have a car or anything, so I\u2019ve just sort of been hanging out by the pool. They\u2019ve got me in the guesthouse. There are a few others staying there, but I have my own room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad things are good,\u201d I told her. \u201cI want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d \u201cDo you think you could pack up some of my things and ship them down? I left all my clothes up there, and Mom has been loaning me shit, but I don\u2019t feel quite right borrowing from her all the time.\u201d</p><p>I glanced toward her bedroom door, wondering if I\u2019d be a horrible person if I said I\u2019d set all her things on fire. Yes. That would be horrible. Pity, because a small, hateful part of me wanted to hurt her.</p> <p>But even with Ruby Fusion hair, I still had to be the adult.</p><p>\u201cSure, I can pack some things up\u2014but not everything. That would cost a fortune to ship. If you want more, you can get a job and earn the money to pay for it. I\u2019ll get some clothes for you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe some of my books and pictures?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou know, like the scrapbook I made of the kids at the community center? I\u2019m kind of missing them, especially since I didn\u2019t get to say good-bye. I wanted to find somewhere else to volunteer, but Mom thought that was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>My heart softened a little. Amber was a Class A bitch, so staying with her had to be a punishment in and of itself. My Jessie girl had some hard lessons ahead of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pack some things up and send them soon,\u201d I told her firmly. \u201cBut it\u2019s late and I need to sleep. I\u2019ve got work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLoni?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Wednesday morning I opened her bedroom door, midsized cardboard shipping box in hand. I\u2019d come in here right after she ran away and picked up the worst of her mess from the tantrum, just so nobody would accidentally cut their feet on the broken glass. But beyond that I\u2019d left everything untouched. Jess was a slob, and we\u2019d come to an agreement years ago. She\u2019d do her part to keep the rest of the house clean, and I\u2019d stop bugging her about her bedroom.</p><p>The system had worked well for us.</p><p>Now I looked around, wondering where to begin. Most of her favorite things were strewn across the floor in dirty piles. I could either grab the things from her drawers (already clean) and pack them, or collect up what she really liked and give it a quick wash.</p><p>Well, she had said \u201cthank you,\u201d which was a big step up for Little Miss Entitlement.</p><p>I grabbed the dirty clothes, tossing them into the box like a makeshift laundry basket. I carried them into the kitchen, where a washer and dryer took up one corner. Then I started sorting through and checking the pockets.</p><p>That\u2019s when I found the money.</p> <p>A hundred-dollar bill, wrapped around a scrap of paper with a note on it.</p><p>Seven tonight, downtown. No bra, no panties.</p><p>What. The. Hell.</p><p>My hand trembled as the implications hit me. Jessica had some sort of secret boyfriend, the kind of man who gave her money. Enough money that she could afford to leave a hundred-dollar bill stashed in her pants.</p><p>Amber had boyfriends like that, too.</p><p>The thought made me sick, and I swayed, reaching out to clutch the counter. I stumbled into the living room, sitting down heavily on the couch, trying to think.</p><p>Mellie. She\u2019d know what was going on.</p><p>The phone only rang once before she picked up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Loni,\u201d she said, sounding pathetically eager to talk to me. I felt a twinge of guilt\u2014I hadn\u2019t given her much thought the past couple days, even though she\u2019d spent two or three nights a week at my house over the last year.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mel. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she replied. \u201cI miss Jessica, though. I\u2019ve tried calling her but she hasn\u2019t answered. I guess she\u2019s too busy doing cool things with her mom.\u201d</p><p>Not so much, but I decided not to go there.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Hey, I was just going through some of her laundry and I found something strange. I thought I might ask you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mellie asked, her voice cautious. I smelled a secret. Excellent. Now I just needed to get it out of her, which shouldn\u2019t be too hard. Mellie never lied directly, only by omission.</p><p>\u201cA note, along with a hundred-dollar bill. It\u2019s from a man, making arrangements to get together with Jess downtown somewhere. Do you know of anyone she was seeing? Someone who would have a hundred bucks to spare?\u201d</p><p>Mellie didn\u2019t answer immediately, so I waited, letting the silence grow between us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his name,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI mean, I know he\u2019s older, but I don\u2019t know any more than that. She said he was her sugar daddy. Said he took care of her.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think that was relevant information to share with me when she went missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get her in trouble,\u201d Mellie replied, her voice miserable. \u201cI knew how pissed you\u2019d be, and I don\u2019t think he had anything to do with her taking off. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s dangerous or anything\u2014not like those bikers she hooked up with. She says he\u2019s really good to her. And they didn\u2019t start sleeping together until after she turned eighteen, at least not that I know of. She says he respects her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said softly. I felt like I should press her for more information, but what was the point? God, this sucked. \u201cI appreciate the heads-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Mellie whispered. \u201cHey, Loni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come over to your place sometime? I sort of miss hanging out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sweetie,\u201d I told her, feeling my eyes start to water a little. \u201cYou\u2019re always welcome here, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou know how it is ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, I know how it is. You\u2019re safe here. Always. Just because Jessica left doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t welcome.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Loni.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and flopped back on the couch, wondering how I\u2019d gotten to such a strange place in my life. I\u2019d dumped my husband for Jess, and now Jess had dumped me for Amber. Then I dumped Nate.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t dump Mellie, I decided.</p><p>No matter what happened, she was a sweet kid and she needed all the support she could get. I wouldn\u2019t fail her like I\u2019d failed Amber and Jessica.</p><p>And yes, I know it was insane to think I failed them\u2014you can\u2019t save someone who doesn\u2019t want saving. Didn\u2019t change how I felt.</p><p>The buzzer went off on the washer, reminding me that I had more clothes to push through. I needed to hit the grocery store for Reese, too. I\u2019d go out to his place early, I decided. That way I wouldn\u2019t have to see him, because despite my bold resolutions I wasn\u2019t quite ready to confront him just yet.</p><p>I\u2019d been through enough in the past twenty-four hours.</p><p>Reese\u2019s motorcycle sat out in front of his house when I pulled up, along with his truck and a sporty little red convertible.</p><p>A Miata. My Miata. I seriously considered keying the car out of pure jealousy.</p><p>Make that jealousy and frustration, because not only had I failed to avoid Reese, he apparently had company. Best not to think about whoever might be driving that pretty little car, either, because I\u2019d bet my morning ice cream it wasn\u2019t one of his club brothers.</p><p>I sat in the driveway and pondered just turning my van around and leaving, then decided that would be pure cowardice. I\u2019d run into him sooner or later. Might as well get it over with. It would be good for me to see him with another woman, I decided. I\u2019d nearly slept with him the other night, and while I\u2019d decided to break up with Nate, that didn\u2019t automatically mean hooking up with Reese was a smart idea.</p><p>It could never be more than random sex anyway. Nothing underscores the temporary nature of a booty call like seeing your intended booty calling on someone else.</p><p>You\u2019re here to work. What he does is his business.</p><p>I turned off my van, grabbed the groceries, and started toward the door. Balancing the bags gracelessly, I punched in the code and pushed through to find myself face-to-ass with the owner of the Miata.</p><p>She straddled Reese on the couch, her miniskirt pushed up around her waist, leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination\u2014my own personal porno, front and center. Holy. Shit. I couldn\u2019t breathe. His gaze met mine over her head, and I managed to clear my throat. She froze, twisting around to see me.</p><p>Awkward.</p><p>\u201cThought you were coming later,\u201d Reese drawled, wrapping his big hands around her waist and holding her steady. His eyes were cold and hostile, although a mocking smile graced his face. He was still angry. Fair enough. We hadn\u2019t exactly ended things on a positive note back at my place. Miss Miata buried her head in his shoulder, obviously trying to hold back a fit of giggles. God, had he told her about me? Did they laugh together at how stupid I\u2019d been, getting drunk and throwing myself at him?</p><p>Don\u2019t panic. DON\u2019T PANIC.</p><p>I panicked. I felt the grocery bags starting to slip, so I tightened my grip and forced myself to inhale slowly. Exhale.</p><p>Think of calm things. Oceans. Clean ovens. Don\u2019t let him see how this hurts you.</p><p>Wait. Why should this hurt me? So I had the hots for him, but that didn\u2019t mean I cared about Reese Hayes. Had I been celibate so long that I\u2019d forgotten what mindless lust felt like? I\u2019d kicked him out of my bed, not the other way around.</p><p>I coughed, and realized I had to take control of the situation. Break the tension. Make a joke.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt,\u201d I said, wondering if my voice sounded as shaky as it felt. \u201cDo you want me to reschedule, or can you move to your bedroom? I generally frown on cleaning around people while they\u2019re having sex. All sorts of potential OSHA violations.\u201d</p> <p>Hayes\u2019s eyes widened and his smile shifted from mocking to genuine. He shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I want to stay pissed at you, but you\u2019re just too cute sometimes,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone like you, London.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never met anyone like him, either, I thought somewhat hysterically. Maybe I\u2019d led a sheltered life, but most of my friends liked to have sex in private. I decided now wasn\u2019t the time to discuss our cultural differences, all things considered. I\u2019d go right ahead and keep focusing on breathing, because somewhere deep inside it felt like I\u2019d been stabbed in the gut, which wasn\u2019t right on about a thousand different levels.</p><p>\u201cUm, still here,\u201d Miss Miata said, lifting a hand and waving it in front of his face. \u201cUnless she\u2019s joining us, I think we should relocate. I only get off on performing for appreciative audiences, and I think we\u2019re scaring this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joining you,\u201d I stuttered.</p><p>Her eyes swept up my figure.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>That was my signal for full, unconditional retreat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just put away the food,\u201d I said, walking quickly past them into the kitchen. I dropped the bags on the counter. Then I leaned forward and forced myself to inhale and exhale some more, counting to ten each time. What the hell was going on with me? So it was weird walking in on people having sex. Yes. Definitely weird. But not full meltdown weird.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>This was all about my stupid crush on Reese, which was apparently even stronger than I\u2019d realized. I didn\u2019t have the right to feel hurt or possessive, yet here I was, trying not to hyperventilate in his kitchen. Not me at all. Desperate times ...</p><p>I opened a cabinet and pulled out a mug. Then I opened the freezer and grabbed some vodka. I poured myself a nice shot, drank it, then quickly disposed of the evidence. Cold fire slid down my throat, clarifying things.</p><p>So I had a problem\u2014Reese was beautiful, I had a crush on him, and he was currently fucking another woman in the living room. His living room. A place he had every right to use for sex or anything else he felt like using it for. Kind of shitty that I walked in on it, but I\u2019d come out to his place early, too. Time to face some hard facts:</p><p>Reese slept with lots of women.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t betraying me, and so far as he knew, I was in a relationship with another man.</p><p>I wanted to curl up into a ball and die.</p><p>Curling up in a ball and dying seemed a little extreme, so I\u2019d just have to pull up my big girl panties and fucking deal with this shit. First up\u2014I had frozen food melting in the van, and it needed to be put away. Because I\u2019m only human, I ducked out the back door to grab the rest of the bags, avoiding the spectacle out front. By the time I came back, they\u2019d left the living room. More giggling and sex noises drifted out from his bedroom and I winced. Maybe I\u2019d just go upstairs for a while. Vacuum. That should drown them out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Forty minutes later there wasn\u2019t a speck of dirt or dust anywhere to be found upstairs. This wasn\u2019t a huge surprise, given how clean it was from the last time I\u2019d been there and the fact that the rooms weren\u2019t being used. There was no getting around my unfortunate reality\u2014I had to go back downstairs.</p><p>My feet wouldn\u2019t move, though.</p><p>I just couldn\u2019t do it. Instead I sat down on the top step, leaning forward on my knees to think. This cleaning gig wasn\u2019t going to work out after all. I couldn\u2019t handle seeing him with another woman, because no matter how I colored my hair, I wasn\u2019t sophisticated and modern enough for booty calls. I would just have to tell Reese I couldn\u2019t clean for him and let it go. Preferably by text. I really didn\u2019t need a new car or that sweet contract out at The Line.</p><p>Except ...</p> <p>Now that Jess had taken off, it really was the perfect time to start expanding my business. The strip club would be a hell of an account to do it with. I could just suck it up, right?</p><p>Yes. I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d walk away from that much money. Does that sound mercenary?</p><p>I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>So what if Reese Hayes was pretty and I wanted to have sex with him? I wanted a million dollars and a house on the lake, and that wouldn\u2019t be happening any time soon, either. Reese had all kinds of women lined up to sleep with, ten a day if he wanted that many. He\u2019d probably lost interest in me already, and I should be happy about it. Clarified things. Didn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t do my best to get and keep the club accounts.</p><p>You have to separate business from pleasure if you want a Miata.</p> <p>Exactly. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do. Pull my act together and\u2014no, pull my shit together and send Jessica her clothing with a smile. I\u2019d be a support to Mellie and be empowered and self-sufficient. I didn\u2019t need a man, but if I wanted one I\u2019d take him and use him and then pass him along without a second thought, because I\u2019d become a sophisticated, modern woman if it killed me.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>And I would lose ten pounds and age backward, too.</p><p>Right after I learned to fly my invisible jet.</p><p>Thirty minutes later the roast was in the oven and I was setting out frozen rolls to rise. I\u2019d had a second, strictly medicinal shot of vodka, and while I wasn\u2019t exactly buzzed, I was feeling a little more balanced about things. Of course, dumping yellow food coloring in the back of the downstairs toilet tank and pouring vinegar in his milk helped restore that balance ... I also loosened the lid on the salt shaker.</p><p>Why did I do these things?</p> <p>Probably best not to examine that too closely.</p><p>Reese emerged from the back addition to lean against the door frame. He wore a pair of faded jeans and nothing else, his big, beefy arms crossing his chest with casual laziness. I refused to let my eyes linger on his muscles, although I did let myself check out his feet.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing sexier than a big, tough man walking around barefoot. I\u2019d always had a thing for it.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that earlier,\u201d he said, although I could tell from his tone that he wasn\u2019t sorry one little bit. \u201cI had no idea you\u2019d come out to the house so early. I thought I had a couple more hours.\u201d</p><p>Wow, he sounded almost sincere.</p><p>\u201cI was planning to get done before you got home from work,\u201d I said, turning away from him to fuss with the rolls. \u201cWhat are your hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrregular,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the boss, remember? I work when I\u2019m needed or when I want to.\u201d</p><p>I sensed him moving toward me, so I turned away from the rolls and headed over to the fridge to put some space between us. Pulling open the door I studied the interior, trying to figure out what I should do next. Sadly, the beer, ketchup, and jar of pickles facing me had no insights to offer.</p> <p>Turning and looking at him wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to scratch him for screwing that other woman or jump his bones. Either way I\u2019d have to scrub him down with bleach, just to be safe, because he was all covered in her cooties.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put together a schedule,\u201d I suggested, studying the expiration date on a container of yogurt as if my life depended on it. \u201cSo I won\u2019t run into you here at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d he asked, and his voice was right behind me. He reached around and shut the fridge, resting one hand on either side of my body, trapping me. Every instinct I had said I should create a diversion and run like hell, but I turned to face him instead.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to let him think he was right, no matter how hard that might be.</p><p>Professional. You are a professional and you don\u2019t play games.</p><p>I offered a bland smile and focused on a cabinet handle across the room, exactly two inches above his broad right shoulder.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to get in your way,\u201d I said evenly. \u201cI know things are awkward between us after the other night. But I want you to know how much I appreciate your support. It was a bad weekend for me. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head and his lip curled in a sneer.</p><p>\u201cDeputy Dick kiss it all better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy personal relationships have nothing to do with my work here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess they\u2019re only relevant when you crawl all over me, rub your tits on my chest, and then kick me out the door after I take care of your drunk ass all night. You started it, sweetheart. I was just following through.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, praying I wasn\u2019t flushing bright red.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s forget that happened, okay? I was emotional and had too much wine. I almost made a horrible mistake, and I\u2019m sorry if I used you. But that doesn\u2019t mean sleeping together would\u2019ve been a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a damned fine idea to me,\u201d he whispered, leaning down and sniffing my neck. \u201cI\u2019d make it good for you.\u201d</p><p>I caught a whiff of perfume on him.</p><p>\u201cMiss Miata is still in the bedroom,\u201d I said tightly. \u201cBetter back off or she\u2019ll see you. Then you\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>He laughed without pulling back.</p><p>\u201cMiss Miata?\u201d he asked. \u201cNow that\u2019s a new name for her. At the clubhouse, we call her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say something nasty, I\u2019m going to kick you,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIs it really worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine \u2018nasty.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything less than complimentary about the woman you just had sex with,\u201d I told him. \u201cBecause it sounded like you were going to insult her. Just remember, anything she did, you participated in. You\u2019re equally guilty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave a low laugh.</p><p>\u201cAt the clubhouse we call her Sharon,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhich I\u2019ve never considered an insult, especially given that she\u2019s named after her grandmother. But you feel free to interpret it any way you like.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and counted to five.</p><p>\u201cJust go away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPic, you know where my shoes are?\u201d Sharon said. She walked into the kitchen and I expected him to pull away, to turn to her with an explanation. He stayed put.</p><p>\u201cThink they\u2019re in the living room, babe,\u201d he said, reaching up to run his fingers through my hair, tugging my head just enough to force me to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Sharon said, passing by us to hunt for her footwear.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she pissed off that you\u2019re talking to me instead of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cThink she already got what she wanted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me guess, this is where you tell me how many times you made her come?\u201d</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>\u201cNo, although if you want details, I guess I could give you some,\u201d he said. \u201cI like how you think. Dirty. But what she wanted was cash. She\u2019s a nice girl and she\u2019s in a bit of trouble. I\u2019m helping her out, so she decided to help me out.\u201d</p><p>That took me off guard.</p><p>\u201cIs she a ... prostitute?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s a person. Try not to be so judgmental\u2014it\u2019s not nice to objectify women like that, London. Don\u2019t you know better?\u201d</p> <p>His tone mocked me, and I snorted.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already covered this,\u201d I said, feeling my chest tighten because I wanted him to touch me. How did he do that? Here he was trying to kiss me right after having sex with another woman, and for some reason I hadn\u2019t kicked him in the balls yet. What was up with that? Probably the vodka, I decided. Definitely the vodka. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, you\u2019re still seeing the good deputy,\u201d he said, his voice a low growl. \u201cYou sleep with him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, actually. Seeing him. I broke up with him yesterday.\u201d</p><p>That caught him off guard, and he pulled back, studying my face.</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d I said firmly, taking advantage of his surprise to slip under his arm and flee across the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ve got a roast in the oven. When the timer goes off, you can take it out and throw in the rolls for fifteen minutes. There\u2019s a salad waiting for you in the fridge and I\u2019ll invoice you for the groceries. Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think I\u2019ll let you drop a bomb like that and just walk out of here?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. It\u2019d been worth a shot. \u201cI have work to do, Reese. I broke up with Nate because it wasn\u2019t right between us. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right with you\u2014if anything, it just means I need to be on my own for a while. Jessica hasn\u2019t even been gone a week. That\u2019s a lot of change and I don\u2019t feel like talking about it with you or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt never started,\u201d I told him bluntly. \u201cI\u2019m not like you. I can\u2019t just have casual sex.\u201d</p><p>Sure you can, the slutty side of my brain whispered. Just try it!</p><p>Miss Miata hasn\u2019t even left the house yet, I reminded my brain firmly. Don\u2019t be such a slut!</p><p>\u201cHow do you know you can\u2019t have casual sex?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. When\u2019s the last time you tried it?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, when was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you change your mind, you know where I am,\u201d he told me. Sharon came back inside and smiled at me, wrapping her arm around Hayes\u2019s waist. She whispered something in his ear, then gave him a lingering kiss before looking at me.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she told me with a genuine smile. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you out at the clubhouse sometime?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, because saying I\u2019d rather eat broken glass didn\u2019t feel quite appropriate. How was she so friendly under the circumstances? It seemed wrong.</p><p>Stop being so judgmental ... Reese\u2019s words echoed in my head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, and Pic? I think there\u2019s something wrong with the toilet, just a heads up. That roast smells fantastic, London. I\u2019m watching my carbs, so good thing those rolls aren\u2019t baking yet!\u201d</p><p>With that she gave me a perky finger wave and left, humming brightly.</p><p>Of course she was watching her carbs. Girls like her always were.</p><p>\u201cThat was just weird,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat was someone who\u2019s comfortable in her sexuality and not worried about overthinking things. You should try it. It\u2019s more fun than pouting. Less work, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really have to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Thursday,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me know what time to expect you and I\u2019ll try to have clothes on ... Unless you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother responding as I marched out of the kitchen, and his laugh followed me through the door.</p><p>Someday I\u2019d be the one making him uncomfortable, I decided. I wasn\u2019t sure when or how, but I looked forward to it. Seemed only fair, all things considered.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>My phone buzzed as I dumped out the bucket of gray mop water. It was nine the next morning, and my crew had one more hour to finish cleaning the strip club. Hayes had kept his promise, and according to Gage\u2014the big Reaper who managed the place\u2014we would be getting the contract long term if he liked what he saw.</p><p>I was there to make damned sure he liked what he saw.</p><p>That meant scrubbing every inch of the place. Not that we\u2019d have to go that far every time we came, but I wanted to start things off right. I pulled out the phone, startled to see it was Jess. Wow ... Getting up her up before noon practically took an act of God.</p><p>JESSICA: Hey Loni. How are you</p><p>ME: Fine. Working, tho. Whats up?</p><p>JESSICA: Do you have time for a phone call? I want to talk to. Things arent so good here</p><p>I frowned, my throat tightening.</p><p>ME: Just a sec</p><p>Setting down the bucket, I walked out of the janitorial closet and across the empty club floor. In the distance I heard the whine of the vacuum as my crew worked their way through the VIP rooms in the back. Gage sat at one of the tables, looking up as I passed with a question on his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust a quick phone call,\u201d I told him, pushing out the front door and into the parking lot.</p><p>The phone rang three times before Jessica picked up.</p><p>\u201cLoni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, baby, what\u2019s wrong? Do you need to see the doctor? You left without your insurance card, but I can send all the information right now if you need it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that,\u201d she said quickly, and I felt myself unclench a little. \u201cI had a little fever last night, but I think it\u2019s just the flu. I\u2019ve been coughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d I warned her, as if she needed the reminder. She knew darned well\u2014damned well\u2014not to play around with infection. The last time she\u2019d wound up in the ICU for three days on an antibiotic drip, with a surgical follow-up just for fun.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she replied hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, careful to keep my voice neutral. \u201cYou can tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you might\u2019ve been right about Mom,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cLast night they had a big party. A lot of guys came over and they weren\u2019t very nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot nice in what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of them cornered me in the guest house,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly a virgin, but this was different, Loni. I\u2019ve never had anyone treat me like that. They didn\u2019t do too much, but only because I ran off and locked myself in a closet. It was horrible.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent. I wanted to demand more information but sensed she was about three seconds away from falling apart completely.</p><p>At least she\u2019d called me.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come home?\u201d I asked, forcing my voice to stay calm and steady. \u201cI know we\u2019ve had our differences, but you\u2019ll be safe here. Maybe we can figure out a way for you to live on your own, where you can be independent and safe at the same time.\u201d</p><p>She gave a snuffling sob, and I realized she was crying.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Loni,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe you. I was really stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not worry about that right now. I can fly down there this afternoon, pick you up, and bring you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you buy me a ticket home, I\u2019ll find a way to pay you back. I can get a cab to the airport, I still have a little cash. But not until tomorrow. Mom said she wanted me to go out with her today, shopping or something. She\u2019s going on a trip, I guess. I\u2019d rather leave when she\u2019s not around. I don\u2019t think I can handle a big fight with her\u2014she\u2019s not going to like it. She\u2019s been acting really strange.\u201d</p><p>I desperately wanted to leap into full rescue mode but forced myself to back off. Just calling me for help was huge\u2014Jessica didn\u2019t need any more pressure. God, I hated this. All of it.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get you a flight home tomorrow, first thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe around noon?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cThat would be better. She\u2019ll be gone by then. There are all these guys around here ... Some of them have guns, Loni. I think her boyfriend might be a drug dealer or something. He\u2019s really rich, but I can\u2019t figure out how he earns his money.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cEntirely possible,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s never had the best taste in men. Don\u2019t go asking questions, all right? You don\u2019t want to do anything to catch attention from people like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>How to answer a question like that?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried about you,\u201d I said finally. \u201cI want you to be safe and happy. You didn\u2019t pick the best way to accomplish that, but I\u2019m incredibly thankful you\u2019re all right. Let\u2019s leave it at that, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Loni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, baby. Take care today and text me every couple of hours, got it? Just stay in touch and let me know you\u2019re all right. And keep an eye on the fever, too. If anything feels off, call nine one one and get an ambulance. Don\u2019t worry about the bills or anything. Just take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered. I ended the call and rubbed the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cFucking great,\u201d I muttered, resisting the urge to throw my phone across the parking lot. I wanted to hit something, or punch a car. Instead I leaned back against the wall, banging my head on it a couple of times, just enough to center myself.</p><p>\u201cYou doin\u2019 okay?\u201d Gage asked, stepping out the door. His pose was casual, but his eyes were sharp. I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cJust the usual,\u201d I said. \u201cFamily drama, that kind of thing. Don\u2019t worry\u2014it has nothing to do with the business and won\u2019t impact our ability to perform.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly, then held the door open for me. I smiled at him and walked through, ready to go inspect the back rooms. I might not be able to control anything else in my life, but I could control cleaning this strip club.</p><p>Too bad I\u2019d already cleaned my oven.</p><p>Maybe Reese\u2019s oven needed a good scrub? I could go out there later and check ... Might as well text him and see if a schedule change would work, because I\u2019d be out at the airport tomorrow afternoon anyway. If he wanted me to come out a second time this week, he\u2019d just have to be flexible.</p><p>Family first\u2014even a big, dumbass biker like Reese Hayes would understand that, right?</p><p>REESE</p><p>\u201cYour girl did good today.\u201d</p><p>Gage\u2019s words echoed in my head as I drove home. I wasn\u2019t quite sure if London qualified as my girl or not, but I wanted her\u2014and not for a quick fuck. She\u2019d been pretty damned upset yesterday and I couldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>I\u2019d rubbed Sharon in her face like an asshole.</p><p>But the thought of London and Evans rolling around naked together had lodged in my head like a virus. I\u2019d wanted to break shit every time I pictured it, and I couldn\u2019t stop picturing it ... A little petty revenge had seemed fair at the time, given I\u2019m a fuckwit. Then she announced she\u2019d broken up with him. Blew me away, because apparently London wasn\u2019t the kind of woman to play men off each other. I\u2019d sort of forgotten what that felt like. Now I respected her even more and felt like a tool in comparison. Screwing Sharon had been juvenile and stupid.</p><p>London was turning me into a dumbass kid again, and not in a good way. At least it seemed to go both ways\u2014she wasn\u2019t winning any maturity awards for that toilet prank ... Laughed my ass off when I finally figured it out, though. Heather used to pull shit like that, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I needed to call London. Or maybe I should just show up at her place, because she probably wouldn\u2019t take a call from me. This sucked. All of it. I liked one-night stands\u2014clean and simple, not some high school bullshit where we danced around each other instead of getting down to business. Couldn\u2019t help but wonder what other complications there might be, either. Would she even be able to handle me in bed\u2014the real me? I wasn\u2019t used to holding back, and if women couldn\u2019t take it, I cut \u2019em loose.</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>If I got my hands on London, I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d let her go just because things got intense.</p><p>I turned around the final bend and spotted the cleaning service van in the driveway. What the fuck? I had a brief, intense fantasy that she\u2019d decided she couldn\u2019t go one more day without my cock deep inside, and that I\u2019d find her naked and waiting in the bedroom.</p> <p>Yeah, right.</p><p>More likely she was in there injecting my toothpaste with strychnine. I parked my Harley next to her vehicle, studying it. She only had the one rig, and driving it had to suck. Like piloting a particularly shitty barge. I wondered if she\u2019d ever been on a bike before, whether she\u2019d like it. There was something about her\u2014the restraint, the sense of duty that never seemed to fail ... She didn\u2019t take much time for herself, and I\u2019d be willing to bet she didn\u2019t get to let go often enough.</p><p>Get her on the back of my bike, bet she\u2019d cream her panties.</p><p>Well, that or run screaming. Either could be worked ... Yeah, I definitely needed to take her for a ride, and now was the time. I\u2019d just gotten it up and running again that morning after way too long stuck in the shop. Huge relief, because when I couldn\u2019t ride, I couldn\u2019t breathe. Winters seemed to last forever some years, and by spring we were all a little crazy.</p><p>Nothing quite like that first ride of the year.</p> <p>I pulled out my phone\u2014sure enough, she\u2019d called. Fucking great, must\u2019ve missed it during church. These days all we talked about \u2019round the table was the cartel, which had been moving in on our territory for close to a year now. They\u2019d hit several of our clubhouses and killed the president of the Devil\u2019s Jacks six months back. For a while we skated the edge of a full-on shooting war, but things had quieted down recently, at least on the surface.</p><p>I knew the Jacks had been down south taking out select targets.</p><p>The Reapers had been doing their part, too, because nobody fucked with us and got away with it. All the houses had full security systems now, and we\u2019d been rolling up select probationary members from the support clubs.</p><p>Sooner or later, that shooting war was gonna hit.</p><p>We\u2019d be ready for it.</p><p>The weekend coming up would be a huge part of that getting ready\u2014patch holders from the Jacks, the Silver Bastards, and the Reapers were coming from all over the region to talk strategy, hopefully put together a joint offensive. We couldn\u2019t just sneak around forever, or wait for them to bring the fight to us.</p> <p>I flipped through my phone, finding the text she\u2019d sent when I hadn\u2019t answered the phone.</p><p>LONDON: Change of plans. I\u2019ll be out at your place this afternoon. Something came up for tomorrow.</p><p>Something was comin\u2019 up for today, too. My dick.</p><p>Christ, next I\u2019ll be making fart jokes.</p><p>Juvenile as fuck.</p><p>Standing outside my front door, I smelled that acrid, horrible stench I remembered from her house last weekend. I turned the knob and stepped inside to find London standing on a stool in the living room, angrily dusting the weapons collection over the fireplace. She wore cutoff shorts and a black tank top\u2014straight out of a wet dream ... except for that god-awful stink filling the air.</p><p>She rose onto her tiptoes, one hand braced against the mantel as she reached higher. Her shirt pulled up, exposing a narrow band of skin, and I held back a groan.</p><p>God damn. I needed to either fuck her or fire her, because this in-between shit was not workin\u2019 for me. \u2019Course Gage wanted her crew working out at The Line permanently, so I guess that meant firing was off the table.</p> <p>Okay, then. I\u2019d take one for the team and fuck her. \u201cI\u2019m cleaning your oven,\u201d she announced loudly, turning to face me, hands on her hips. The stance was pure challenge. Spoiling for a fight. Why, I couldn\u2019t imagine, but it was a good look on her\u2014fire in her eyes and all that shit.</p><p>I\u2019d screw the fire right out of her. My cock took note, tightening just enough to be uncomfortable, and I decided what the hell. No time like the present.</p><p>\u201cWhat crawled up your ass?\u201d I asked. London scowled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to do my job. I was supposed to come tomorrow, but I\u2019ll be at the airport instead. Jessie is coming back home.\u201d</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem too happy about that,\u201d I said, sauntering across the floor toward her. I came to a stop about three feet away, which put my eyes level with her boobs. She sniffed, then turned and lifted her arms to reach one of the higher knives with her duster. It made her tits jiggle under the tank, a sight my cock appreciated greatly.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin\u2019s boyfriend is apparently some kind of criminal,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cI guess the place is crawling with scary goons. A couple of them cornered Jess last night, terrified her. She says she\u2019s safe until tomorrow, but I wanted her to come home tonight. She said she\u2019d text me but she hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I stilled.</p><p>\u201cYou know anything about these guys?\u201d</p><p>She turned back toward me, shaking her head. A smudge of dirt ran across her forehead and her bright red hair flopped around like she\u2019d just gotten out of bed.</p><p>Not a bad look on her at all.</p><p>\u201cNothing, but I know I want to hurt them. She said I shouldn\u2019t fly down there. Probably a good thing, because I don\u2019t need to spend the rest of my life in jail and that\u2019s where I\u2019ll end up if I get my hands on these assholes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came out here instead? Not sure how to take that, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be around tomorrow, and I don\u2019t want you accusing me of backing out of our deal.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>\u201cSo you think I\u2019m such an asshole I won\u2019t let you off the hook to pick up your cousin from the airport?\u201d I asked, trying not to smirk because I had her cold. She\u2019d come here because when shit hit the fan, she wanted to be near me. Might not be ready to admit it, but that didn\u2019t change what was really going on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re enough of an asshole to have sex in front of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a real piece of work\u2014a single man fucking a willing partner in the privacy of my own home. Sometimes I cry myself to sleep, I\u2019m so ashamed of my actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying the timing was a total coincidence?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who showed up early,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cBut yeah, I\u2019ll give you that. I\u2019d already decided to keep Sharon around all afternoon, make a point of her bein\u2019 here. Didn\u2019t plan to screw her in front of you, but I wasn\u2019t disappointed when you walked in and saw it, either. I was fucking pissed off, London. I was there for you when you needed it, I took care of you, and then you called me another man\u2019s name. One of my least favorite men, for the record.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and her mouth opened, then closed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m an asshole. You wanna fight like a grown-up, start using grown-up words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d she hissed, and I swear her hair started levitating a little like Medusa. Okay, so it might\u2019ve just been how she shook her head, but either way it was hotter than hell. The fighting had been fun, but we\u2019d wasted enough time. Time to get inside that tight cunt of hers, check out whether it felt as good wrapped around me as my imagination suggested.</p><p>I wrapped an arm around her waist and lifted her off the chair, hoisting her horizontally against my side as I started toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough foreplay. Time to get down to business, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your babe. Put me down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>She started kicking, which would\u2019ve been a lot more effective if her legs could\u2019ve reached any part of my body from that position. Not my first rodeo. Then she slapped at me, prying at my arm around her waist.</p><p>\u201cCareful, don\u2019t want me to drop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod! How can you be doing this? It\u2019s not fair\u2014you\u2019re too strong for me. I hate you!\u201d</p><p>I decided how I could be doing this was fucking obvious, so it didn\u2019t need answering. Good thing, too, because she dug her fingernails into my arm so hard I think she drew blood.</p><p>\u201cStop playin\u2019 around, London.\u201d We passed through the kitchen. My bedroom door was open. I kicked it shut behind us, then reached around to lock it because I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d put up with any interruptions at this point.</p><p>Then I tossed her on the bed.</p><p>London scuttled back like a crab, bracing herself against the headboard with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d she demanded breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m horny,\u201d I said, my voice matter-of-fact. I sat on the edge of the bed and pulled off my boots. I grabbed my T-shirt and drew it up and over my head, tossing it over to land on top of my dresser. Then I stood and went for my pants.</p><p>London squeaked again.</p> <p>\u201cDoor\u2019s right there,\u201d I said. \u201cLocks from the inside, so not like you\u2019re trapped here. If you want to leave, go. Otherwise take your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>I stood and shoved down my pants, cock springing free to smack against my stomach. She gasped and I smiled, because I knew the view was generally considered a good one.</p><p>\u201cClothes?\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>She sat up, then sort of pulled her dignity around her like a heavy cape, as if that could protect her.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe should set some rules, figure out where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to fuck. Then I think we\u2019ll probably do it again. After that I\u2019ll buy you dinner, but only if you\u2019re nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought dinner with me,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019d be perfect if you didn\u2019t have such a stick up your ass.\u201d</p><p>I crawled forward on the bed, grabbing her ankles and jerking them down abruptly. She squawked, but she didn\u2019t fight when I caught her hands and pressed them back into the bed, over her head. Then I lowered my mouth to catch hers\u2014had to see if she actually tasted as good as I remembered.</p><p>She did.</p><p>I thrust my tongue in deep, closing my eyes as I savored finally getting inside her body. At first she lay passive. Then her tongue started playing with mine, a game of chase and follow I could\u2019ve kept up for hours if my dick wasn\u2019t on fire. Kneeing her legs apart, I settled down between them, realizing the hard way I was in serious danger of denim burn on my cock.</p><p>I pulled back and smiled down at her. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes were bright, and that shiny red hair of hers lay across the pillow like a lava flow.</p><p>\u201cI like that color on you,\u201d I said, shifting to the side so I could slide my hand down to her stomach. The button of her jeans opened easily enough, and her hips surged upward to meet my fingers as they found her clit.</p><p>Wet as hell. Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d noticed. You didn\u2019t say anything the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, that feels good ...\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI do my best.\u201d</p><p>Her breasts rose and fell rapidly as her breathing increased. I slid my fingers up and down, dipping into her pussy and then pressing in and upward as my thumb kept the action going outside. Finally I pulled back and she whimpered, protesting.</p><p>To hell with this slow shit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing too much,\u201d I said. \u201cTake something off, because otherwise I\u2019m going to start ripping things.\u201d</p><p>LONDON</p><p>Take something off, because otherwise I\u2019m going to start ripping things.</p><p>I nearly had a heart attack.</p><p>Reese would let me walk out the door if I asked. I knew he would ... But if I walked out, I might never come back, and in the past five minutes I\u2019d come to the clear realization that I wanted to come here in every sense of the word.</p><p>He shoved up my shirt, exposing the red satin bra I\u2019d decided to wear while cleaning his house for no particular reason I cared to acknowledge. Reese\u2019s mouth caught my nipple and I forgot all about taking things off.</p><p>This was unfortunate. He hadn\u2019t been kidding about the clothes.</p><p>Apparently sucking me through the fabric wasn\u2019t good enough, because seconds later he caught the center fastener of my bra and snapped it in half. My breasts spilled free and then I felt the heat of his mouth pulling me back in, deep. His fingers burrowed down into my shorts, finding my clit and rubbing it hard enough that it should\u2019ve hurt. Instead it just felt really, really good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Need grew out of my center, sending tingles through my entire body. I couldn\u2019t think, but I could sure as hell feel. It felt good. Real good. Better than I remembered sex, and I remembered sex as something very nice indeed.</p><p>Reese switched to my other breast, and somehow I regained enough awareness to reach down between us and cup his hard length.</p><p>His cock.</p><p>I liked the word, I really did. I liked it a lot and I liked the fact that I was free to use it as much as I wanted. I wanted to see more of it, too.</p><p>\u201cI want your cock,\u201d I managed to whisper, and Reese froze.</p><p>Then things changed.</p><p>Before he\u2019d been restrained, if not gentle. Yeah, that was over now. Within seconds he had me flipped over on my stomach, and then I felt my shorts ripping down my body. I\u2019m not quite sure what happened to my panties, but a heartbeat later his hand came under my stomach, lifting me to my knees.</p><p>I barely had time to catch my breath before I felt the head of his erection at my entrance. Not for long, though. He thrust in\u2014hard\u2014which was more than a little startling because I hadn\u2019t seen any real action for years.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d I grunted, and he stilled, letting me grow used to the feel of him deep inside. I felt pinned, impaled ... vulnerable. \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe you just did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it,\u201d he muttered, fingers finding my clit again. He toyed with it and I squirmed, squeezing down on him every time he found just the right spot.</p><p>\u201cFuck ...\u201d he groaned. Then his hips pulled back and he started moving in me. He wasn\u2019t gentle and as he hit home I gasped, because the man was big and it sort of hurt but in a weirdly good way.</p><p>Did I mention it\u2019d been a while?</p><p>Fortunately, Reese \u201cPicnic\u201d Hayes had magic fingers, because by the third time he filled me, I\u2019d lost all sense of time and space. All I could feel was the pressure building through me, centered on my clit and the delicious friction of him pushing deep against the front wall of my vagina.</p><p>My vibrator just couldn\u2019t compete.</p><p>Then I had a horrible, horrible thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on birth control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a condom,\u201d Hayes grunted. \u201cAnd a vasectomy.\u201d</p><p>Huh. How had I missed him suiting up? I couldn\u2019t feel it, either, which was probably because I was so damned wet. Reese caught my clit in his fingers, almost pinching at it, which should\u2019ve hurt like hell but was quite possibly the most amazing thing anyone has ever done to me.</p><p>It was enough to push me over.</p><p>I gasped, my muscles clenching down hard on him as I came. He groaned. Then his hands caught my hips, which was a good thing because my entire body ceased to function and I collapsed.</p><p>Reese ignored my mental and physical crash, lifting my ass up high for his penetration, pumping into me faster and faster as he got close to his own release. Then I felt a renewed tingle of sensation, and realized that I might be capable of achieving the Holy Grail for all women\u2014multiple orgasms.</p><p>\u201cUp on your hands,\u201d Hayes told me harshly. Somehow I pushed myself up, startled I had the strength. His hand caught my hair and jerked back. I screamed and reared back on my knees, bracing my hands against the bedstead.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I gasped, wondering if it was possible for eyes to literally roll into a person\u2019s head from the intensity of an experience. This time I came hard, no long buildup of sensation or gentle warming. Nope. Just an explosion of lust and satisfaction braced like an animal in the home of a man I wasn\u2019t even dating.</p> <p>Glorious.</p><p>Reese pulsed deep inside me as he came. Then he stilled, my butt pulled tight against his groin, his fingers digging into me hard enough I figured I\u2019d find bruises later.</p><p>The thought made me giggle.</p><p>I might have a sex injury!</p><p>Reese let me go, pulling out and catching the condom. I collapsed onto my stomach, still panting, wondering if I could just go to sleep for a while. Pretend the outside world wasn\u2019t real, and that Jessica wasn\u2019t in the shit yet again.</p><p>His thick, muscular arm came around me, pulling me back into the cradle of his body.</p><p>\u201cThat was very nice,\u201d I murmured, eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cNice? I think I\u2019m insulted,\u201d he replied, although he sounded smug as hell. His hand cupped my breast, casually playing with my nipple as we lay in silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be sore tomorrow ...\u201d I said, yawning. \u201cBut totally worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore? I wasn\u2019t that rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my ex-husband left six years ago, when I got custody of Jess, so ... six years.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s hand stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had sex in six years?\u201d he asked, his voice incredulous.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m a freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a freak, sweetheart,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut gotta admit, I\u2019m surprised. You\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cSingle moms who run businesses don\u2019t have fabulous social lives, Reese,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, glad you picked me to break the dry spell,\u201d he said finally. \u201cYou\u2019re not half bad for a chick who\u2019s out of practice. I\u2019d give you a six out of ten.\u201d</p><p>I smacked his arm playfully and he squeezed me tight.</p><p>\u201cOkay, make that nine out of ten,\u201d he whispered, kissing the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019m holding out the last point in the hopes you\u2019ll give me a blow job next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDream on.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled quietly, and then I felt his breathing grow regular as he drifted off to sleep. Letting my thoughts go, I fell into the darkness, wrapped tight and protected in his strength and warmth.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>My phone woke us up early in the evening.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t figure out where I was at first, or why there was a heavy arm holding me prisoner. I tried to grab the phone and Reese tightened his grip, grunting.</p><p>\u201cIt might be Jessica,\u201d I told him, shoving at the arm until he let me catch the call.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her.</p><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t her ... Just because she\u2019d realized things weren\u2019t so sunny down in San Diego didn\u2019t mean that she\u2019d magically turned into a responsible person. I managed to push Reese off and lean up onto my elbow to take the call anyway, because Caller ID said it was Melanie, and I\u2019d sworn I wouldn\u2019t ignore her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Loni,\u201d she asked, her voice hesitant and a little shaky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Reese reached out and caught me again, pulling me back into the crook of his arm. I found my face pressed against his chest while his fingers started running through my hair. I couldn\u2019t believe we\u2019d actually had sex. S. E. X. For real. Wasn\u2019t sure how to process that. On the one hand, I felt incredible ... Warm and full of endorphins that still gave me a full on glow. On the other, I knew I needed to protect myself because Reese was a Grade A man-whore, and I couldn\u2019t let myself get attached to him.</p><p>Fun to play with but not a keeper.</p><p>Then again, keepers weren\u2019t part of my new, improved plan to be a free and independent woman. Unfortunately, neither were hurt feelings and picking up Jessica from the airport tomorrow afternoon. The plan wasn\u2019t off to a good start.</p> <p>\u201cLoni?\u201d Mel asked. I blinked.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer me?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God, I\u2019d done it again. I\u2019d forgotten about Mel\u2014while I was on the phone with her, no less. I was such a shitty person. Ugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the question again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I come over to your place tonight?\u201d she asked, her voice full of hope. \u201cDad\u2019s in a real bad mood. I have some news ...\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my mom took off,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s what Dad told me, and I haven\u2019t seen her for two days. He\u2019s been skipping work. He\u2019s really drunk right now\u2014I\u2019m kind of scared. Do you think I could stay with you for a couple days?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, feeling a rush of hot, righteous indignation. How dare that asshole do this to Melanie? She was a sweet girl, a good girl who worked hard and deserved happiness.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby ... Of course you can. Go let yourself into the house. You can get anything you want out of the kitchen, just make yourself comfortable. Settle yourself in Jess\u2019s room, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat time will you be home?\u201d she asked in a small voice. I burrowed into Reese\u2019s side and felt his hand sweep down to cup my bottom. He caught my knee with his other hand, pulling it up and over his leg until I sort of straddled him in a weird, lying-down kind of way.</p><p>His erection stirred to life, and I looked down through the faded light to see it. Still couldn\u2019t quite believe that thing had not only gone into me, but made me come twice in a row.</p><p>Shitty to be me, because Mellie needed me more than I needed Reese\u2019s dick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home in twenty, thirty minutes.\u201d Hayes snorted, and I smacked his chest to shut him up.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Loni. You know ... Sometimes I wish you were my mom.\u201d</p><p>A lump grew in my throat.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re part of my family,\u201d I told her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks ...\u201d</p> <p>I ended the call and then dropped the phone, nestling into the muscles of his strong chest.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine okay,\u201d I said, feeling a bitter smile spread across my face. \u201cJess has a friend named Melanie. Her home situation isn\u2019t so good, so she spends a lot of time with us. I think I just invited her to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d I said, sighing. \u201cAnd she\u2019s nearly nineteen\u2014older than Jess. They graduated in the same class but Mel had a late birthday and Jess had an early one. They probably should\u2019ve held her back a year along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like this girl can do all right, you give her a fighting chance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want you to stick around a while longer. I\u2019m not finished with you yet.\u201d</p><p>At that, he caught my hips and tugged me up and onto his body. My legs tangled with his and my breasts crushed into his chest, all of which made me wish to hell that Mellie\u2019s dad had chosen another night to get drunk. Of course, he was drunk every night, thus her mom\u2019s decision to take off. Nicole should\u2019ve left his ass years ago\u2014but she should\u2019ve taken her daughter with her.</p><p>Selfish bitch.</p><p>Mellie was so eager to please and easy to be around. I couldn\u2019t imagine why her mom would pull this shit. Thinking about it made me feel sick. That\u2019s why, when Reese cupped my bare ass with both hands and pulled me into him, I shoved against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sensin\u2019 a pattern here,\u201d he muttered, frowning at me. \u201cEvery time I get you horizontal, you run away. Not a fan, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf one of your girls needed help, you\u2019d be out of here so fast I\u2019d find myself on the floor.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and I knew I had him. Then one of his hands slid slowly up my body, catching me around the back of my neck. I let him kiss me, amazed that such an intense man could be so gentle. His tongue flirted with mine and his fingers tightened on me. His penis\u2014no, his cock\u2014kept getting harder and I felt a restless ache stir between my legs.</p><p>I have to get the hell out of here, I realized. Otherwise I won\u2019t make it.</p><p>The kiss ended and I pulled back, staring down at his face. The man was beautiful, no other way to describe it. His short brown hair was sticking up all around his head at the moment. His eyes were bright blue, like aquamarine birthstones shining in the center of his face, and the scruff covering his chin held just a hint of gray. Not enough to make him look old. Just ... mature.</p><p>And the arms holding me?</p><p>I\u2019d never met anyone with such strong, safe arms.</p><p>You\u2019re not safe, my brain hissed. He\u2019s a dangerous man, you have no idea what he might be involved with.</p><p>My brain made a good point\u2014I knew damned well that the club had business interests that weren\u2019t totally legitimate. Everyone knew it. That\u2019s why they paid so well\u2014they weren\u2019t just buying cleaning services, they were buying silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d I whispered, kissing his cheek softly. Then I tried to roll off him, stand up. He held me tight for a second longer.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about Melanie\u2019s dad, I can send one of the guys to watch her.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHer physical safety isn\u2019t the problem. She\u2019s a young woman whose mother just abandoned her and she\u2019s terrified. She needs hugs, not a bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>Reese grew very still, and his fingers dug deep into my flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention her mom before,\u201d he said, his voice deceptively calm, but with an undercurrent of strong emotion I couldn\u2019t place. What was that all about? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then it clicked. Heather. She\u2019d had to leave their girls behind. Totally different circumstances, but that didn\u2019t change the end result\u2014young women without a mother, forced to grow up too early.</p><p>\u201cHer dad is a drunk,\u201d I said, deciding five more minutes wouldn\u2019t make a difference. I let my head fall down on his chest, and he loosened his fingers, running them through my hair again. \u201cI think he was beating on Nicole. She\u2019s Mellie\u2019s mom. I tried talking to her a couple of times but she didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now she\u2019s taken off and left her kid behind? Fuckin\u2019 cunt. He treats her like that, he\u2019ll treat her girl like that, too.\u201d</p><p>Wow, that was harsh ... but fair. Nicole was a cunt. She abandoned her daughter to a drunk who liked to hit women. If she didn\u2019t fit the word, I wasn\u2019t sure who did.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll take care of Mellie. She\u2019s like my own.\u201d</p><p>He looked thoughtful, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get some shit straight and then you can head out.\u201d</p><p>Great, here it came. The Talk. Fortunately I was ahead of him for once.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Reese. I know this was just a one-off for you, and that you don\u2019t want a relationship. That\u2019s what I needed, too, so in a way it\u2019s perfect. No harm, no foul. We can just pretend this never happened.\u201d</p> <p>A scowl covered his face. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs. Or rather, the fact that there isn\u2019t an \u2018us.\u2019 I get it\u2014you like to sleep around. I had a good time, but I\u2019m not expecting a ring or anything.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, and I smirked.</p><p>\u201cAlthough I\u2019ll be around if you want another booty call,\u201d I added slyly.</p><p>Yay me! I\u2019m a sophisticated woman who knows the difference between love and sex.</p><p>Reese\u2019s scowl grew deeper, and then suddenly he moved and I was under him, pinned down against the bed. He pulled my hands up, holding them prisoner above my head.</p> <p>\u201cAre you fucked in the head?\u201d he demanded harshly. \u201cYou get laid for the first time in years, it\u2019s phenomenal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you the modest one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal,\u201d he repeated, emphasizing the word heavily. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re just going to ignore me? I am not fuckin\u2019 down with that.\u201d</p><p>Now it was my turn to be startled.</p><p>\u201cI see you with women all the time,\u201d I said, confused. \u201cI know how you operate. Strictly sex. I\u2019m not looking to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck?\u201d he muttered, shaking his head. It was like we were having two completely different conversations, because I had no idea why he was acting this way. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking stupid I could strangle you. Don\u2019t know exactly what we\u2019re doing here just yet, but it\u2019s not just sex. For one thing, I\u2019m not okay with your seein\u2019 anyone else, especially Deputy Dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and I suppose you\u2019re planning to be true and faithful? I don\u2019t buy it. You\u2019re a known man-whore. Also, you ever call me stupid again and I\u2019ll dump paint stripper on your bike. That isn\u2019t a threat, it\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>He looked me straight in the eyes, his face grim and serious.</p> <p>\u201cI have no plans to fuck anyone but you, at least for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d I told him, feeling almost wistful. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t need to be saying things like this, because I\u2019m not interested in tying you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen. To. Me,\u201d he said, his face growing colder, which I wouldn\u2019t have considered possible ten seconds earlier. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it\u2014I\u2019ve slept around since Heather died. Slept around a lot, but none of them ever felt real to me. There\u2019s something about you, London, something that\u2019s real in a way I can\u2019t even begin to explain. I like it and I want it and you dumped your boyfriend and came to me when you were hurting. Guess that means you want it, too. So far as I figure, that makes you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWe hardly know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we won\u2019t get to know each other if we\u2019re out there screwing other people, so I think we\u2019re gonna have to stop doing it. Should be easy enough for you, under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you want to be in an exclusive relationship with me? I thought you didn\u2019t do that. What about Heather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather is dead. I\u2019m not. Now I\u2019m gonna kiss you and you\u2019re gonna kiss me back. Then I\u2019ll let you go home because it\u2019s important and I respect that. Tomorrow you\u2019ll go get your girl at the airport and I\u2019ll give you the evening together, but come Friday night you\u2019re with me. Havin\u2019 a party out at the Armory and I want you there. You got a problem with any of that?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head quickly, relatively certain that \u201chavin\u2019 a problem with that\u201d wasn\u2019t really a solid option at this point.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed me, and not in a laid-back kind of way. His mouth took possession, head slanting as his tongue pushed in. It wasn\u2019t a seductive kiss, or even a comfortable one. Nope, this was his body telling mine we had unfinished business. I didn\u2019t even notice I\u2019d spread my legs for him until he pulled away long enough to slide on a fresh condom. Then he was deep inside, claiming and conquering me yet again.</p><p>Turns out you can improve on phenomenal. Go figure.</p><p>Half an hour later, when Reese gave me another kiss, it was a quick peck through my van window.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want someone keeping an eye on your house? If her daddy\u2019s a mean drunk, might not be a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, which jiggled my chest. He\u2019d destroyed my bra, unfortunately\u2014and I was a big enough girl that going bra-less wasn\u2019t the best of options.</p><p>\u201cMel\u2019s spent at least two nights a week at my place for the past three years. Not sure what the long-term plan will be, but I\u2019ll get her set up. Unlike Jessica, she\u2019s got a job and she\u2019s planning to start classes at NIC in August. They\u2019ve got student housing.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, reaching out and tucking a strand of my bright red hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou know, this is sexy as fuck,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you were gorgeous as a blonde, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered. Then I pulled away and turned the key in my ignition.</p><p>The starter turned over, but the engine didn\u2019t catch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I frowned, and tried again. \u201cIt\u2019s not starting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour check engine light is on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said absently. I pushed on the gas pedal and tried again. The starter whined in protest. \u201cIt goes on and off all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you do realize that when the check engine light comes on, you\u2019re supposed to check the engine, right?\u201d</p> <p>I shot him the Look of Death, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cWant a ride back to your place?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can figure this out for you, but I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 if you want to be with your girl while she\u2019s all upset, now isn\u2019t the time to start tearing apart your rig.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and sighed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cThat would be great. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s not working. What am I going to do about picking up Jess tomorrow? Shit, now I\u2019ll have to rent something and it\u2019ll be a fortune and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon. Honey. Settle the fuck down. One of the perks of datin\u2019 a man who owns a repair shop is that shit like this is no longer a crisis. I\u2019ll find something for you to borrow while I take care of it, okay? Now get your ass out of there and over to my bike. I\u2019m takin\u2019 you home.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled the door open and I stepped out. He held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeys, babe. Gonna need keys if you want me to fix your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fix anything without checking with me first,\u201d I said, my voice serious. \u201cIf it\u2019s really bad, I may need to go out and find something new. This van is nearly twelve years old, not sure how much life she has left in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeys?\u201d</p><p>I pulled off the van key, which I kept on a little dealie that snapped off my main keychain for situations exactly like this one.</p> <p>\u201cGreat. Now get your ass on the bike.\u201d</p><p>I stepped toward the big Harley, which was black and silver, with the Reapers symbol painted on the gas tank. The seats were black leather, the chrome was shiny, and the whole thing looked ginormous now that I was actually standing right next to it. Hayes handed me a helmet. I studied it, bemused. It\u2019d been a strange day and now it was getting stranger\u2014the president of a motorcycle club was giving me a ride home.</p><p>After fucking me.</p><p>And he planned to fuck me some more.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>It took everything I had to bite back a little squee of excitement, because there\u2019s not a woman on earth who doesn\u2019t secretly want to ride off into the sunset with a bad man on a bike ... Especially after having excellent sex with that man.</p><p>I glanced up at the sky. Sure enough, it was streaked with pinks and blues and gorgeous clouds, glowing as the very last of the day\u2019s sunlight kissed the north Idaho mountains.</p><p>\u201cIt goes on your head.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked, confused.</p><p>\u201cThe helmet,\u201d Reese said, slowly and distinctly. \u201cIt goes on your head.\u201d</p><p>Then he smiled at me and I think I might have blushed, which is kind of crazy considering I\u2019m thirty-eight and well past the blushing years.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you go when you drift off like that?\u201d he asked. I laughed and gave a shrug.</p><p>\u201cEverywhere, I guess. I\u2019ve always done it. Used to get in big trouble at school for it, because they thought I was ignoring them on purpose. But things just catch my imagination and then I\u2019m off. I\u2019m sorry\u2014I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d he said. \u201cJust curious. Let\u2019s go make sure your girl Mellie is all right. Come mornin\u2019 I\u2019ll get one of the boys to run a car over for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, wondering if any of this was real.</p><p>\u201cJust remember, Friday night is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday night is yours,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>Then I climbed on Reese Hayes\u2019s bike, wrapped my arms around him tight, and let him carry me off into the sunset.</p><p>It was full dark by the time we reached my place.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to get off the bike and step back into reality ... there was something incredibly thrilling and powerful about riding with Reese, and I wanted to enjoy it while I could. Whatever he might have said earlier, I wasn\u2019t exactly holding my breath that this would turn into a real relationship. The odds weren\u2019t in our favor. But until things fell apart, I\u2019d let myself savor the moment\u2014giving up control and trusting him to keep me safe was the most liberating thing I\u2019d done in six years.</p><p>When he turned off the Harley, I couldn\u2019t seem to make my hands let go of him. This didn\u2019t seem to bother Reese. He caught them in his own and pulled me tighter against his back. I smelled the leather and felt his strength between my legs. Surreal.</p><p>Then he let go.</p><p>I climbed off the bike and back into reality. The porch light came on and the front door opened to reveal Mellie. She stopped dead when she saw Reese, and her jaw actually dropped.</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>Last time she\u2019d seen me, I\u2019d been dating a deputy sheriff. Now I\u2019d come home with an outlaw biker, and I\u2019d be willing to bet that anyone seeing us would know we\u2019d been together. There was an intimacy between us that hadn\u2019t been there before. I felt it in the way he put his hand on my back protectively, and the way I found myself leaning toward him.</p><p>Oh, and it probably didn\u2019t help that I\u2019d lost my bra\u2014the night air was cool enough to nip me out in a big way.</p><p>Mellie had always been shy, so I was surprised when she stepped off the porch and started walking across the lawn. The kid must\u2019ve been even more upset than she sounded on the phone. I\u2019d just started toward her when a horrific burst of sound and heat and light exploded out of the house. Reese tackled me to the ground, covering me with his body.</p><p>Everything fell perfectly, utterly silent.</p><p>What the hell had happened?</p><p>Reese lay on top of me for long seconds. I couldn\u2019t hear his voice but I felt the vibrations of his yelling through his body. Why couldn\u2019t I hear him? After an eternity, he rolled off me and I looked up to find an inferno where my house had been, flames licking up toward the sky.</p><p>I realized my house had exploded.</p><p>My house had fucking exploded!</p><p>An instant later I remembered how close Melanie had been when it went up, and my heart stopped.</p><p>\u201cMellie!\u201d I yelled, grabbing Reese\u2019s arm, jerking him toward me. \u201cWe have to find Mellie!\u201d</p><p>He yelled something back at me, but I couldn\u2019t tell what it was. Then he was on his feet, running across the lawn. I staggered upward, trying to figure out what the hell was happening. Neighbors were pouring out into the street all around us. Slowly sounds took shape\u2014mostly an unpleasant ringing\u2014and I realized the force of the explosion had temporarily deafened me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reese was a dark silhouette against the fire, searching through the debris. He stopped suddenly, and I saw him lift Mel\u2019s still form, carrying her toward me. Then he was laying her in the grass and noises started filling my ears again. I fell to my knees next to her body.</p><p>Oh God. Mellie ...</p><p>She looked dead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling nine one one!\u201d someone yelled behind us, startling me. I was still stunned\u2014I couldn\u2019t seem to think. I needed to check her pulse, make sure she was breathing. Old training kicked in, and I could have cried in gratitude for the CPR classes I\u2019d taken over the years. I found her pulse. Weak, but definitely present. Then I leaned my face into her mouth and nose, praying I\u2019d feel her breathe against my skin.</p> <p>Air tickled my cheek.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive,\u201d I whispered. Tears rolled down my face.</p><p>\u201cThank fuck for that,\u201d Reese muttered, pulling me into his arms as one of my neighbors knelt next to Melanie, covering her with a blanket. The wall of safety came crashing down around me and I started to shake.</p><p>My house was gone. I\u2019d almost lost Melanie ... What the hell could possibly explain this?</p><p>The wailing howls of emergency vehicles filled the air. I heard a car screech to a stop, and out of the corner of my eye I vaguely noticed that a man in a sheriff\u2019s uniform had stepped out, speaking into his shoulder radio urgently.</p> <p>Then a fire engine rumbled down the street. Firefighters ran past me, dragging their hoses with them, and EMTs swarmed Mellie\u2019s still form.</p><p>To my relief they weren\u2019t doing anything that looked serious and scary like you see on TV\u2014no chest compressions or IVs or shocking her with shiny paddles. Instead they monitored her vitals, voices calm as they methodically got a neck brace on her before rolling her onto a backboard. Seconds later they lifted the entire apparatus\u2014backboard and all\u2014onto the rolling gurney and started back toward their vehicle.</p><p>\u201cThat board won\u2019t do much good if you already paralyzed her. Should\u2019ve left her where you found her,\u201d I heard a familiar voice say. I looked up to find Nate standing over me, his voice full of venom. I pulled away from Reese and stood slowly. Nate reached a hand down to help me, but Reese caught my arm.</p><p>\u201cStay the fuck away from my woman,\u201d he growled. Nate\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><p>\u201cGuess that cunt\u2019s not made of gold after all?\u201d he commented. Reese lunged toward him and without thinking I jumped between the two men.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d I shouted, staring them down like two little boys who needed a time-out. \u201cI need to check on Mel. Reese had to get her away from the fire, Nate. If you\u2019d been here, you\u2019d have done the same thing. She was practically on top of it. And Reese? What happened between me and Nate is between me and Nate. I\u2019m a big girl and I can fight my own battles. I\u2019m going to follow Mel to the hospital, and you better fucking behave yourselves because I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p> <p>Both men gaped at me. I didn\u2019t care\u2014these weren\u2019t normal times and I could give a fuck about their little pissing match. I decided to ignore them and follow Melanie.</p><p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d I asked the EMT, who was busy securing the gurney in the ambulance. She glanced over at me but didn\u2019t miss a beat.</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll check her head at the hospital. Looks like she hit something hard. You have any idea what happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d I said, my voice grim. \u201cBut we\u2019re really damned lucky to be alive. She was just coming out of the house when it exploded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely lucky,\u201d she said. None of this added up.</p><p>\u201cHouses don\u2019t just explode. Do they?\u201d I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d asked the question out loud until the woman answered me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen stranger things,\u201d the EMT said. \u201cAre you a family member? We\u2019re headed toward Kootenai. There\u2019s another bus coming, they\u2019ll be able to check you out\u2014she\u2019s higher priority and we need to get her in. I\u2019m going to close the doors now. Step back, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d I said anxiously. I turned to find Nate and Reese still in their standoff, staring each other down in the flickering light of the flames. My neighbor, Danica, walked up to me and wordlessly wrapped a blanket around my shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked. \u201cCan I do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give me a ride to the hospital?\u201d I asked, the words broken by a sudden, harsh cough. \u201cI need to make sure Melanie is okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want to check in with the police first? I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll want to talk to you, probably have a ton of questions they need to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answers will still be the same after I make sure Mellie is okay,\u201d I said tightly. \u201cJust get me out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d she said. \u201cCar\u2019s parked behind the house, back in the alley. Good thing, too, because everyone on the street is blocked in. Um ... I couldn\u2019t help but notice that big guy over there was with you. And that the other one used to be with you. You want to touch base with them before you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said, shaking my head, frustrated. \u201cThey can play caveman without me. All I care about right now is getting to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>REESE</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what you need to know,\u201d I said to Evans, clenching my fist because I\u2019ve never wanted to hit a man more in my life. I wasn\u2019t exactly used to holding back. \u201cLondon is with me now. You don\u2019t talk to her, you don\u2019t touch her, you don\u2019t think about her. Otherwise we\u2019ll have another discussion, and that one won\u2019t happen where you have a thousand cop buddies to save your ass. Got me?\u201d</p><p>Evans studied me and shook his head slowly, the flickering light of the fire throwing his face into shadow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her. I could give a shit about London Armstrong.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and my next bike was gonna be a Honda.</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t mind staying the hell away from her,\u201d I said. \u201cThings won\u2019t get ugly and I won\u2019t find myself diggin\u2019 a hole down in the Bitterroots.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went big.</p><p>Yeah, fucker. You heard that right.</p><p>\u201cJust to be clear\u2014you just threatened a cop with murder? Not smart, Hayes.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou got a great imagination,\u201d I told him. \u201cI think we\u2019re finished here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His expression turned ugly, and I thought I saw a glimpse of something like hatred in his face. Fair enough\u2014feeling was mutual. Then the sheriff himself stepped between us, smacking me on the back before gripping my shoulder meaningfully.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Pic?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cStill here, Bud. Kind of concerned about my woman\u2019s place, though. Houses don\u2019t usually blow up,\u201d I said, holding my gaze fixed on Evans. \u201cNot too impressed with your boy, either. He called London a cunt. For the record, she\u2019s the owner of this property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvans, get back to your car,\u201d Bud snapped. Deputy Dick gave him a mock salute, then ambled off. \u201cGoddamn but I hate that man. I think he\u2019s gonna run for sheriff next election, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe can run,\u201d I said, my voice cold. \u201cHe ain\u2019t gonna win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so sure about that,\u201d Bud replied. \u201cMy Lavonne met up with Jennifer Burley at the casino last week. Jen said that Nate\u2019s dad has already started talking about mounting a campaign for the boy. Fund-raising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had any balls, you\u2019d fire his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fire his ass, the commissioners will have mine,\u201d Bud said bluntly. \u201cYou know that. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a politician in the county his daddy doesn\u2019t have something on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe you should\u2019ve been more careful,\u201d I told him, losing patience. \u201cMight be time to throw yourself on your sword, you ever consider that? He\u2019ll do a lot more harm before he\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>Bud\u2019s eyes narrowed and I shrugged off his hand. Fucking coward. I\u2019d had just about enough of this shit.</p><p>\u201cSo that your woman\u2019s place?\u201d he asked, jerking his chin toward the burning house. \u201cFalls under my jurisdiction. Just outside the city line limits. Anything I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s my woman\u2019s place,\u201d I said slowly, the words feeling strange in my mouth. \u201cBut we\u2019re a new thing. This wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the club, even if it wasn\u2019t accidental. What\u2019s your gut read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a gas leak and buildup,\u201d Bud said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the firefighters think, and they got good instincts about this kind of shit. Nobody\u2019ll say anything official until there\u2019s a full investigation, of course, but all the signs are there. We\u2019re damned lucky it\u2019s not full of crispy critters. She have a gas stove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cLast time I was here, I smelled it. She said she was cleaning the oven. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like a pretty big deal to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff the record, EMTs think the kid\u2019ll be fine. Wanna check for internal bleeds, spinal trauma, all that shit. But it\u2019s just routine. We\u2019ll need to talk to both of them, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I responded, noticing for the first time that Mellie was gone. Damn, where was London?</p><p>\u201cShe went to the hospital,\u201d Bud said dryly, clearly reading my expression. \u201cSaw her leave while you were pissin\u2019 over her with Evans. Somethin\u2019 to consider next time you feel like fighting over a woman instead of taking care of her.\u201d</p><p>I turned on him, my face grim. How had I missed her taking off? And since when did Bud have the balls to lecture me? Then I realized the bastard was right.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I was out of practice with this relationship shit, but the pissing matches were all but hardwired into my DNA after so many years in the club.</p><p>\u201cHeadin\u2019 to the hospital,\u201d I told him shortly. \u201cShe\u2019ll be upset, confused. I want updates, but you won\u2019t question her until tomorrow, got me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bud said, nodding. \u201cNo real reason to, so far as I can tell. Nothing that can\u2019t wait. That\u2019ll change, we find any evidence this wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find any evidence it wasn\u2019t an accident, you call me,\u201d I told him, my voice cold and serious. \u201cFirst call you make. You scared Nate Evans\u2019s daddy\u2019ll go after your job? I\u2019ll go after your fucking family. We clear?\u201d</p><p>Bud smiled, his mouth tight.</p><p>We were clear.</p><p>LONDON</p><p>It was around ten p.m. when Reese sat down next to me in the hospital waiting room, handing over a cup of coffee without saying a word. Wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about him being there. Sure, we\u2019d had great sex. But the whole showdown with my sort-of ex? I was a grown-up. I didn\u2019t need that kind of complication, no matter how fabulous he was in the sack.</p><p>On the other hand, he had thrown himself over me when the house blew up. He definitely got points for that.</p><p>\u201cYou over your snit with Nate?\u201d I asked him, rubbing the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cI think we cleared things up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hear anything about Mellie yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think she\u2019s probably all right,\u201d I told him wearily. I\u2019d had a hell of an adrenaline rush, but it was starting to wear off. \u201cThey\u2019re doing some scans to make sure, but sounds like a mild concussion. Might keep her overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer dad show up?\u201d</p><p>I snorted.</p><p>\u201cHer dad was too drunk to understand me when I called him,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI think he said she wasn\u2019t welcome at his house but it\u2019s hard to tell. He wasn\u2019t making a whole lot of sense. I can\u2019t let her go back there. She can stay ...\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>That\u2019s when it hit me\u2014I had nowhere for her to stay ... or for me. I had to find somewhere to live. Immediately. I remembered someone saying something about the Red Cross and a hotel room, but the details were blank. Reality hit me all at once\u2014I looked at Reese, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m homeless,\u201d I whispered. \u201cOh my God, I don\u2019t have anywhere to live. Jessie is flying back home tomorrow and there\u2019s no home.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and took the coffee he\u2019d just given me, setting it on the little table in front of us. Then he pulled me over onto his lap, wrapping his arms around me. One hand caught my head, pulling it down against his shoulder and stroking soothingly.</p><p>I resisted at first\u2014I didn\u2019t like the idea of being dependent on him, or him thinking I needed him for anything ... but maybe just this once.</p><p>\u201cJust let me be strong for you for a minute, okay?\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve held on for a long time, sweetheart. Nobody can say you haven\u2019t been strong. But it\u2019s been a hell of a night, so why don\u2019t you let me hold you and help you right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took me a minute, but then I nodded because he was right. I\u2019d been strong for a very long time and now I\u2019d have to be stronger. Oh, God. What was I going to tell Jess?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come back to my house tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they let Mellie go, she can sleep upstairs in Kit\u2019s room. Tomorrow you\u2019ll pick up Jessica and she can stay at my place, too. Fuck, I\u2019m used to having a house full of girls. That\u2019ll give you the time to figure out what your next step is. I\u2019m assuming you had insurance?\u201d</p><p>Insurance. I\u2019d forgotten about insurance! Woo-hoo!</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, sitting up so quickly I almost fell off his lap. \u201cI have insurance. I need to call my agent\u2014I think it even pays for an apartment or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s a start,\u201d he said, then smiled at me. It hit me hard, the way those bright blue eyes crinkled at the corner, and I felt a very inappropriate wave of lust sneaking up. Even if the house had blown up, it didn\u2019t change the fact I\u2019d finally gotten laid and it kicked ass.</p><p>Something stirred under my butt. Guess I wasn\u2019t the only one in lust.</p><p>Leaning forward, I whispered, \u201cI feel sort of like a pervert.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, rubbing his nose along my cheek.</p><p>\u201cMs. Armstrong?\u201d</p> <p>I looked up, full of that sudden, guilty, caught-in-the-headlights sensation I remembered from the time the PE teacher at my high school caught me making out with Troy Jones behind the bleachers. We were supposed to be running laps.</p><p>See? I wasn\u2019t always a good girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m London Armstrong,\u201d I said quickly, standing up and smoothing my clothes\u2014a pointless task if one ever existed, because they were muddy and disgusting from Reese\u2019s protective tackle earlier. My hair wasn\u2019t much better, although I\u2019d managed to get the dirt off my face in the bathroom sink.</p><p>\u201cMelanie\u2019s done with her scan now,\u201d the ER nurse said, a hint of humor in her eyes. Glad someone could appreciate the situation. \u201cShe\u2019d like you to come back and wait with her.\u201d</p><p>I started to follow, Reese one step behind. The nurse paused and frowned.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t mention him,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you family?\u201d</p> <p>Reese shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with London,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Mel doesn\u2019t want me in there, I\u2019ll leave. No arguments. I don\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable ... but I\u2019d like to talk to her if she\u2019s okay with that.\u201d</p><p>The nurse looked skeptical, but she nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want you in the room, you\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>Then he caught my hand in his, giving it a quick squeeze as the nurse used her card to buzz us through the big double doors separating the ER itself from the waiting area. We passed room after room until she stopped outside one at the end of the hallway, giving the door a quick, crisp knock.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Mellie called, and I sighed in relief. She didn\u2019t sound full of energy and giggles, but her voice was steady and calm. The nurse opened the door for us.</p><p>Mellie\u2019s eyes went wide at the sight of my new ... whatever the hell he was. Boyfriend? Seemed a little too cutesy, somehow.</p> <p>\u201cYou want him out?\u201d the nurse asked bluntly, which I thought was pretty brave of her considering Reese was twice her size and looked scary enough when he wasn\u2019t covered with dirt and soot.</p><p>Mellie glanced at me, and I nodded encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cThis is a friend of mine,\u201d I said. \u201cA good friend. But if you don\u2019t want him here, he\u2019s gone. Reese is the one who pulled you away from the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can stay,\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cJust push the button if you need anything,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cThe doctor will be in as soon as we have your scan results.\u201d</p><p>She left the room and we stood there, Mellie trying not to stare at Reese and failing miserably.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Reese Hayes,\u201d he said, his voice gentle\u2014far gentler than I would\u2019ve dreamed possible. \u201cLondon and I are together now, and she\u2019s told me all about you. I have two daughters, just a few years older than you. Told London she could come out to my place while she gets things straightened out. You\u2019re welcome, too. I hear home\u2019s a little uncomfortable these days.\u201d</p><p>Mellie\u2019s face crumpled, and she sniffed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, London. I didn\u2019t mean to burn down your house. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still talking to me.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. Like Mel needed more trauma and guilt? I moved quickly toward the bed, taking her hands into mine.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, baby,\u201d I told her. She shook her head, then tears burst out like a dam had broken.</p><p>\u201cI was using the stove,\u201d she gulped between sobs. \u201cI checked to make sure the burners were all off, but I guess I missed one. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBut I sort of doubt that leaving on one gas burner for a short time would be enough to blow up the whole house. Even if it was, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just a house.\u201d</p><p>Huh. I\u2019d said it to make her feel better, but it was the truth, too. It really was just a house. The sadness and shock I\u2019d been fighting faded, replaced with relief. Not that I was happy about losing my home, but I was mostly just thankful that Mellie hadn\u2019t been hurt. That I hadn\u2019t been hurt.</p><p>\u201cI can buy a new house. Or build one ... I don\u2019t know. Nothing that really matters is gone.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and a woman stepped in. She looked way too young to be a doctor, but she had all the right props\u2014white coat, stethoscope, hair pulled back in a bun.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dr. Logan,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got your test results, Melanie. Would you like to talk with me privately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they can stay,\u201d Mellie said, her hands tightening on mine.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think you\u2019re going to be just fine,\u201d the doctor said with a reassuring smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a concussion, so we\u2019ll keep you overnight to keep an eye on things, but I don\u2019t think you need to worry. There\u2019s no sign of bleeding, no serious trauma to the head or spine. You got lucky.\u201d</p><p>Relief filled her face. Then she glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to stay at the hospital?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea. You can go home first thing tomorrow, if there aren\u2019t any complications.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll come and get you,\u201d I told her, feeling suddenly exhausted. \u201cBut the doctor\u2019s right\u2014better to be safe. You were unconscious for several minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Melanie agreed, and I smiled, leaning over to tuck a strand of her hair behind her ear. Such a sweet girl. Whatever else Jessica had gotten wrong, she\u2019d definitely hit the jackpot the day she dragged Mellie home with her.</p><p>An hour later we had Mel all tucked into a room upstairs, and she was starting to drift off into sleep. Reese walked me downstairs, where I was startled to see several of his club brothers waiting for him, including Gage and both of the prospects I\u2019d met that night I\u2019d driven out to the Armory.</p><p>There were also the two men I\u2019d seen with Jessica that same evening. Painter and Banks? Hard to remember their names, although I\u2019d never forget the sight of them in that little room with her. Hateful night.</p> <p>I smiled at them weakly but opted not to say anything. I didn\u2019t have the energy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 London home,\u201d Reese announced. \u201cPainter, you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come out, too,\u201d Gage said. \u201cWe should talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I asked, wondering what could possibly be more important than sleep at this point. A giant of a man with shoulder-length dark hair gave me a quick, charming smile. The patch on his leather vest said \u201cHorse.\u201d Funny name.</p><p>\u201cAll good, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cNo worries. We\u2019ll talk to the boss and then get out of your hair.\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged, because I was past curiosity. We all walked out to the parking lot, where Reese carefully helped me onto his bike. I wrapped my arms around his waist and leaned my head against his back, utterly spent.</p><p>The sun kissed the mountains through the darkness as we pulled out of the parking lot, sending pink streaking through the sky for my second ride with Reese. Same colors as last night\u2014this time it was sunrise, the start of a new day.</p><p>My whole world was changing faster than I could keep up with, and it scared me a little. I hugged him tighter, thankful that in the midst of all this mess I had someone solid to anchor me.</p><p>Wishful thinking?</p><p>Probably. I didn\u2019t care\u2014all I wanted were his arms around me while I slept. Warm. Strong.</p><p>Safe.</p> <p>REESE</p><p>I sat at the head of my dining room table, wondering how many times over the years we\u2019d had meetings in here just like this one.</p><p>Too many to count.</p><p>Back in the day, Heather always kept the fridge fully stocked with beer and snacks for when the guys came over. My girl Em had done the same as she grew up, although not as efficiently.</p><p>Now I took a deep, cold drink of the beer London had gotten at the grocery. Hadn\u2019t asked her to do it, she just noticed what I liked and then bought more of it when I got low. Felt good to have a woman in the house, even if she only took care of me because I hired her to do it.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t paying her to fuck me, though.</p><p>Thinking about her in my bedroom right now, wrapped tight in my sheets, waiting for me? That gave me a satisfaction and sense of rightness that I hadn\u2019t even realized I was missing.</p><p>Dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the report?\u201d I asked Gage. Ruger, Horse, Bolt, and Painter sat back, waiting patiently. I had a feeling they\u2019d had this discussion at least once already, probably in the hospital parking lot.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be checking it out, and whatever goes in the final report gets run by us first,\u201d Gage said slowly. \u201cOff the record? Fire investigator told me it might not be an accident. Houses explode sometimes, of course. Faulty valves let the gas build up and then when something touches it off, boom. But he doesn\u2019t think it fits the pattern of an accidental explosion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting ...\u201d I murmured. \u201cBud said he thought it was an accident. Said that\u2019s what the firefighters were sayin\u2019. He full of shit?\u201d</p><p>Gage shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCould be. He\u2019s gettin\u2019 a lot of pressure from the Evans family. They\u2019re out for blood, and this shit with London dumping the crown prince for you puts us in their sights. But I think what\u2019s really happening is they\u2019re cuttin\u2019 Bud out of the loop. Everyone knows he\u2019s on borrowed time, so they\u2019re pickin\u2019 sides. Fire department is with us, always has been. They\u2019ll report to us first, then tell him what he needs to hear.\u201d</p><p>Painter grunted in agreement, his young face grim. Once upon a time, I thought he might end up my son-in-law. Still couldn\u2019t decide how I felt about that. He didn\u2019t love Em, not the way I wanted her loved by her old man\u2014that meant he wasn\u2019t the right one for her. But now she was living with Hunter Blake, a nomad with the Devil\u2019s Jacks. Hated that fucker. I\u2019d come to respect him, but that\u2019s where it ended. Too much bad blood between us.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Jeff Bradley,\u201d Painter said. \u201cWent to high school together, he\u2019s one of the firefighters who was there tonight. He\u2019s pretty new, but one of the older guys told him it looked wrong for an accident. I think we need to at least consider that this was a planned hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why London?\u201d I asked. \u201cWasn\u2019t \u2019til today that I finally nailed her. Not like she\u2019s an old lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but she belongs to the club,\u201d Ruger said thoughtfully. \u201cWorks for us, been comin\u2019 out to your place. From the outside, probably looks like you\u2019ve been bangin\u2019 her for a few weeks now.\u201d</p><p>He raised a good point.</p><p>\u201cSo we assume it\u2019s a strike at the club until we learn otherwise. Thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait and watch,\u201d Horse said. \u201cSmells like the cartel to me\u2014they love blowin\u2019 shit up. See if they tip their hand moving forward. Let the cops play with it for now, see how it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll keep London out here with me until we know for sure,\u201d I said. \u201cWant her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that?\u201d Ruger asked.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cDunno what it is. But I know that I don\u2019t want her caught in the crossfire, assuming this is about the club. I got a bad feelin\u2019 about this shit tonight. Way too coincidental, doesn\u2019t add up. Whatever happens between me and her, don\u2019t want her hurt because she caught my eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you care?\u201d Painter asked, his eyes sharp. \u201cYou in the market for an old lady?\u201d</p><p>Tension filled the air, because the older brothers knew better than to suggest I\u2019d ever replace Heather. I\u2019d laid good men out for less. Somehow the question didn\u2019t piss me off like it normally would. Probably because this time it made sense. I\u2019d never moved a woman into my place before\u2014he had a good reason for asking. I realized they had all stilled, waiting for an answer. Might as well clear it up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll never have another old lady,\u201d I said carefully. \u201cI like London. She\u2019s a good fuck, handy around the house. Cute. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m keepin\u2019 her long term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t fuck up so bad she drops the cleaning accounts,\u201d Gage said, his voice serious. \u201cI got high hopes for her at The Line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Bolt chimed in. \u201cBest thing that ever happened to the pawn shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when we do let business come before pleasure?\u201d I asked, cocking a brow.</p> <p>\u201cSince the night I had to scrub the fuckin\u2019 toilets because the old cleaners were stealing shit and I had to fire them,\u201d Gage said bluntly. \u201cNot a fan, Pic. Anyone can suck your dick, but a woman who stays on top of the toilets is a goddamn treasure. I\u2019d protect her from whoever blew up her place on that basis alone.\u201d</p><p>I snorted, shaking my head because he was right. Gettin\u2019 my dick sucked on a regular basis wasn\u2019t exactly a challenge, but London was a fuckuva lot more than that.</p><p>And not just because she cleaned.</p><p>I liked having her under my roof. Sooner or later she\u2019d talk to her insurance agent, maybe look into getting an apartment. To my surprise, I didn\u2019t care for that idea much at all.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we\u2019ll keep an eye out,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll keep her out here for the duration. She\u2019s got a couple kids in tow, too\u2014the girl who was at the house tonight and her little cousin. Guess they\u2019ll be sleepin\u2019 upstairs until we get this worked out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdmit it. You hate living in a house that isn\u2019t full of girls screechin\u2019 and fighting over the bathroom, you fuckin\u2019 masochist,\u201d Horse said, evil glee in his eyes. \u201cEm and Kit are gone, so you\u2019re auditioning replacement daughters. Seek professional help, bro. Or at least go for a son this time. Somethin\u2019 wrong with a man so eager to get pussy whipped.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and flipped him off, standing up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re good here,\u201d I said, glancing pointedly toward the door. London was waiting for me, which meant fightin\u2019 with Horse wasn\u2019t exactly a priority.</p><p>\u201cPainter stays out here tonight,\u201d Gage said. \u201cDon\u2019t want to step on your toes, prez, but you need backup. If that really was the cartel, we can\u2019t leave you uncovered.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, because I knew he was right. As sergeant at arms, it was Gage\u2019s job to worry.</p><p>\u201cOkay, kid,\u201d I said to Painter. \u201cYou take the guest room. Tomorrow you head home, grab some shit. Might be stuck here for a while. If Jessica comes back from California, the hands stay off. Don\u2019t care how convenient it would be. Got me?\u201d</p> <p>Painter gave a sharp nod, and then the meeting was over. Shitty night, but at least I\u2019d be bedding down with London soon. Not sayin\u2019 I was happy her house had blown up, but I guess there\u2019s always good with the bad. Probably best not to share my theory with her under the circumstances, though.</p><p>Women get all touchy and shit sometimes.</p><p>LONDON</p><p>I woke up in a man\u2019s arms for the second time in twenty-four hours. Reese. His body surrounded mine, and I wore a T-shirt that was far too big for me. Not mine. Why was I here?</p><p>Then it came back to me.</p><p>My house was gone.</p><p>My clothing, my pictures, my books ... All of it. Gone. For no good reason. I lay still in the early-morning light, wondering what the next move should be. What I really wanted to do was cry and feel sorry for myself, but I\u2019ve always been practical. With my life, I\u2019ve had to be\u2014no point in wasting time whining when there\u2019s work to be done.</p><p>First up, I needed to call Jessica.</p> <p>I rolled over to grab my phone and felt Reese\u2019s arm tighten on me. He pulled me back into his hips, the press of his morning erection sending tingles radiating up between my legs to my nipples.</p><p>\u201cI need to make some phone calls,\u201d I told him softly. He nuzzled the back of my neck and I squirmed, because I couldn\u2019t just lie down and pretend last night hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>He sighed and loosened his grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, babe,\u201d he said softly, kissing my shoulder. Three little words, but they felt so good. He was here, with me. For once I wasn\u2019t on my own, and while I wasn\u2019t fool enough to think his presence changed anything in my big picture, just waking up in his arms meant more than I could have imagined.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered. Then I took my phone and pressed my finger to Jessica\u2019s number. Surprisingly, she answered on the first ring, her voice alert, almost strained. Had Melanie called her already?</p><p>\u201cHey, Jess,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI have some bad news for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust spit it out,\u201d she snapped. I heard a cracking noise and then she coughed suddenly, gasping.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d I asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she replied, her voice more subdued. \u201cSorry, just dropped something. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house blew up.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house blew up,\u201d I repeated, the words sounding unreal even to me. \u201cI don\u2019t know how or why. Probably a gas leak. I\u2019ll talk to the police later today, but it all burned down. There\u2019s nothing left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Melanie all right?\u201d she asked, her voice full of dread. I paused, wondering how she knew about Mellie.</p><p>\u201cShe got out. They took her to the hospital because she hit her head. I\u2019ll go get her in a bit, but I stayed with her long enough to know she\u2019s going to be just fine. Nothing serious. You should know that her mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about her mom,\u201d Jess said softly. \u201cShe called me last night after she got to our place. I\u2019ve been thinking of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just thankful she\u2019s okay ...\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I have a place for us to stay, at least until I get the insurance worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Nate?\u201d she asked quickly. Awkward question ... I hadn\u2019t actually told her about the breakup. Oops.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I should probably talk to you about Nate,\u201d I said, feeling Reese tense behind me. I decided not to worry about him for the moment. \u201cI\u2019m not actually with him anymore. I\u2019m seeing Reese Hayes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Jess said, surprising me with her enthusiasm. She\u2019d never approved of me dating anyone before. Huh. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe with the Reapers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t with Nate?\u201d I asked, biting back a startled laugh. She didn\u2019t respond. \u201cWell, anyway, I\u2019m with Reese now. I\u2019m out at his place\u2014he was actually with me when the house blew up. He took care of me last night and he said we can stay with him while we get things figured out. He\u2019s got a room upstairs for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI was planning to call you anyway. I changed my mind. Mom and I just had a little fight, nothing big. I was exaggerating things. You know how I get all worked up. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>I stilled. Reese started rubbing my back soothingly.</p><p>\u201cIt was a big deal,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cYou were scared of those men. I heard it in your voice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve imagined it,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cReally, it\u2019s all good here. You should just hang out and take care of yourself, get the housing situation figured out. I have to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d I started to say, but she cut me off.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, London, you need to let it go. I had a bad night, okay? I got a little homesick, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m happier here. Mom has lots of money and she doesn\u2019t have to work all the time. You need to make your own life instead of trying to take over mine.\u201d</p><p>With that she ended the call. I stared down at the phone, completely confused. Then I flopped back down and burrowed into the crook of Reese\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI will never, ever understand teenage girls,\u201d I said slowly. He snorted.</p> <p>\u201cNo shit. They\u2019re all fucked in the head. Doesn\u2019t get better when they hit their twenties, either. What\u2019s the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says everything\u2019s okay and she doesn\u2019t want to come back to north Idaho. I don\u2019t get it. She was scared, Reese. This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and ran his fingers into my hair. I snuggled deeper into him, wondering how and why my world had gotten so strange so fast.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really a nice guy,\u201d I said. He groaned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say shit like that. I\u2019m not a nice guy, sweetheart. Trust me, I\u2019d know if I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re being nice to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have ulterior motives. I like fucking you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cWhatever the reason, thanks for last night. I suppose I should get to the hospital and check on Melanie. Pick her up. I\u2019ll get us out of here in a day or two. I know I\u2019ll have to talk to the cops, and then get hold of the insurance agent. I can\u2019t remember exactly what my coverage is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that for now,\u201d he told me. \u201cWorry about Melanie. Later I\u2019ll take you out and we\u2019ll find you some clothes and shit. Until we know what happened with your house, you\u2019re with me. Nice and safe here. Nonnegotiable.\u201d</p><p>That caught my attention and I rolled onto my elbow, looking down at him with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou think I wouldn\u2019t be safe somewhere else?\u201d I asked quickly. \u201cThat sounds like you think my house wasn\u2019t an accident?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI got no idea what happened to your house,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably just a gas leak. Just like the idea of keeping you around for a bit, letting shit settle. Probably hasn\u2019t totally sunk in what happened just yet\u2014you need to figure things out. This is a good place to do it. That\u2019s all I meant.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, guess I\u2019m a little edgy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it that means you aren\u2019t up for wake-up sex?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, then shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m up for anything at all,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI have whiplash. Too much happening too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Let\u2019s get to the hospital, go check on girl number two. See if they\u2019ll let us spring her.\u201d</p><p>An hour later we stood outside the hospital, Mellie gripping my arm as she took in the sight of Painter\u2019s motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cI sort of thought you meant a car when you said you\u2019d give me a ride home,\u201d she whispered, eyes wide. I nodded, more than a little startled myself by the transportation situation. Reese had insisted on us riding his bike that morning, saying Painter would meet us at the hospital to give Mellie a ride if she needed one.</p><p>I\u2019d assumed that mean a ride in a car. Not so much.</p><p>\u201cShe did have a head injury,\u201d I pointed out. Painter stood tall next to his bike, his blond hair in short spikes. He frowned at Mel.</p><p>\u201cThen call a cab,\u201d he said, his voice challenging. \u201cDon\u2019t have my car with me.\u201d</p><p>Reese rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSort of thought the car was implied,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Painter shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say and it\u2019s not like she\u2019s really hurt or anything. You got a headache?\u201d</p><p>Mel frowned, looking nervous and a little excited all at once.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t actually,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough they said no sudden movements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll have to hold on tight,\u201d Painter replied, smirking at her. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Reese said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his cell. \u201cI\u2019ll call someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Mel said suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ll try riding the bike.\u201d</p><p>She smiled hesitantly at Painter, and my mom radar exploded to life. This was the same kid who\u2019d been screwing Jessica. He was tall, with lots of tattoos and muscles and cute in that way only bad boys can be ... My Mellie was a good girl, not the kind of girl to get involved with someone like this Painter. Shit. Was she blushing?</p><p>I turned on Painter, whipping out my Parental Voice of Authority like a sword.</p><p>\u201cYou watch yourself with her,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything bad happening to that girl. I see right through you, little man.\u201d</p><p>Reese, Melanie, and Painter all froze, their faces full of shocked surprise. Then Painter started laughing.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 priceless, prez,\u201d he said, smirking at me. Then he glanced at Mel. \u201cYou comin\u2019 or not?\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly, hopping up on his bike while I glared at them both. Painter kicked his Harley to life and then roared out of the parking lot, leaving me alone with Reese.</p><p>\u201cKid\u2019s survived prison, you know that?\u201d he asked me slowly, shaking his head. \u201cBigger than you, too. Really think talkin\u2019 to him like that is a good idea? You\u2019re kind of small.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I put my hands on my hips and glared up at him.</p><p>\u201cThen why the hell did you let him ride off with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019ll do what I say,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd I told him to take her out to my place and keep her safe. He\u2019ll die before he lets anything happen to her. He\u2019s my brother and I trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s an Orthodox rabbi,\u201d I said, my voice cold. \u201cHe\u2019ll keep his filthy hands off Melanie or he\u2019ll answer to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust because he fucked Jess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have this conversation,\u201d I said tightly. \u201cI\u2019m protective of her. Unlike Jessica, Melanie works hard to avoid trouble. I hear you\u2019re protective of your girls, too, so I bet you know exactly how I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe, I get it. Just remember\u2014he\u2019s a big boy and he doesn\u2019t have to take any lip from you. Bein\u2019 with me doesn\u2019t give you the right to say shit to him, so be glad you made him laugh instead of pissin\u2019 him off.\u201d</p><p>I stepped forward and threaded my hands up and around his neck. Then I gave him a sweet, sugary smile, staring deep into his blue eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it because I\u2019m with you,\u201d I said softly, my voice deadlier than arsenic. \u201cI did it because that child\u2019s mama ran off yesterday and I\u2019m her emergency backup mother. It\u2019s a job I take seriously. Don\u2019t fuck with a mama bear, Reese. Doesn\u2019t end well for anyone\u2014not even big, bad bikers.\u201d</p><p>He burst out laughing, then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t.\u201d He leaned down and gave my nose a quick kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful not to piss you off in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that. I\u2019m small, Reese, but I\u2019m persistent. Like a rabid ferret. Don\u2019t make me bite you, because my teeth are very sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know you were into that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou keep surprisin\u2019 me, London.\u201d</p><p>I started giggling, sounding more like Melanie than myself. But Reese made me feel that way. Young and vibrant and alive. I\u2019d forgotten just how much fun it felt to fall in love.</p> <p>Wait.</p><p>I was falling in lust. Possibly infatuation. Love was something else entirely. I needed to pull my head out of my ass before I got hurt.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s get going, though. I\u2019ve got a lot to do today\u2014Oh, crap. I don\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop by the shop, pick up that loaner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say you can\u2019t accept any help, I\u2019m going to strangle you.\u201d</p> <p>I stared at him, shocked. Reese shrugged, holding out his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a guy thing,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe like taking care of our women. You don\u2019t let me help you, the other boys\u2019ll make fun of me and then I\u2019ll have to cry. Are you trying to make me cry, London?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at me like an innocent puppy, and I couldn\u2019t help it. I started laughing, and we both knew he\u2019d won.</p><p>\u201cYou suck,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou like it.\u201d</p><p>He was right\u2014I totally did.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>LONDON</p><p>Thursday passed in a blur.</p><p>We started out with a quick trip by Target so I could grab something clean to wear. I\u2019d rebuild my wardrobe down the line, but for now just having fresh panties and jeans that weren\u2019t covered in dirt and soot was a huge improvement\u2014not to mention a new bra. Reese seemed a little disappointed by that, but he\u2019d get over it. The girls liked their support.</p><p>Then I met with the cops and the fire investigators. Reese made some phone calls, and a lawyer I didn\u2019t know sat in on the meetings with me, which seemed a bit excessive. Then again, what did I know about exploding-house procedure? Not that it mattered. The suited assassin (seriously\u2014this lawyer wore a black suit and looked exactly like a hit man) just listened with a blank face, occasionally cutting off a line of questioning for reasons I never quite figured out. The official types didn\u2019t seem overly concerned by this, so I decided not to worry about it, either.</p><p>I was more worried about how I\u2019d pay the guy but apparently it was a non-issue. According to Reese, \u201cHe\u2019s on retainer with the club, babe. Part of his job. Don\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff\u2014Bud Tyrell\u2014and the fire investigator wanted to know about my history with the house (long), whether I\u2019d ever had issues with the oven (occasionally), and if I had any large, outstanding debts (always).</p><p>The latter got the most attention from them, because despite the fact that business was thriving, I was always a step behind financially. It wasn\u2019t that I blew money. Not at all. But there were six years of medical bills built up from Jessica\u2019s ongoing surgeries and treatment, which added up fast even with insurance.</p><p>When they asked for specifics, I couldn\u2019t tell them anything. All my records burned up in the fire. They\u2019d see plenty if they pulled my credit report, though. Maybe I could use the insurance settlement to pay off my debts? Tempting ...</p><p>That\u2019s when I realized having a lawyer in the room might not be such a bad idea after all.</p><p>It\u2019s all about motive, right?</p><p>Meeting with the insurance agent was easier. I\u2019d never really paid attention to my coverage, but he\u2019d been my mother\u2019s agent for years and he\u2019d known what he was doing when he set everything up. Not only did I have fantastic coverage to rebuild the house, but I had coverage for living expenses for the duration.</p><p>I could move out of Reese\u2019s place any time I wanted.</p><p>The idea was less appealing than it should\u2019ve been. I mentioned looking for an apartment and he shut me down, so I figured that was an argument I\u2019d tackle tomorrow. The thought of one more night in his bed wasn\u2019t exactly unappealing under normal circumstances\u2014as things stood, I was more than happy to stay put for a couple of days.</p><p>Thursday night Reese took me and Melanie out to dinner, with the ever-present Painter tagging along for good measure. I glared at him every time he talked to Mellie, which seemed to give him perverse pleasure, and when I complained about him to Reese after we locked ourselves in the bedroom, he rolled me over and shut me up with his mouth.</p><p>It was an impressive argument in favor of silence, all things considered.</p><p>In the midst of all this, they called on Friday to let us know my van was ready. I drove the loaner over to the shop, where I was handed my keys by a gruff, overweight man who ignored me when I asked about a bill. He wouldn\u2019t even tell me what\u2019d been wrong with the vehicle, which seemed a bit excessive. I would\u2019ve been pissed if I weren\u2019t so thankful that it was up and running without me having to blow my savings completely. Sure, I had insurance money coming. Theoretically. But I\u2019d need that to rebuild, and those medical bills were always waiting for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now it was Friday evening, and I was about to experience my first real biker party out at the Armory. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about this\u2014before all the drama with the house, I\u2019d promised Reese that he could have Friday night and I wanted to keep my word. On the other hand, I\u2019d watched my house blow up and I didn\u2019t have anything to wear.</p><p>Reese laughed at me and suggested I go naked.</p><p>I went shopping instead, both for clothing and for several large containers of baked beans and fruit salad, because exploding house or not, I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d show up to a potluck empty-handed. The gravel parking lot outside the Armory was about half full when I pulled in, with the same two young prospects I\u2019d met on my first trip out there directing traffic.</p><p>Did those poor guys ever get a break?</p> <p>This time they didn\u2019t question me as I walked toward the building, just waved me through a side gate in the wall. I followed a narrow passage between the wall and the looming mass of the fortress itself, leading to a large courtyard in the back. It was a mixture of pavement, open grass, and outbuildings that had to cover a good acre or two.</p><p>It felt like being inside a castle courtyard, but instead of knights and ladies there were big, scary guys with beards and more cleavage than I\u2019d ever seen outside a girls\u2019 locker room. People bustled around everywhere and they all seemed to know each other or have a job to do. Feeling awkward, I glanced around for Reese. Maybe coming out here had been a mistake. Then a tall, curvy woman in tight jeans came up to me, smiling broadly. She looked about my age and very friendly.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Darcy,\u201d she said, reaching out to take the container of beans from me. \u201cI\u2019m Boonie\u2019s old lady. He\u2019s president of the Silver Bastards. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon Armstrong,\u201d I said, putting on my game face. \u201cI\u2019m friends with Reese Hayes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPicnic?\u201d she asked, looking startled. \u201cUm, don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but you don\u2019t look like his usual type. Are you ... together?\u201d</p> <p>A heavy arm came down around my shoulders, startling me so much I squeaked. I looked up to find Painter grinning at Darcy, a hint of the devil in his pale blue eyes. His white-blond hair was newly spiked and he wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt under his leather cut. Made me feel kind of pervy to notice, but between the muscles and the tattoos he was actually very attractive. He smelled good, too.</p><p>Oh, I definitely needed to keep his handsome ass away from Melanie ... Boys like this one were dangerous, and not just because of the whole prison thing.</p><p>\u201cLondon\u2019s playing house with Pic,\u201d he said blandly. Darcy\u2019s eyes opened wide.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d</p><p>Painter nodded.</p><p>\u201cYup, they\u2019re shacked up,\u201d he said. \u201cExpectin\u2019 him to get down on one knee and propose soon. It\u2019s all so beautiful we could just cry.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth dropped and he burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 priceless,\u201d he said, shaking his head and dropping his arm. \u201cShe\u2019s his newest piece of ass. Seems to be sticking more than the usual, but we all know how he is. She doesn\u2019t like me much for some reason, do you, babe?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, trying to decide whether kicking him in the nuts on Reaper property was a bad idea.</p><p>Probably.</p><p>\u201cReese and I are dating,\u201d I said to Darcy, pulling my dignity around me like a queen. \u201cI had a problem with my house, and he graciously offered to let me stay as his guest until I get things worked out. Anything else is baseless speculation.\u201d</p><p>With those words I scowled at Painter for emphasis. He held his hands up in surrender, a look of blatantly fake empathy taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cWow, guess I\u2019m not wanted here. I\u2019ll go. You bring Melanie with you? I\u2019d love to show her the clubhouse.\u201d</p><p>I growled and he burst out laughing again before swaggering off.</p> <p>\u201cI see ...\u201d Darcy said slowly. \u201cWell, you must be something special, because Pic doesn\u2019t date women. He fucks \u2019em and dumps \u2019em. I should know. Enough of his leftovers have shown up at my place crying over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s very interesting,\u201d I replied, because what else could you say? Darcy shook her head, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking\u2014that was so rude and I didn\u2019t mean it that way. We must seem like the strangest people you\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond to that, and she shrugged sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Painter\u201d\u2014she paused to glare at him across the courtyard\u2014\u201cjust has a strange sense of humor, and I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean to offend you. And I know all the other old ladies will be thrilled to meet you. This is a special party, because we\u2019ve got people coming in from five different states. Montana, Idaho, Oregon, California, and Washington. Three different clubs. You\u2019ll have a great time, although you might want to stick close to either Pic or one of us, seeing as you don\u2019t have a property patch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a property patch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, you really are new,\u201d she said, eyes widening. \u201cIt\u2019s when a man marks you as his, so the others know to keep their hands off. See mine?\u201d</p><p>She turned around and for the first time I noticed she was wearing a leather vest, just like one of the guys. On the back it read \u201cProperty of Silver Bastards. Boonie.\u201d</p><p>Once again, I had no idea what to say. She seemed proud and pleased with it, although I couldn\u2019t quite imagine calling myself property. Of course, I couldn\u2019t imagine my house blowing up, either. Sometimes life throws you a curve. Darcy turned back toward me, eyes assessing my face carefully.</p><p>\u201cIn club culture, being a man\u2019s property is like being married to him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means he\u2019s my old man, and that\u2019s a special bond. The others respect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see ...\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t, but you\u2019re being polite and I like that,\u201d she told me. \u201cMore polite than I was. Here, come on over and meet some of the other girls. You\u2019ll like them, and while you may not be Pic\u2019s old lady, you\u2019re obviously someone special. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be sleeping over at his place. Don\u2019t listen to Painter\u2014he\u2019s just fuckin\u2019 with your head, okay?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, because I hadn\u2019t planned on listening to Painter anyway. I liked Darcy, though. She was a little different, but she seemed genuine and kind. That went a long way in my book. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She started walking across the cracked concrete, and I followed her, studying the scene. There was a largish group of women arranging food on long tables back against the building. They all worked together smoothly to put together the meal, and I got the impression that every movement was well rehearsed\u2014they must do this a lot.</p><p>That sort of surprised me, although I\u2019m not sure why. I guess I\u2019d pegged the parties as one hundred percent debauchery, but even sex fiends have to eat. At least my baked beans and fruit salad fit right in, because this spread wouldn\u2019t be out of place at a church social. Apparently some things are universal, and potlucks are one of them.</p><p>Off to the right was a big fire pit built out of curved concrete landscaping blocks. The blackened smoke streaks and enormous pile of firewood stacked behind it made it clear the club used it often and well. Past that was a long patch of grass that I wouldn\u2019t call lush, but it seemed to be holding its own despite the presence of a big wooden play structure complete with swings, slide, and rope bridge to a tree-house. The latter had been built into the branches of an enormous tree with a trunk that had to be nearly six feet wide. Old growth. Probably predated the building.</p><p>\u201cLadies, this is London Armstrong,\u201d Darcy said as we reached the tables, which was surrounded by bustling women wearing property patches like Darcy\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s with Picnic.\u201d</p> <p>Several of the women stilled, studying me with sudden intensity. I glanced around, wondering what I\u2019d done. A small brunette with riotously curling hair stepped forward, grinning at me. I\u2019d met her before ... What was her name? Marie. That was it. She\u2019d shown me around Pawns the first night my crew had come in.</p><p>\u201cHey, London,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cGood to see you again! Sorry if it looks like we\u2019re acting weird, but Picnic doesn\u2019t usually bring women around here. Well, not the kind of women who bring fruit salad with them.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, because I knew exactly what kind of women he liked to hang out with, and I\u2019d be willing to bet some of them weren\u2019t old enough to know how to make baked beans. You didn\u2019t make the beans, either, my brain pointed out caustically. Jealous much?</p><p>Well, I could have made them if I wanted to, I insisted right back.</p><p>\u201cUm, London? You okay?\u201d</p> <p>Oh, crap. I\u2019d zoned out in the middle of a conversation again. I really, really needed to stop doing that. I smiled brightly and pretended I wasn\u2019t a giant dork.</p><p>\u201cReese and I are dating and he wanted me to come to the party,\u201d I told her, holding out the plastic bowl like an offering. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe in coming to parties empty-handed. Now how can I help?\u201d</p><p>Marie looked impressed, and I realized I\u2019d passed some sort of invisible test. I didn\u2019t know what it was and I didn\u2019t care. It was just nice to be surrounded by friendly faces, because despite the fact that the Reaper men had been good to me\u2014for the most part\u2014they were still scary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dancer,\u201d said a tall woman with long hair, dusky skin, and a slow smile that screamed sexy. \u201cI\u2019m Bam Bam\u2019s old lady. Horse is my brother, and we practically grew up in this club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Horse,\u201d I told her, smiling. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met Bam Bam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here tonight,\u201d she said, her voice soft with something I couldn\u2019t quite read.</p> <p>\u201cHorse is my old man,\u201d Marie chimed in. \u201cHe\u2019s a handful, but he\u2019s a good guy. Most of the time, at least. Pic give you a gun yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Picnic given you a gun yet?\u201d she asked, as if it were a perfectly reasonable question. I shook my head, wondering if I\u2019d somehow missed half the conversation.</p><p>\u201cJust sort of seeing where things stand,\u201d she said, smirking. That made no sense at all, so I decided to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Em,\u201d said a young woman with brown hair and Reese\u2019s eyes. I recognized her immediately from the photos around his house and felt a sudden burst of nerves. This was his daughter. The one who\u2019d moved to Portland last year, leaving him with an empty nest.</p><p>Why did I suddenly feel like I was in a job interview?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all about you. I didn\u2019t realize you lived close enough to come to a party, though. I thought you were in Portland with your ...\u201d I fumbled for the right word, because she didn\u2019t seem old enough to use the term \u201cold man.\u201d But I was pretty sure he was more than a boyfriend, and they weren\u2019t married. Awkward, trying to figure out how to say things.</p><p>\u201cMy old man is Hunter,\u201d she said, her eyes sparkling as she said his name. \u201cHe\u2019s here for the meet. Bunch of clubs coming together, but that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with us. Your only job here is to have fun, okay? Let\u2019s go find you a drink and we can talk. I want to get to know the woman who\u2019s moved in with my dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve moved in together ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you slept there more than one night?\u201d she asked, her voice challenging. I nodded. \u201cWell, that\u2019s more than he\u2019s done with any other woman since my mom died.\u201d</p><p>Damn. No pressure there.</p><p>Em took my arm and pulled me over past the tables to where several plastic garbage cans held silver kegs surrounded by ice. She grabbed a red Solo cup.</p><p>\u201cBeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Not that I\u2019m a particularly big beer fan. Usually I drink wine, but it seemed the polite thing to do and I could nurse it through the evening. I pulled out my phone while she primed the pump, wondering why Reese never answered my message. He\u2019d told me to text him when I arrived. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou waiting to hear from my dad?\u201d Em asked, holding out the cup. I shoved the phone back into my pocket, nodding. \u201cHe\u2019s probably welcoming the other officers who traveled here. It\u2019s important\u2014otherwise I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be out here with you already. As the president, he has certain things he needs to do at events like this, but he obviously trusts you to handle yourself. Want to sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I said, noting that she hadn\u2019t gotten a cup of beer for herself. Hmmm ... Should I have accepted her offer? Maybe it wasn\u2019t considered appropriate to have a drink so early? A quick, surreptitious glance around told me other people had already hit the beer.</p><p>I decided I was overthinking things. Sometimes people just don\u2019t feel like drinking, and if I kept worrying about doing something wrong I\u2019d go crazy. We found a spot at a picnic table near the playground, and she sat down, straddling the bench to face me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, this is different,\u201d she said, and while her tone was friendly, her eyes were serious. \u201cSince my mom died, Dad hasn\u2019t exactly been dating women. Half the bitches he screws are younger than me and none of them have brains. I hear you own a business and while I\u2019d never say you\u2019re old, you\u2019re definitely in the right age range for him. What gives?\u201d</p><p>I smiled weakly.</p><p>\u201cNot sure how to answer that,\u201d I said, wondering why the hell I\u2019d let him talk me into coming out here tonight. If he wanted me to meet everyone, he should be introducing me to them. Instead he\u2019d thrown me into the deep end without a warning, which was sort of a dick move. \u201cYour father and I are sort of seeing each other, I guess. Officially, just a couple days ago, although it feels like longer. It\u2019s complicated. I\u2019ve worked for the club since last February, and he hired me to clean out at his place. We hooked up and then my house blew up. It\u2019s not a typical relationship.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cWhy did your house blow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cGas buildup, so far as I can tell? Maybe the oven\u2014in the past year or so, gas started leaking if you bumped the controls wrong. The fire investigator is looking into it. I guess for my purposes it doesn\u2019t really matter why the place blew. All that matters is I don\u2019t have a house ... That\u2019s really what I\u2019m focused on at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he moved you into our place,\u201d she mused. \u201cAnd he moved in your daughter, too? Did I hear that right?\u201d</p><p>Taking a drink of my beer, I tried to figure out the best way to answer that question.</p><p>\u201cMelanie isn\u2019t mine,\u201d I said. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t have any children of my own. I\u2019ve been raising my cousin\u2019s girl, though, and Melanie is her friend. Jessica is down in California right now and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll be coming back or not, but Mellie needed a place to stay. We\u2019re actually really lucky she wasn\u2019t hurt in the explosion\u2014she was in the house right before it went up.\u201d</p> <p>Em\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cInteresting ...\u201d she said, and I wished I could read her thoughts. \u201cYou realize this isn\u2019t normal for my dad at all. Is Melanie out here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head emphatically. \u201cShe\u2019s already got a crush on that Painter jerk, and the last thing I want is her out here spending more time near him.\u201d</p><p>Em snorted.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about Painter, okay? Hunter and I will probably sleep out at the house tonight, so maybe I\u2019ll meet her in the morning. We weren\u2019t sure we were coming until the last minute. Things are sort of up in the air, but we usually stay with him ...\u201d</p><p>I caught a hint of question in her voice, and I realized she must be wondering if my presence would change things out at her dad\u2019s place. I took a deep swig of my beer, because the longer this conversation continued, the more awkward it got. Where the hell was Reese?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want you to do whatever you normally would,\u201d I told Em. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let us get in your way. You\u2019ll like Melanie\u2014she\u2019s a sweet kid. And she deserves better than what she\u2019s got going on back home. I really appreciate your dad\u2019s kindness.\u201d</p><p>A funny look came over her face, and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Kind\u2019 is not a word women use for my dad.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, because he\u2019d been kind to me.</p><p>He\u2019d also been overbearing, scary, and pushy ... But once a man throws his body over yours to protect you from an explosion, I guess you tend to overlook the little things.</p><p>My plan to slowly sip one drink over the course of the evening fell apart pretty quickly. For one, I was nervous as hell and the booze soothed me every time I started feeling panicky. Ideally he would\u2019ve met me at the gate, introduced me to people, et cetera. But I also understood he was a host, and it made me feel kind of proud that he trusted me enough to simply throw me into his social circle on my own.</p><p>My \u201cslow sipping\u201d plan also fell apart because the Reaper women knew how to drink and they weren\u2019t shy about encouraging me to join them. Before I knew what was happening, Dancer had lined up a row of tequila shots in front of us, issuing everyone salt and limes before declaring, \u201cDrink up, bitches! If God wanted us sober, he wouldn\u2019t have made shot glasses so cute!\u201d</p><p>We all licked our hands, poured our salt, and sucked the shots down like a line of good little soldiers.</p> <p>All but Em, that is.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?\u201d Dancer demanded, shouting to be heard over the music and growing noise of the party. She nodded toward the younger woman\u2019s water bottle. \u201cYou love shots. You used to sneak them in my bathroom with your sister. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve given up alcohol?\u201d</p><p>Em shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNot in the mood, I guess. Is there a law that says I have to drink?\u201d</p><p>The women stilled and Dancer leaned in, studying the younger woman with owlish eyes. She held up a finger, waving it back and forth in the air like a divining rod, biting her tongue in concentration. Then the finger moved down, pointing toward Em\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou got somethin\u2019 in there we should know about?\u201d</p><p>My eyes went wide, darting toward Em\u2019s tummy, which was covered by a loose T-shirt. She blushed and looked away. Dancer and Marie burst out in screams, jumping up and down, and suddenly we were surrounded by big men wearing leather and concerned facial expressions.</p><p>I was glad to see them, too, because so far as I could tell, the women had lost their minds.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, babe?\u201d Horse demanded, catching Marie and pulling her into his side protectively. A young, tall, muscular man wearing black leather with red accents came up behind Em and tugged her back into his arms. He let his hands rest over her stomach and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cTold you they\u2019d figure it out,\u201d he said, not looking particularly upset. I glanced at his patches and decided this must be Hunter. With his hands over her stomach. Holy shit\u2014Em must be pregnant! Wow. I wondered how Reese would feel about that?</p><p>Grandpa Hayes.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d muttered another man. He was tall and built and had a pierced eyebrow and lip. His vest said his name was Ruger, which I recognized, although I\u2019d never met him in person. This must be Sophie\u2019s old man\u2014I\u2019d met her earlier with the other girls, although she\u2019d wandered off toward the kitchen to grab more cups a few moments ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPic know about this?\u201d someone asked. Em shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the due date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly next year,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cShe\u2019s a little more than three months along, but we wanted to keep things quiet for a while.\u201d</p><p>Someone snorted, and I realized it was Darcy.</p> <p>\u201cGood luck keeping things quiet around here,\u201d she declared.</p><p>\u201cCongrats,\u201d a familiar voice said, and I looked up to find Painter staring at Em, his face utterly blank. Everyone stilled.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, but she didn\u2019t look at him. Instead she turned her head toward Hunter, who took the opportunity to press a deep, intimate kiss on her. I blushed, because if she hadn\u2019t been pregnant before that kiss, she would\u2019ve been after. Nobody else seemed to notice or care, though. Nobody but Painter. He turned and stalked off.</p><p>Obviously there was a story here. Not that I\u2019d pry ... but it was only human to feel curious, right?</p> <p>Then something in the air changed, and I felt that sense of tension and anticipation that only came when Reese was nearby. I looked around for him, spotting him coming out of the Armory\u2019s back door. His eyes found mine and he smiled. I melted, any lingering annoyance about being left on my own disappearing because just seeing him made me feel special and wonderful.</p><p>Ruh-roh.</p><p>I really shouldn\u2019t be falling for him this quickly.</p><p>He came striding up to our group, throwing an arm around my neck casually, tugging me into his big body with an air of primitive possession that sent a thrill racing through me.</p><p>\u201cEmmy Lou,\u201d he said in greeting, and I felt the love in his voice. \u201cHunter.\u201d</p><p>Not so much love for him. Lots of stories I hadn\u2019t heard, here ...</p> <p>\u201cPic,\u201d Hunter said, nodding. His grip on Em tightened, and that\u2019s when Reese spotted Hunter\u2019s hands folded protectively across Em\u2019s stomach. I felt his entire body tense.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d he said, his voice deceptively casual. \u201cI heard screaming, which usually means we\u2019re under attack. Of course, it could also mean that Marie and Dancer found a new nail polish color they like.\u201d</p><p>Em smiled at him hesitantly, and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you\u2019re going to be a grandpa.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Reese muttered, and I couldn\u2019t quite read his tone. Neither could anyone else, apparently, because we all froze. Finally he spoke again. \u201cCongratulations, baby. Hope you\u2019re ready for it. Kinda like the idea of some little muppet givin\u2019 you hell for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans you\u2019re stuck with me, Pic,\u201d Hunter said, his voice full of satisfaction. Em tugged free and smacked his arm. Then she came toward Reese, who let me go so he could give her a deep hug. I stepped back, not wanting to interfere with their moment.</p> <p>People scattered, giving them space, and I tried to figure out what to do with myself. Looking around, I noticed that the tables were littered with empty plastic shot glasses and beer cups. Reese and Em were still talking quietly to each other, so I figured I might as well clear up a bit while they shared her big news. Not every day a man learned he had a grandchild on the way.</p><p>It was on my third trip to the garbage, arms full of empties, that I spotted Painter out by the big old tree in the back corner of the enclosure. He\u2019d been a jerk to me, but there was something about his body language that caught my attention. For once he didn\u2019t look cocky.</p><p>I walked toward him, then put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked, my voice soft. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the history, but to an outsider, it seemed like that was a rough thing for you to hear. Anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, and if I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d say his eyes looked suspiciously watery. Then he shook his head, throwing that casual arm around me once again, pulling me in for a quick hug. Not mocking this time\u2014genuine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave her alone,\u201d he said quietly. I glanced up at him, confused.</p><p>\u201cMelanie,\u201d he clarified. \u201cI won\u2019t bother her, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wondering if he was telling the truth. Reese\u2019s words came back to me\u2014these guys had so many women falling all over them that one more wouldn\u2019t matter, right?</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s had a really hard time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d I said, patting his back awkwardly. \u201cYou want a drink?\u201d He shook his head and let me go.</p><p>\u201cNaw, think I\u2019ll go for a ride,\u201d he said. \u201cClear my head a little. You go find Pic, help him celebrate. He should enjoy tonight. Things\u2019ll fall to shit soon enough around here. They always do.\u201d</p><p>Alrighty, then ... I glanced back toward the party, then spotted a cluster of empty cups that had been left on the play structure. They offended my sense of order and cleanliness, and that\u2019s when I realized something wonderful.</p><p>I had something to offer these people.</p><p>I\u2019d been feeling out of place ever since I\u2019d gotten here, and while the women were definitely friendly and the drinking was fun, I hadn\u2019t quite known what to do with myself. But this\u2014making sure things got picked up, or keeping an eye out for stragglers like Painter? I could do this and help Reese in the process, because despite the fact that it was a social event, you\u2019d have to be an idiot not to see he was under a lot of pressure here.</p><p>Better yet? I could do it and still drink.</p><p>I felt my stress drop away and I nearly laughed out loud, because I had a job to do, helping the man who\u2019d gone out of his way to help me.</p><p>Life was good.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>I was still high off my little revelation when arms came around me from behind, catching the cups I\u2019d been holding and setting them on the table. Then Reese turned me toward him, looking down at me in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou throw yourself right in, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, and I smiled, puzzled. \u201cYou\u2019re picking up, helpin\u2019 the girls. I even saw you talkin\u2019 to Painter despite the fact that he\u2019s been sort of an asshole to you. You like takin\u2019 care of people, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, feeling all smug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being polite,\u201d I said. \u201cWho sits around at a party ignoring a mess like this? I\u2019ve had fun hanging out with the other women, too\u2014they seem like a good group. They\u2019re really friendly, and they\u2019ve told me all sorts of interesting things about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, smirking. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fill me in.\u201d</p><p>With that he drew me away from the table, catching my hand and leading me past the bonfire toward the same corner of the courtyard where I\u2019d talked to Painter earlier. The giant tree sheltered everything, and behind the massive trunk you couldn\u2019t really see the rest of the party. It formed something like an outdoor room back here, with the corner of the courtyard wall ensuring privacy.</p><p>Reese grinned at me, then sat down and leaned back against the trunk. I tried to sit next to him, but he caught my leg and tugged it over his waist. I fell off balance and then I was straddling him, hands braced against his shoulders. His own hands caught my waist, pulling my pelvis down and into his.</p><p>Oh, very nice ... Like always, being near him filled me with tension and longing, a feeling I knew was mutual because his penis was getting harder and harder. It pushed up at me through our jeans, and I couldn\u2019t help myself. I just had to wiggle around just a little.</p><p>Reese groaned, then his fingers dug into my ass hard, dragging me up and down along his length.</p><p>\u201cChrist, feels like forever since I\u2019ve touched you. Been stuck yap-pin\u2019, instead of hanging out with my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a little upset with you earlier,\u201d I admitted. He leaned forward and started sucking on my neck. Not hard enough to make a mark, just enough to heat me up and start driving me crazy. The space between my legs was hot and empty. I wanted him up inside, filling me, stretching me ... We\u2019d been together enough now that I knew it would be good, but not so much that the mystery was gone. This position, for example. I realized that I\u2019d never been on top with him before.</p><p>So much potential.</p><p>I caught my hands in his hair and jerked his head back, then kissed him hard, reversing our usual roles. My tongue plunged deep and he reached between us, unhooking the button on the front of my pants. Then his hands slid down my ass, under my jeans and underwear, cupping me hard as our mouths fought with each other.</p><p>Finally I pulled back, out of breath, panting. I felt how much he wanted me\u2014his dick was harder than a rock, and that wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. Like a pillar of granite. I wanted to taste it ... Yes, I definitely needed to taste him now that I\u2019d finally gotten him alone, because who knew how long it would be before someone found him and needed something? Knowing my luck they\u2019d spot us any minute.</p><p>Well, if they did, they\u2019d get a show because I was tired of waiting.</p><p>What? Sheesh, how much have I had to drink? That isn\u2019t me.</p><p>But why couldn\u2019t it be me? I\u2019d been stuck doing the right thing, being a good girl, my whole damned life. Fuck that.</p><p>\u201cSo you still pissed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still pissed at me?\u201d he asked again. \u201cRight before you kissed me, you said that I\u2019d upset you. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>My head shook, and I smiled at him, feeling dazed.</p><p>\u201cYou told me to come out here and then you weren\u2019t around,\u201d I told him. \u201cAt first it bothered me, because I felt like you abandoned me. But it kind of worked out. I had to reach out and introduce myself. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve met nearly so many people if I\u2019d been with you. I like your friends\u2014at least, I like the women. The ones wearing the property patches. I didn\u2019t really talk to the others.\u201d</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>\u201cProbably just as well,\u201d he said. \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t like the stories they have to tell nearly as much. Biker groupies and club whores. Nice girls, a lot of them, but they aren\u2019t part of the community the same way the old ladies are.\u201d</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed pretty comfortable with that Sharon chick. I thought she was part of the community. Now you tell me she isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. Sharon\u2019s a good kid,\u201d he said, hands kneading my ass in a slow rhythm that nearly made my heart stop. I struggled against the lust, trying to turn off my brain and listen to him. \u201cBut she\u2019s still a club whore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told me she wasn\u2019t a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a term,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cShe isn\u2019t getting paid or anything. Just means she likes to hang around, and in exchange she\u2019ll sleep with whoever wants her. She\u2019s under our protection.\u201d</p><p>He slipped a hand around to the front of my body, then reached down and found my clit with his fingertip.</p><p>\u201cYou really wanna talk about Sharon right now?\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, and shook my head, burying my face in his shoulder as he started working my clit harder. My hips twisted over his, grinding his cock down hard as the tension built inside me.</p><p>\u201cLadies first,\u201d he whispered, then used the hand still on my ass to lift me just enough for him to shove three fingers down deep inside. Holy crap. I don\u2019t know how he pulled it off logistically and I didn\u2019t care. All that mattered was the way he filled me up and ground down on my clit at the same time. My heart was beating too fast and I felt dizzy with need and desire and pleasure that wound so tight I thought I might explode.</p><p>Oh, God ... please explode!</p><p>Then it hit, and I bit his shoulder so I wouldn\u2019t scream, waves of ecstasy shattering me. My body went limp over his, and he pulled the hand that\u2019d tortured me free. Then it was at my mouth, pushing inside until I tasted myself all over him as he gripped my jaw in a soft but firm hold.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to suck my cock?\u201d</p><p>I nodded so fast it made me dizzy. Then he let me go and I slithered down his body, ripping at his jeans and pulling his belt free. He lifted his hips to help me, his erection springing free to slap up against his belly. I\u2019d seen it before, of course, but never up quite this close and personal. We hadn\u2019t had a normal courtship, and I realized with a shock that we\u2019d only had sex three times, total. Wow. Felt like so much more than that.</p><p>A little frisson of excitement raced up my spine\u2014there was so much more about him I couldn\u2019t wait to learn. I giggled, giddy, and he grinned down at me, wrapping his fingers tight into my hair.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a kid when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d I whispered back at him. \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. Why don\u2019t you suck me off like we\u2019re in the backseat of a car and you\u2019ve got ten minutes \u2019til curfew,\u201d he said, winking.</p><p>I leaned down and licked his full length, root to head, in answer. He groaned and dropped his head back against the tree. My tongue wound around his cockhead, tracing the smooth ridge dividing the head from the shaft. Then I found the little notch on the bottom and pointed my tongue, wiggling across it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reese groaned again, shifting his hips as his hands clutched my hair.

I wasn\u2019t done playing.</p><p>I sucked and nipped my way down the shaft, letting my teeth brush him just enough to let him know they were on the job, so he\u2019d better behave. I\u2019d always loved giving head. I don\u2019t know why ... Maybe the power of it, the way a man will do almost anything if you offer to touch his dick with your mouth? I found his balls and reached up to catch them in my hand, squeezing them gently before sucking one into my mouth.</p><p>Oh, he definitely liked that.</p> <p>I pulled my head away and looked up at him through my lashes, letting my tongue slide along my lower lip.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, something close to desperation in his eyes. His thigh muscles were rock hard under my hands, and while he might look relaxed against the tree, I knew that was a lie. If I pulled away right now, he\u2019d probably stroke out. Fortunately, I\u2019m a benevolent kind of woman, so I opened my mouth wide and sucked in his cockhead like a Popsicle.</p><p>Bobbing up and down, I took him a little deeper each time. He hands came up to clutch my head, fingers tightening in my hair with restrained power. He could force me if he wanted to. Just shove me down over his erection, slamming it into my throat.</p><p>The hint of danger turned me on and I felt myself getting wet again between the legs.</p> <p>By the fourth or fifth stroke I\u2019d gone as deep as I could without gagging, which thankfully seemed to be plenty good for him. He grunted and groaned as I sucked him hard, bringing my hands up to catch and squeeze the lower part of his shaft with every stroke of my mouth.</p><p>Then he started swelling in my mouth, and I realized he must be getting close. His length twitched and he gave me a little tap on the side of the head, a warning to pull away. A real gentleman. But I wasn\u2019t feeling ladylike, not at all. I sucked him down harder, and when his shaft throbbed and he started spurting I swallowed hard as he groaned and shuddered.</p><p>Finally I pulled away, catching the edge of his shirt to wipe my mouth. My lips felt sore, almost bruised, and when I spoke my voice rasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an experienced club whore, but I hope that was okay with you?\u201d</p><p>He stared down at me, blinking, then gave me that sexy smile of his again.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 amateurs compared to you, babe. You got a real talent for that,\u201d he muttered. \u201cShit, how long since you had sex again? Six years? That include givin\u2019 head?\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSix long years,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I think my dry spell is over. I want to brush my teeth, though. You got a toothbrush around here? Or is that too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, then dragged me up his body, holding me close.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t, I\u2019ll send a prospect to the store to buy you one,\u201d he muttered. \u201cFuck, babe. You can have whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed him tight, because I already had what I wanted.</p><p>Him.</p><p>This.</p><p>Us.</p> <p>Unfortunately, fantasies are for children and I was a grown woman. I should\u2019ve known it wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>REESE</p><p>I lay in the darkness on my office couch, eyes closed, mind drifting.</p><p>London was passed out on top of me, her soft curves molding against me. She gave a tiny, ladylike snore. Adorable. I let my hand slide down to her ass, cupping it as I considered all I had to get done in the next twelve hours.</p><p>Big meeting today. Big decisions, and I had a feeling that within the next couple of weeks we\u2019d start to see the bodies pile up. There\u2019d been more drama in the south, more cartel bullshit. My daughter\u2019s old man was in it up to his ass.</p><p>I had mixed feelings about that situation.</p><p>On the one hand, I wanted Hunter dead for all he\u2019d done to Em, not least of which was stealing her from me and knocking her up. On the other, the last thing I needed was some cartel fuckwad pulling the trigger on him. If anyone put that bastard in the ground, it would be me.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Like I\u2019d do that to my little girl. Or her baby. Shit. Couldn\u2019t quite wrap my head around that\u2014my little girl was gonna be a mom. She didn\u2019t seem old enough, although I\u2019d been several years younger than she was right now when I planted Emmy in Heather.</p><p>God help Hunter if he treated her wrong. He\u2019d be on his knees praying for death before I ended him.</p><p>London stirred against me, the perfect distraction. Couldn\u2019t wrap my head around her, either. I still couldn\u2019t believe how much fun she was. Her house exploding had turned into something of a bonus, at least in terms of keeping her in my bed. Not like I was happy about her losin\u2019 everything, but I was more than willing to take advantage of it, given the opportunity.</p><p>She\u2019d talked to her insurance agent Thursday, mentioned moving out into an apartment. Wasn\u2019t gonna happen\u2014at least not any time soon. I liked her way too much. Sure, having Mellie around was a pain in the ass, but kids always were. She\u2019d move out by the end of summer anyway. Planned to start college, and I knew she\u2019d signed up for housing. All good there.</p><p>Now my brothers? They weren\u2019t too sure about me and London. They liked her plenty, but they also knew I was a player and they didn\u2019t want me fucking up the cleaning contracts.</p><p>Fuck \u2019em. What\u2019s the point of being president if you can\u2019t pull rank every once in a while?</p><p>Someone knocked at the door and I glanced at the clock. Almost nine in the morning, though you\u2019d never know it seein\u2019 as the office didn\u2019t have a window.</p><p>\u201cYou in there, prez?\u201d Bolt asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, keeping my voice low. London stirred, then slumped back down into sleep.</p><p>\u201cGirls got breakfast going,\u201d he said. \u201cShade says he wants to start church before ten. We got a lot to get through.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d I muttered. I shook London, who grumbled and muttered at me to go away. Biting back a smile, I rolled her to the side, sliding her off my body and down into the fabric of the couch. Her butt stuck up in the air and her hair covered her face. She gave another little snore.</p><p>I stood and stretched, reaching for the little light on my desk. I found it and flicked it on, sending a soft green glow through the room from the banker\u2019s shade covering the bulb.</p><p>You have fun last night? Heather asked.</p><p>I glared at her picture on the file cabinet.</p><p>Yeah. You got a problem with that?</p><p>She laughed, and I imagined her shaking her head.</p><p>I told you to be happy, baby, she seemed to whisper. I like this one. She makes you smile and she pitches in. The girls like her. I know you don\u2019t want another old lady, but maybe you need to pull your head out of your ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fuck that. Happenin\u2019 too fast. London grunted and rolled onto her back, making a smacking noise with her mouth. It wasn\u2019t the sexiest thing I\u2019d ever seen, but the sight of her tits flattening out across her chest was right up there. She\u2019d seemed too sweet, too soft when I met her. She\u2019d never survive in the club, I\u2019d known it in my bones.</p><p>Then she\u2019d sucked my cock like a pro in the courtyard, and the fact that any one of a hundred people could\u2019ve walked up on us at any moment didn\u2019t seem to bother her at all. Earlier, when I\u2019d gotten stuck talking to my national president and left her hangin\u2019 for hours with a crowd of strangers, London did great on her own. The woman wasn\u2019t a coward.</p><p>Not only that, she brought food to the party and she wasn\u2019t scared to stand up to Painter. She pitched in to keep things tidy, made sure everyone had enough to eat. Hell, she didn\u2019t even freak out when her house exploded, which would\u2019ve been totally fair, even in my book.</p><p>Old lady material.</p> <p>You don\u2019t want her, maybe you should pass her along to a man who does? Heather suggested, her voice sly. Don\u2019t waste a good old lady\u2014bring her into the club. Doesn\u2019t have to be you claiming her. We need women like this one ... Bolt\u2019s lonely as hell these days.</p><p>\u201cBolt touches her, I\u2019m shootin\u2019 him.\u201d</p><p>London stirred, then opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d she whispered. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been someone in the hallway,\u201d I grunted.</p> <p>\u201cYou mind if I sleep some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou rest. I think later on the girls are goin\u2019 out, getting their toes done or some such shit. You should go with them.\u201d</p><p>London\u2019s eyes were already closed again.</p><p>I gave Heather the finger and slipped out the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Hunter declared, looking around the big game room on the second floor of the Armory. We had men from three clubs here\u2014nowhere near enough room in the chapel for all of us. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing defense against the cartel for too long. The Jacks are standing strong, but we don\u2019t have the manpower to hold out much longer. We\u2019re already losing territory. They\u2019re gettin\u2019 more powerful and soon they won\u2019t be satisfied with anything less than open war. We think it\u2019s better to attack them before they come after us with full strength, but we can\u2019t do it alone. We need the Reapers and the Silver Bastards to join us, along with your support clubs. This may be our last chance to stop them.\u201d</p><p>I sat back in my chair, wishing I didn\u2019t dislike Hunter quite so much. Hard to listen to him making such sense and reconcile my respect for his opinions with him fuckin\u2019 my baby girl and putting a baby in her. Shade, the Reapers\u2019 national president, gave Hunter a respectful nod. The younger man sat back down, making way for Boonie\u2014the president of the Silver Bastards\u2014to speak.</p> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Boonie said, surprising me. The Bastards had the most to lose in a war at this point. They were smaller than us, and so far as I knew, the cartel wasn\u2019t directly interfering with their operations in the Silver Valley, which meant they were only here out of loyalty to the Reapers. I knew Boonie would lay down his life to save any one of us, but there\u2019s a big difference between standing by a brother and following him into war. \u201cThe Jacks can\u2019t hold\u2014no offense meant by that, it\u2019s just numbers. And when they fall, the Reapers will fall and then it\u2019ll be too late for the Bastards. If we\u2019re going down, I want to do it with my gun in my hand while there\u2019s still a chance we can win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we agree?\u201d Shade asked, looking around the room. \u201cI know there are details to be worked out, but if I\u2019m hearing right, all three clubs are on board with an offensive?\u201d</p><p>I raised a hand, and Shade gave me a nod. I stood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 we shouldn\u2019t go after the cartel,\u201d I started. \u201cBut I think we need to be damned careful how we plan it, because even with the support clubs behind us, we just don\u2019t have their firepower. Straight-up confrontation won\u2019t work. This needs to be a smart attack, take out their head and then smack them down before a new one pops up. That should buy us some space, at least for a few years. I don\u2019t think anyone here is naive enough to think we can destroy them completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t matter if we did,\u201d said Duck, the oldest man present. He\u2019d been through Vietnam and had watched more than one MC president rise and fall. Normally only officers spoke at a meet like this, but Duck had earned the right ten times over. \u201cYou take out one, another one comes. But we can defend our territory and make a difference if we hit it right. Just remember this\u2014they\u2019ve probably got the CIA behind them. Not that I have any proof, but there\u2019s plenty of evidence the feds have fingers in the drug trade. Goes all the way back to \u2019Nam. But those spooks aren\u2019t loyal, which means if we weaken the cartel enough, they\u2019ll pull out their backing and it\u2019ll fall apart. Could buy us years of peace. Maybe more if we strike a truce with whoever comes along next.\u201d</p><p>Men grunted in agreement, and I sat back, deep in thought. Duck had been goin\u2019 on about the CIA for decades, and it used to be we tuned him out. Recent years had proved him right, though. Time and again they\u2019d been caught out doing business with the cartels, until I hardly noticed when the news reported another incident. I guess their theory was pick a partner and back them against all comers, because some influence over the drug trade was better than none?</p><p>Throw in legalization and things got even weirder.</p><p>\u201cIt settled, then?\u201d Shade asked. \u201cWe go in together, take out select leadership targets in a coordinated attack. Anyone got a problem with that plan?\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cThen we got some other business to discuss,\u201d Hunter said, startling me. Given we\u2019d been in here talkin\u2019 for the past four hours, seemed like there wasn\u2019t much potential left for uncovered ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Shade asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about London Armstrong.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and caught his gaze, jaw tensing.</p><p>\u201cChrist, not enough you\u2019re fuckin\u2019 my daughter?\u201d I asked. \u201cNow you gotta climb into my bed, too? Not club business how I handle my woman, so back the fuck off.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head slowly, eyes holding mine, not giving an inch. God damn, but I should\u2019ve killed him when I had the chance. Probably too late now, what with the baby and all ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot when it\u2019s part of this war,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s right in the middle of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a serious charge,\u201d Duck growled. I felt Gage behind me as he pushed off the wall, coming to stand next to my chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 she\u2019s a spy,\u201d Hunter started. \u201cBut I did some diggin\u2019 on her. There\u2019s things about her you don\u2019t know, deep shit. Could be she\u2019s an innocent woman in the wrong place at the wrong time. Could also be you\u2019re sleepin\u2019 with the cartel. Needs to be addressed.\u201d</p><p>Gage put a hand on my shoulder, squeezing it tight.</p> <p>\u201cSince when are you interested in who I\u2019m sleepin\u2019 with?\u201d I asked. \u201cThought we were allies. You spyin\u2019 on me?\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter loves you for reasons that occasionally confuse me, so I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to show a little respect,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI know this shit with you and London is recent, but there\u2019ve been rumors for a while now. Heard you let her walk into the Armory and pull out a girl, all with your blessing. That shit\u2019s not normal and it got me thinkin\u2019. Did a little background work on your girl. You aware that her cousin is shacked up with the cartel\u2019s number two man north of the border?\u201d</p><p>I froze.</p><p>\u201cExplain,\u201d Shade snapped.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been with him for more than a year now,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cGuess he\u2019s married to some poor bitch down in Mexico, but he won\u2019t let her come north to enjoy the good life. Not while he has his pretty girlfriend to play house with ... And guess who\u2019s living with him now, too? The daughter. That Jessica kid London\u2019s so protective of is in his house, eatin\u2019 his food and probably tellin\u2019 him all about Auntie London and how much the president of the Reapers comes runnin\u2019 when she calls. Then suddenly\u2014right after you finally close the deal\u2014her house blows up and she needs a hero to rescue her. Now she\u2019s livin\u2019 in your house with full access to whatever the hell you might have hidden there. Still sure she\u2019s innocent?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s got no clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aware that Nate Evans is on the cartel payroll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 joke,\u201d Ruger said quietly. \u201cNate Evans answers to his daddy, nobody else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d Boonie said, which shocked the hell out of me. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing things in the Valley. The Evans family gets their money from the White Baker mine, and according to the union, it\u2019s near played out. They\u2019re tryin\u2019 to keep it quiet, but you can\u2019t fool the men underground. The ore\u2019s no good. Means Natey-boy needs a new backer if he wants to run the show around here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a game changer,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cNot that I think London\u2019s in on anything, but I had no idea the Evans family was short of cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d Hunter said, his voice quietly intense. \u201cYou got an out-of-the-way mountain pass, one the feds don\u2019t watch too close. Cartel wants Montana, the Dakotas\u2014hell, anything between here and Chicago? They gotta get through the mountains somehow and there\u2019s not many places better than right here. Straight shot east, straight shot north. It makes sense strategically, and if they control local law enforcement, they\u2019ve got it made once they take us out. It all starts with you, Pic. London may be a victim who\u2019s in the wrong place at the wrong time, or she may be one of them, but either way she\u2019s dangerous as fuck. You gotta cut her loose.\u201d</p><p>I stood so fast my chair fell over backward.</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell over the room. Shade sighed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we got that information,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s on you, Pic. You and the Coeur d\u2019Alene brothers. Now you know, so you use it the best you can. Hell, might be a good thing. You feed her bad intel, see if it gets through. If it does, then we have a way to fuck up their game. Doesn\u2019t really change anything in the end, so long as you keep your shit tight. Might not be a bad idea to put some extra security on her, though. Rest of the women, too, seein\u2019 as things are gonna heat up fast. We all gotta cover our asses.\u201d</p><p>I nodded tightly.</p><p>\u201cAnyone else?\u201d Shade asked. Nobody spoke. \u201cOkay, then. Hunter, I know you\u2019re standin\u2019 in for Burke, so take time to consult with him if you need to.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBurke\u2019s on board,\u201d he said. \u201cSo\u2019s the rest of the club. We\u2019re under fire already\u2014can\u2019t hold out much longer. We want blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, adjourned,\u201d Shade announced. A quiet murmur broke out, and I felt my brothers surround me. I looked to Ruger.</p><p>\u201cDouble-check the cousin,\u201d I told him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe Hunter, but we gotta know what we\u2019re lookin\u2019 at here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in on it,\u201d Bolt said quietly. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even meet Evans until a couple months ago. I did a full background on her before she started at Pawns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed the cousin,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a distant relative livin\u2019 a thousand miles away,\u201d he said. \u201cI tracked down all of those, we\u2019d never finish a background check in under ten years. But no way I\u2019d miss a boyfriend, or even a fuck buddy. She met Evans for the first time at a fund-raiser two months ago\u2014talked to one of the bitches on her cleaning crew about it. Listened to her go on about him through the closed circuit one night. She had no idea I was even there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, rubbing the back of my neck. \u201cBut if they\u2019ve got Jess, they\u2019ve got a hostage she won\u2019t be able to ignore. Let\u2019s confirm where the girl is, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t take too long. I\u2019ll make some phone calls, see what I can come up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Evans?\u201d Gage asked. \u201cWhat about him? You think he\u2019s in bed with the cartel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. He\u2019s got no morals, no sense of loyalty to the community or the job. You might start thinkin\u2019 of ways to get him off alone, maybe think of a permanent solution to our problems with him.\u201d</p><p>Ruger\u2019s mouth tightened, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cThinkin\u2019 that\u2019s gonna be how it goes,\u201d he said. \u201cFuckload of trouble, takin\u2019 out a cop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it more at the next church.

Gage, look into extra security for the girls, too\u2014at least until we know what caused that explosion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPic, you got a minute?\u201d</p><p>I looked up to see Boonie, his face thoughtful. A young man stood next to him\u2014prospect. Had a real hard edge to his face, although I wouldn\u2019t peg his age much higher than nineteen or twenty. Old eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWanted to introduce you to Puck,\u201d he said, nodding toward the kid. \u201cBeen prospectin\u2019 with one of our chapters out in Montana. Things got a little hot for him out there, so he\u2019s moved into the Valley for now. Thought he might be helpful to you.\u201d</p><p>I sized him up. Kid was tall with short, dark hair. Built like a fuckin\u2019 Marine, but his tats were all biker. Both arms covered in full sleeves, and a scar running across his face that made him look like an ax murderer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your story?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cGrew up in the club,\u201d he said, holding my gaze steadily. \u201cDad was a patchholder. Dunno if you ever met him? Went by Kroger.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head slowly, because damned straight I knew Kroger. He\u2019d been killed on a run down to Cali, three years back. At the time we assumed it was cartel, but no real evidence.</p> <p>\u201cFeelin\u2019 motivated, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find something for you,\u201d I told him. \u201cMight come out of it with a patch, you do good enough.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flickered with something I couldn\u2019t quite read, and he nodded. Boonie and I exchanged back slaps, and I started downstairs. Lotta guys would be heading home this afternoon, but others would be spending another night. Needed to check on food, make sure everything was ready.</p><p>Hunter caught my arm on the stairs. I paused and stared down at his hand, because he had no fuckin\u2019 business touching me.</p><p>\u201cThink me and Em are gonna head out this afternoon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, not enough to move her four hundred miles away from me, now I don\u2019t even get to see her for the weekend?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot like that\u2014she\u2019s got cramps, feelin\u2019 sick. It\u2019s been smooth sailing so far, but I want her home and in bed.\u201d</p><p>I felt something tighten in my chest.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take her in to the ER,\u201d I said. \u201cBetter not to fuck around with this shit.\u201d</p><p>Hunter snorted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not gonna happen. I already suggested it and she laughed at me. She says she\u2019s fine, she went off to get a pedicure with the rest of the girls, but I think she needs to rest, maybe go see her midwife on Monday. We stay here, she\u2019ll wear herself out tryin\u2019 to do everything with everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d I said, although I hated him for it. \u201cBetter be safe. Keep me posted, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He started down the stairs, the Devil\u2019s Jacks colors on his back taunting me. Asshole.</p><p>Asshole who takes care of our little girl, Heather reminded me.</p><p>I had to give her that one.</p><p>Still didn\u2019t like him.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>LONDON</p><p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d Em said, narrowing her eyes at me. \u201cI was right about the color.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my feet and wiggled my toes, which were now painted hot pink. I wasn\u2019t a hot-pink kind of person, and the toe bling was almost beyond my comprehension ... but I had to give her credit.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt looks fantastic. I always go for the traditional look. Never would\u2019ve tried it if you hadn\u2019t bullied me into it.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and I laughed, taking a drink of my iced coffee. Me, Darcy, Em, Dancer, Marie, and Sophie had all taken off for the mall after breakfast in search of the perfect pedicure. Surprisingly, Maggs Dwyer had met us there\u2014apparently she\u2019d been Bolt\u2019s old lady for years but had dumped his ass recently. I got the distinct impression he\u2019d done something horrible to her. The women were all clearly pissed at him, but they didn\u2019t offer any details and I didn\u2019t ask. Ignorance is bliss and all that, because I still had to work for the guy at Pawns.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t totally comfortable with my brightly painted nails, but if nothing else they were fun and playful. My toes looked like they\u2019d been dipped in a vat of flamingos. Make that flamingos on fire, with bright red accents and brilliant sparklies.</p><p>Shiny.</p><p>\u201cLadies, this has been fantastic, but I\u2019d better get going because I have to work this afternoon,\u201d I said reluctantly, standing up from the table we\u2019d taken over in the food court. \u201cI just hope I don\u2019t gack my nails while I\u2019m at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPisser,\u201d Em said, pouting prettily. \u201cI was hoping we could go shopping until the men finish their Top Secret Important Biker Business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe tomorrow?\u201d I asked, flattered that she\u2019d invite me along. Em sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll have to be another time,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019re headed home this afternoon. I\u2019ve been cramping a little\u2014no big deal\u2014but Hunter\u2019s all worked up about it. He\u2019s terrified I\u2019m going to break or something.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and we all laughed. Then I waved good-bye and headed out to my van.</p><p>The first hint something was wrong was the open driver\u2019s-side window. I never left my van open. (Not that I had anything valuable in it, but I carried enough equipment and cleaning chemicals in the back that I worried some little kid might get in there and get hurt. My insurance agent had spent forty-five minutes three years ago explaining the concept of business liability to me, and I\u2019d been irrationally nervous ever since. The man was a sadist. He should\u2019ve worked as a high school guidance counselor, because not one of those kids would\u2019ve been brave enough to have sex after a sit-down with him.)</p><p>The second red flag was a business-size manila envelope sitting on the seat. A white mailing label had been stuck to the front, but instead of an address, one word had been printed in large, black letters.</p><p>\u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>In a movie, this is where the bomb squad gets called out. But it didn\u2019t look big enough for a bomb, and I lived in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho. We\u2019d already used up our entire town\u2019s annual drama quotient on my house. I reached down, my fingers trembling, and picked it up. A black smart phone slid out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It came to life\u2014a Skype request for videoconferencing.</p><p>I fumbled for a minute, then managed to press the accept button. Jessica\u2019s face appeared on the phone, her eyes swollen with tears. A purple bruise darkened her cheek. Oh shit oh shit oh shit ...</p><p>\u201cLoni?\u201d she asked, her voice tight and strained. I leaned heavily against the van, my legs turning to Jell-O.</p><p>\u201cJessie, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in some trouble,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMom\u2019s friends are here with me and they want to talk to you. Please listen to them. I think they\u2019re going to hurt me more if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With that, someone grabbed the phone out of her hand and jerked it away. The image swayed, giving me glimpses of concrete and men wearing dark masks. Then it stilled, focusing on Jessica\u2019s arm. A man\u2019s gloved hand held it down, spreading out her fingers across what had to be a butcher block. Then a giant knife came into view\u2014no, that thing was more like a machete. It flashed down and then Jessica\u2019s screams came pouring through the phone\u2019s tiny speakers.</p><p>A terrible fist clutched my chest, cutting off my breath and stopping my heart.</p><p>They\u2019d sliced off her little finger.</p><p>I could see it sitting right there on the block, and it wasn\u2019t attached to her body anymore!</p> <p>Blood was gushing and Jess was screaming and somewhere in the background a man laughed, but my eyes would only focus on that little pink hunk of flesh, complete with sparkling gel nails that had recently been filled. I had a sudden, discordant vision of Jess and Amber getting manicures together. Laughing. Maybe grabbing something to eat before they came home and Amber handed over her beautiful daughter to a fucking psychopathic madman! I had no fucking doubt this was Amber\u2019s work.</p><p>What kind of animal cuts off a child\u2019s finger?</p><p>The picture abruptly disappeared, switching to audio. I put the phone to my ear, wondering if I\u2019d imagined the whole thing. My body felt distant and shaky. Shock? I needed to breathe. I managed to climb into the van\u2019s seat and drop my head down over my knees as a man started speaking.</p><p>\u201cNext time it\u2019ll be her hand,\u201d he said, the heavily accented words laced with menace. \u201cThen maybe I\u2019ll cut that tube right out of her head, see what it looks like. Always wondered how they wire up retards to make them look normal. She\u2019s cute, so I\u2019ll probably fuck her before I kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I whispered. \u201cPlease, she\u2019s just a girl\u2014let her go. We won\u2019t tell anyone about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to keep her alive, you\u2019ll do exactly what I say, because I own you now,\u201d he said, his voice dark and low and radiating so much evil I could cry. Wait. I was crying. \u201cI want you to go through Picnic Hayes\u2019s house and find papers for me. Anything you can that looks like it might be business related. Lists of names. Schedules. Take pictures with this phone and I\u2019ll access them. You\u2019ll do the same at Pawns and The Line. You\u2019ve got until Tuesday to get it done, but I want to see progress along the way. If I don\u2019t get something from you every day, her hand\u2019s back on the block. We can cut off a lot of pieces before she dies\u2014it\u2019s all on you.\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed, wishing I could afford to play dumb, do something to buy time, change it somehow because this couldn\u2019t actually be happening, could it?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s more susceptible to infection than other kids,\u201d I said desperately. \u201cThat shunt keeps her alive, and if it gets blocked or infected, it\u2019s very serious. It could even kill her. Please\u2014if she spikes a fever, get her to a doctor. She might need surgery if things go wrong. I saw a bruise on her cheek, which means someone hit her. Jessica can\u2019t take trauma like that. She\u2019s not a normal kid, it could kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should worry about me killing her. But if you do a good job following my directions we won\u2019t have to hurt her any more. Start going through the house. Text me if you find something and I\u2019ll download it. Be careful, because if he catches you, he\u2019ll shoot you and then Jessica will die, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Amber?\u201d I asked quietly, wondering if I really wanted the answer. \u201cDoes she know what you\u2019re doing to her daughter?\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cThat cunt\u2019s dead. Unfortunate accident, couldn\u2019t be helped. Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t have any more of those, sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I whispered, closing my eyes as he ended the call.</p><p>Wow. Just ... wow ... How was this happening?</p> <p>Amber. It always came back to Amber. I wanted to strangle her, but then a wave of guilt hit me because she was already dead. God, I\u2019d hated her so much over the years, but I loved her, too, and the thought of her bloodied body being dumped somewhere filled me with agonized sorrow.</p><p>Detach. DETACH. You can do this. You have to do this. Doesn\u2019t matter how much you like Reese, he\u2019s just a man and your girl needs you. Life is about choices.</p><p>I knew what my choice had to be\u2014the same one I\u2019d made six years ago.</p><p>Jessica was a child of my family.</p><p>Saving her had to come first.</p><p>Things got weird after that.</p><p>There\u2019s an understatement for you.</p><p>I considered calling Nate. I considered telling Reese. I considered driving to California with a gun and shooting people until they gave me back my little girl.</p><p>In the end, I decided to do what he told me, because Jessica\u2019s life was at stake. End of story. There wasn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t do to save her. I\u2019d beg, borrow, steal, kill ... I\u2019d give every one of those men the best blow job they\u2019d ever had, if I thought it would make a difference.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t want me\u2014they wanted Reese\u2019s papers, and I\u2019d find them if it killed me.</p><p>I\u2019d do it because I was Jessica\u2019s mother. The only real one she\u2019d ever had. Fuck you, Amber. Fuck you all the way to hell. I\u2019d become Jessie\u2019s mother the hard way, cradling her tiny body in my arms in the NICU, holding her as she cried after her first boyfriend dumped her.</p><p>Dragging her out of the Reapers clubhouse in the middle of the night.</p><p>Jessica was a pain in my ass and she\u2019d screwed up plenty, but this? This was all on Amber. Beyond that first burst of involuntary pain, I refused to let myself grieve for her. That bitch was lucky she was already dead, and that\u2019s the fucking truth.</p><p>Because life is surreal, I still had to work that afternoon or people would\u2019ve gotten suspicious. This turned out to be a good thing. There\u2019s nothing like hard, physical labor to clear your mind. One of my crew leads had the day off, so I found myself cleaning a local attorney\u2019s office downtown. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t the assassin who worked for the club. I\u2019d bet there were all sorts of interesting papers in that guy\u2019s office, ones that might buy Jessica some time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We also cleaned Pawns that night.</p><p>Usually Bolt was in the back room\u2014so far as I could tell he slept on a cot in the storeroom half the time. I\u2019d assumed he was just crashing there out of convenience, but based on our conversation at the mall, Maggs had thrown him out.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t actually at the store that night, but I decided it would be stupid to break into his office and search for papers. The whole place was probably wired up with cameras\u2014it was a pawn shop, for God\u2019s sake, which meant it was full of valuable, portable merchandise. The real question wasn\u2019t whether the cameras were there, but whether they would still work if the power was cut.</p><p>Something to think about, because if I fucked up, they\u2019d chop off another piece of Jessica.</p> <p>Reese had asked me to come back out to the Armory that evening after I finished my jobs, but conveniently I didn\u2019t get done until after ten. That meant I wasn\u2019t lying when I told him I was too exhausted. I drove out to his house instead, fingering the black smart phone thoughtfully. If I got lucky, I\u2019d have most of the night to search. I couldn\u2019t imagine he\u2019d be home any time soon\u2014maybe he\u2019d even crash at the Armory. God, I hoped so. I wasn\u2019t sure I could look him in the face without giving anything away.</p><p>We\u2019d slept on the couch last night, the same couch where\u2014</p><p>Shit. If he slept at the Armory, who would he be sleeping with? Could I really trust him not to cheat on me with so many willing, available women running around all the time? A wave of jealousy hit me, but I squashed it because that was fucking crazy. I was doing my best to betray him and the people he loved most to an evil stranger who liked to cut fingers off young women.</p><p>So far as I could tell, that sort of trumped the jealous-girlfriend bit.</p><p>God, I would miss him ...</p> <p>If we both lived through this, I\u2019d be lucky if he didn\u2019t kill me himself. Not an idle concern, either. I\u2019d heard the rumors\u2014I knew what the Reapers were capable of. But I\u2019d also heard that they didn\u2019t take out anyone who didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>Unfortunately, from their perspective I\u2019d probably deserve it. They wouldn\u2019t be entirely wrong about that, either.</p><p>Shitty to be me.</p><p>The Hayes house blazed with light when I pulled in the driveway, and two bikes were parked out front. One looked familiar. The other I\u2019d never seen before. Neither belonged to Reese.</p><p>I let myself in the front door to find Melanie sitting next to Painter, his arm draped loosely across the back of the couch over her shoulders. She was buried in a quilt with only her eyes showing. They were glued to the TV screen, where a chainsaw-wielding man was about to cut a woman\u2019s hand off.</p><p>I threw up a little in the back of my throat, grasping the door frame for support.</p> <p>Another young man leaned back in the lounge chair, feet propped casually on the end of the coffee table. He had short dark hair, heavy stubble, and eyes so cold and dead he could\u2019ve been holding the chainsaw. It was hard to see in the dim light, but it looked like tattoos completely covered his arms. Handsome and unnerving\u2014a very dangerous boy, I decided.</p><p>Painter paused the movie, standing up slowly. I glanced between him and Melanie, shaking my head. Couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d fallen for his shit\u2014apparently this was International Fuck Over London Armstrong Day.</p><p>\u201cLondon,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cPainter,\u201d I replied, wondering if we were starting some kind of standoff. I guess we were, because he\u2019d promised to stay away from her, yet here he was. Although to be honest, my perspective on that whole issue had changed in the past twelve hours, what with watching Jessica\u2019s finger get cut off. Somehow Melanie\u2019s virtue wasn\u2019t seeming quite as important in comparison.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk in the kitchen,\u201d he told me, then jerked his chin toward the scary young man. \u201cThis is Puck. He\u2019s a prospect with the Silver Bastards. Pic asked him to stay out here tonight. Said it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have some extra security, given how many people are in town right now.\u201d</p><p>Panic closed my throat. Extra security? That didn\u2019t make any sense\u2014they must know something. Painter was going to take me into that kitchen and kill me for betraying the club.</p><p>Shut up! My brain snapped. Chill the fuck out, because there\u2019s no way they could find out so fast.</p><p>Good point. I took a deep breath and tried smiling at the young prospect. He just studied me, crossing muscular arms in front of his chest. He really was extremely attractive. Black hair, dark eyes, dusky, thick eyelashes\u2014near perfect, except for the scar running up one cheek, along his nose and into his forehead.</p> <p>Damn. Looked like someone had tried to cut his face off.</p><p>Not that it hurt his looks at all. If anything, it kept him from being too pretty. Dark skin said he came from a mixed background. Maybe one of the local tribes? Or Latino ... Hard to tell, and not really any of my business anyway.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I said, then looked back at Painter. \u201cI assume you got him settled upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s covered,\u201d Painter replied. \u201cLet\u2019s talk in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, pausing to give Mel a quick squeeze on the shoulder. She seemed to be operating on the theory that no murderers or monsters would be able to get her so long as she stayed under the covers. Clearly she wasn\u2019t willing to risk that safety for a hug, which made me smile sadly.</p><p>I was learning the hard way that nothing can protect us from the real monsters.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I asked Painter once we reached the other room. He caught and held my gaze, his expression focused.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you about Melanie,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything to hurt her. She was just scared of the movie. Puck and I had no idea she\u2019d be so frightened, and she didn\u2019t say anything ahead of time. Otherwise we would\u2019ve watched something else. Pic didn\u2019t want her out here alone, and I knew you\u2019d be pissed if I took her back to the Armory.\u201d</p><p>I would\u2019ve felt extremely relieved to hear that if I hadn\u2019t been so completely focused on keeping Jessica alive.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve fucked up before,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m a dick and an ass-hole. But I promise you\u2014I\u2019m not gonna screw her over. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, as if something important had been decided. I wasn\u2019t even close to understanding what was going on behind those eyes of his, and it didn\u2019t matter. All that mattered was saving Jessica.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna watch the rest of the movie with us?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have my own horror movie playing on a loop in my head. But thanks for asking.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll get to bed,\u201d I told him, smiling weakly. \u201cNice to meet your ... friend? Brother? I don\u2019t know what to call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him Puck,\u201d he said, giving me a charming grin. \u201cYou might want to get used to him, too. I think Pic plans to have him stick with you for the next week or so. Security.\u201d</p><p>Well. That was inconvenient. I decided I\u2019d think about it tomorrow, because I\u2019d burned through the last of my energy when I\u2019d come home to find the living room full of young bikers I was pretty sure were capable of killing me without blinking.</p> <p>Painter\u2014apparently oblivious to my terrible tension\u2014ambled toward the fridge and pulled out a beer.</p><p>\u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to bed. Ready for this day to end in a big way.\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p> <p>I lay sprawled in the center of Reese\u2019s bed, staring up at his bedroom ceiling and trying not to cry. It was four in the morning. He\u2019d texted me at two saying not to wait up for him, so I\u2019d made the most of the opportunity, going through every drawer, every box, every inch of his bedroom looking for anything that might be valuable to the sadists down in California.</p><p>Not a goddamned thing.</p><p>Although I knew a lot more about Reese now. For example, I knew Heather had written him a beautiful letter saying good-bye right before she died. She told him to be happy. She said that when her girls got married, she wanted him to give each of them a diamond pendant, set in silver, from her. She called them \u201csomething new\u201d for the big day.</p><p>She also told him she didn\u2019t want him to grow old alone.</p><p>According to Em, I was the first woman he\u2019d really let in since Heather died. \u201cGuilty\u201d just wasn\u2019t strong enough to describe how that made me feel, given my current plan to betray him. At least I didn\u2019t need to worry about him knowing I\u2019d searched the room. I\u2019d been incredibly careful, taking pictures of his things before moving them, so I could put them back exactly where they\u2019d been before. Realistically, there wasn\u2019t any more that I could do, but I couldn\u2019t sleep, either.</p><p>I rolled over and turned off the light, wishing I were better at praying. Now would be a real good time for it ...</p> <p>Big hands slid under my shirt.</p><p>I sighed and shifted, confused. Reese caught my breasts and squeezed lightly. Then I felt his lips touch my stomach and I squirmed, heat pooling between my legs.</p><p>\u201cMissed you last night,\u201d he said, his voice low. I opened my eyes, but the room was still dark. Must be very early morning, right before dawn.</p><p>Then I remembered. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Jess was in danger, Amber was dead, and I had to screw over the first man who\u2019d made me feel anything real in years. Maybe ever.</p><p>\u201cSleepy,\u201d I murmured, which was true. It was also a great way to get out of conversation, because I hadn\u2019t had a chance to figure out the proper etiquette one uses when destroying a man\u2019s life. His fingers burrowed under the fly of my jeans, and then I felt him opening them. Wow. I hadn\u2019t even gotten undressed last night.</p><p>I didn\u2019t remember falling asleep at all.</p><p>My jeans opened and then he tugged at them, murmuring for me to lift my hips. I obeyed without thinking. He slid them down, along with my panties, and tossed my clothing across the room.</p><p>Then I felt his lips on my stomach again.</p> <p>Instead of teasing me, this time they moved steadily downward, and then his hand caught at my inner thighs, pushing them apart. His tongue felt like fire on my skin and I shifted restlessly. A finger slid along the edges of my labia, pushing in just enough to collect some of the moisture growing there. He rubbed upward, finding my clit as it started to swell, circling it and teasing. I wiggled under him.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention I missed you?\u201d he whispered. \u201cProbably a hundred bitches out there tonight, half of them ready and willing, but all I could think about was getting home to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to call them bitches?\u201d I asked, trying to focus. \u201cSeems kind of ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a figure of speech, doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said. Then I felt him shake his head, and he laughed. \u201cNo, guess you got me on that. We call \u2019em bitches because they aren\u2019t that important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharon seemed important enough to you,\u201d I muttered, wondering if I was losing my mind. Why would a woman interrupt a man about to go down on her\u2014or at least I assumed that\u2019s what this was leading up to\u2014to argue about what he calls someone else?</p><p>\u201cYou wanna talk semantics or get your clit sucked?\u201d</p><p>Hmmm ...</p><p>\u201cThat second thing,\u201d I said. His mouth opened on my stomach and he made a huge raspberry noise. I squealed because it tickled, and then he was tickling me with his hand, blowing raspberries on my stomach over and over until I screamed.</p><p>\u201cStop! You have to stop it!\u201d</p><p>He stopped, sliding up to cover me with his body, holding my hands prisoner on either side of my head.</p><p>\u201cNow give me a kiss and let me know you\u2019re happy to see me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wanna talk about other women, we can do that tomorrow. Right now\u2019s about you and me.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head and met his lips. Despite the tickling and playing, this wasn\u2019t a teasing kiss. It was hard and fast, nipping and dueling until I felt faint from desire.</p><p>Or maybe that was lack of air?</p><p>He pulled away, and we both gasped.</p><p>\u201cNow. What would you like me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, you could ...\u201d I trailed off, squirming. I still wasn\u2019t so great at the explicit talk in front of him. Why I felt so inhibited I couldn\u2019t imagine. I\u2019d always assumed that I\u2019d have things figured out by my thirties. Not even close.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d he asked. I couldn\u2019t see his smirk in the darkness, but I knew it had to be there.</p><p>\u201cYou could go down on me,\u201d I said, the sentence ending on a squeak. \u201cI think I need more practice talking about sex. It feels really weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sort of picked up on that,\u201d he whispered into my ear, nuzzling at it. \u201cKinda hot when you get all embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed,\u201d I insisted. \u201cI just don\u2019t have a potty mouth.\u201d</p><p>He stilled.</p><p>\u201cDid you seriously just use the phrase \u2018potty mouth\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I giggled. \u201cI think I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try this again. Tell me what you want me to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill you suck my clit, Reese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes, London. I\u2019d be happy to suck your clit for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracious of you,\u201d I muttered, but at least he was moving back down my body. His fingers found my folds again, and then his mouth caught me, hot and wet and completely amazing as he attacked my most sensitive place.</p><p>Within minutes I was moaning and squirming under him. When he started thrusting two fingers inside me, sliding up and along my inner wall, I lost the power of speech. Fortunately that didn\u2019t matter, because I didn\u2019t need words to scream when I blew apart into a thousand pieces.</p><p>I also didn\u2019t need words to express my approval when he pushed into me hard and fast a minute later. Instead I wrapped my arms and legs around him, savoring the feel of him deep down inside because it was beautiful.</p><p>He was beautiful.</p><p>And he was wrong about using dirty words, too, because this wasn\u2019t something dirty and it wasn\u2019t fucking.</p><p>We were making love.</p><p>Under the circumstances, I\u2019d rather fuck. The only thing worse than destroying the man you care about is destroying him after he makes heartbreakingly beautiful love to you.</p><p>I was still going to do it, though.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough,\u201d the man whispered in my ear. \u201cI told you to find me something or I\u2019d cut off another piece of her. Did you think I was joking?\u201d</p><p>No. I really, really didn\u2019t think he was joking.</p><p>I don\u2019t know which grip was tighter\u2014my hand holding the phone or the one holding the steering wheel. Thankfully I\u2019d been driving when he called, which was the only time I\u2019d gotten any privacy since Saturday. Now it was Monday and Reese\u2019s minion, Puck, was following me everywhere in the name of \u201cextra security.\u201d Fortunately, when I\u2019d very politely told Reese that the minivan was off-limits, Puck quickly volunteered to ride his bike instead.</p><p>I could\u2019ve cried with relief.</p><p>Puck scared the hell out of me. I knew he was young\u2014probably only nineteen or twenty\u2014but he had the eyes of a killer and that scar across his face wasn\u2019t exactly reassuring. For once I was happy to have Painter around, because Puck was also weirdly sexy and I suspected Melanie would\u2019ve fallen for him in a heartbeat if she weren\u2019t already sighing heavily every time she saw Painter.</p><p>God, when had he become the lesser evil?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else for me to find,\u201d I said to the man on the phone, willing him to believe me. \u201cI\u2019ve looked everywhere I can. There\u2019s always a prospect with me, or Reese. Even at work they follow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cHave you given yourself away? If that\u2019s the case, you aren\u2019t useful to me anymore and neither is this little teenage shit. Might as well kill her now.\u201d</p><p>Oh God oh God oh God oh ...</p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll figure something out. There has to be a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more day,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it\u2019s over. Want to talk to her one more time? This\u2019ll be the last if you don\u2019t get me something I can use.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop whining. Nobody likes a whiny cunt.\u201d</p><p>I heard a rustling sound, as if he\u2019d put his hands over the mic. Then Jessica came on the line, her voice soft and weak.</p><p>\u201cLoni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts, Loni,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hurts all the time. My hand hurts so bad and I have dreams and I want to come home ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you home,\u201d I promised, although I had absolutely no idea how I\u2019d pull that one off. Maybe I should just shoot Bolt and raid his office. So what if they killed me? All I needed to do was get Jessica free\u2014after that? Whatever.</p><p>\u201cI need you to come get me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so scared, Loni. They hurt me. Last night they ...\u201d</p><p>She paused, and my mind raced, filling in the blanks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d the man said, his voice muffled in the background. The call stopped and I nearly drove into the ditch because I couldn\u2019t stop the tears filling my eyes. Couldn\u2019t see for shit.</p><p>I took a long detour heading home, wondering how I\u2019d explain that to Puck, and then deciding I didn\u2019t care what he thought. I\u2019d just tell him I got distracted and didn\u2019t notice I\u2019d gone down the wrong road, or something like that.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask, though.</p><p>When we pulled up to Reese\u2019s place, he just parked his bike and got off, following me into the house. Reese sat at the dining room table, flipping through a motorcycle magazine and drinking a beer.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart,\u201d he said, looking up at me. \u201cCome here, sit on my lap for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me for anything else tonight?\u201d Puck asked, his voice bored but his gaze focused, taking in everything. That\u2019s what unnerved me about him the most\u2014the fact that if I made even the slightest mistake, he\u2019d catch it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free for the night,\u201d Reese said as I came to a stop next to him. He caught me by the waist, lifting me easily to straddle him across the chair. His hands lifted and framed my face, those brilliant blue eyes of his seeming to stare right into my soul.</p><p>What did he see there?</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to me,\u201d Reese said, and my heart stuttered. He knew. He had to know. Why else would he say that? \u201cWhatever it is, if some-thing\u2019s wrong talk to me, babe. It\u2019s the only way I can help you.\u201d</p><p>I felt like my face was cracking, but I managed to smile at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings this on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the girls down at The Line,\u201d he said. \u201cShe got herself in some trouble a couple days ago, and instead of talking to us, she decided to sell us out.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to force my pulse to slow down. Could he feel it racing under his fingers?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll happen to her?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, and he didn\u2019t answer. I felt his hand slide around and into my hair, fingers combing through it lightly, and then he caught it up, twisting it around his wrist until it just almost hurt. He tugged my head back, exposing my throat. Then he wrapped his other hand around my neck lightly, caressing me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he whispered. His hand tightened in my hair painfully and he tilted my head, taking my mouth in a hard kiss. It shouldn\u2019t have turned me on. I was scared of him, scared of the men in San Diego.</p><p>Scared of everything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But his dick was hardening between my legs and I wanted him so bad it hurt. When he let my mouth go and cupped my butt in his hands\u2014lifting me and carrying me back into the bedroom\u2014it never occurred to me to protest.</p><p>I wanted him way too much.</p><p>All of him.</p><p>His smell, his strength, the way he\u2019d thrown himself over me when my house blew up. The love in his eyes when he saw his daughter, and the fact that I\u2019d found two stunning diamond pendants in blue Tiffany boxes next to the letter his wife had written him, right in the top drawer of his dresser.</p> <p>None of that would ever be mine ... But for tonight, I\u2019d take what I could get and pretend my world hadn\u2019t ended.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find for me today?\u201d</p><p>That voice. It haunted my dreams. I think it would\u2019ve been easier if he yelled at me, or even if I sensed that he enjoyed hurting Jessica. But we could\u2019ve been talking about the weather or what I\u2019d eaten for lunch. The guy was like an exterminator, and I could tell he\u2019d shoot Jessica and then go home and put up his feet, maybe watch a TV show.</p><p>We weren\u2019t even human to him.</p><p>I drove on slowly, Puck following me on his bike, wondering if I should just turn out along the highway and head for the high bridge. Then I\u2019d drive off the side. End of story. Suddenly I heard the bloop of a police siren, then caught the flash of blue lights in my rearview mirror. At first I couldn\u2019t tell if they were after me or Puck.</p> <p>Then he pulled over and the cop stopped behind him. Thank God for that\u2014no way I could deal with the police and this phone call at the same time. Puck might\u2019ve just saved Jessica\u2019s life by distracting the cop for me, I realized. Was her existence really hanging by a thread that thin? Yes, it probably was. Sweat broke out on my forehead.</p><p>\u201cLondon? I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>Catching the phone between my head and shoulders, I reached up to swipe at the moisture with the back of my hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything,\u201d I admitted. \u201cReese didn\u2019t want me cleaning today, so I didn\u2019t even make it inside. He said they were shutting things down. Security situation. Same excuse he gave for having someone follow me around. I think he knows what\u2019s going on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s following you?\u201d the man asked, his voice casually curious.</p><p>\u201cA prospect named Puck,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s with the Silver Bastards. He\u2019s not following me right now, though. The cops just pulled him over and I\u2019m still driving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInteresting. Why not a Reapers prospect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? Maybe they\u2019re watching the other girlfriends and old ladies. Things are really tense right now. I talked to Marie this morning and she said that even Maggs had someone with her, and she\u2019s not part of the club anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why would you think they know about you?\u201d he asked. \u201cAll the women are under guard. Things are tense, and you don\u2019t even know why. Unless Hayes has been talking to you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, then realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to see it.</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t talk about anything important. Not about the club or business or anything. He said a girl at The Line sold them out, but I don\u2019t know the details.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to be silent.</p><p>\u201cHe give the girl\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re on your own right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ve got a new job for you. Do you have a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would I have a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon you\u2019re going to get one,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cAnd tonight you\u2019re going to kill Reese Hayes. If you do that for me, I\u2019ll let Jessica go.\u201d</p><p>The van swerved. I slammed on the brakes and skidded to the side of the road, wondering if he\u2019d actually said what I thought he said.</p><p>No.</p><p>Not possible.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t kill him. I can\u2019t kill anyone,\u201d I babbled. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where I could get a gun\u2014I don\u2019t know how to use one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have all afternoon,\u201d the man told me, his voice calm and patient. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you an address. You\u2019ll go to your bank and pull out six hundred dollars. Then set your GPS for that address and follow it out there. Someone will meet you, and you\u2019ll buy the gun he offers. You won\u2019t discuss me with him and he won\u2019t say anything to you. If you try to say something, he\u2019ll leave without giving you the gun and Jessica will die. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>My tongue wouldn\u2019t work. I couldn\u2019t kill Reese\u2014I didn\u2019t kill people. Real people didn\u2019t have things like this happen to them.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u201cLondon, are you paying attention?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re taking this seriously enough. Maybe you need some encouragement.\u201d</p><p>The phone pinged, and suddenly a video request came through. I stared at it for a second, then closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and hit accept.</p><p>Screams filled the air.</p><p>Jessica faced me on the screen. A large, muscular hand held her by the hair, which gave me a nasty sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu because Reese had held my hair almost exactly the same way last night. Jess wasn\u2019t sitting in anyone\u2019s lap, though.</p><p>A second hand flashed through the air, hitting her so hard that she ripped free of her captor and slammed to the ground with a sickening thunk, her head literally bouncing from the impact against the concrete floor. Someone started laughing. The man who\u2019d been holding her opened his fingers, chunks of her hair drifting down across her body. I clutched my side, my vision going dark, and for long seconds I wondered if I\u2019d lose consciousness.</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d I finally managed to whisper. She didn\u2019t respond. A man kicked her in the stomach, and then I heard some muffled Spanish in the background. Her body jerked, quivering for about ten seconds before falling still again.</p><p>Seizure. She used to get them as a child, but I hadn\u2019t seen one in years.</p><p>\u201cYou need to take her to a hospital. That kind of head trauma can damage the shunt. She\u2019ll die. You can\u2019t let her die!\u201d</p><p>The video died, transitioning back to audio only. I raised the phone slowly to my ear, hand shaking so bad I almost dropped it.</p><p>\u201cAfter you kill Hayes, we\u2019ll dump her in front of a hospital,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019ll need proof. Homicide report will do nicely. Call nine one one yourself if you want things to move faster, I have people monitoring the police scanners up there. They\u2019ll tell me when it happens.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swallowed. I couldn\u2019t imagine killing anyone, let alone Reese.</p><p>But Jessica was dying\u2014hitting the floor that hard would be bad for anyone. But with the shunt her risk was so much higher. One slip, one tear, one tiny blockage ... The fluid would start building in her skull and it wouldn\u2019t stop until it squeezed the life out of her brain completely.</p><p>It might be happening already\u2014I\u2019d seen the seizure.</p><p>I\u2019d do it. I\u2019d shoot Reese, then I\u2019d call the police. Maybe I\u2019d wait for them to get there, or maybe I\u2019d try to get away first. Jessica would need someone to take care of her if they did another surgery ...</p> <p>Pulling up the edge of my shirt, I wiped my face hard to get rid of the tears rolling down my cheeks. Then I grabbed the mirror, tipping it down so I could see how I looked. Red eyes. Nothing I could do about that, and it wasn\u2019t like crying was illegal. I put the van into reverse, then did a three-point turn across the road. I had close to four thousand dollars in the bank. I\u2019d need all of it in cash, if by some miracle I survived the evening, because one thing was for sure.</p><p>If the Reapers caught me, I was a dead woman.</p><p>When I passed by Puck and the cops, they had him lying face-down on the side of the road, hands behind his back. A second cruiser was just pulling up. Perfect\u2014hopefully it would give me enough time to do what I had to do.</p><p>Two hours later I owned a gun.</p><p>The man who\u2019d sold it to me wasn\u2019t a gun dealer\u2014he was just a guy in a car with a gun. I met him alone in a field halfway to Bay-view, which I found using the GPS on the smart phone they\u2019d so helpfully provided me. I paid him the money and he\u2019d handed me the weapon, a box of ammunition, and what appeared to be an extra bullet holder. I stared down at them blankly, wondering how the hell I\u2019d even load a gun, let alone shoot it.</p> <p>My confusion had to be obvious, because he reached for the weapon again and when I handed it over, he demonstrated how to pop another bullet holder out of the gun\u2019s handle like magic. He also showed me how the bullets could be taken out, then had me put them back in again.</p><p>The he showed me how to shoot it.</p><p>It was surprisingly easy. All I had to do was unhook the little safety switch, pull the trigger, and BOOM. The shell casing popped out and then it was ready to go again. My hand hurt a little after the third shot, but the gun didn\u2019t really have much of a kick or anything. After that, the man got in his car and left without saying goodbye ... or anything else. I\u2019d bought a gun and learned how to use it all without either of us talking. Surreal. Fucked up. I could almost pretend it\u2019d been a dream if it wasn\u2019t for the extra weight in my purse.</p><p>So. Now I had a gun. I just had to stop off and get some groceries before killing Reese. Oh, and maybe some gas.</p><p>You can do this, I told myself. Just take it one step at a time.</p><p>I made it halfway back to town before reality hit me. Had I lost my fucking mind?</p> <p>Killing Reese wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>Letting Jessica die wasn\u2019t an option, either. There had to be a solution. That\u2019s when it hit me\u2014Nate. I\u2019d call Nate. If the kidnappers wanted a police report, Nate could make that happen. I supposed I\u2019d probably end up in jail, but that was the least of my concerns at this point. Jail was nothing to me. Hell, it\u2019d be a vacation compared to this.</p><p>I grabbed my phone and found his number.</p><p>\u201cGet tired of fucking the biker?\u201d</p><p>Did he have to be nasty about everything? How had I ever been attracted to this asshole?</p><p>\u201cNate, I really need to talk to you,\u201d I was working hard to keep my voice even. \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Silence, and then when I\u2019d almost started to wonder if he\u2019d hung up on me, he spoke again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to talk to you in person. It\u2019s ... complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just coming up on Hayden,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too far away. Meet me at the cafe across from the flooring place, down on Government Way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. God knows if I\u2019ll help you. Right now I\u2019m tempted to tell you to fuck off.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed my pride.</p><p>\u201cThanks for hearing me out. You\u2019re the only person I know who has the power to change the situation I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>God, I hated sucking up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll listen,\u201d he said after a pause. \u201cNo promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust having you hear me out means the world to me.\u201d</p><p>I ended the call, leaned out my window, and threw up. Remember, you need him, my brain reminded me. Play nice.</p><p>The restaurant wasn\u2019t too busy, thank God. Nate was already waiting for me, sitting in a booth in the back corner. I smiled at him weakly as I walked over. My purse felt too heavy, the strange, hateful weight of the gun throwing my whole world off balance.</p><p>So wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d he said as I slid into the seat. \u201cYour eyes are all red and puffy, like you\u2019ve been crying. Lover boy not as wonderful as you thought?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head\u2014now wasn\u2019t the time to fight or defend myself. If Nate found a way to help me, he could say whatever the hell he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI have a big problem,\u201d I replied slowly, wondering just how exactly I was supposed to explain all this to him.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d a waitress asked, smiling down at Nate. He flashed her a flirty grin, reminding me so much of the night I\u2019d met him that it might\u2019ve hurt, if I still had the capacity to experience more pain. Lucky me\u2014I\u2019d already topped up on suffering for the day.</p><p>\u201cDecaf,\u201d he said. \u201cLondon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust water, please.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although I could see a look in her eyes that said she didn\u2019t appreciate me taking up table space if I wasn\u2019t going to order anything.</p><p>Shitty to be her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this, so I\u2019m just going to spit it out,\u201d I told him. \u201cThere are some bad guys down in California who have Jessica, and they\u2019re going to kill her unless I commit a murder for them.\u201d</p><p>I expected to startle him, maybe have him question whether I\u2019d lost my mind. Instead he just smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>It felt like someone had hit me in the stomach with a baseball bat. Guess I could still feel more pain after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know all about it,\u201d he said casually. The waitress came back and handed him his coffee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want anything with that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSlice of pecan pie would be great,\u201d he said, winking at her. \u201cWith a scoop of ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d she said, glancing over at me again. \u201cHey, are you sick? You don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>I managed to shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, my voice hoarse and weak. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just ... need to talk with the deputy, okay? Can you leave us?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, then strutted off, smacking her little order pad down on the counter as she passed into the back.</p><p>\u201cNow you pissed her off,\u201d Nate said casually. \u201cIf she spits in my pie, I\u2019m making you pay for it. In fact, I think I\u2019ll let you pay for everything anyway. So was that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas what all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that all you wanted to talk about? If that\u2019s it, you should probably get going. Sounds like you got your work cut out for you. Good luck with that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a police officer,\u201d I said, still stunned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he replied, taking another sip of his coffee. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m a little bored right now, but I love pie. I should eat up, sounds like it\u2019ll be a long night. Crime scene to process and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2014what\u2019s wrong here? Is this some kind of joke to you?\u201d</p><p>Nate smiled, so much hatred in his eyes that it scared me. Had I ever known him at all?</p><p>\u201cNo, Loni, this isn\u2019t a joke. You\u2019ve got a job to do, and if you want that little cunt Jessica to survive, sounds like you better stop dickin\u2019 around and get it done. Oh, now don\u2019t look at me like that. It\u2019s not like I want her dead\u2014kid\u2019s fuckin\u2019 great in the sack. Wouldn\u2019t mind another run at her.\u201d</p><p>I reeled. My brain seemed to shut down, incapable of accepting any new data.</p> <p>\u201cYou were sleeping with Jessica?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re stupid,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSomeone had to give her enough money to get down to Cali when you had your little fight. This whole thing was a lot of work to set up, but I have to admit that screwing her tight little ass was the fun part. Christ, you didn\u2019t actually think I was into you, did you? You\u2019re too old, used up ... And now it\u2019s time for you to go and take care of your business. Don\u2019t bother trying to call the cops before it\u2019s done, either. Nobody\u2019s going to help you.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere in the middle of his little speech, I shut down. I could still see everything, hear everything ... but it all felt distant and unreal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an evil person,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man with a goal,\u201d Nate replied, his voice serious and his eyes hard\u2014nothing like the person I thought I\u2019d known. He leaned forward, his words precise and clipped. \u201cI know what I want, and I\u2019m willing to do anything to get it. I fucked your girl and convinced her to go to San Diego, Loni. I rigged your house to blow so Hayes would take you in. Now you\u2019re right where I want you, and you\u2019ll fucking dance because I told you to. No more questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s that pie,\u201d the waitress said, walking toward us.</p><p>\u201cThanks, hon,\u201d Nate replied with a smile. She leaned in to him just a little, her body language making it clear she had more than pie to offer.</p> <p>They ignored me when I pushed up and out of my seat, trying not to stumble as I walked out of the restaurant and back to my van. I sat in the driver\u2019s seat for several minutes, trying to process what the hell had just happened. But some things don\u2019t make sense no matter how you look at them, so I turned my key in the ignition and pulled out of the parking lot, because I still needed to hit the grocery store. I had a list of things to buy and I was running out of time to get dinner on the table.</p><p>Why was I fixing dinner? I don\u2019t know.</p><p>What I do know is that by the time I paid for the food, my side hurt where my purse kept thwacking me as I walked\u2014the gun threw it off balance, I guess. I ignored the small pain as I drove home to cook dinner for Reese. Not like killing a man is less awful if you\u2019ve fed him first, but what else was I supposed to do for the rest of the afternoon?</p><p>God damn Nate Evans to hell, and God damn me for falling for his shit. God damn the men holding Jessica, too. If there was any justice in the universe, Amber was burning in a fiery pit surrounded by demons right at this minute. I hated all of them.</p><p>Mostly, though, I hated me.</p><p>REESE</p><p>\u201cWhy bother playing it through? She\u2019s got a gun in there and she\u2019s gonna shoot you with it. Not many ways to spin that and get a happy ending,\u201d Puck said, holding my gaze steadily. \u201cI spent almost two hours gettin\u2019 harassed on the side of the fucking road while she plotted your death. How much more proof do you need?\u201d</p><p>The kid had balls, talking to me like that. Still, he\u2019d been thrown into deep shit, headfirst, and he\u2019d rolled with it and done his job. Nobody wants to be the one telling an MC president that his woman\u2019s fixin\u2019 to kill him. The Silver Bastards prospect had showed me respect without fucking around.</p><p>I still hated him for what he\u2019d discovered.</p><p>\u201cHate to say it \u2019cause I like London, but I\u2019m with Puck on this one,\u201d Gage said. He sat back in an old office chair I\u2019d hauled down to my shop a few years ago. Right now it was positioned in front of a long, low table with two monitors set on top of it. They each split into four screens, playing a live feed of different rooms in my house. Ruger had a gift for electronics, no question.</p><p>I\u2019d have to make sure he didn\u2019t forget to take any of those little fuckers out after this was all over, too. Last I needed were eyes on what went on in there on a regular basis. Been damned fuckin\u2019 hard to act normal this week, knowing the brothers were watching everything I did.</p><p>Make that almost everything. I didn\u2019t let them put anything in the bedroom, because fuck that shit.</p><p>We\u2019d spent a good part of the afternoon down here\u2014Gage, me, Ruger, Horse, Painter, Bam Bam, and Duck. Bolt was off at Maggs\u2019s place. Not sure what drama was goin\u2019 down with those two. Hopefully I\u2019d never find out. Couldn\u2019t even manage my own woman, didn\u2019t need to worry about his.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d I said, watching London bustling around the kitchen on the monitor and sighing. I\u2019d fallen for her, I realized. Not just fucking her, but her. Comin\u2019 home to her felt good, and havin\u2019 her with me at the party? Hadn\u2019t felt like that since Heather was alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d never hated the cartel more than I did in that instant.</p><p>We might not have the full story here, but didn\u2019t take a genius to see they were using Jessica to manipulate her. Was that an excuse? No. London should\u2019ve come to me, let the club handle things.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got no fuckin\u2019 clue what she got herself into here,\u201d I muttered. Bam grunted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how they work. Nobody sets out to get controlled and used by a fuckin\u2019 cartel. They\u2019re like parasites, workin\u2019 their way in and then taking over until you can\u2019t pull them out without killing the host. Lost cause at this point, Pic. She\u2019s made her choice and it wasn\u2019t you. Those weren\u2019t blanks I pulled out of her purse\u2014so far as she knows, that gun is still loaded and she\u2019s obviously plannin\u2019 to use it.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed, torn between wishing he wasn\u2019t so damn blunt and thankful my brothers weren\u2019t afraid to give it to me straight.</p><p>\u201cSo why are we still waiting?\u201d Gage asked. \u201cWe go in and find out what\u2019s going on\u2014she won\u2019t be able to hold out on us long. We can make a decision about what to do with her after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s hoping she\u2019ll change her mind,\u201d Duck muttered. He sat on a shop stool, eyeing all of us cynically. \u201cFuckin\u2019 pussy thinks that maybe true love will conquer all, and then she\u2019ll climb onto his bike and they\u2019ll ride away into the sky on a rainbow while we all throw rose petals at them.\u201d</p><p>Puck snorted, quickly turning it into a cough.</p><p>\u201cJust \u2019cause you\u2019re old doesn\u2019t mean you can talk to me like that,\u201d I told Duck, my voice like ice. He shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cCall it like I see it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever you do, let\u2019s do it soon. If you want it to go all the way to the end, that\u2019s fine with me. Just get moving because I\u2019m hungry. Whether she tries to shoot you or not, that food she\u2019s cookin\u2019 will still taste good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Duck,\u201d Painter muttered. Then he caught my eye. \u201cIf this is really goin\u2019 down, I should grab Melanie. She\u2019s upstairs, and I don\u2019t know what London\u2019s planning to do about her witnessing things. We don\u2019t need her seein\u2019 this shit. No more collateral damage than necessary, right boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo get her,\u201d I said. \u201cTake her to dinner and a movie, or some such. Make it a date. That\u2019ll be a good alibi for both of you if anything happens. I\u2019ll keep you posted and if things go to hell you can dump her with one of the girls, sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Painter said. \u201cI\u2019ll take her out and then tuck her in safe once you give the all clear. Good luck, Pic. Hope it works out okay.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and gave me a rough hug. I slapped his back, and the rest of us settled in to watch as he drove his bike around the back side of the hill, pulling into the driveway like he\u2019d come directly from town.</p><p>\u201cSo, you find anything interesting in her purse besides that gun?\u201d I asked Bam.</p> <p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s the phone they\u2019ve been usin\u2019 to talk to her, but that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill fuckin\u2019 pissed about that,\u201d Ruger muttered. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be so hard to crack the bastard, but still haven\u2019t been able to tap it. Ninjas or something.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, I had to smile. Ruger wasn\u2019t used to being beaten by technology.</p><p>\u201cFinally met your match,\u201d Duck grunted, his voice satisfied. \u201cI keep tellin\u2019 you, we can\u2019t just count on electronic shit to cover us. Nothing like human intel combined with real firepower. Beats one of your little bugs any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout my bugs, we\u2019d have no idea what we\u2019re walking into,\u201d Ruger said. Duck rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou still got no idea,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWe know she\u2019s got a gun somewhere and we\u2019re pretty sure she\u2019s planning to shoot Pic. Has somethin\u2019 to do with that kid of hers. Hard to know more without hearin\u2019 both sides of the conversation, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. We haven\u2019t learned one damn thing about the cartel that\u2019s new or useful in all of this, and I\u2019ll bet she can\u2019t tell us shit, either. This is the sideshow\u2014the main event\u2019s gonna be in Cali, not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know they want Pic dead,\u201d Ruger said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u2019cause that\u2019s a big fuckin\u2019 surprise,\u201d Horse said. \u201cAnd here I thought they loved him, up to this point. Who knew?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019re like two-year-olds,\u201d I muttered, glaring at him and Ruger. \u201cYou need a fuckin\u2019 time-out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainter\u2019s in,\u201d Gage said quietly. We watched on the tiny screens as he went upstairs to talk to Melanie, who apparently needed some time to get ready. This wasn\u2019t a huge surprise to me, seeing as I raised two daughters. Painter went down to the kitchen and chatted up London while Mel was primping, then guided her gently out of the house to his bike.</p><p>\u201cI think Painter\u2019s got a little crush,\u201d Horse said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that sweet? We should all congratulate him on that, make real sure he knows we\u2019re pullin\u2019 for him. He\u2019ll love that.\u201d</p><p>Puck snorted again.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, prospect,\u201d Duck said. \u201cNo respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as my cue,\u201d I said, rubbing the back of my neck. \u201cHorse? You come with me, along with Puck and Bam. Ruger, I want you keepin\u2019 an eye on things until we finish with her. Then get your ass down to the house and tear it all down. Tonight. No more fuckin\u2019 cameras in my shit. And I want everyone ready to leave for Portland by midnight, got me? No point in makin\u2019 things easy for the bastards if they\u2019re spying on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cSooner we get this done the better. Make our move before someone in the Devil\u2019s Jacks decides they don\u2019t want to play nice with the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely. They\u2019re fucked,\u201d I said. \u201cSo are we, come to think of it. This is it, brothers\u2014we either smack these cartel cocksuckers back now or we get ready to start followin\u2019 their orders. Not a whole lot of ground in between.\u201d</p><p>For once, neither Horse nor Ruger had a joke.</p><p>\u201cReady for a beer?\u201d London asked brightly as she opened the door for me. I studied her face for a hint of something\u2014guilt, evasion ... Hell, even hostility.</p><p>Nothing. She was like a pretty, blank blow-up doll going through the motions. Completely checked out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, sweetheart,\u201d I said, reaching out and catching the back of her neck, pulling her in for a kiss. She didn\u2019t respond, which wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got chili cooking, and some corn bread,\u201d she told me when I let her go. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make yourself comfortable in the dining room? Food\u2019ll be ready soon, I\u2019ll bring it out to you.\u201d</p><p>As she walked me toward the table, I decided there\u2019d never been a more incompetent assassin in history. I hadn\u2019t really believed she was deliberately working with the cartel from the start, but now I had proof. Nobody who knew what they were doing would be this stupid about it.</p><p>She\u2019d set a magazine out for me in front of the chair at the head of the table. Facing away from the kitchen\u2014wasn\u2019t that convenient? That way she could just walk up to me and shoot me in the head.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just check on the corn bread,\u201d she said without meeting my eyes. I watched as she drifted away. Fuck. Guess it\u2019d been too good to be true.</p><p>Sorry, baby, Heather whispered.</p><p>Yeah, whatever.</p><p>I grabbed my magazine and walked around to the far side of the table. Knowing my luck, she\u2019d ditch the gun and go after me with a rolling pin. Never turn your back on a woman with a weapon\u2014I\u2019d learned that from Heather. Come to think of it, she\u2019d tried to kill me at least three times over the course of our marriage ... \u2019Course, only one of those was serious.</p><p>Ten minutes later London came back into the dining room, something heavy pulling down one side of her sweater. Christ, but she was clueless. It would\u2019ve been funny, but pretty fuckin\u2019 hard to laugh when the woman you love tries to kill you.</p> <p>Love?</p><p>Now that was probably takin\u2019 it a bit far, I mused. But whatever I felt for her, it was a step up from lust. Pisser, because that was a gun in her pocket, and from the determined look on her face she was definitely planning to use it against me. I decided to throw a Hail Mary anyway.</p><p>\u201cSomething you want to talk about?\u201d I asked her. Her mouth twisted as she bit her lip, clearly startled to find me in a different place than where she\u2019d left me. Yeah, \u2019cause I always made it as easy as possible for people to kill me. I\u2019m a giver that way.</p><p>Last chance, London.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly, sticking her hand down into the pocket with the gun. She caught me watching, and her face actually turned white.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you look like you could use a day off,\u201d I told her, wondering if there was a way to get through to her. Couldn\u2019t decide how I felt about that ... Duck had been right. I wanted things to end happy, for her to fall into my arms and let me take over and fix everything. But I was also fuckin\u2019 pissed, because I could no longer deny that this woman truly meant to kill me. Hard not to take that personally. \u201cHave you considered hitting the spa? Maybe get a massage?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat costs too much,\u201d she said automatically. I frowned at her, wondering how such a smart person could be so stupid. Talk to me before it\u2019s too late.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting that you pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, you\u2019re totally independent and you like it that way. Blah, blah. Just let me do something for you, for once.\u201d</p><p>She looked like she might throw up, and then her eyes started turning red. Tears. London knew what she was about to do was wrong, and she knew she didn\u2019t want to do it ... yet it still didn\u2019t occur to her to reach out for help. I got that she had to protect Jessica\u2014I\u2019d do the same for Em or Kit. I even got that she was confused and frightened. But what really sucked in this situation was that she didn\u2019t trust me to save her.</p><p>Had it been anything but sex for her?</p><p>No. Time to face reality. I was just a booty call to her, proving once and for all that karma\u2019s one hell of a bitch. And so was London.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>\u201cThe food won\u2019t be ready for another ten minutes. You look sort of tense. Want a neck rub?\u201d She started to walk around the table toward me, clearly planning to blow out my brains. Now I felt a wave of fury hit. How dare this cunt use me for sex and then try to shoot me in my own home? I\u2019d have done anything to help her, but she couldn\u2019t even bother asking.</p><p>\u201cI think you should stay back.\u201d Otherwise I might strangle you.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d hate to make it too easy for you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She smiled weakly. I wanted to slap the smile right off her lying face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. You understand. And now you\u2019ll understand what it means to be afraid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re planning to shoot me in the back of the head,\u201d I said, forcing myself to stay calm. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad idea. You shoot that close, you\u2019ll be all covered in blood spatter. Means you\u2019ll risk tracking more evidence out of the house or taking time to clean up. Either way, complicates things.\u201d</p><p>That clear enough for you, bitch?</p><p>She pulled out the gun slowly, raising it carefully to aim at my head. Little idiot. A gun like that wasn\u2019t exactly a sniper\u2019s weapon. Even at this close range, she should be going for the biggest target\u2014my chest.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, do it,\u201d I said, smirking at her. I wanted to scare her. Hurt her. Make her pay for not trusting me ... \u201cShow me what you\u2019re made of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered, and those tears building in her eyes started spilling out, running down her cheeks. Behind her I saw Horse step up quietly, waiting. Puck and Bam Bam would be in the kitchen, and I knew they\u2019d do whatever I needed, up to and including disposing of London\u2019s body for me. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know how much I wish this weren\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do it,\u201d I told her, catching and holding her gaze because I\u2019m a fucking fool. Even now I\u2019d forgive her if she just opened her mouth and told me what was going on. Trusted me. \u201cWhatever it is, we can work through it. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ...\u201d</p><p>I sighed, because that was it. Over. Goddamn waste, tryin\u2019 to connect with a woman. Heather had been one in a million\u2014I\u2019d already had my time.</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>I gave Horse a tip of my chin, letting him know wordlessly that I\u2019d had enough of this shit. London would have to pay for what she\u2019d done, which was just too fuckin\u2019 bad. That\u2019s what you get for tryin\u2019 to kill the man you\u2019re sleepin\u2019 with. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, babe,\u201d Horse said. I saw shock all over her face, but I had to admit, the bitch had balls, because she pulled the damn trigger.</p><p>I sighed again as Horse reached around the woman I\u2019d fallen for, grabbing her wrist and squeezing hard as he threw her down on the table face-first. London dropped the gun, crying openly. I stood and strolled over to her, dropping down on my haunches to study her. Her eyes caught mine, expression full of pain and despair.</p><p>Appropriate, because she was well and truly fucked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d really benefit from one of the handgun classes down at the gun shop,\u201d I told her quietly. \u201cLearn all kinds of good stuff there. For instance, they\u2019d teach you to check and make sure nobody\u2019s tampered with your weapon when it\u2019s out of your control. They\u2019d also teach you to check and make sure it\u2019s loaded.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes and bit her lip.</p><p>I\u2019m a sick bastard, because the sight of her laid out on that table, held down and crying? That should\u2019ve bothered me. It turned me on, though. Even now I wanted to fuck her.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill me?\u201d she asked, her voice a hoarse whisper. Horse shot me a glance, and I considered the question.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t decided yet,\u201d I finally admitted. \u201cFirst we\u2019re going to get information from you. I\u2019d suggest you cooperate, because otherwise we\u2019ll have to convince you, and the fact that you\u2019ve been in my bed isn\u2019t going to help you out of this.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and nodded. The life had gone out of her completely ... But just when I wondered if she\u2019d roll over and die, she opened them again, forcing herself to reengage.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to know something,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I asked, waiting for her to start going on about love or some other bullshit, trying to save her ass.</p><p>\u201cThey have Jessica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we kind of figured that out,\u201d I told her, my voice dry. \u201cForgive me if I don\u2019t give a shit. I don\u2019t care why a person tries to kill me. I\u2019m all about the end result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica is going to die if she doesn\u2019t get help,\u201d she said, ignoring my sarcasm. \u201cLike, help in the next twenty-four hours. She\u2019s got a shunt, Reese. Born with hydrocephalus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck?\u201d Horse asked, frowning at me.</p> <p>\u201cWater on her brain,\u201d London said. \u201cHer cerebrospinal fluid doesn\u2019t drain right, which means she has a little tube running down from her skull through her neck to drain the fluid. If that tube gets blocked or infected, she\u2019s dead. Head trauma is particularly dangerous for people with shunts\u2014I watched them throw her down. Her head hit the concrete and then she had a seizure. I know I messed up, and it was wrong to try to shoot you, Reese. But please\u2014if you have any mercy at all\u2014please try to find a way to help her. It\u2019s over for me and I\u2019m fine with that, but you have children. You\u2019d do anything to keep them alive, wouldn\u2019t you? Please ...\u201d</p><p>With that she seemed to fold in on herself. I glanced at Horse.</p><p>\u201cYou know about this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cKnew the kid had medical issues, not the details,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBills came up on the background check. This shunt shit is news, though. Fuck, London\u2014why the hell didn\u2019t you tell me she had a tube in her head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica doesn\u2019t like people to know,\u201d she whispered, her voice miserable. \u201cShe says it makes her feel like a freak, so we don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of this matters,\u201d Puck said, stepping into the room.</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over for your girlfriend. We all know it\u2014sucks for the kid, but there\u2019s nothing we can do for her. You can\u2019t let her get to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cold fucker, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Horse asked. Puck shrugged.</p><p>\u201cPractical. It is what it is. You can\u2019t let the woman who tried to kill the president of the Reapers MC get away with it.\u201d</p><p>Horse and I exchanged quick looks. London stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get her out of here,\u201d Horse said finally. \u201cFigure out what to do with her back at the Armory\u2014we don\u2019t even know how useful she might be to us yet. Burn one bridge at a time, brother.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>LONDON</p><p>Relief.</p><p>That\u2019s what I felt, more than anything else.</p><p>I think I was supposed to be afraid, maybe cry and beg for mercy. Instead I wanted to cry with relief just because it was finally over. Jessica would live or die, but there wasn\u2019t a damned thing I could do about it at this point.</p><p>The instant I pulled the trigger, I\u2019d known that I\u2019d made the worst mistake of my life. They say God shows mercy on drunks and fools. That I believed, because despite my resolve, the gun didn\u2019t fire. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure why and I didn\u2019t care\u2014if they killed me, so be it.</p><p>It was a strange realization. Reese and I hadn\u2019t even been together a full week. I didn\u2019t truly know what kind of man he was, ultimately. But I knew he had people who loved him. He\u2019d been crazy about his wife, he\u2019d raised two children by himself, and he\u2019d protected me with his own life.</p><p>I had no justification to shoot Reese Hayes, no matter what was at stake. Period.</p><p>Let it be.</p><p>During the short ride to the Armory I drifted, thinking about everything and nothing ... They\u2019d bundled me roughly into the back of my own van, which I supposed would have to disappear along with my body. I wondered how they\u2019d explain things to my employees, then figured it didn\u2019t really matter. None of them knew anything that could get them in trouble. They\u2019d just have to find new jobs.</p><p>On the bright side, job hunting is rarely fatal.</p><p>Horse and Bam Bam drove me, with Gage in the backseat by my side. They\u2019d cuffed my hands in front of my body, which was fairly considerate under the circumstances. I sort of expected a burlap bag over the head before being stuffed in a trunk. This seemed luxurious, all things considered.</p><p>After what felt like hours and still no time at all, we pulled up to the Armory and they opened the gate into the back courtyard. The pale sunlight showed a very different picture from the way it\u2019d been the last time I was here. The tables had been put away, and instead of laughing people, a grim circle of men wearing Reapers colors stood waiting for us.</p><p>Reese wasn\u2019t among them.</p><p>I opted not to meet their eyes when Gage opened the sliding door and caught my arm, dragging me out of my seat. He pushed me roughly across the pavement toward a sunken stairwell at the back of the building\u2014a basement entrance, leading down into darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You know, I\u2019d been nervous the first time I walked into the Armory. It\u2019s an intimidating place and the men are rough and scary looking. Now I kept waiting for the numbness to lift and the fear to set in.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>They hustled me along a barren, dimly lit concrete hallway lined with doors that looked like prison cells. One of them stood open, and I saw a small cot with a nasty little mattress. Definitely a prison cell. I wondered what\u2019d happened to the last person in there, then decided I really didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>I\u2019d tried to make death quick for Reese, and as painless as possible. I could only pray he\u2019d do the same for me.</p> <p>Gage shoved me through a door farther down the hallway. Two bare-bulbed work lights hung suspended from rusty hooks in the ceiling. A rope hung down, too\u2014it\u2019d been strung through a metal loop bolted into a massive support beam. Gage nudged me forward, looping the rope around the chain between the handcuffs.</p><p>Bam Bam caught the other end and pulled it, stretching my arms up and over my head. Shit\u2014were they going to hang me from the ceiling? I\u2019d just reached the point of discomfort when he stopped. Bam tied off the rope to another loop bolted to the wall. Horse watched me the entire time, as if he expected me to say something. Were they waiting for me to beg for mercy?</p><p>They\u2019d be waiting for a while. The thought made me smile, and Gage finally broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cAre you on something?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, startled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re way the fuck too calm,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cDid you take something? If you\u2019re about to OD, tell me. Drowning in your own puke isn\u2019t the way you want to go.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that this is a huge relief,\u201d I said. His face showed the first emotion I\u2019d seen. Surprise. That struck me as funny, and I started laughing\u2014not gentle, dignified noise. These were real, genuine belly laughs. The kind where you snort your drink out your nose because it catches you by total surprise, and then your friends make fun of you and everyone catches it and you\u2019re all laughing like crazy people. You know what I\u2019m talking about.</p><p>But these men weren\u2019t my friends and they weren\u2019t making fun of me. They were staring at me like I\u2019d lost my mind. Maybe I had.</p><p>\u201cChrist, she\u2019s falling apart,\u201d someone muttered. That was even funnier. I snorted again, then choked a little bit on my own giggles. I laughed so hard my throat hurt and tears streamed down my face.</p><p>A wall of cold water hit me, shocking me into silence.</p> <p>I shook my head, blinking rapidly. Reese stood in front of me, an empty bucket in his hands. His eyes were cold and there was so much coiled tension in his body I could feel it, like electricity crackling through the air during a storm.</p><p>The bucket fell to the floor with a jolting clatter, and he kicked it out of his way.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, I shut the fuck up because this was Reese, but not a Reese I\u2019d ever seen. This couldn\u2019t possibly be the same man who\u2019d laughed with me, made love to me ...</p><p>I couldn\u2019t find my Reese in this man\u2019s face.</p><p>That first night at the Armory, he\u2019d scared me. Then I\u2019d fallen for him, and while my brain remembered he had darkness inside, my body convinced me it wasn\u2019t true. Now I realized I\u2019d never seen the real Reese at all\u2014I\u2019d only seen hints of his true capacity.</p><p>Holy God.</p><p>This was the reality of Reese Hayes, and it was darker than I ever imagined.</p> <p>He terrified me.</p><p>Expressionless, Reese stepped toward me, reaching down and slowly wrapping his fingers around the hilt of the big hunting knife he wore strapped to his leg. The thing was huge, and it\u2019d freaked me out the first time I saw it. Then I\u2019d gotten used to seeing it and it became just another part of him.</p><p>Apparently the part he used to murder people.</p><p>The wicked blade glinted as he brought it up, testing the edge with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d I whispered, feeling my own mortality wrap around me like a suffocating blanket.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Nope. Just started walking around behind me, circling out of my line of sight. I glanced toward the other men, wondering if they\u2019d stop him or say anything, but their eyes were dead, and I saw my own end clearly reflected back at me. One of these Reapers would bury my body later tonight. Nobody would ever know what happened to me, and I would never learn what happened to Jess, either.</p><p>\u201cWill you wait until we find out whether she\u2019s alive?\u201d I asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cNot the time to be askin\u2019 favors, sweetheart,\u201d he said with quiet emphasis. Suddenly he caught my hair, jerking my head backward hard and fast. The knife flashed, and then I felt the blade digging into my throat. A line of fire crossed my neck. This was it. Reese Hayes was about to slit my throat.</p><p>I waited to die, the sound of his breath harsh in my ear. Then he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get off that easy, bitch.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I realized he hadn\u2019t severed my windpipe ... The blade still pressed at my throat, and I felt a faint trickle of blood slide down my neck. He\u2019d cut me, but not badly. Just enough to part the skin.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me everything,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t leave out anything, whether you think it\u2019s important or not. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I started to nod and he jerked my hair back violently.</p><p>\u201cBad idea to nod when you\u2019ve got a knife at your throat,\u201d Horse said casually from across the room. \u201cMight wanna be a little more thoughtful in your movements right now, London. Just a suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, my voice so hoarse that it came out with a croak. I cleared my throat, then tried to talk again. \u201cUm ... you know Jess got mad at me and went down to her mom, Amber? Well, the guy Amber was living with is holding Jess prisoner. You already know she was scared of the men at Amber\u2019s house, told me she wanted to come home. That was Wednesday morning. Then my house blew up Wednesday night, and you brought me out to your place.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s fingers tightened in my hair hard enough that I wondered if I\u2019d have any left in a minute. The knife shifted painfully.</p><p>OhmyGodohmyGodohmyGod!</p><p>\u201cSo you know about that,\u201d I continued, almost thankful for the cuffs holding up my wrists. I wasn\u2019t sure I could\u2019ve stayed on my feet without their support. \u201cThe next morning I called Jess and she said she\u2019d changed her mind. That was in your bedroom, remember? Looking back, I think they\u2019d taken her already. She didn\u2019t sound like herself, something was off. That night I came out here for the party\u2014\u201d Reese growled, low and deep in his throat. He jerked me into his body, still holding the knife to my throat, and I felt his cock hardening against my ass. Must\u2019ve been remembering our time together out in the courtyard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A hint of desire built between my legs, and I wondered just how much more twisted my lust for him could get. He\u2019d made me feel free, adventurous ... guess that sense of adventure ran deeper than I realized, if I could get turned on by him holding a knife to my throat.</p><p>In the unlikely event that I actually made it out of here alive, I really needed to look into some serious counseling. The thought struck me as funny, and a snort of laughter escaped. Nobody else laughed\u2014guess they couldn\u2019t quite appreciate the humor?</p><p>\u201cYour daydreamin\u2019 bullshit is only cute on days you haven\u2019t tried to kill me,\u201d Reese murmured in my ear. \u201cFuckin\u2019 talk or I\u2019ll cut you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, forcing myself to focus.</p><p>\u201cSo the next morning the girls invited me to go out with them and get pedicures. That was Saturday. We had a good time and got some lunch after. Then I left because I needed to get to work. I went back to my van and the front window was open. There was an envelope on the seat and I opened it. There was a phone, the same one you probably found in my purse. It\u2019s black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t occur to you that maybe opening a strange envelope was a bad idea?\u201d Bam Bam asked, his voice casual. \u201cYour house had already blown up, and then you find someone\u2019s been in your car? Not real bright, London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll give you that one,\u201d I said, biting back the urge to laugh again. God. What was wrong with me? Oh yeah ... imminent death ... \u201cNot smart at all, but I did it anyway. They sent me a video chat request, and I answered it. Jess was there and I talked to her, and then they held her down and cut off one of her fingers while I watched.\u201d</p><p>Reese\u2019s breath hissed in my ear, and for the first time I saw the carefully blank expression on Horse\u2019s face crack a little. He looked ... disgusted?</p><p>\u201cSo they cut off her finger and told me that I had to take pictures of papers I found in Reese\u2019s house,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cThey told me they\u2019d kill her if I didn\u2019t, and I believed them. I think they might have done it already ... They didn\u2019t care about hurting her, and they have no clue what they\u2019re dealing with. She\u2019s not a normal kid, at least not medically. Not with that shunt in her head. Other stuff isn\u2019t quite right with her, either\u2014her brain doesn\u2019t process cause and effect correctly. Fetal drug effects. Amber did a lot of drugs while she was pregnant, so Jess came early and spent months in the NICU over at Sacred Heart. We\u2019ll never know if the hydrocephalus is connected to that ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoulda told me,\u201d Reese gritted out. \u201cShoulda told me about Jessica\u2019s medical shit, shoulda told me somethin\u2019 was wrong. Gave you lots of chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, London,\u201d Gage said, shaking his head. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you come to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly know you,\u201d I said, and for the first time I felt something that wasn\u2019t numbness or fear. Anger. \u201cWhy the hell would I come talk to you? Crazy men have my cousin and she\u2019s in danger, and all I really know about you is you throw great parties and everyone says you\u2019re criminals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to know our time together meant so much to you,\u201d Reese whispered, and I\u2019ve never heard so much menace in a man\u2019s voice before. But his cock was still hard against me and my nipples tightened in response.</p><p>Serious fucking counseling.</p><p>First thing on my to-do list, right after not dying in this basement.</p><p>\u201cThink about it from my perspective,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice calm. \u201cI don\u2019t know you very well. Her life is at stake. Would you risk Em\u2019s life based on a relationship that\u2019s only a week old?\u201d</p><p>Silence fell, so terrible I actually heard my own heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I wouldn\u2019t risk lettin\u2019 you flush a fuckin\u2019 toilet at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is getting off track,\u201d Horse muttered. \u201cPic, hold it in. We gotta figure out the situation, then you can deal with her, bro. Hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d Reese said. He let go of my hair abruptly, which scared the hell out of me because the sudden release pushed my throat deeper into the knife. Then the knife pulled away, and his hand wrapped around my throat instead, big fingers catching me under the jaw and pushing my head back into his shoulder.</p><p>Now I felt the full length of his body behind me, cradled in his embrace. How could this be the same man who\u2019d held me before? I\u2019d felt so safe in his arms. Now all I felt was terror.</p><p>Terror and unholy lust.</p><p>\u201cSo what does this mean in terms of them holdin\u2019 Jessica?\u201d Bam Bam asked, his voice tight. \u201cShe need special drugs or somethin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBut she\u2019s really vulnerable to infection and head trauma. That shunt gets damaged, it\u2019ll take her out fast. She can\u2019t be handled rough, it\u2019s too dangerous. I did what they said. I searched as much of the house as I could, although I didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Reese told me, tightening his hold until I could hardly breathe. \u201cWe watched you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes tightly. God. I\u2019d been so stupid.</p><p>\u201cYou knew all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the details,\u201d Gage said, his voice soft. \u201cBut we knew you were working for them. That\u2019s why you had Puck on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s not a huge surprise,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt all felt wrong\u2014I kept thinking you knew. Not that it matters. I couldn\u2019t find anything for them, and then they called me again today. I talked to Jessica, and then I watched them throw her down on a concrete floor. She hit her head and started having a seizure. He told me I have to kill Reese or she\u2019ll die. If he dies, they\u2019ll dump her at an ER. So I tried to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever see their faces on the video?\u201d Reese asked, his voice like ice.</p><p>\u201cNo, they only let me see Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get the gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey gave me an address and I drove there using the GPS on my phone. Up north of Hayden. It turned out to be the middle of a field, and a man met me there. He showed me how to use the gun. I didn\u2019t learn his name or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I went to Nate.\u201d</p><p>The air in the room changed. Sudden menace radiated from Reese, and his hand tightened so hard on my throat that I couldn\u2019t breathe and my vision started to swim with black dots.</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Horse said suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna hurt her, Pic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I squirmed, desperate for air.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Bam Bam said, his voice urgent. \u201cPic, let her the fuck go. You don\u2019t wanna do this, bro. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Reese let me go, stepping away as I collapsed down in the handcuffs. I gasped for oxygen, vision hazy as Reese stalked around me, tossing his knife back and forth between his hands. He wasn\u2019t looking at me, though. No, he stared down his club brothers like a force of nature.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out,\u201d Reese said, the words soft and calm and more terrifying than anything I\u2019d ever heard before in my life. \u201cOr I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck, bro\u2014\u201d Gage started. Reese shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cNot playin\u2019 games,\u201d he told them. \u201cGet out. My woman, my business.\u201d</p><p>Horse cocked his head, eyes assessing. Then he gave a sharp nod and left the room. Bam Bam followed, smacking his hand hard on the wall as he passed through the door. Gage stayed, studying us.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill her,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret it. Walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast chance,\u201d Reese said, the words quiet and cold. Gage sighed and gave a sharp nod.</p> <p>Then he walked out, leaving me alone with a madman.</p><p>He turned and our eyes met. I searched his, trying to identify what I saw there. Hate? Anger? Maybe rage or betrayal?</p><p>None of those words were strong enough to describe the air of cold menace filling the space between us. Menace, but also a flicker of awareness. There was something broken in my libido, I decided. I shouldn\u2019t be turned on by this. Not even a little bit. He started stalking toward me, lifting the knife and touching the side of the blade to one cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou went to Nate.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt\u2019d gone too far. Looking for papers is one thing, but shooting a man is another.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYet you pointed a gun at me and pulled the trigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because of Nate,\u201d I replied. He lowered the knife and raised his hand, brushing a finger down my cheek. Then he caught a strand of my hair and slowly wound it around his fingers, until it pulled and I couldn\u2019t move my head. He leaned forward, brushing his nose against my cheek and whispering in my ear.</p><p>\u201cDid you fuck him?\u201d</p><p>The hot touch of his breath sent a thrill through me, some sort of twisted lust mixed up with fear and adrenaline, and a sick, savage pleasure that he wanted to know, \u2019cause nothing fucked up about that, right?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, the word hoarse. \u201cI met him at a diner. I told him what was happening, and what they were trying to get me to do. Then he said he knew all about it and that he\u2019s the one that blew up my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you he wasn\u2019t a very nice guy,\u201d Reese said, sucking my earlobe into his mouth. I moaned, and he twisted my head back, forcing me to look up at him. His mouth ghosted across my skin, and he nipped at my lip. I gasped, almost expecting a kiss, but instead he asked another question. \u201cLet me guess\u2014he\u2019s buddies with the guy holdin\u2019 Jessica, and this was all a setup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHe said he ... He said he had sex with Jessica. That he gave her money. Melanie told me she had an older boyfriend who bought things for her. I think it must\u2019ve been him. He told me I had to kill you and that the police couldn\u2019t do anything to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came home and tried to shoot me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was very, very stupid,\u201d Reese said, his voice growing hard as he pulled back from me. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re going to pay. But you\u2019re a very lucky girl, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, my voice a whisper.</p><p>He offered a feral smile.</p><p>\u201cBecause I still want to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>More of that sick lust tore through me, all mixed with fear as he raised his knife. Grasping the neckline of my shirt, he slowly slit the fabric in half, exposing my upper body and bra. Then he tugged the bra down, popping my breasts out the top.</p><p>I saw the pulse pounding in his neck, smelled a hint of musky sweat. It was messed up and horrible and wrong in every way, but I wanted him inside me. Desperately. That\u2019s my only explanation for what I did next.</p><p>Licking my lips, I spoke, taunting him.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna talk or you wanna fuck? \u2019Cause I know which one I\u2019d prefer.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks flushed dark red and then the knife whipped upward, slashing through the rope holding my handcuffs. I collapsed instantly, and he caught me, throwing me roughly over his shoulder as he carried me out the door. I had a vague impression of bare concrete, bright white lights, and a grim-faced Gage as we found the little room with the cot. Reese slammed the door shut behind us with his foot.</p><p>I hit the bed hard, knocking the wind right out of me. Then I heard a slithering, whipping sound, and Reese was cinching my hands to the top of the bed with his belt. Seconds later my pants came down around my ankles. His hands grabbed my hips, lifting them high and I felt his cock at my entrance.</p><p>Then his eyes caught mine and he snarled.</p><p>I screamed when he slammed home, because it hurt and I was scared and it felt incredibly good and my brain just wouldn\u2019t work anymore. Reese wasn\u2019t a gentle lover under the best of circumstances, but this was brutal. He stilled and braced above me with those strong arms of his, smiling.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a friendly or loving smile.</p><p>No. This smile was a baring of teeth, and in his eyes I saw rage, pure and simple. Rage and hate and some kind of unholy, twisted desire that cut through both of us, no matter how sick that was. Holding my gaze, he pulled back and thrust again, this time harder. It burned and I cried out, but he didn\u2019t stop. I didn\u2019t want him to, either. I wanted more\u2014I wanted him to pin me and fill me with his come and I didn\u2019t care anymore whether that was wrong or right.</p><p>I just needed this terrible tension building between us to break. I needed him.</p><p>\u201cThat the best you can do?\u201d I demanded, laughing almost hysterically. He growled and my laugh turned into a shriek as he showed me that no, it wasn\u2019t the best he could do. It was just the beginning, because Reese started thrusting into me so hard my body could hardly take it. My legs spread wide and my hips pressed back into the thin mattress and I screamed again. I had never, ever in my entire life felt anything so amazingly good as the sensation of his body tearing into mine.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t sex\u2014this was revenge and it was perfect.</p><p>He pounded into me without mercy after that, our eyes glued to each other, lips snarling. There were no tender kisses, no playful giggles. Just the raw desire of two people whose lives had crashed together in the worst possible way. My orgasm didn\u2019t build slowly and wash over me. Nope. It slammed through me, ripping apart my existence until I cried out and tears ran down my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reese didn\u2019t even acknowledge that it\u2019d happened.</p><p>He just sank deep inside over and over again, driving my body toward another explosion. I think my synapses weren\u2019t firing right, because I knew I\u2019d be raw and bruised after this. I just didn\u2019t care. I wanted to take all of his hate and pain and anger and own it because I deserved it, but instead of suffering he just kept filling me and it felt way, way too good.</p><p>Then it hit again. I blew apart, my fragile mind all but shattering with the intensity.</p><p>This time he came with me, groaning painfully as his hot seed shot deep inside. His arms quivered and his heavy frame hung over mine as I crumpled, utterly exhausted. I\u2019d used up my adrenaline, lost the edge of fear in favor of lust, and couldn\u2019t even bring myself to think about poor Jessica. My brain had had enough, and my body agreed. Reese pulled away from me without a word, and I realized we hadn\u2019t used a condom. Oh well.</p> <p>My life span probably wouldn\u2019t be long enough to worry about STDs anyway.</p><p>I heard the sound of him zipping up, and then his big hands came down around mine, pulling the belt free but leaving me cuffed. He turned and walked out of the cell, slamming his hand against the wall as he went. The door clanged shut and the bolt slid home with a thunk.</p><p>I blinked in the darkness, trying to figure out what had just happened.</p><p>Holy. Shit.</p><p>I had no place to store this in my head. I didn\u2019t want to think about what we\u2019d done, how much I enjoyed it, or whether it meant anything. Considering this situation too carefully was scary, and I couldn\u2019t afford to be afraid right now. Not if I wanted to survive and save Jessica.</p> <p>My natural pragmatism kicked in. I was alive. I had no idea how much longer that would last, but I had to make the most of it. I closed my eyes and started taking deep breaths, counting to ten on each inhale and exhale. The relaxation technique had served me well over the years, and it didn\u2019t fail me that night.</p><p>Eventually sleep crept in, bringing an entirely different kind of release than what I\u2019d found with Reese.</p><p>The cold woke me.</p><p>I tried to reach for the covers, to pull them up and over my freezing body. Then I realized there weren\u2019t any, because I was on a cot in a cell in the Armory basement. My shirt and bra were ripped apart, my hands were cuffed together, and my wet jeans were still tucked around my ankles.</p><p>Other than that, things were great.</p><p>I rolled onto my back, bemused. I hadn\u2019t really expected to make it this far. I sort of assumed that I\u2019d tell them everything and they\u2019d shoot me. The end.</p> <p>Finding myself alive threw me.</p><p>I tried to think, figure out what the next step should be. Nothing came\u2014all of this was so far beyond my ability to process that my brain just spun out.</p><p>None of that changed the fact that I was cold. Maybe I could do something to fix that?</p><p>It took me a couple of tries to stand up because my legs were cold and rubbery. One of my feet had fallen asleep, too, which wasn\u2019t such a bad thing once I caught my balance. The tingling pins and needles helped me wake up and sharpen my perspective. I set about pulling my pants up, which was harder than you\u2019d think, because they had that cold, wet, clingy thing going on that makes jeans so unpleasant sometimes.</p><p>My bra was a lost cause, but I managed to stretch my shirt across my chest. It wasn\u2019t great, but it was better than just sitting around all naked and vulnerable. I walked around the cell, testing the door with my cuffed hands. It didn\u2019t open\u2014big surprise there, right?</p><p>By that time I was getting seriously cold. I sat back down on the bed and realized that what I\u2019d thought was the mattress cover was actually a thin, woolen blanket wrapped over the padding\u2014one of those striped army surplus ones from three wars back.</p><p>Crawling under it wasn\u2019t easy, but I figured the wool might help me stay warm. Theoretically, wool holds in heat even when it\u2019s wet. Practically, huddling under a wet wool blanket in a basement sucks ass, and I\u2019m saying that as a lady who tries not to cuss. My teeth started chattering as I considered my options.</p><p>I still wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of that last little episode with Reese. I felt sore between my legs and dirty in my soul, but I couldn\u2019t deny it\u2019d been the best sex I\u2019d ever had in my life. Messed up, but I don\u2019t believe in hiding from the truth\u2014apparently scary life-and-death situations turned me on.</p> <p>Or at least they turned me on when Reese was involved.</p><p>Go figure.</p><p>I supposed I could use that to try to stay alive, manipulate him somehow\u2014I was over the whole \u201cI don\u2019t care if I live or die\u201d numb feeling from the night before. When the shit hit the fan and Reese whipped out that big knife of his, I had very much wanted to live.</p><p>Okay, so I had that figured out. I wasn\u2019t going to just lie down and die. Good to know.</p><p>But what was I willing to do to stay alive? Yesterday I\u2019d decided to kill an innocent man to save Jessica\u2019s life. That hadn\u2019t ended so well for me, and I was forced to admit the truth. I really wasn\u2019t a very good assassin. This limited my options, which was probably just as well.</p><p>So what should I do next?</p><p>The answer seemed clear. I\u2019d do whatever I could to help the Reapers fight their enemies, because despite my little episode with Reese, I knew who the real bad guys were. Nate and his drug dealer friends down south. They\u2019d killed Amber, they were killing Jessica\u2014if they hadn\u2019t already\u2014and they\u2019d almost made me kill Reese.</p><p>A knife at my throat followed by crazy monkey sex in a basement wasn\u2019t all that bad in comparison. I tried to shoot him. In exchange he\u2019d given me two orgasms, so I guess in some ways that counted as a win?</p><p>Maybe the Reapers would be able save Jessica, although whether they\u2019d be motivated to try was a whole different question. I certainly couldn\u2019t do anything more for her at this point, and the cops obviously weren\u2019t an option. Assholes. If I got very lucky, Jessica might live. If cooperating with the Reapers raised those odds in any way, I\u2019d consider helping them my new goal in life.</p><p>And if Jessica died?</p><p>Well, then I\u2019d spend whatever time and freedom I had left hunting down the fuckwads who\u2019d done this to us. I might be a crappy assassin, but I was a fast learner and I had a sneaking suspicion that Reese would be a hell of a good teacher.</p><p>Sound crazy?</p><p>Probably, but what other options did I have? The only ones who hadn\u2019t lied to me or used me were Reese and his brothers, and we shared a common enemy. Wars have been won with less, so maybe we could pull something off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Assuming they didn\u2019t kill me first.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>REESE</p><p>\u201cNate Evans. Always a pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at my least favorite law enforcement officer, because some twisted part of me was almost relieved he\u2019d finally fucked up bad enough for us to take him out. The once and future prince of the Kootenai County Sheriff\u2019s Department sat tied to a metal chair in the center of our interrogation-slash-torture room, face covered with fresh bruises.</p><p>Not a bad look on him.</p><p>Bolt loosened the bandanna gagging Nate\u2019s mouth, smacking him on the head in the process for good measure. Deputy Dick had pulled Maggs over for \u201cspeeding\u201d once.</p><p>Bolt wasn\u2019t a fan.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your fucking mind?\u201d Nate demanded. \u201cI\u2019m a cop. They\u2019ll be looking for me\u2014they\u2019ll never stop. Not even you guys can kidnap a deputy and get away with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got a feeling Bud will find evidence that you were embezzling, and that you took off,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cSounds like a cold case to me. Ya think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d he said, shaking his head in blind denial. \u201cMy family will destroy you. This isn\u2019t how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that today, this is how it works,\u201d I told him, feeling a smile creep across my face. \u201cYou fucked up, but I have good news for you. You still got a shot to get out of here alive.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and spat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never let me go,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know you\u2019re fucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said I was fucked if I didn\u2019t let you go,\u201d I countered mildly. \u201cYou should probably work on those threats a bit. These contradictions are confusing, and you really can\u2019t afford to have us get frustrated, now can you?\u201d</p> <p>Horse grinned.</p><p>\u201cI think I should be the one to do it,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t really have anything against him. Not personally, I mean. You all have too many reasons to want him to suffer before he dies, so letting me kill him fast would really be the merciful thing.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. You know how sloppy I get when I\u2019m pissed off, and then the prospects will have a big mess to clean up.\u201d</p><p>Horse carefully took off his cut, folding it and handing it to Bam Bam. Then he picked up a hammer and started toward Evans, whistling a familiar tune faintly. I tried to place it ...</p><p>\u201cThe Wheels on the Bus.\u201d</p><p>Fucked-up shit, but that\u2019s sort of what we loved about Horse.</p><p>Seconds later he brought the hammer down hard on the good deputy\u2019s right hand. The man started screaming like a baby.</p> <p>\u201cSo, here\u2019s the part where I tell you I changed my mind about making it fast,\u201d Horse said, his tone friendly. \u201cIt\u2019s just so much fun, you know? Now I\u2019m going to break all the bones in your feet so you can\u2019t walk ever again ...\u201d</p><p>Nate shrieked and babbled, tears running down his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon,\u201d Bam Bam said, his voice heavy with disgust. \u201cYou fucked that girl and sent her down there to die. You blew up London\u2019s house. Then you blackmailed her into shooting Pic. Now you\u2019re whining because of a broken hand? I thought you were hard-core and shit, but you\u2019re just a little girl with a badge.\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s jaw started working, and we waited patiently until he managed to form words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you want,\u201d he gasped. \u201cJust don\u2019t hit me again. Don\u2019t kill me. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow \u2019bout this,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cYou call your friends down south and tell them me and London are dead. Murder-suicide, or some such shit. If they let the kid live, we\u2019ll let you live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019ll keep your promise? You can\u2019t afford to let me survive at this point.\u201d</p><p>I sighed heavily, rubbing my temples with a thumb and finger.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I almost don\u2019t want him to call,\u201d I told Horse. \u201cJessica is a pain in my ass, and if she comes back home, I won\u2019t get as much pussy. Doesn\u2019t change anything in terms of the war if we save her. Why don\u2019t you just have some fun with him, and then when you get bored we\u2019ll shoot him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Horse said, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Evans shouted.</p><p>I cocked a brow at him. \u201cI thought we couldn\u2019t afford to let you live? That\u2019s what you just told me. What\u2019s the holdup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile he\u2019s still alive, he\u2019s still got hope,\u201d Bam said, smirking. \u201cSo now he\u2019s gonna do exactly what you tell him, because every minute he\u2019s breathing means he could still get out of this. Am I right, Nate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet my phone,\u201d Nate said, sweat breaking out on his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll make the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll dial for you, \u2019cause we\u2019re helpful that way,\u201d Horse said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t always give us full credit for our warm, fuzzy side, but it\u2019s definitely there. We just love to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 Mother Teresa of the MC world, Horse,\u201d Ruger chimed in. \u201cBrings a tear to my eye.\u201d</p><p>Gage snorted and tossed me the man\u2019s phone.</p><p>\u201cWho do I call?\u201d I asked. \u201cRemember, if you double-cross us, you die. If Jessica dies, you die. You got a lot more to lose here than I do, because I really don\u2019t give two shits about the kid. Might be easier for me if she doesn\u2019t live. Something to keep in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia Strauss,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the number.\u201d</p><p>I scrolled through the contacts, finding the name. Then I hit the call button and put it on speakerphone. It picked up, but nobody spoke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Nate said, eyes darting quickly around the room. I wondered if he\u2019d warn them. Probably not. The man was too much of a coward to sacrifice himself for a cause. For once I agreed with him\u2014the cartel wasn\u2019t worth a sacrifice, and they sure as shit wouldn\u2019t appreciate or reward one. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, and then a man with a deep voice and faint Spanish accent replied.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? We didn\u2019t hear anything on the scanner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo police report,\u201d Nate said. \u201cLondon called me after she shot him, and I went out there. Now she\u2019s dead, too, made it look like a murder-suicide. I left them\u2014we\u2019ll let someone else find the bodies. You can let the girl go now.\u201d</p><p>The man gave a harsh laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll authorize the transfer to your account,\u201d he said, and the line went dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nate\u2019s face fell, the hope in his eyes fading.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill her,\u201d he said. \u201cAlways knew they would. She\u2019s a good kid ...\u201d</p><p>I punched him in the face so hard his chair fell over backward. His head hit the floor with a hollow-sounding thud and he started crying again. Standing over him, I cracked my knuckles, choosing my words for maximum effect.</p><p>\u201cWhile she\u2019s alive, you\u2019re alive,\u201d I told him. \u201cSo if you have any idea how to find these fuckers, now is the time to talk. If we get her out because of information you give us, the deal stands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t care if she lived or not?\u201d he asked, blinking in the glare of the work lights hanging from the ceiling. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me and we both know it. Why should I help you?\u201d</p><p>Painter stepped over, nudging the man\u2019s shoulder with one booted foot. He\u2019d only just gotten back to the Armory, after settling Melanie in at the house. Perfect timing\u2014he had his own scores to settle with Evans.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, the words soft and feral. \u201cLet\u2019s throw in a little more motivation. How \u2019bout you help us get Jess out safe and I won\u2019t kill your parents.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him, impressed because he\u2019d really stepped up his game. Painter was still young, but the past year had changed him. Nate\u2019s mouth gaped and Painter laughed, reaching down to grab the front of his uniform shirt, jerking his body up\u2014chair and all\u2014and setting him upright again. Then he leaned down, right into Evans\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get off on old bitches, but I\u2019ll make an exception for your mom,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThis is my promise to you. I\u2019ll fuck every hole she has before I slit her throat, and I\u2019ll be sure to tell her it\u2019s all from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can give you an address,\u201d Evans moaned, his entire body shaking. \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure if he\u2019s there, but he has a warehouse. I saw it once. It\u2019s the perfect place to hold her\u2014that\u2019s all the information I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you just the reasonable little man?\u201d Horse asked, grinning at him. \u201cI just knew we could work this out. Now let\u2019s take care of some more business. I think you need to call in sick to work\u2014you just don\u2019t look quite right. Maybe it\u2019s your time of the month or somethin\u2019, so you\u2019d best let them know. Wouldn\u2019t want \u2019em worrying, would we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, you\u2019re always so thoughtful,\u201d Bam Bam said to Horse.</p><p>\u201cI try,\u201d Horse responded, his tone modest. I snorted back a laugh, then nodded at Painter to follow me out of the room.</p><p>\u201cThat was a new level of twisted shit, little bro,\u201d I said quietly as we walked down the hall together toward London\u2019s room. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t appreciate it, but what the fuck?\u201d</p><p>Painter shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cIf Jessica dies, Melanie will cry.\u201d</p><p>I studied him, wondering if I wanted to go there. Nope, I really didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Go let the others know we\u2019re riding to Portland. Deke called in a favor, so we\u2019ll be hopping a cargo flight south from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout time we took the war to them,\u201d Painter replied, that feral gleam in his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited. There\u2019ll be bodies before this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t live forever. You decide what you\u2019re doing with London yet?\u201d</p><p>I stopped in front of her door, frowning thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cNo goddamn idea,\u201d I said. \u201cTakin\u2019 her to Portland with us. We\u2019ll make a decision there. She might be useful to us down south\u2014don\u2019t like the idea of leaving her alone here. Someone might go vigilante on her ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good, prez,\u201d he said, then started toward the stairs. I grasped the bolt, sliding it open, then reached for the handle to open the door, wondering what exactly the fuck I was going to do about London.</p><p>Heather, if you\u2019re actually out there somewhere, I could sure use your advice right about now.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, which shouldn\u2019t have surprised me, seein\u2019 as she was a figment of my imagination. Still, bitch always chimed in fast enough when it wasn\u2019t convenient for me. Probably sittin\u2019 up in heaven right now, drinkin\u2019 a beer and laughing her ass off.</p><p>Fuckin\u2019 women.</p><p>LONDON</p><p>By the time Reese came back, I\u2019d started shivering so hard my muscles and joints ached from the strain. My toes and fingers had gone numb, and while freezing to death wasn\u2019t exactly a danger, this borderline hypothermia shit bit the big one.</p><p>Then I heard footsteps outside the door, and the low murmur of voices. The bolt slid back with a thud and the door opened. Light from the hallway blinded me at first, and I blinked rapidly at the shadowy outline of what had to be Reese.</p><p>I supposed I should be scared of him, but I was just way too cold.</p><p>\u201cH-hey,\u201d I said, the word unsteady. \u201cA-a-any word on J-Jess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, and I started laughing because the question was so ridiculously stupid.</p><p>\u201cW-w-why don\u2019t we just l-list what\u2019s right?\u201d I asked, too tired and cold to think straight. He shut the door and came toward me, sitting down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cShit, you\u2019re freezing,\u201d he muttered, pulling back the blankets. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Within seconds, he\u2019d wrapped me up in the blanket and was carrying me out of the room, yelling at Painter to go find some keys or something. He hauled me down the corridor and up three flights of stairs before turning down the same long hallway we\u2019d visited when I\u2019d first come looking for Jessica.</p><p>Painter was ahead of us, opening up one of the rooms, and then Reese carried me in and set me on my feet. He fumbled for a minute to unlock the handcuffs, then stripped off my wet clothing with smooth efficiency. He led me to a tiny bathroom, switching on the shower and waiting until steam started rising before putting me under the hot spray.</p><p>Amazing.</p><p>The water flooded over me, and after a few minutes my shivers died down. Reese stood watching me, his face pensive, until the water started to cool. I reached over and twisted the faucet closed.</p><p>\u201cYou have a towel?\u201d I asked, feeling self-conscious. Sure, he\u2019d seen me naked ... but that was before. He stepped out of the bathroom, returning seconds later to hold a towel out to me wordlessly. I dried off quickly, then wrapped it around me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all bruised up,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrugged. \u201cShit happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon over to the bed. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this like the last \u2018talk\u2019 we had?\u201d I asked, my voice rasping\u2014probably from all the screaming I\u2019d done. \u201cI know you\u2019re in charge, but I\u2019m still kind of sore down below. Not sure I can handle more talking quite yet.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, eyes serious. I walked over to him as he sat on the bed and learned back against the wall. He caught my hand and tugged me down until I settled between his legs, my back to his stomach. His arms came around me and I let myself relax into his heat and strength, wishing things had been different.</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d I asked him finally, hating to break the strange sense of peace that had settled between us. \u201cI realize you have no reason to believe me, but I\u2019m sorry for what I did, Reese. Really sorry, and not just because it backfired on me. I know it was wrong and stupid and you\u2019ll never trust me again ... but if there\u2019s a way for me to help you fight, I want to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFight? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. These people\u2014these drug dealers\u2014they\u2019re out to hurt you, and probably a whole lot of other people, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a cartel. Big one, out of Mexico. Control the West Coast trade, up through northern Cali. Movin\u2019 upward now into Oregon and southern Idaho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to stop them. I don\u2019t care what it takes,\u201d I murmured, burrowing deeper into his embrace. My neck still hurt from the tiny cut he\u2019d given me, but considering I\u2019d tried to shoot him, I\u2019d gotten off easy. At least so far. I still didn\u2019t know what they planned to do with me, but for the moment I chose not to think about the future.</p> <p>Sounds crazy, but even now I felt safe when he held me.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jess?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they ever planned to let her go,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to die unless someone stops them. Kills them. They\u2019re evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish you weren\u2019t right,\u201d he replied, and I felt his chin come to rest on top of my head. \u201cCartel bastards think I\u2019m dead now. Think you shot me, then killed yourself. They still aren\u2019t gonna let her go, even though we gave them what they wanted.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I\u2019d suspected, but hearing Reese lay it all out felt like a punch to the gut. I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cHow did you convince them we\u2019re dead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeputy Dick told them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he lie to them? Isn\u2019t that dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe asked him very nicely.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I didn\u2019t think Reese was using the word \u201cnicely\u201d in the traditional sense. Didn\u2019t sound promising for Nate\u2019s future prospects. I considered the situation\u2014did it bother me that the Reapers had obviously done something terrifying and horrible to make him lie?</p><p>No. It really didn\u2019t. Did that make me a bad person?</p><p>I decided I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cHe used Jess, then he sent her down to those people knowing what they are,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cAnd he tried to turn me into a murderer. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s allowed under the circumstances, but I\u2019d like to see him before you kill him. Talk to him. I have things to say, and I\u2019d like to see his face when he realizes he lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming we had him\u2014and I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 we do\u2014why would we let you witness something that could be used against us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to be an accomplice,\u201d I told him, the words spilling out of me with sudden force. \u201cI want to make Nate pay, and I want to shut those fuckers down. I know you\u2019re planning to do something big. I can sense it\u2014all those meetings? People coming in from all over, and extra security? There\u2019s something happening and I\u2019m in the middle of it now. I messed everything up with you, and I know you can\u2019t trust me ... But I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help. Anything. I figure there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t survive this situation and I\u2019m coming to peace with that\u2014but I really want to make Nate pay before I go, Reese. I want to look him in the eye and watch him suffer. Then I want to shoot him.\u201d</p><p>The thought made me smile, and I wondered how the hell I\u2019d gone from cleaning lady to bloodthirsty killer. Okay, so I wasn\u2019t a very competent killer, but the sentiment was there ...</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered, pulling me into him tighter. \u201cWhen did you turn so hard-core?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I realized my girl is dying or already dead\u201d\u2014the words made me choke, but I forced myself to push past them\u2014\u201cand that Nate Evans is the reason. I had a good life before I met him. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but I had a home and a family, and he took them away from me. Fuck him, Reese. He should have to pay for what he did.\u201d</p><p>I felt Reese\u2019s lips touch the top of my head as I bit back tears. I didn\u2019t want to cry or look weak or beg for mercy\u2014I\u2019d made my bed ... Now I had to own up to my choices.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cSorry for all of it. For trying to shoot you. For not trusting you. You didn\u2019t deserve any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle late for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Portland in a couple of hours,\u201d Reese said softly. \u201cThen we\u2019re heading down to California to make a strategic strike at the cartel leadership. Got our targets already, been scoping \u2019em out for a long time now. I\u2019m going to try and find Jessica while I\u2019m down there.\u201d</p><p>I felt a sudden surge of hope, then bit it back. I couldn\u2019t afford hope.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, unless you remembered something you haven\u2019t told us already?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, thinking hard.</p><p>\u201cI told you everything,\u201d I said. \u201cI wish I knew more. Will you let me see Nate?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a minute, and then he sighed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But you can\u2019t shoot him. We might still need his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s on a need-to-know basis. Somethin\u2019 you should learn about the club\u2014we don\u2019t like it when people ask too many questions. We\u2019ll be leaving soon, and you\u2019re coming with us. Marie is bringing over some shit for you to wear.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know what I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she won\u2019t. We don\u2019t need the girls all worked up about your situation, so keep your mouth shut if you happen to see one of them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrusting me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you for shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou trust me enough to come to Portland with you.

I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s dangerous. You can even use me for bait, if you think it\u2019ll work. I just want the chance to fight back, for Jessica and for me.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled hard. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later I was dressed in biker babe clothing just a little too small for my generous curves. Marie and I were the same height, but my chest was a little more ... substantial. At least I was warm and dry. They\u2019d even found me a leather jacket somewhere, which was important because apparently I\u2019d be riding to Portland on the back of Reese\u2019s bike. This surprised me\u2014I\u2019d assumed he wouldn\u2019t want me around, or that his brothers wouldn\u2019t tolerate me.</p><p>Apparently the politics of biker betrayal were more complicated than I realized.</p><p>People had started gathering for the trip when Reese led me down the stairs and into the basement for a second time that night. I followed him down the hallway until we reached the same nasty, scary room where they\u2019d hung me from the ceiling just a few hours earlier.</p><p>Things were moving so fast I could hardly keep up.</p> <p>Reese pushed the door open, and I walked in to find Nate sitting in a battered metal chair, his arms and legs tied down tight. A dirty bandanna had been used to gag his mouth. Dried blood crusted his face and hair. It looked to me like one of his hands had been smashed with a mallet.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a happy camper.</p><p>The fire I felt died a little, because imagining Nate in pain and seeing him like this were two very different things. I didn\u2019t feel sorry for him, exactly. Just sort of creeped out. I was determined, though. I wanted to personally make him pay and this was my big opportunity.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to talk to him?\u201d Bolt asked, and I glanced over to see he\u2019d been waiting for us in the room. I nodded hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cNate, are you awake?\u201d I asked. My former boyfriend\u2019s eyes flickered open, catching on my face.</p><p>\u201cYou want the gag off?\u201d Reese asked, his hand at the small of my back. I still had no idea what the club had planned for me in the next twenty-four hours, but at least they hadn\u2019t beaten the shit out of me like this. Good thing, too. I had too much work to do before they killed me. Jessica needed saving and I wanted revenge, too. After that? Well, I\u2019d probably be dead then, so I guess I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to hear anything he has to say,\u201d I answered. Then I took a deep breath, steeling myself. \u201cNate, I came down here because I want you to know I see exactly who and what you are. You\u2019re a pathetic, evil little man, and I hope they kill you. I already asked Reese if I could shoot you and he said no. I found this very disappointing.\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s eyes widened and I smiled, understanding for the first time in my life how one person could enjoy hurting another, because for better or worse this felt kind of good.</p> <p>Empowering.</p><p>I stepped closer, leaning down to examine his smashed hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never going to heal up right,\u201d I said softly, then looked up at his face. One of his eyes was swollen nearly shut, and it took everything I had not to poke it, just to see him flinch. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been trying to decide what I should do to make you pay ... I could hit you, or poke you, or maybe just take those broken fingers of yours and start twisting them around for fun. Maybe cut them off? That\u2019s what your friends did to Jessica.\u201d</p><p>He grunted frantically and I spat in his face, which was vaguely satisfying, but nowhere near enough. I stood up, glancing around the room. In the corner was a pile of wood scraps, including a chunk of two-by-four about the length of a bat. Perfect. I walked over and grabbed it, hefting it experimentally. Felt good in my hand.</p><p>Gage gave a low, warning whistle.</p><p>\u201cWe need him alive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd able to talk.\u201d</p><p>I nodded thoughtfully, then walked back toward Nate, studying his frame. Drawing back the wood, I swung it at his right knee with everything I had. It hit with a crunch and he screamed through the gag. I felt a little sick to my stomach, but forced myself to speak.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for using Jessica, and sending her down to California.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I hit him again, this time on the other knee. He gave another piercing screech, then started a low, steady keening in pain.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for fucking things up with me and Reese.\u201d</p><p>I paused to consider the situation. I wanted to hit him again. I\u2019d planned one blow for each thing he\u2019d done to ruin my life, which meant I still owed him for lying to me and for blowing up my house. Instead I dropped the two-by-four, because no matter how much the man deserved to suffer, a part of me realized I was sinking to his level.</p><p>Turning toward Reese, I spoke. \u201cI\u2019m good. Thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cSure? You might not have another chance.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s like a vicious dog,\u201d I told him softly, realizing it was true. \u201cNo point in torturing a dog, even one that\u2019s a killer. Best to just shoot it in the head and dump the body.\u201d</p><p>Nate made another noise and I heard the chair scrape against the concrete floor. Ignoring him, I focused on Reese, holding those ice-blue eyes of his steadily, savoring the sight of the little wrinkles at the corners as he gave me a strange little smile. In the background, I was vaguely aware that Gage watched us curiously. It didn\u2019t matter. Nothing mattered anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Reese asked me quietly. I nodded. Whatever happened next, I wasn\u2019t lying or playing games. I\u2019d made my decision and it filled me with a weird sense of peace.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>By the time we hit Portland, I was exhausted but still absolutely determined to do whatever I could to help the club\u2014not only were they my best hope for saving Jessica, they were also my best shot at some sort of revenge for what those cartel fuckers had done to my life.</p><p>I needed sleep first, though. In a big way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The short rides I\u2019d taken with Reese hadn\u2019t come close to preparing me for this. My ass had started to hurt, growing slowly worse until finally it went numb. Even if I hadn\u2019t been sleep-deprived the trip would\u2019ve killed me. Just to make things more pleasant, not one of the fifteen men riding with us would talk to me, or even look me in the eye.</p><p>Good times.</p><p>When we finally pulled down a narrow alley into a residential neighborhood, I didn\u2019t quite register that the ride was over. We stopped in front of a great big old carriage house with huge wooden sliding doors on the back. They opened slowly and the men rolled their bikes in, leaving just enough room on one side for the battered gray cargo van that had trailed us from Coeur d\u2019Alene. They had a prospect driving it, but I had no idea what was in the back.</p><p>No way I\u2019d be asking, either.</p> <p>I\u2019d learned my lesson about questions.</p><p>The heavy doors slid shut behind us, blocking out the light and sound. Some seriously solid walls in this place. As my vision adjusted, I looked around in the gloom to find Hunter, Em\u2019s boyfriend, watching the activities with a proprietary air.</p><p>His gaze caught on me standing next to Reese, and he strolled over to join us.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the story there, Pic?\u201d he asked quietly, ignoring me. \u201cNot a trip for women.\u201d</p><p>Reese shook his head, face grim.</p> <p>\u201cWe had an unpleasant incident yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it later, but the quick and dirty is she tried to kill me. Cartel was behind it.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s face hardened.</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were all hopin\u2019 it would work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit happens,\u201d Pic said. \u201cFuckers have her cousin\u2014she did it to save the kid\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like an interesting story,\u201d Hunter said, his jaw tightening. \u201cSo she\u2019s a prisoner?\u201d</p><p>Reese nodded sharply.</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t decided what to do with her yet, but figure the Portland prospects can babysit her just as easy as the Coeur d\u2019Alene ones. Didn\u2019t want to leave her behind. We haven\u2019t had time to make any decisions, you know how that goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a strong room we can put her in,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need that for someone else.\u201d</p><p>That caught my attention, and I glanced back at the van. Had they hauled Nate across the state, too?</p><p>\u201cHow about the storage room upstairs?\u201d Hunter asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not as secure, but the window\u2019s high enough she won\u2019t be able to climb out and she\u2019ll have to pass through the chapel to leave the building. Should be safe enough for the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Reese answered. He gave me a nudge and I followed Hunter upstairs through a big, open space with a broad wooden table and then down a hallway to the storage room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch anything,\u201d he told me, his voice grim. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t wanna learn what happens if you break something. And if you find something in here you can use as a weapon, don\u2019t. This is my place, and I don\u2019t give a damn how much Pic likes fuckin\u2019 you. You pull any shit, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, studying the room after he closed the door behind me. Dusty boxes lined three of the four walls. The last wall had a garage sale couch pushed up against it, and above the couch was an old leaded-glass window. I climbed onto the cushions and looked out to find a fenced backyard hidden behind the carriage house. The house attached to the yard was two stories, with a high porch off the back. It looked to have been built about a hundred years ago\u2014obviously one of those not-quite-Victorians littering the older neighborhoods in Portland.</p> <p>Must be Hunter and Em\u2019s place, I realized. They probably lived in the house while his club used the carriage house out back as a base of operations. Not a bad setup, all things considered.</p><p>I could see a barbecue pit in the center of the grass, with several canvas folding chairs circling it. There wasn\u2019t much open space, though. The yard was essentially a jungle\u2014just a mass of overgrown shrubs surrounded by a circle of mature trees providing complete privacy, despite the fact that I knew there had to be buildings on either side of us. Nobody would be able to see my window, that was for sure.</p><p>Good thing I wasn\u2019t trying to catch any attention, or escape.</p><p>I wondered how long I\u2019d be stuck here. Considering I hadn\u2019t really slept in nearly twenty-four hours, being locked up long enough for a nap sounded pretty good. I flopped down on the couch and closed my eyes.</p><p>Bliss.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019d been out when the sound of a car back-firing woke me. I took a minute to orient myself, rubbing the sleep out of my eyes and wiping off what felt suspiciously like a trail of drool.</p><p>Sexy.</p><p>The light had changed\u2014now it streamed through the window much more brightly. I rose to my knees and looked down through the leaded glass to find Em sunning herself on a white blanket in the center of the lawn. She wore a bright red bikini that showed off a very small, very cute baby bump, and one arm had been thrown over her eyes.</p><p>The girl was obviously sound asleep. Early pregnancy. I hadn\u2019t had children myself, but I\u2019d seen enough of my friends go through it to learn that sometimes naps weren\u2019t optional. Such a pretty girl.</p><p>God, I hoped I got my own pretty girl back, safe and sound.</p><p>Reese was a lucky man, because while I hadn\u2019t met his other daughter yet, Em was a treasure for sure. He\u2019d done a great job with her despite losing his wife so tragically. As I watched, Em shifted restlessly and rolled to the side, dropping her arm down to clutch her stomach. Her face twisted, but she didn\u2019t seem to wake up.</p><p>Oh, fuck.</p><p>Something was very, very wrong here ...</p><p>Bright red blood covered the blanket where she\u2019d been lying\u2014blood that seemed to be coming from between her legs. She must not be asleep, but unconscious. Blood smeared the backs of her thighs. Adrenaline hit, and I ran for the door, jerking at the knob desperately. Nothing. I pounded on it, yelling for someone to come and get me.</p><p>Nobody responded.</p><p>The walls were old and thick, built by hand to last.</p><p>ShitShitShitShitShit! Em might be dying out there, and obviously nobody could see it but me. I had to do something.</p><p>Running back to the window, I climbed up onto the couch and peered through the glass, trying to figure out how to get down to her. Nothing really jumped out at me, but maybe I\u2019d be able to figure something out if I broke out the glass. I found an old, broken stool propped against a pile of boxes and grabbed it, shoving the legs through the glass. It shattered easily enough, and after three more blows I managed to knock the leading out, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pulling off my leather jacket, I laid it down across the windowsill to protect my hands from glass shards, then leaned out to take a good look around. In the movie version of my life, this was where I\u2019d find a convenient tree branch, or maybe an old trellis to serve as a ladder.</p><p>Nada.</p><p>I did see a great big shrub right below the window, though. Maybe if I climbed out I could lower myself to shorten the fall, then jump into the bushes to cushion myself? A quick glance at Em showed the pool of blood spreading slowly but steadily.</p><p>Shrubbery it was, then.</p> <p>I climbed out and caught the sill with my hands. That\u2019s when the first thing went wrong, because instead of lowering myself down carefully, I fell off the ledge with a thump. The second thing to go wrong was the shrub itself, which had seemed rather lush and cushiony from the window.</p><p>Not so much.</p><p>I\u2019d fallen into a forest of pointy branches, cutting through me like a thousand tiny, sharpened stakes. My right arm screamed in agony, and I looked down to see a quarter inch stick passing right through the fleshy part of my forearm. My vision blackened, and I took a couple of deep breaths, willing myself to hold it together.</p><p>Em needed me.</p><p>Painfully, I pulled my arm off the stick, ignoring the gush of blood as I shoved my way out of the bushes. My entire body was covered in smaller scratches and cuts, and I felt something warm and wet trickling down my face. At least nothing seemed to be broken.</p> <p>I ran across the yard toward Reese\u2019s bleeding daughter, dropping to my knees to check her pulse. There, but very weak. Fuck. I saw a phone lying in the grass next to a bottle of water. A real phone, the kind that\u2019s connected to a landline. Thank God for that, because I didn\u2019t have an address to give them.</p><p>I grabbed it and dialed 911 frantically, praying it wasn\u2019t too late.</p><p>REESE</p><p>\u201cBurke will meet us in Cali,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThey went down to scope out targets already. Shade and his boys will be flying in this evening, and the Silver Bastards are headed south, too. Between them and our local allies, we should have close to three hundred men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s scary is not even that many guys are enough to stand up to the cartel head-on,\u201d Horse grunted.</p><p>\u201cTheir soldiers are disposable,\u201d I said. \u201cOurs aren\u2019t. We know what we\u2019re doin\u2019 and we can trust each other. Combine that with the fact that we aren\u2019t giving \u2019em the chance to meet us head-on, I think it\u2019ll be enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re wheels up just after ten tonight,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cargo plane, and things are all smoothed out with the shipping company. The pilot\u2019s a friend of mine and he\u2019s solid. When we land, we\u2019ll have brothers there to meet us and we\u2019ll bring our own hardware. Sound good to everyone?\u201d</p><p>The room filled with grunts and nods of approval.</p><p>\u201cThanks for settin\u2019 all of this up,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cNo prob,\u201d Hunter replied, glancing toward the man sitting next to him, who rolled his eyes. \u201cI made Skid do most of the work, anyway. I suppose now it\u2019s time to talk about your woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d I admitted. \u201cNot sure what to do. Long story short, she got manipulated by the cartel. Nate Evans may or may not have planned to set her up, but when the opportunity showed itself, he took it. Guess he was fuckin\u2019 her cousin\u2014the one who lived with her\u2014and probably filling her head with all kinds of bullshit. Then he gave her money to run off down south, where the kid\u2019s mom happens to be shacked up with Gerardo Medina.\u201d</p><p>Hunter gave a low whistle.</p><p>\u201cDamn, bitch aims high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d I agreed. \u201cNow he\u2019s livin\u2019 the high life while his wife stays tucked away in Mexico. Anyway, when Jess went down, Medina took her and used her to control London. Guess they cut off the girl\u2019s finger while she watched, and London lost it. We knew somethin\u2019 was up, so we put a man on her, and some cameras out at my place. Then shit escalated and Puck found a loaded gun in her purse. He took her ammo and gave me a heads-up. We waited until she made her move before we took her down. Wanted to see how far she\u2019d go.\u201d</p> <p>Silence filled the room.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason she\u2019s still alive?\u201d Hunter finally asked.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Gage said, his voice thoughtful. \u201cShe hates that fucker Evans more than we do, which is sayin\u2019 somethin\u2019. Went after him with a two-by-four. Says she wants to help us take down the cartel, and she\u2019s definitely got the motivation. We\u2019re the only shot she has to save the kid at this point.\u201d</p><p>Hunter smirked at me, and I saw the mocking laughter in his eyes. He knew I\u2019d fallen for her, I knew I\u2019d fallen for her, and now I had to kill her or look weak in the eyes of the Devil\u2019s Jacks.</p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>The wail of sirens filled the air, and I cocked my head. The walls in here were solid as fuck\u2014hearing them so loud meant they had to be close. Cops? Shit. We had two goddamned prisoners in this barn, and about a hundred guns of one kind or another.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>Puck burst into the room, and for once he wasn\u2019t calm and collected.</p><p>\u201cYou guys gotta get down here, fast,\u201d he said. \u201cPic, your daughter\u2019s in the backyard and I think she\u2019s bleedin\u2019 out. London\u2019s with her, guess she called the ambulance. We got EMTs and firefighters all over the place.\u201d</p><p>Hunter almost knocked me over, he was out of the room so fast. I was on his heels, tearing down the stairs and out into the backyard.</p><p>Oh, shit, Heather murmured in my head. That\u2019s our baby ...</p><p>What I saw nearly killed me.</p><p>It\u2019s probably no surprise to hear I\u2019ve ended more than one person\u2019s life\u2014I had a pretty good idea what it looked like when someone lost too much blood to live. That much blood and more coated Em\u2019s lower body, and the blanket she\u2019d been lying on was soaked with it, too.</p><p>Hunter stood over her\u2014frozen\u2014as two EMTs worked frantically.</p><p>London stood to the side, her eyes full of despair. A distant part of me noted that she was covered in blood, too. It ran down her head and into her face. It even dripped off her arms\u2014looked like her clothes had been ... shredded?</p><p>Fucked-up shit, and my baby girl was in the middle of it.</p><p>For an instant I was almost thankful Heather was dead, because if she was still here, she\u2019d tear the skin right off my body for letting this happen. Whatever the hell this was. Looked like the blood was comin\u2019 from between Em\u2019s legs, and that was a bad fuckin\u2019 sign for my grandbaby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m so goddamned sorry, Heather.</p><p>Hunter turned on London, grabbing her arms and shaking her violently.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you do to her? I\u2019ll fucking kill you for this, bitch!\u201d</p><p>Skid, Gage, and Horse leapt into action, pulling him off and dragging him halfway across the lawn before the cop had time to do much more than blink.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked one of the EMTs, my stomach sinking. I\u2019d never dreamed London could be a threat to Em\u2014was she behind this? Fuck. What the hell had I done, bringing her here?</p><p>\u201cLooks like a miscarriage,\u201d the man said, catching my eyes. \u201cYou a family member?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to follow us to the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is serious\u2014she\u2019s lost a lot of blood. I don\u2019t know what the hell\u2019s going on around here, but time to cut the drama because your kid needs you. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p> <p>Christ. I hated this helpless feeling. It took forever for them to load Em\u2014looked like she was dying, and there wasn\u2019t a fuckin\u2019 thing I could do to help. Out of the corner of my eye I saw one of the firefighters checking out London. She didn\u2019t look so good, either. I glanced up at the carriage house, finding the remains of the second-story window. She\u2019d obviously smashed it out and then dropped down into the bushes. There were broken leaves and sticks everywhere.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cThat woman saved your daughter\u2019s life,\u201d the cop said, coming to stand next to me. He obviously recognized my colors, but he didn\u2019t seem intimidated. \u201cShe jumped out the window and called nine one one. You wanna explain to me why someone would have to break out of a second-story room to get help, instead of using the stairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d I said. They were loading Em into the ambulance. Shit. I needed to follow them.</p><p>\u201cTake care of your kid,\u201d the cop said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the other victim. I\u2019ll make sure she gets to the hospital and stays safe.\u201d</p><p>His words caught me, and I looked at him\u2014really looked at him\u2014for the first time. He saw right through us, I realized. He knew London was a prisoner, and he was going to get her out of here. Of course, I had thirty brothers with me, and they\u2019d fight to hold her if I asked them to ... but that was a losing battle. This guy might be the only cop, but there were at least six firefighters. We tried to pull any shit, whole fuckin\u2019 city would come down on us. The cop smiled, because he knew he had me. Ignoring him, I strode toward the carriage house, jerking my chin for Skid to join me.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re takin\u2019 London to the hospital,\u201d I said in a low voice. \u201cCop knows it\u2019s not right, he\u2019s gonna talk to her. I need the brothers and the evidence out of here before that happens, got me? Just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d he said, eyes narrowing. \u201cFuck. You should\u2019ve taken care of this before you left home\u2014shut her mouth so she\u2019d never talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019d done that, Em would be dead right now,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget who called nine one one. London said she wanted to help us and she\u2019s got good reasons to keep her word. Those cops won\u2019t be able to get her cousin out. We\u2019re her only hope, so let\u2019s just wait and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>LONDON</p><p>\u201cReese asked me to find a box for him,\u201d I told the cop, my words deliberate and careful. \u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend. We rode over from Coeur d\u2019Alene last night to visit his daughter. I went up to the storage room and started looking around\u2014then I accidentally bumped the door and it swung shut, locking me in. That\u2019s when I saw Em outside in the backyard, and after nobody heard me shouting, I broke out the window and jumped down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was in the box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotorcycle parts. I never found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s your boyfriend, why isn\u2019t he here to make sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p> <p>I sighed, because now he was just being stupid on purpose.</p><p>\u201cBecause his daughter was bleeding out the last time I saw her, and all I\u2019ve got are a few scratches. I think she takes priority over me for now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The cop stared at me without speaking. We\u2019d been through this whole story three times now. Each time he made it clear he didn\u2019t believe I was telling the truth. Each time I made it clear I didn\u2019t care what he believed.</p><p>In some ways I had to appreciate what he was trying to do\u2014all too many police officers turned a blind eye to abuse, which was obviously what he thought was happening here. He was trying to save my life, and if staying alive were my top priority I\u2019d be all over that.</p><p>But rescuing Jessica was my top priority, followed closely by killing the men who\u2019d hurt her. Survival was a distant third.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to change your story, are you?\u201d he asked, his voice tired.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a story,\u201d I replied softly. \u201cIt\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my card,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m putting my personal cell number on the back. Call me if you decide to talk, or you need help. We both know something\u2019s wrong here, and sooner or later it\u2019ll come crashing down around you. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your concern, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and walked away, leaving me alone in the small private room they\u2019d given us. There were lots of tissue boxes placed in strategic spots\u2014I had a feeling this was one of those places they put families right before they told them someone had died. I hoped very much that Reese wasn\u2019t sitting in another room just like this somewhere else in the hospital, mourning his daughter. I needed to find him, or at the very least find someone who could tell me what the hell was going on with Em.</p><p>Standing up hurt, although none of my bruises or cuts were serious. They\u2019d given me a couple of stitches on my forehead, disinfected me, and called it good. I was supposed to keep a close eye on the puncture wound in particular, and see a doctor asap if there were any signs of infection, blah blah blah.</p><p>I grabbed the bag holding the remains of my clothing and clutched it to my chest. (Although I wasn\u2019t sure why they\u2019d bothered to give them back to me, because I\u2019d never be able to wear them again. At least the scrubs they\u2019d given me were comfortable.) I\u2019d already been discharged from the ER, so I was able to just walk right out into the waiting room. No sign of Reese, but I spotted Painter. His expression was grim. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked over to him, scared of whatever news had put that look on his face.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d I asked, not bothering to say hello.</p><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d he said, standing up and facing me. \u201cI guess the baby wasn\u2019t right. They called it an octorpic pregnancy, or some such shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEctopic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that sounds right. The baby wasn\u2019t in the right place. Instead of growing in her womb, it was in one of the tubes to her ovary, and then it busted the whole thing open. That\u2019s what started all the bleeding. They\u2019ve got her in surgery right now, but she\u2019s lost a fuckload of blood, London. They said she might die. The baby never had a shot.\u201d</p><p>I swayed, and he caught me, still holding my eyes.</p><p>\u201cReese and Gage put me here to watch for you,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cGage said you were talking to the cops.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, trying to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that,\u201d I told him quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t give them any information. I\u2019m not trying to get away from the MC, Painter. I want to go to California and save Jessica, and the only way that can happen is if I stick with the club. But right now I need to find Reese. He must be terrified.\u201d</p> <p>Painter nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure he is, though he\u2019d never cop to it. I can take you up there ... But I need to tell you something first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you saved Em, and you didn\u2019t talk to the cops? That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re safe with us, and Pic isn\u2019t necessarily the one who\u2019ll make that call. You need to understand what you\u2019re doing here, London. If you go upstairs and find Pic, there\u2019s still a chance the club won\u2019t forgive you. Even if they do, that trip to Cali might be one way\u2014this isn\u2019t a game. Give me the word and I\u2019ll go take a piss, let you walk right out that door. Got about two hundred bucks on me and it\u2019s yours. That\u2019s the best I can do.\u201d</p><p>I reached my hands up and cupped his face, smiling at him sadly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the most beautiful things anyone\u2019s ever offered me,\u201d I said softly. \u201cBut I need to go find Reese, and then I need to go to California to find my girl. Whatever happens, happens, and I\u2019m okay with it. Now where do I need to go\u2014can you show me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll point you in the right direction, but I shouldn\u2019t go in with you,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter doesn\u2019t need to be seein\u2019 my face right now. We got history, me and Em. I\u2019ve come to terms, but he and I aren\u2019t exactly friends. Don\u2019t wanna stress him out more than I have to.\u201d</p><p>Pieces fell together in my head, and I patted his arm, startled at how different he seemed from the young man I\u2019d met just weeks ago. Painter put up a hell of a front, apparently.</p><p>Then again, so did Reese.</p><p>He escorted me as far as the corridor outside the surgical waiting area. I walked in, spotting Reese and Hunter immediately. Waiting with them were Horse, Ruger, and Bam Bam. There was also a young man wearing Devil\u2019s Jacks colors I didn\u2019t recognize. He was covered in tattoos and looked vaguely hipsterish with his skinny jeans.</p><p>Wow, if Portlanders could do that to a biker, they could turn anyone into a hipster.</p><p>Between him and Hunter sat a young woman whose face was streaked with tears and heavy black mascara. She looked like something out of a horror movie, but at least she showed some emotion. Hunter\u2019s face was completely blank. So was Reese\u2019s. I started toward them, and then stopped\u2014across the room sat the same police officer who\u2019d just been talking to me. Damn, but he was persistent.</p> <p>He watched Em\u2019s little support group closely, eyes speculative.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>We didn\u2019t need this right now. Maybe a little show would get him off our asses? I started walking toward Reese again, hoping like hell he\u2019d pick up on what I was doing and not blow it. When I got close enough, I flicked my eyes toward the cop, then set myself down in his lap like I had every right to be there. I wrapped my arms tight around his neck and whispered in his ear.</p><p>\u201cThat cop over there is trying to save me. I told him you\u2019re my boyfriend, and that I just got stuck in the storeroom looking for something you needed, so treat me like you don\u2019t want to strangle me and maybe he\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around me hard, and I let myself pretend for a moment that I\u2019d spoken the truth. That he actually was still mine, and that he would be relieved to find me safe.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he murmured. \u201cOne less thing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI understand that. But I\u2019m on your side, Reese. I screwed up and now I\u2019m trying to fix it. I don\u2019t expect you to forgive me, or that things will ever be like they were before, but I won\u2019t betray you again.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then loosened his grasp. Apparently I wasn\u2019t the only one aware of our audience, because none of the others showed the slightest hint of reaction to our little reunion. Hunter rose to his feet when Reese let me go, and walked over to us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, his voice strained. \u201cThey tell me she\u2019d be dead already if you hadn\u2019t saved her. I shouldn\u2019t have jumped on you like that, London. Guess I just lost it.\u201d</p><p>God, he looked so young and scared.</p><p>I put a hand on his arm, offering him a little squeeze. Easy to forget some of these bikers were essentially still kids, despite how tough they acted. This boy was scared shitless because he\u2019d lost his baby, and he might be losing his girlfriend soon, too.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I understood what was happening and didn\u2019t take it personally.\u201d</p><p>The girl who\u2019d been sitting next to him joined us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kelsey,\u201d she said, looking me over. Her face was tight and strained, and her entire body radiated leashed tension. \u201cI\u2019m this asshole\u2019s sister, which makes Em my sister, too. Thanks for what you did. That took balls.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope they can help her.\u201d</p><p>As if summoned by my voice, a doctor stepped into the waiting room and we all looked up, trying to read his expression.</p><p>\u201cYou the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Reese said, standing to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on with my girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s through surgery and it went well, all things considered. You already know she lost a lot of blood. We transfused her in the ER and again on the table, and I think we turned it around. Unfortunately there\u2019s no way the fetus can survive in an ectopic pregnancy like this one. Wouldn\u2019t matter how early we caught it and there\u2019s nothing she could\u2019ve done to prevent it. Sometimes it just happens.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you see if it was a boy or a girl?\u201d Hunter asked, his voice anguished.</p><p>\u201cIt was a girl,\u201d he replied. \u201cShe was about fourteen weeks old. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. We\u2019re very lucky to have saved the mother\u2014it was close, maybe a matter of minutes that made the difference. The next few hours will be critical, but I\u2019m hopeful she\u2019ll make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>Horse threw his arm around me and squeezed me tight.</p><p>\u201cThanks for rescuing our Emmy girl,\u201d he said softly. Ruger nodded at me, and I wasn\u2019t sure what to do or say. Reese seemed lost in his own world and Hunter\u2019s eyes had turned red.</p> <p>\u201cHow soon until we can visit her?\u201d Kelsey demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in recovery right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a while before she\u2019s ready for company, and I\u2019d like her to get as much rest as she can. Immediate family only, and the rest of you can visit tomorrow or the day after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here tonight,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cUnless that\u2019s a problem?\u201d</p><p>The doctor smiled, although the expression didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe waiting room is all yours,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d</p> <p>He turned and walked out, his mind obviously already on the next patient.</p><p>\u201cSo now what?\u201d Ruger asked slowly. \u201cThis is fucked, but we got three hundred brothers travelin\u2019 down to Cali for a major offensive. We gotta make a plan, because we can\u2019t just leave them hanging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out,\u201d Hunter said bluntly. He gave his friend a quick glance. \u201cSkid can step up and take over for me. I already told Burke what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Reese, wondering if he\u2019d say the same thing. Nobody could blame him if he decided not to go to California\u2014but there was no way in hell I\u2019d get a chance to save Jessica without him there. He looked at me and sighed, reaching up to rub the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said to Hunter. \u201cYou take care of my girl for me, and I\u2019ll make sure we got your club\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>Hunter seemed surprised, and I saw Ruger and Horse exchange a glance I couldn\u2019t interpret.</p> <p>\u201cAppreciate that,\u201d Hunter said, turning toward Skid. \u201cYou need anything more from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head back to the house,\u201d Reese said slowly, although I could see it was killing him to leave Em. \u201cCall me when she wakes up? I\u2019ll come back and see her before we take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cAnd Pic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of her. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna hold you to that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p> <p>The plane touched down at eleven that night.</p><p>I\u2019d fallen asleep on top of Reese, which was comfortable and wonderful and probably more than I deserved, but I figured I\u2019d take advantage while I could. He seemed to want me with him, and I even felt a slight stirring of hope at one point. Maybe I hadn\u2019t killed everything between us when I pulled that trigger?</p><p>Then I wrestled my head out of my ass, because I couldn\u2019t afford to let hope distract me.</p><p>Still, there was a noticeable change in attitude toward me after we got back from the hospital. Nobody had been at Em and Hunter\u2019s place initially\u2014apparently they\u2019d cleared out in anticipation of a police raid.</p><p>A raid they\u2019d expected because of me.</p><p>The combination of my silence and the fact that I\u2019d saved Em had gone a long way toward rebuilding the club\u2019s goodwill, and nobody bitched when Reese announced I\u2019d be coming with. That meant everything, because if they found Jessica, I needed to be there for her. If they didn\u2019t, I had other, less pleasant work ahead of me.</p><p>Now it was one a.m. and I was sitting in the dark. Waiting. We\u2019d gone to a warehouse in the middle of bumfuck San Diego, which was apparently very similar to regular San Diego, but with more shootings and gang activity. It\u2019d taken quite a bit to convince Reese to let me join them for the actual attack\u2014I think he\u2019d planned for me to hang with the women at someone\u2019s clubhouse or something.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>We\u2019d compromised when I swore to stay outside in one of the vehicles (an anonymous-looking cargo van\u2014something I was starting to think was MC standard issue) unless they called for me. Puck stayed, too. During the time we\u2019d been stuck out here, he hadn\u2019t said anything to me. Not. One. Word. I hunched down in the darkness, praying for something to happen. Anything.</p><p>I still wasn\u2019t sure who our targets were or where the rest of the men had gone\u2014we had about thirty in our group total, a mixture of Reapers, Silver Bastards, and some other club of locals who were apparently their allies. None of them wore their distinctive colors and everything was very hush-hush. All of them had ignored me completely, except for Puck, who radiated resentment at being stuck with babysitting duty.</p><p>Fair enough, because I was starting to resent his silent ass, too.</p><p>After what felt like hours, Puck\u2019s phone vibrated. He answered it, grunted a few times, and hung up, turning to look at me with a frown marring his handsome features.</p><p>\u201cThey need me inside,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come, too\u2014can\u2019t leave you out here by yourself. Keep quiet and don\u2019t say, do, or touch anything. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I felt like telling him that he was young enough to be my son, and I wasn\u2019t fucking stupid. Instead I said, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Another grunt. Some day he really was going to have to learn some real words, I decided.</p><p>We stepped out of the van and started around the side of the building. Around the corner we found a door guarded by a man I didn\u2019t recognize. He opened it for Puck silently, eyeing me with suspicion as I followed the prospect inside.</p><p>The warehouse surprised me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I was expecting ... Maybe some kind of big, open space with catwalks and spotlights, and an evil genius laughing maniacally in the background.</p><p>A hairless cat or two?</p><p>Instead, dim security lights showed an interior that looked less like a crime lord\u2019s fortress and more like a Costco. There were long stacks of boxes and bins and pallets forming alleys, some of them piled nearly to the ceiling. A perfectly normal forklift was parked near the door. It didn\u2019t even have a machine gun mounted on the roof or anything.</p><p>Puck pulled out his gun and started down the second row of pallets, which my active imagination immediately pointed out would operate like a cattle chute. You know, the long, narrow paths they use to guide animals to their deaths in slaughterhouses? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not a happy thought.</p><p>He crept through the darkness and I followed him like a good girl. Then I tripped on my own shoelace, somehow doing an elaborate dance and shuffle to stay upright without making a sound.</p><p>When I was stable again, I dropped down into a crouch to fix the lace. Puck kept moving ahead, oblivious, and there was no way I could stop him without making a sound. Which was worse? Making noise or getting separated?</p><p>Making noise seemed more likely to get us killed.</p> <p>Sucked to be screwing things up less than five minutes into the operation. Kneeling down gave me a whole new perspective on the situation\u2014specifically a perspective low enough to see through a gap in the pallets that was only about two feet high, and maybe eighteen inches wide. On the other side of the gap I could just make out a ... Oh shit. That was a body over there\u2014not one of the bikers, he wasn\u2019t wearing the right kind of clothes.</p><p>There was dark black crap puddled around him on the floor.</p><p>Blood?</p><p>Yeah. Had to be blood, and way more of it than had come out of Em. This guy was deader than dead, no question. Wow. This was really happening\u2014London Armstrong from Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, was in the middle of a gang war and people were dying ... I backed away, looking ahead to see that Puck had almost reached the end of the row, still clueless that we\u2019d gotten separated. Wasn\u2019t that just perfect? I\u2019d just started rising to my feet when I heard the noise.</p><p>A snuffling, whimpering cry ... High-pitched, like a child or maybe a young woman. My mom radar went on point, because I recognised that cry.</p> <p>Jessica.</p><p>She was somewhere on the other side of these pallets, which meant I could either run to the end of the long row and go around, or I could try crawling through that narrow little gap. But running around would take time and possibly make noise ... Not only that, if I caught up to Puck, he might not let me go look for Jess, not when he had an assignment of his own to accomplish.</p><p>I\u2019d just have to crawl through.</p><p>The only downside was Mr. McDead over there, which I had to admit was a major strike against my plan. Then I heard Jessica whimpering again, and she sounded weaker this time\u2014no more playing around. I dropped back down and started slithering my way through the gap. It wasn\u2019t particularly fun or comfortable, but deadly raids against notorious cartels rarely are.</p><p>The first thing I discovered when I reached the other side was that Mr. McDead\u2019s blood was still warm\u2014something I figured out by accidentally putting my hand in it. I could smell it, too. Metallic, with a hint of sweetness. I started to wipe it on my shirt, and then stopped, because ewww. Wondering faintly if God would strike me for defiling the dead, I leaned down and carefully wiped my hand on his shirt.</p><p>My fingers brushed a hard lump.</p> <p>I froze. There was something solid under his shirt, something that had fallen down toward his left side. Giving another quick glance down the row, I didn\u2019t see anyone, so I tugged up his shirt to look.</p><p>It was a gun.</p><p>The whimper came again, and I looked around for the source. Along the wall stretched a series of doors. They were all shut, like they were offices that\u2019d been locked up for the night ... Except for one clearly marked as a bathroom\u2014that door had been propped open. Was she in there, hiding?</p><p>I decided to check my new gun before going in, because I didn\u2019t want to get caught out without any bullets this time. Oh-so-carefully, I let the little bullet holder-thingy slide out of the bottom. Yup. Full of bullets, all right. Then I pushed it back up and wrapped the bottom of my shirt around the whole thing, muffling the sound as I carefully cocked the weapon.</p><p>Now I was locked and loaded, ready to go rescue my little cousin like Lara Croft herself. All I needed was Angelina Jolie\u2019s body and I\u2019d be set. Make that Angelina Jolie\u2019s money\u2014then I could outsource the rescuing and screw Brad Pitt. I felt an inappropriate little laugh try to bubble its way out of my throat, which I swallowed down brutally. Too much tension rattling around in my head.</p><p>Stop making jokes and go rescue Jessica.</p><p>Okay, then. I took a centering breath, edging toward the bathroom door. The shattering crackle of gunfire suddenly echoed through the building, scaring the hell out of me. Men shouted in English and Spanish, followed by more shooting. I scuttled across the floor and through the bathroom door, into total darkness. Then I tugged the door shut behind me\u2014it might not provide much in the way of a barrier, but it had to be better than hanging with a dead body right out in the open. Trailing my hand along the wall, I made my way deeper into the room, around a corner.</p><p>The gunfire died down outside.</p> <p>Now I heard someone else breathing in the tiny room. Jessica? Murderous cartel thug? How the hell was I supposed to tell them apart in the darkness?</p><p>\u201cCan you help me?\u201d a voice whispered, and I nearly started crying because my mama instincts had been right\u2014I\u2019d found my girl and she was alive.</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d</p><p>Silence, then a sobbed attempt at speech. \u201cLoni? Is that really you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m here to save you. You\u2019ll be happy to hear I left the minivan home this time.\u201d</p><p>More silence.</p><p>\u201cAm I imagining this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jess. I\u2019m real, but the warehouse is full of dead people and I touched one of them, so I think we should get the hell out now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got me handcuffed to the pipes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m on a toilet, so I won\u2019t make a mess.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. I suddenly wished Mr. McDead were still alive so I could kill him again\u2014given his position outside, he\u2019d probably been guarding her. I assumed the bikers had taken him out, but who knew? Whoever it was hadn\u2019t found Jess, which was the only thing that mattered. Now I just needed to get her out of the cuffs, then sneak her out of the building without getting both of us killed.</p><p>Easy, right?</p><p>\u201cLoni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill here,\u201d I said quickly. Another round of gunfire filled the air\u2014time to get her loose and out the door before someone came in here and started killing us.</p><p>Speak of the devil ...</p><p>Footsteps thudded outside as someone ran down the long canyon between the wall and the pallets. Then the door banged open and bright white light flooded the bathroom, blinding me. Jessica screamed as shooting seemed to explode all over the building. I scuttled backward frantically, away from this new threat, more screams filling the air. Jessica\u2019s, but also from men outside. Men in pain, or dying.</p><p>This shit was getting real.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My back hit a wall and I found myself under a sink, blinking rapidly as my eyes adjusted to the light. Not six feet from me, I saw a short, fat Hispanic man in an expensive-looking suit stop in front of the lone stall, gun in hand. His breath came heavy and he muttered to himself as he dug in his pockets for something.</p><p>Keys.</p><p>He opened the stall and I caught a glimpse of Jess for the first time\u2014only a flash, but I saw dried blood and her jaw was swollen. She shrieked as he reached for her, and then I heard the clatter of what had to be him fighting to open the handcuffs. Jess kicked out and the key dropped, skittering across the floor to the far corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d she yelled.</p> <p>\u201cShut your mouth, cunt!\u201d the man yelled back. Then he slapped her. Hard.</p><p>She shut up.</p><p>Outside the gunfire died off, but a new noise had started up. A shrill wailing that could only be a fire alarm.</p><p>Holy fuck. I had to end this somehow or we were both going to die like rats.</p><p>The bastard lowered himself heavily to his knees, muttering curses under his breath as he hunted for the key. His motions were desperate, and I realized I wasn\u2019t the only terrified one in here. Good. Nice to know the bad guys got scared, too. Maybe I could use that against him.</p> <p>Jessica\u2019s frantic eyes met mine over his back. Her face was bloodied and bruised, and she\u2019d obviously lost some weight. More than she could afford. To make things even more wretched, her hands were fastened behind her, and they\u2019d left her on the toilet with her pants around her ankles.</p><p>Shouts sounded outside, and a loud crashing noise. Like a body thrown against the wall?</p><p>The man muttered under his breath, his movements growing more frantic. I couldn\u2019t figure out why he didn\u2019t just run away\u2014was he cornered in here? If that was the case, he needed Jess alive. A hostage was his best shot to get out, although whether the club would let him go to save Jess was very much in question ...</p><p>He spotted the key under one of the urinals and backed out of the stall, scuttling across the floor toward it like an exceptionally large cockroach.</p><p>I smelled smoke. More shouting outside.</p><p>Floor Man ignored it all, absolutely determined to get that key and unlock Jessica. I had no idea who he was and I didn\u2019t care. He had the key, which meant he was responsible for her being here and that was good enough for me.</p> <p>Time to end this and get the hell out of here before we died.</p><p>I rose silently to my knees and aimed the gun, just like Disturbing Field Guy had taught me. Then I took a deep breath and pulled the trigger, the explosion shattering so loud in the tiny room that my ears started ringing. Jess screamed again as the bullet caught him in the side, knocking him back against the wall. His eyes found mine and widened in surprise. Then his hand started fumbling for something that\u2019d crashed heavily to the tile next to him.</p><p>His gun?</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>I shot him again, this time in the chest. Another shot, catching his arm. I started knee-walking across the floor, determined to grab that key and get Jessica out. God. He was still alive. His eyes blinked, and he held up a hand, as if he could stop me by sheer force of will. His mouth moved but I couldn\u2019t make out the words through the ringing. Smoke started curling through the air above me, filtering through the air vent. We really, really needed to get out of here.</p><p>Time to end this asshole.</p><p>Holding my gun with both hands, I shot him point-blank in the center of his forehead. Blood and brain spattered everything in the room, including me. I gagged, trying not to throw up. I didn\u2019t slow down, though. I couldn\u2019t afford to, not with smoke pouring into the room, half an army waiting to kill us, and Jessica chained to a fucking toilet with her pants on the floor.</p><p>Time to find that key. Too bad it was wedged somewhere under Fatty McDeadfuck.</p> <p>His body was heavy and limp, but I managed to roll it toward me long enough to dig through the gore and find the little key that\u2019d cost him his life. Then I was on my feet and unlocking Jessica. She was just standing up when the door burst open again.</p><p>I raised the gun, ready to shoot.</p><p>Reese.</p><p>His eyes widened, taking in everything. My blood-spattered face, Jessica peeking out of the stall ... Fatty McDeadfuck\u2019s spattered brains.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he muttered. Huh. Guess my hearing was working again. Yup. More gunfire in the background, along with even louder wailing from the alarm, now that the door was open.</p><p>\u201cHi, Reese,\u201d I said, smiling just a tad too brightly. \u201cI found Jessica.\u201d</p><p>Ruger came in behind him, followed by Horse and some bearded stranger I didn\u2019t recognize. Suddenly the bathroom was way too crowded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Gerardo Medina,\u201d Beard Man said. \u201cHe\u2019s dead ... Holy hell. Who shot him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I snapped, waving my gun for emphasis. They all froze, and I realized waving deadly weapons for emphasis while covered with blood and brain chunks probably wasn\u2019t such a hot idea. This struck me as funny, but I managed not to laugh.</p><p>That\u2019s when I realized perhaps I was losing my shit a little.</p><p>\u201cOops. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Reese let out a slow breath.</p><p>\u201cOkay, give me the gun, babe,\u201d he said, reaching out for it. I hesitated\u2014what if I needed to defend Jessica again? My thoughts were racing way too fast, I couldn\u2019t think. Reese considered me warily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed as hell, London. You just killed the number two guy for the Santiago Cartel in the U.S., so job well done. But much as I respect your deadly instincts, I think we\u2019ll all be safer if you hand that gun over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine keeping it,\u201d I said, narrowing my eyes to focus on his face. Damn. Why was everything moving so fast?</p><p>\u201cTell me right now how much ammunition you have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you can\u2019t answer the question, you got no business carrying that thing around.\u201d</p><p>He made a good point.</p><p>I handed over the gun with the barrel pointed down carefully, startled by how hard it was to keep my balance. Then he was lifting me up and throwing me over his shoulder in a firefighter\u2019s carry. He raced out the bathroom door, smoke surrounding us and the roar of guns growing louder. Something whacked my shoulder and my arm went numb.</p><p>\u201cLoni!\u201d Jess screamed behind me, and I raised my head to see Horse carrying her, dangling pants and all. Then I heard someone yell \u201cFuck!\u201d really loud, followed by \u201cGet the hell outta here!\u201d</p><p>Reese pelted toward the end of the warehouse as the whole place seemed to burst into flames. Smoke burned my eyes, and I had no idea how he was getting enough air\u2014I certainly wasn\u2019t. Still, we barreled down the row of pallets like a herd of wild horses until I saw Puck waiting by the door we\u2019d used to enter, waving at us frantically. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then we were through it and out in the night air.</p><p>Reese tossed me into the back of a van and jumped on top of me, knocking the breath right out of my body. Horse and Jessica followed, and the vehicle took off, cargo doors swinging wide as we tore down the street. From my crumpled position on the floor, I saw a pillar of flame burst through the top of the warehouse roof. Then Horse caught hold of a tie-down mounted on the van\u2019s wall and leaned out, grabbing the doors and slamming them shut.</p><p>There was a giant, roaring whoosh as something blew up, and the entire van rocked violently.</p><p>\u201cPeople have got to stop blowing up buildings at me,\u201d I muttered, trying not to giggle. Something was wrong here ... Why wouldn\u2019t my brain work? Felt like I was looking at everything through a film of honey. I tried to push Reese off, but my arm still wouldn\u2019t work.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into it,\u201d Reese muttered back at me.</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me close and squeezed me, which should\u2019ve made me feel all warm and safe. Instead I didn\u2019t feel anything at all. I knew I should be checking on Jessica, there was something important ... but I was just so incredibly tired and weak.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember anything after that.</p><p>The garbled noises that woke me sounded like someone speaking underwater.</p> <p>This made sense, because I seemed to be floating. I just wasn\u2019t quite sure how I was floating\u2014or why\u2014but I definitely wasn\u2019t on solid ground.</p><p>Lovely ...</p><p>\u201cLondon?\u201d</p><p>I tried to say \u201cgo away,\u201d but it came out more like \u201cgwo cay.\u201d</p><p>Huh.</p><p>\u201cLondon, can you hear me? Try and wake up, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, feeling a sharp twinge of pain. It cut through the floating sensation in a way I simply couldn\u2019t approve of. I opened my eyes to try to find whoever was making my head hurt. Maybe if I bit them hard enough, they\u2019d stop? But identifying the culprit wouldn\u2019t be easy\u2014apparently he\u2019d filled my eyelids with sand, because they were all scratchy and dry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got news about Jess,\u201d the voice said, catching my attention. Jessica. Memories started to come back. Oh, sheesh. We\u2019d gone to California and I\u2019d killed a man. But I\u2019d found Jess\u2014that part was important. Jessica was alive. Then another building had exploded. I blinked, trying to focus on the face above mine.</p><p>Reese.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I managed to croak out. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got shot in the arm and passed out,\u201d he told me. I frowned. I didn\u2019t remember getting shot. Shouldn\u2019t I have noticed?</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming with a bullet,\u201d he said, voice dry. I considered hitting him, but that would\u2019ve involved raising my hand, which didn\u2019t seem to be a realistic option at the moment.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel so weird?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoc shot you up with painkillers. Probably a little more hard-core than you needed, but I didn\u2019t want you hurting.\u201d</p><p>Guess that explained the fog. I blinked some more, trying to clear it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jess?\u201d I finally managed to ask.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doin\u2019 great,\u201d Reese said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a CAT scan and the shunt is fine. Aside from the finger, the only other thing wrong with her is a little dehydration and some bruises. They want her to follow up with a plastic surgeon for the hand, but otherwise it\u2019s all good. No sign of any seizures, either. She\u2019s actually in a lot better shape than you\u2014girl\u2019s stronger than you thought.\u201d</p><p>That was a relief. The ball of tension loosened in my chest, which was very curious. Up to that moment I hadn\u2019t been able to feel my chest at all. Probably because of the drugs, which they\u2019d given me because I got ... attacked by a bullet? Oh yeah. Maybe I should ask Reese about that, now that I knew Jess was safe ...</p><p>\u201cWhen did I get shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the warehouse,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you remember the man in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, wishing I could forget him\u2014I had a feeling I\u2019d be seeing those eyes blinking at me in my nightmares for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think it might\u2019ve been a ricochet in there,\u201d he said. \u201cEither that or a random hit while we were running out of the building. It\u2019s a graze along your arm, but you got lucky. Didn\u2019t penetrate much past the outer layer of muscle\u2014no nerve damage. You had so much other blood covering you that we didn\u2019t even notice until you passed out on the floor of the van. Like Em all over again. Thought I\u2019d have a fuckin\u2019 heart attack.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrenaline. Happens more often than you\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him, the world finally coming into focus. Reese looked tired, his eyes shadowed with dark circles, and I had a feeling I wasn\u2019t looking too shit-hot myself. My head was starting to throb\u2014felt like a Mack truck had rolled right over me. I looked around, trying to move as little as possible in the process. I seemed to be in a child\u2019s bedroom. There was a kitten poster up on the wall and a pink canopy overhead.</p><p>\u201cWhere on earth are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a friend\u2019s house,\u201d he told me, scooting his chair closer. \u201cHis club and the Reapers are allies, so when you needed a place to go, he offered. We\u2019ve had a medic in to see you, and they stitched you up while you were out. Doc said you\u2019ll be fine, gave you a shot of painkillers before he left. He\u2019s a friend of the club, too\u2014won\u2019t report anything. Jessica\u2019s situation is a little more complicated, because she needed more tests. Got her into a private clinic. They\u2019ll keep their mouths shut so long as they get paid enough.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes again, too tired to keep talking. The bed dipped and then Reese was lying next to me. It hurt to move, but I cuddled into his arms anyway. He made me feel safe and protected.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing I should mention,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like Jessica was raped. Repeatedly. She\u2019ll need STD and pregnancy tests.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, because I couldn\u2019t handle thinking about that just yet.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need a lot more than that.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, which I appreciated. Instead he rubbed my back softly, soothing me. Why, I have no idea. I didn\u2019t deserve his kindness\u2014not after what I\u2019d done.</p><p>I drifted off, waking up again when someone opened the door and asked Reese something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered quietly, although I hadn\u2019t caught the question. You need to pull yourself together, figure out what happens next.</p><p>\u201cAnything else I should know about?\u201d I managed to whisper, the drug fog muffling me. He gave a humorlous laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, apparently someone hit five drug warehouses and eight safe houses belonging to the cartel last night. No idea yet about a body count, but the cops are sayin\u2019 almost all the leadership was taken out nearly simultaneously. They\u2019re tryin\u2019 to figure out who might be behind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid all of our guys make it out okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe lost three,\u201d he said, his voice lowering. \u201cOne Reaper and two Devil\u2019s Jacks. Nobody you knew. And here\u2019s bad luck for you\u2014the cops picked up Puck and Painter last night for speeding. Found some guns in the car, so now they\u2019re lookin\u2019 at a trafficking charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. By \u2018lost,\u2019 do you mean ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were they?\u201d I asked, my voice a whisper.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers,\u201d Reese said, his voice rough. \u201cEven the Jacks\u2014they earned it with their blood. Now isn\u2019t the time for crying, though. Gotta get everyone home safe first. Then we\u2019ll remember them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Puck and Painter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawyer\u2019s on his way right now,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut probably not lookin\u2019 so good for either of them. Both have priors. You owe Puck, by the way. He\u2019s the one who figured out where you were. Hadn\u2019t been for him, we might not\u2019ve found you in time.\u201d</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>\u201cSurprised he bothered. I don\u2019t think he likes me very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how he feels about you,\u201d Reese told me. \u201cProtectin\u2019 club property. That\u2019s his job.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea how to react to that statement, so I decided to pretend I hadn\u2019t heard it.</p> <p>\u201cOverall it was a big win for us\u2014it\u2019ll take years for them to recover,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe boss down in Mexico\u2019s already been in touch, askin\u2019 for a truce. They\u2019ve agreed to stay south of San Francisco, at least for now, and leave the local clubs alone. In exchange, we gave \u2019em a little token of our appreciation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvans.\u201d</p><p>I stilled.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said if Jess made it through you were going to let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we told him if she survived, he\u2019d survive, and he was definitely alive when we handed him over to the Santiagos. But only an idiot thinks he can double-cross the cartel and keep breathing long term. He was dead already, just didn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p><p>Scary as hell, but I had to agree. Nate had made his own bed, and I didn\u2019t feel particularly sorry for him at all. I yawned. Between the drugs and the drama, I was exhausted.</p><p>Reese probably was, too ... But I had one more question for him. An important one.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d I asked, my voice a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNot sure I follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the club decided what they\u2019re going to do about me?\u201d I repeated, the words slurring. \u201cNow that it\u2019s all over. I\u2019m really sorry. I know I keep saying that and it doesn\u2019t change anything, but it\u2019s true. What I did was wrong\u2014you always tried to help me, and even after I stabbed you in the back, you still saved Jessica. I know you don\u2019t trust me and you probably don\u2019t believe me, but I\u2019d do anything for you, Reese. For the club, too. I can\u2019t ever thank you enough for rescuing my baby girl ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, I think it\u2019s safe to say you\u2019re fine with the club,\u201d he replied, and I heard a touch of humor in his voice. \u201cYou saved Em\u2019s life, lied to the cops to protect us, and then killed Gerardo Medina\u2014all in twenty-four hours. That\u2019s impressive, honey. You know how many people have tried to take his ass out? Not only that, we all sorta got off on you kneecapping Deputy Dickhead. Don\u2019t sweat it, okay? Fuck, Heather tried to kill me at least three times over the years. We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I understand bikers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, babe. You\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>Jess cuddled up next to me like a baby the entire flight home, tucked into my side with a blanket around us both. I hadn\u2019t quite believed Reese when he told me she was fine. She was, though. At least physically. Sure, she\u2019d lost a finger, and I knew recovering from that wasn\u2019t going to be fun. But her shunt really hadn\u2019t budged, there were no signs of infection, and even the concussion she\u2019d gotten from hitting the floor was healing up like it should.</p><p>We also had no idea why she\u2019d had the seizure. Of course, we\u2019d never really understood why she had them as a child, either\u2014or why she\u2019d stopped having them. One thing I\u2019ve learned over the years spent with her in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices is that medicine is an art, not just a science.</p><p>They don\u2019t know nearly as much as they want you to think.</p><p>Mentally, things were going to be a lot harder for her. She didn\u2019t want to talk about the rape or what had happened to her mother, but she flinched every time a man came near her. That was answer enough for me. Maybe she\u2019d be ready to open up as time went on\u2014not like a cargo plane full of bruised and bloodied bikers was the best spot for a heart-to-heart anyway.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t my place to push her.</p><p>We finally reached Em and Hunter\u2019s house in Portland early in the morning, less than forty-eight hours after we\u2019d left it. Crazy, right? Reese pointed us toward a guest bedroom before taking off, saying he needed to visit Em. They\u2019d talked by phone, but it wasn\u2019t enough. He wanted to see her for himself, make sure she really was going to be okay.</p><p>I felt the same way about Jessica. I tucked her in like a child and then lay down next to her, counting her breaths like I had when she was in the NICU. I should probably go downstairs, make sure everyone else was okay ... But I was so tired. Instead I drifted off, wondering what our next step should be.</p><p>The pinging sound of a text woke me. This seemed odd, considering I hadn\u2019t seen my phone (or purse) since before I tried to shoot Reese. I rolled over, blinking quickly, trying to figure out what was going on.</p><p>\u201cTurn it off,\u201d Jess mumbled, flopping over onto her side. \u201cToo tired for school ...\u201d</p><p>Guess some things didn\u2019t change.</p><p>I looked across the room to see the purse in question sitting on top of a plain wooden dresser, next to two neat stacks of folded clothing. Who could be texting me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pushing myself to my feet was painful at best. Every single part of my body hurt, including my fingernails and hair. I was sore, scratched, cut, and shot. Astoundingly, none of these things had been fatal, or even particularly serious. I stumbled across the room and unzipped my leather bag, digging around for my phone. The battery was low, but it showed a missed call and a message from my neighbor.</p><p>DANICA: How are you doing? Still can\u2019t believe what happened. Wanted to let you know that Hugh\u2019s dad read about your house in the paper. They\u2019ve got that cabin out on Kidd Island Bay road and not using it this year\u2014was rented but the tenant fell thru. You can have if you want. Nothing special but decent. 2 bedrooms 1 bath, friends &amp; family rate. Sitting empty and want to help.</p><p>I stared down at the text, considering the opportunity. I\u2019d been out there a couple of summers ago with Danica and her sister for a girls\u2019 weekend. She was right\u2014it wasn\u2019t anything special. But it would give me, Jess, and Melanie some space. Things were still up in the air with Reese, although I was starting to believe him when he said I was safe. The guys had been friendly enough on the plane, too. Well, as friendly as a bunch of exhausted men who\u2019d just lost three of their brothers in a battle against a drug cartel could be.</p><p>That didn\u2019t change the fact that Jess flinched whenever one of those big, scary men looked at her, or that I had no idea what kind of relationship Reese and I would have moving forward.</p> <p>Sure, he\u2019d offered us rooms at his house until I figured something out ... before I tried to shoot him. Not only that, no matter how happy the two of us might be together, if he scared Jessie, his house wasn\u2019t a good place for her.</p><p>Okay, then. Cabin it was.</p><p>ME: I\u2019m interested. Call you later tonight?</p><p>DANICA: Sounds good. I\u2019ll tell him. He says you can move in any time, he knows your good for the money. I have the keys and its furnished.</p><p>So. That was solved. We had a place to live.</p> <p>Someone had scrounged up some clean clothing for us, including jeans that were a little too long and tight for me and a Reapers MC T-shirt. A plain sports bra and elaborately decorative thong completed the ensemble\u2014dead giveaway that they\u2019d been digging through the back of a closet. Probably Em\u2019s.</p><p>Stepping quietly out of the room, I found the bathroom across the hall and got myself cleaned up, brushing my teeth with my finger and some toothpaste left on the counter. I looked like hell, which wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise. Few women come through shootings looking fresh and energetic, and that wasn\u2019t even taking my plunge through the shrubbery into consideration.</p><p>When I finished, I decided to go downstairs and get an update on Em.</p><p>I found Reese, Horse, Bam Bam, and Skid sitting around the kitchen table drinking coffee. The clock over the oven said it was eight in the morning. They were all haggard, with bloodshot eyes and stubbled chins, and their faces weren\u2019t particularly perky.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said softly. Reese looked up at me, and something flickered in his gaze. Then he pushed his chair out just a bit and patted his knee. I went and sat on it, leaning into his comforting bulk.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Em?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna run back over to the hospital soon. Kicked me out earlier, guess they\u2019re doing some tests or something. She wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>I hardly knew what to say.</p><p>\u201cYou okay with me visiting her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sweetheart. Seein\u2019 as you saved her fuckin\u2019 life, she\u2019s probably safer with you than with me. None of us even noticed something was wrong. Although I should warn you, her sister\u2019s there. Kit\u2019s hell on wheels and she\u2019s been asking questions about you.\u201d</p><p>Great. I\u2019d get to meet his other daughter for the first time looking like something a cat puked out.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d Skid said. \u201cTough on him, though, hearin\u2019 about our losses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm needed him,\u201d Reese said, his voice firm. \u201cAnyone has a problem with that, they can talk to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNobody has a problem with it, Pic,\u201d Skid replied, and I could tell from his tone that this wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d discussed the issue. Alrighty, then.</p><p>\u201cYou guys want breakfast?\u201d I asked brightly. \u201cDo we have time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter said he\u2019d call,\u201d Reese told me. Obviously it bothered him to be waiting on \u201cpermission\u201d to see his daughter.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast it is.\u201d</p><p>I tugged free and walked over to the fridge, inspecting the contents. Options were limited ... But there were eggs and bread. I hit the pantry and found some syrup. Twenty minutes later I had hot French toast coming off an electric skillet, which the guys seemed to appreciate. Then everyone but Reese left the kitchen, which was either convenient or extremely inconvenient, depending on how one interpreted things.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s Jessica?\u201d he asked, as I started washing dishes. To my surprise he came over and picked up a towel to help dry. Didn\u2019t fit the whole He-Man vibe of the past few days, but I guess even the manliest of men will pitch in if you feed him first.</p><p>\u201cStill sleeping,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll be before she opens up about what happened. You notice how jumpy she was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a good scene.\u201d</p><p>That was the best opening I\u2019d get, so I ran with it.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about what happens next,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u201cCrazy, but you realize it\u2019s only been a little over a week since we first slept together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like longer,\u201d he said, taking a plate from my hand. \u201cToo much shit happenin\u2019 too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to process all of it ...\u201d I said slowly. I turned to him, cocking my head. \u201cI need to know\u2014are we past what I did to you? Because I don\u2019t understand how you could just let go of something like this. I\u2019ve told you how sorry I am, but I can\u2019t change what happened. I\u2019ll understand if you can\u2019t forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that you did it, but I understand why and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll do it again. Let. It. Go.\u201d</p><p>I blinked rapidly, my eyes filling with tears.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He grunted, and we continued washing dishes for a few more minutes. I couldn\u2019t relax, though, because there was another piece of unfinished business\u2014and his reaction to it would tell me a lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo ... I found a place for us to rent this morning. We can actually move in as soon as we get back\u2014my neighbor Danica has the keys waiting for us already, and it\u2019s even furnished. That\u2019ll get me and the girls out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>Reese set down the plate very carefully and turned to face me, arms crossed. I kept washing, which was harder to do than you\u2019d think with him standing there, his face like granite.</p><p>\u201cYou tryin\u2019 to dump my ass?\u201d he asked, his voice low and cold. I dropped the sponge and met his gaze, wiping my wet hands nervously on my thighs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I don\u2019t know what our relationship is, either. I mean, we agreed to see each other exclusively, then I tried to shoot you, then you threatened to slit my throat, and we finished things up by going on a killing spree together. This is outside my realm of experience, Reese. Does \u2018let it go\u2019 mean we\u2019re still a couple, or does it just mean I shouldn\u2019t worry about you killing me and hiding my body in the woods? Right now I\u2019m unclear.\u201d</p> <p>His expression softened.</p><p>\u201cI was kind of hoping we could move on to somethin\u2019 a little less fucked up. Maybe watch some movies, hang out and barbecue at my place? We\u2019ve had a rough start, but we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground fast, too. You know, Heather and I didn\u2019t go on a killing spree together until we\u2019d been married for a good five years. You think Jess was a complication? Imagine shootin\u2019 up a cartel with two preschoolers taggin\u2019 along.\u201d</p><p>Holy fuck.</p><p>His mouth quirked and then he reached up and gently pushed my jaw shut.</p><p>\u201cLondon, I\u2019m joking. This shit is not normal. None of it. But this part isn\u2019t a joke\u2014we both got a lot to answer for, but I\u2019m hopin\u2019 you\u2019ll give me another shot and maybe I can do the same for you? No reason for you to move out, sweetheart. I like havin\u2019 you around. Like it a lot.\u201d</p> <p>I studied his face, trying not to fall into those gorgeous eyes of his. They always got to me\u2014no man should be that beautiful. But it wasn\u2019t just about me.</p><p>\u201cJess needs a place to heal up,\u201d I told him softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the club in and out of your place all the time, and right now she\u2019s scared of men. I need some space, too. Things happened too fast, and I want to be sure that we\u2019re doing this for the right reasons. Sometimes you have to take a step back if you want to move forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a refrigerator magnet,\u201d he said, his voice tight. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna walk away from us, London. What we were workin\u2019 on was different. Real. I want that and you do, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRenting my own place isn\u2019t walking away from us,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut we barely had time for there to be an us. We had sex on a Wednesday and by Saturday I was spying on you. Tuesday I got kill orders. All I want is my own space while we explore us, whatever that might end up being. We\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him.</p> <p>\u201cDid Heather always do what you told her to do?\u201d</p><p>He stilled, and I wondered if bringing her up was a mistake. But he\u2019d started it ...</p><p>\u201cHeather almost never did what I told her,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIn front of the club? Sure. But she also liked to keep a knife next to the bed. Always said I was free to fuck whoever I wanted, so long as I understood that the night I came home smellin\u2019 like another woman would be the night she killed me in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>I bit back a smile, looking up at him through my lashes.</p><p>\u201cShe sounds like she was a hell of a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was. But she\u2019s dead, and you\u2019re a hell of a woman, too, London. Come back home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to visit,\u201d I said, holding his gaze. \u201cSleepovers, how does that sound? We can get to know each other, do this the right way. We already did everything wrong once, but if what we have is real, me having my own place won\u2019t kill it. When we\u2019re ready, we can talk about moving in together.\u201d</p><p>His arms stayed crossed, but he nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the summer,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cAfter that all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I reached my arms up around his neck and tugged his head down to mine for a kiss. He let me, but he didn\u2019t respond at first. I pulled back.</p><p>\u201cReally, Reese? Pouting?\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhen you say it like that, it sounds so juvenile.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered, then wrapped his arms around me, pulling me in tight. His lips caught mine and I opened for him. Need and desire flared to life, and I wanted more than his tongue inside. Good thing we\u2019d talked before we started making out, I realized. Otherwise I\u2019d have done whatever he asked, because kissing Reese was that good. By the time Horse stepped into the kitchen and cleared his throat, Reese had me up against the wall, both legs wrapped tight around his waist.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter called,\u201d Horse announced. \u201cShe\u2019s ready for you to come and visit. Said not to forget London. Should I call her back and say you\u2019re too busy fuckin\u2019 in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Reese froze, groaning as I started to giggle. Then he leaned his forehead against mine, eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d he muttered. \u201cShit for timing. Always.\u201d</p><p>He lowered me and I straightened my clothing. Horse didn\u2019t look away or give us even a hint of privacy. Nope. He just stood there smirking like a total creeper.</p><p>\u201cYou like to watch?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah, I like to watch. Doesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p><p>Reese glared at him, which seemed to make him smirk even harder.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go see Em,\u201d I said, tugging at Reese\u2019s hand. \u201cJust \u2019cause she\u2019s a big girl doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t need her daddy.\u201d</p><p>Reese rolled his eyes, then gave me a strange, almost sheepish smile.</p><p>\u201cThank fuck for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d Em said softly when we walked into her hospital room. She looked pale and weak, but her eyes were bright and she still managed to give Reese a smile.</p><p>Hunter stood next to her, his eyes watchful and concerned. He was still the badass biker I\u2019d first met in Coeur d\u2019Alene, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t devoted to his girl. He\u2019d do anything for Reese\u2019s daughter\u2014I saw it written all over his face.</p><p>I decided I liked him, despite the fact that he\u2019d locked me in a storage room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d Reese said, dropping my hand as we crossed over to her bed, which was by the window. Em didn\u2019t have a roommate. I wondered if that was because she\u2019d gotten lucky, or if Hunter had scared the nurses into giving her space.</p><p>Probably best not to ask.</p><p>Reese leaned over and kissed her forehead, then sat down on the bed next to her. I stood beside him, which should\u2019ve felt awkward but it somehow didn\u2019t.</p><p>I was just happy to see Em alive and well.</p> <p>\u201cSo I hear you saved my ass,\u201d Em said to me, her eyes full of gratitude. Not a hint of blame or wariness\u2014she obviously had no idea I\u2019d been a prisoner when I discovered her bleeding. Guess that was on a need-to-know basis, something I found very comforting. I\u2019d just as soon she didn\u2019t find out I\u2019d tried to kill her dad. I had a feeling she\u2019d hold a wicked grudge.</p><p>\u201cI did my best,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cYou scared me\u2014thought we might lose you. How are you feeling now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeak,\u201d she replied. \u201cSad. They told me it was a girl. It\u2019s strange ... I was kind of scared when I saw the positive pregnancy test, but I loved her. I wanted her. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Em nodded, a hint of red around her eyes. I glanced up at Hunter, seeing shadows written in his face. They\u2019d obviously both wanted her. I hoped they\u2019d get another chance ... Ectopic pregnancies could do a lot of damage.</p> <p>\u201cYou tired, little girl?\u201d Reese asked, reaching out to catch Em\u2019s hand. \u201cYou want some rest? We can go wait outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, squeezing his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Reese,\u201d a new voice said, and I looked up to see a girl standing in the door frame. This had to be Kit, the daughter I hadn\u2019t met yet. I recognized her from her pictures, although they\u2019d all been taken before she\u2019d adopted her current style. She looked like a Betty Page pinup, all vintage clothes, sculpted black hair, red lipstick, and tough-girl attitude.</p><p>Like Em, she was stunning, but in a completely different way.</p><p>Reese stood and walked toward her. She flung herself into his arms, squeezing him tight as he lifted her up for a hug. He\u2019d told me she liked to pick fights with him\u2014and I had a feeling calling him by his first name was part of that dynamic ... But clearly when shit hit the fan, the Hayes family stood together. After long seconds he let her slide back down to the ground and she stood back, smiling at him with a hint of vulnerability in her face.</p><p>Then her eyes found me, and they narrowed.</p> <p>\u201cThis her?\u201d she asked, her voice sharp. Em sighed heavily and Hunter rolled his eyes. Time to step in and diffuse, I decided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m London Armstrong,\u201d I said in a clear, friendly voice as I walked over and held out my hand. \u201cYou must be Kit. I\u2019ve seen so many of your pictures, but none of them are recent. I love your look\u2014very classic.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, signaling clearly that it would take more than flattery to win her over. Alrighty, then. I\u2019d try another tactic.</p><p>\u201cReese, would you like me to go and get coffee for everyone?\u201d I asked. \u201cLet you have some family time together?\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow, but Kit looked triumphant. Clearly she thought she\u2019d scared me. Not the case, but I wasn\u2019t looking to butt heads with her. Em was her sister and Reese was her dad\u2014this was about them, not me. I saw right through this girl. Under the belligerence was an undercurrent of fear and insecurity. She needed to know I wasn\u2019t here to take her father away from her, and the best way to communicate that was with space.</p><p>They could have their moment without me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Hunter said suddenly. I nodded, surprised. Up to this point, I would\u2019ve bet a hundred bucks that he wouldn\u2019t be leaving this room for anything.</p><p>Interesting.</p> <p>He followed me into the hallway. \u201cCafeteria\u2019s this way.\u201d</p><p>We started walking, falling comfortably silent. I had no idea why he\u2019d come with me, but if I needed to know, he\u2019d say something. I felt like my role here was to support, not question.</p><p>\u201cThey should have time together,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThey\u2019re tight, but Kit and Reese love to fight. Like two alley cats. Us being in there just gives \u2019em one more thing to fight about, and Em doesn\u2019t need that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, shaking my head as it fell into place.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not the easiest of families, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got no fuckin\u2019 idea.\u201d</p><p>We bought the coffee and carried it back slowly, but despite our best efforts the errand only took about twenty-five minutes. I knocked on the door and pushed it open carefully. Em lay back in the bed, Kit cuddled up next to her on top of the covers. Reese sat between them and the window, leaning back in his chair casually. He rested one ankle across his knee, watching over his girls as they whispered quietly to each other.</p><p>Then he looked up at me and smiled, pale blue eyes creased with warmth, obvious pride written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon in,\u201d he said.</p><p>I glanced at Kit, but she ignored me. Em winked, patting the side of the bed. I walked over and sat down awkwardly in the tiny sliver of space, wondering what the future held for me with this family.</p><p>Only one way to find out.</p><p>\u201cWho wants coffee?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>ONE MONTH LATER</p><p>LONDON</p><p>I leaned forward into the bathroom mirror, carefully brushing mascara over my pale lashes. Outside the bathroom door I could hear Mellie and Jessica arguing about something\u2014the cabin was only about a thousand square feet and I was very, very happy that Melanie would be moving into student housing in a few weeks.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t sure how much more of this I could take.</p><p>Loud music started blaring as I brushed my hair, changing abruptly to rap as I smoothed on lipstick. That would be Jessica taking control of the stereo.</p><p>It switched back again and I realized a full-on musical battle royale was starting outside the tiny bathroom. Taking one more quick look at myself\u2014not perfect, but I\u2019d do\u2014I stepped out, prepared to start yelling. Before I could, the music stopped completely. Both girls stood in the living room, glaring at each other. Melanie had started standing up to Jessica in recent weeks, something I\u2019d always wished she would do. Now I regretted that wish because I lived in a war zone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking idiot,\u201d Jessica growled. I took a deep breath, prepared to tell her off. Melanie beat me to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if it\u2019s true. I saw that letter. He\u2019s just another pussy-chasing asshole, and writing to him in jail is desperate and pathetic. You\u2019re smarter than me, so why don\u2019t you act like it?\u201d</p><p>Mellie\u2019s mouth dropped and so did mine.</p><p>Then the doorbell rang.</p> <p>Melanie stomped past me toward their shared room, leaving Jessica standing in the center of the living room, eyes bright with fury. The bell rang again and I decided they were big girls who could figure this out on their own. Grabbing my backpack, I walked over to the door and opened it.</p><p>Then I smiled because everything was okay again.</p><p>Reese was here.</p><p>REESE</p><p>Christ, but she was gorgeous.</p> <p>I took London\u2019s hand and tugged her out onto the porch for my kiss, because I didn\u2019t feel like dealing with whatever girl drama was brewing in the cabin. And there was major drama brewing\u2014after raising Em and Kit, I could fuckin\u2019 smell that shit in the air.</p><p>Fortunately, the sweet softness of London\u2019s lips more than made up for the girls and their games. My hands found her ass, lifting her up and into my body. As always, my cock was as happy to see her as the rest of me.</p><p>Rap music blasted out through the window, all but knocking us off the porch. Just as fast it turned off again.</p><p>That\u2019s when the screeching started.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d I growled, dragging London toward my fully loaded bike. Being the clever woman she was, she didn\u2019t argue. Let the girls kill each other\u2014this was our weekend, and they weren\u2019t gonna fuck it up for us.</p><p>Five minutes later we were pulling off the road and onto the highway, heading north toward the Canadian border. Over the past month London had gotten more comfortable riding with me, which was great for the most part ... Although I sort of missed the way she used to cling to me like her life depended on it. Now she felt comfortable enough to raise her hands, weaving and dancing them through the air as we flew down the road.</p> <p>Things had been fucked up and tense for a while when we\u2019d gotten back. Some of it between me and her, but mostly just getting shit settled with the club. Painter and Puck were facing jail time no matter how you looked at it, and of the three brothers lost, one had been from the Moscow chapter, ninety miles south of Coeur d\u2019Alene. He was a good man, and I\u2019d known him more than a decade. London had come down with me for the funeral. Our relationship might be new, but she\u2019d earned no small amount of respect when she killed that Medina fuck back at the warehouse.</p><p>She\u2019d handled herself well at the memorial, too, and afterward more than one brother asked me why she wasn\u2019t my old lady already.</p><p>Hard question to answer.</p><p>This weekend wasn\u2019t about answering questions, though. It wasn\u2019t about the club, the girls or anything to do with the cartel. Nope, this was about camping out, spending time together, maybe gettin\u2019 my girl drunk and takin\u2019 advantage of her. Perfect.</p><p>It was still early by the time we reached my favorite campsite up on the Pack River. Calling it a river was a bit of an exaggeration, at least this time of year. The Pack was fed by snowmelt, and by late summer it wasn\u2019t much more than a foot deep in any given spot. It meandered through a wooded valley, the central channel running across a wide bed of rounded rocks, small sand banks, and waterfalls two or three feet high at most.</p><p>Our campsite wasn\u2019t anything particularly special\u2014tucked away off a dirt road, just a little clearing in the trees with a fire pit next to the river. I\u2019d been coming here since I was a kid.</p><p>Had to be one of the most gorgeous places on earth. Couldn\u2019t wait to share it with London.</p><p>I set up the fire while she rolled out the sleeping bags. Still too early to light it, which was fine because I had other things I wanted to do. And no, I\u2019m not talking about fuckin\u2019 her, although that was on the list, too.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready for some fun?\u201d I asked, and she smiled back at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you shot a Super Soaker?\u201d</p><p>She stared at me blankly.</p><p>\u201cWater gun, sweetheart. Plastic? Pump it up, water sprays out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what they are, Reese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I couldn\u2019t carry the big ones on the bike, but the smaller ones are great, too. I\u2019ll give you a head start \u2019cause you\u2019re new at this.\u201d</p><p>With that I pulled out the plastic gun I\u2019d brought for her with a flourish. It was neon orange and green, and it held about two cups of water. More than enough for a good fight, especially since we\u2019d be in the river. Easy to reload.</p><p>Her mouth dropped.</p><p>\u201cDid you seriously bring me up here for a water fight? I thought this was a romantic weekend?\u201d</p><p>I cocked a brow at her.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you gotta look at this from my perspective. I shoot right, your T-shirt gets all wet and then I get to roll around with you in the water. Tell me that isn\u2019t romantic?\u201d</p><p>London snorted, but I could see a hint of playfulness in her eyes. Yeah, she was on board. I tossed her the gun and turned away.</p><p>\u201cYou got until I hit a hundred,\u201d I told her loudly. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll do better if you ditch your shoes. The rocks aren\u2019t sharp but they\u2019re slippery, and there\u2019s lots of places where you can only walk in the water. Now run, unless you want it to be a real short game. Upriver there\u2019s a pool where we can swim, and if you get there before I catch you, you win. If you hit me with your gun, I have to stop and count to ten again. If I hit you, I get a kiss. One. Two. Three. Four ...\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019m an asshole, I stopped at fifty. No reason to make it too easy for her.</p><p>Turning toward the river, I looked upriver. Couldn\u2019t see her, which wasn\u2019t a huge surprise. The swimming hole was only about half a mile away, but it took longer to get there than you\u2019d think because of the rocks and the way the Pack twisted around. I leaned down and filled my gun, then pumped it up, ready for action as I started up the river.</p><p>Five minutes later I still hadn\u2019t seen her. There were a lot of ways to play the game\u2014if she just booked ahead as fast as possible, she\u2019d probably beat me. But that wouldn\u2019t be nearly as much fun, and I knew London.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be able to resist an ambush.</p><p>The first one hit out of nowhere. I\u2019d just come around a bend when cold water slammed me in the side of the head. I heard her laughing hysterically, but I closed my eyes and started counting. Fast. Now I knew she was nearby and I listened carefully for the sound of splashing. When I opened them again, she was still in range, so I lifted my gun and shot her in the back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned toward me shrieking.</p><p>\u201cYou cheat, you didn\u2019t count to t\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shot her in the face before she could finish the sentence, then started toward her through the water. Walking across the smooth, round rocks was awkward, but I have long legs, so it didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>\u201cI counted fast,\u201d I told her smugly. \u201cAnd you owe me two kisses.\u201d</p> <p>She glared at me, but when I caught the back of her neck and pulled her in to claim my prize, she didn\u2019t protest. After long seconds we broke apart, gasping for air. Her wet shirt clung tightly to her tits.</p><p>Outstanding.</p><p>Then she leaned forward to kiss me this time. I closed my eyes, savoring the delicate touch of her lips and\u2014</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck!\u201d</p><p>Bitch shot me in the cock with her gun, point blank.</p> <p>London started laughing and took off up the river, shouting back at me.</p><p>\u201cYou count for real this time, asshole! Otherwise I\u2019m taking your gun away from you.\u201d</p><p>By the time we reached the little pool, both of us were soaking wet, so no real point in keeping our clothes on. It was only about three feet deep and maybe ten feet across, so we couldn\u2019t really swim, either\u2014fine with me. Instead we sort of splashed each other, then wrestled, and then the next thing I knew I was sitting under a waterfall while London rode my cock.</p><p>Best. Game. Ever.</p><p>Later that night I lay on my back, looking up at the stars, London tucked into my arm, one hand across my chest.</p><p>\u201cI wish we could just stay out here forever,\u201d she murmured softly. \u201cWhere nobody can find us and we don\u2019t have to do anything. God, the girls are driving me crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMellie will be gone soon,\u201d I reminded her. Above us a star shot by, then then another. \u201cHeather and I used to come up here every year at this time for the Perseids shower. You see that? They\u2019ll be falling all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I saw it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDo you think about her a lot?\u201d</p><p>I considered the question, trying to find the right words.</p><p>\u201cSometimes. But I think about you a lot more. After she died I swore I\u2019d never take another old lady. Just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it, not until now. But it\u2019s right with us, isn\u2019t it? You feel it, too.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer for a second.</p><p>\u201cI feel it, too,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to make it official?\u201d I asked. She shook her head, rubbing her hair against me. Smelled good.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I know this sounds silly, but let\u2019s keep this ours for a bit longer. Just a little secret we don\u2019t have to share with anyone else. Everyone counts on us all the time and that\u2019s not going to go away ... but for now, let\u2019s not give them this.\u201d</p> <p>I hesitated. I wanted things out in the open, wanted everyone to know London was my woman for real. Fuckin\u2019 proud of her. But I understood, too.</p><p>\u201cEnd of the summer, then? Only about two weeks left, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much longer you gonna stay in that tiny little cabin when I got a whole house just waitin\u2019 for you?\u201d</p><p>She gave a snort of frustration.</p><p>\u201cThe day Mellie moves out, I\u2019m packin\u2019 my shit. I\u2019m losing my mind there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jessica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe actually has plans, believe it not. I\u2019m sort of torn about them. I want her with me ... but I also know she won\u2019t be happy out at your place. She isn\u2019t ready to get back into life like that just yet. But I\u2019m really proud of her for realizing she has to move forward, make her own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What\u2019s she gonna do with herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s moving in with Maggs Dwyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBolt\u2019s old lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Bolt\u2019s ex,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty emphatic about that detail. She runs a program at the community center for special-needs children. Jess has been volunteering there for a couple of years, and she\u2019s decided to enroll in the early-childhood education program down at the college. Maggs is giving her a part-time job and a room to rent. It\u2019s perfect in a lot of ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBolt won\u2019t like that,\u201d I mused. \u201cHe\u2019s tryin\u2019 to get back with her. Havin\u2019 Jess around won\u2019t make things easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Bolt\u2019s decision.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>\u201cSo two weeks and you\u2019re all mine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, giving a yawn. \u201cAssuming you still want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah, I want you.\u201d</p><p>She made a happy little snuffling noise and we fell silent again. Another meteor streaked overhead. London\u2019s breathing slowed as she drifted off.</p><p>Hey, babe, Heather whispered. Remember coming here together? Two little girls snuggled up between us, watching the stars shooting all night? You told them they were people riding up to heaven on rockets.</p><p>Yeah, I remember.</p><p>I remembered everything, although sometimes I wished I could erase those memories because they hurt so bad. Tonight, though? Tonight they were beautiful.</p><p>She\u2019s good for you\u2014this is what I wanted. Someday when Em and Kit have kids, you bring them up here for me, will you? Tell them Grandma Heather\u2019s watching over them ... Then tell them Grandma London\u2019s gonna give \u2019em extra loves, because they\u2019re such special kids they deserve double.</p><p>I swallowed. London stirred next to me, and I took in her scent. Clean and fresh, her hair still just a little damp from the river.</p><p>I\u2019ll always miss you, I told Heather. But it\u2019s time to let you go.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Another star shot by in the darkness, and London raised her head.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Reese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never said that to me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t ready. I\u2019m ready now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>She settled back into my body, and I felt right in a way I\u2019d almost forgotten existed. Darkness surrounded us, broken only by the meteor shower. I waited for Heather to say something. Nothing.</p><p>Now it was just London and me.</p><p>Felt good.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>THIRTEEN MONTHS LATER</p><p>SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</p><p>PUCK</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t decide\u2014should I get drunk first and then get laid, or the other way around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Puck muttered, staring at the ceiling. He lay back on the top bunk, trying to ignore the annoying mouth breather he and Painter shared a cell with. At least they had a cell. Given how crowded the prison was, half the guys didn\u2019t have any space of their own at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna start with sex,\u201d Fester continued, oblivious to the threat in Puck\u2019s voice. The guy was a complete moron, but at least he was harmless. Over the past year, he and Painter had needed to fight off the cartel boys at least once a month. An annoying cell mate was better than getting shanked in your sleep. \u201cThere\u2019s this chick I saw once who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t shut the fuck up right now, I\u2019ll cut off your dick,\u201d Puck muttered. Fester laughed, because they\u2019d had this same conversation at least once a day for the past six months. But today they were in lockdown, which meant Puck couldn\u2019t get away from the little shit.</p><p>Painter snorted in amusement across the room, because he knew exactly how much the man got on Puck\u2019s nerves.</p><p>\u201cHow \u2019bout that girl of yours?\u201d Fester asked Painter, shifting directions abruptly. \u201cShe have anything interesting to say? I always think about her in that blue sundress she was wearin\u2019 in that one picture. You know, the one where her tits were sorta pokin\u2019 through? I swear to fuck, those were her nipples. They taste good? I\u2019ll bet they taste good.\u201d</p> <p>Puck closed his eyes and shook his head. Fester had no fuckin\u2019 sense of self-preservation at all. Painter didn\u2019t like questions about his girl. This was not new territory.</p><p>\u201cYou say one more word and I\u2019ll kill you on the spot,\u201d Painter replied, his voice like stone. \u201cShe\u2019s not my girl and whatever you think you saw, you forget. You\u2019re not good enough to look at her picture, asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Painter,\u201d Fester said quickly. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to bother you. You just keep readin\u2019 your letter and I\u2019ll go over here for a while. Maybe draw a picture or somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Painter said, then Puck heard Fester move across the room, followed by the sounds of crayons dumping out across the desk. Man had the mind of an eight year old, no joke. Puck wondered how he\u2019d survive when they got out in two weeks, but he didn\u2019t put too much energy into it. Fester was like a cockroach\u2014he\u2019d find a way.</p><p>\u201cAny news from home?\u201d Puck asked, although \u201chome\u201d wasn\u2019t really the right word. Painter\u2019d gotten a packet of notes and pictures from Coeur d\u2019Alene, all gathered together by one of the Reapers\u2019 old ladies and sent down at once.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks like Bolt and Maggs are back together.\u201d</p><p>Puck grunted, trying to remember who Maggs was. Bolt he remembered, but they hadn\u2019t talked much. He\u2019d only been in Coeur d\u2019Alene a few days before everything fell to shit. After their first four months inside together, Painter had suggested he come prospect with the Reapers when he got out. Wouldn\u2019t be happening. Puck\u2019s dad had been a Silver Bastard, and that\u2019s who he wanted to ride with.</p><p>Assuming he ever got to ride again.</p><p>\u201cMellie got a scholarship,\u201d Painter added after a few minutes. \u201cSays she\u2019s excited, because it means she won\u2019t have to work during school this year.\u201d</p><p>Puck grinned, but he didn\u2019t say shit. Painter had it bad for the girl\u2014pussy whipped, despite the fact he\u2019d never even gotten a whiff. He\u2019d never fall for that, no fuckin\u2019 way. Life was hard enough without some bitch whinin\u2019 all the time.</p><p>Not only that, who wanted to pick just one?</p> <p>The warning bell rang for lights out, and Fester scrabbled around, presumably picking up his crayons. Freak had a talent for drawing, strangely enough. He could draw pictures of anything, all shaded and complicated and shit. Puck wouldn\u2019t have thought you could pull that off with crayons, but what did he know?</p><p>The lights went out and Puck closed his eyes, ignoring the howls and moans of inmates up and down the block. This was the best time in prison. He might be stuck in a concrete box with Painter and their pet fuckwit, but with the lights off he could imagine being somewhere else. Outside.</p><p>Get drunk first or get laid?</p><p>Damned fine question, he had to admit. Christ, but he missed women. Specifically, he missed fucking them ... But he also missed their softness, and the way\u2014when he smiled just right\u2014their eyes went all liquid and they\u2019d do whatever the hell he asked, no matter how fucked up it might be.</p><p>Okay, laid first.</p><p>He tried to picture the girl. Blonde? Dark hair? Fuck, he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d start out with a blow job, and then move on to her pussy, maybe eat her out. Yeah, that\u2019d be good. His cock twitched and he lifted his hips, sliding down his pants. On the bunk below him Fester grunted, breaking the spell\u2014but not for long. Puck ignored him, palming his dick and squeezing tight.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>But her mouth would be hot and wet, and the thought of her pussy was so sweet it made his teeth hurt. And he\u2019d find one with a sweet pussy for that first night outside. No nasty old bitches for him. Nope. Nothing but the best, because it was his fantasy and he\u2019d damned well do what he wanted in it.</p> <p>His cock swelled as he pictured sliding it into her slowly from behind. Favorite way to do it, looking down at their asses, all heart shaped and pretty. Jacking his hand slowly, he tried to decide what he wanted. Pale skin? Dark? Maybe some freckles, or just all creamy smooth? Hell, he\u2019d order one of each, find a new one to play with every night.</p><p>Speaking of asses, he\u2019d hit that, too. Yup. Mouth, cunt, ass. Then he\u2019d get drunk and start all over again.</p><p>Fuckin\u2019 beautiful. Too bad she wasn\u2019t real. Frustration filled him, but Puck jacked harder, lust for his imaginary girl clashing with the cold, hard reality that a man\u2019s hand just wasn\u2019t enough. Not after thirteen months.</p><p>But his hand would have to do.</p><p>Fluid started seeping from his tip, and he caught it, slicking his way as he kept going. His heart pumped faster now, matching his rhythm. Sweet, tight, and hot. Young. Pretty. Maybe long hair, so he could hold on to it while he fucked her, because riding rough worked for him in a big way.</p><p>Oh yeah ...</p><p>He liked the idea of pulling her hair, maybe giving her ass a little smack. The vision was so intense he practically heard the slap of his hand against her flesh, the way she\u2019d tense around him when he did it. Fuck, that was good. The pressure inside grew tighter and he knew he was close. So fucking close.</p><p>His vision shifted\u2014now she knelt in front of him, looking up with big, deep brown eyes as she wrapped her pink lips around his cock. Holy hell, that was perfect. Puck\u2019s arm started to ache, but he didn\u2019t slow down. Probably making enough noise for the others to hear and he didn\u2019t give a shit. Painter was his brother\u2014might not be with the same clubs, but brothers just the same. They\u2019d done time together, forged a bond that couldn\u2019t be broken. Shit like this meant nothin\u2019. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>And Fester?</p><p>He didn\u2019t count.</p><p>The girl in his head pulled her mouth free of his cock, and glanced up at him playfully. Then she reached out with the tip of her tongue, poking the slit at the end of his length.</p><p>Puck exploded.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>So fucking good. Fucking perfect.</p><p>For a moment he just lay in the dark, free in that instant. What a joke.</p><p>Too bad his little mama wasn\u2019t real. And she wasn\u2019t. Because here he was, stuck alone in the dark with two other men, one of whom was half in love with some bitch he\u2019d probably never touch. Nope. Painter wouldn\u2019t make a move even after they got out. Precious Melanie was too pretty and perfect up on her pedestal to get dirty, Puck figured.</p><p>As for Fester? He liked to eat his own crayons.</p><p>Pathetic. Both of them. Puck needed to get out, sometimes thought he\u2019d go crazy if he didn\u2019t get out.</p><p>Two weeks.</p><p>Fourteen days.</p><p>Puck wiped off his hand and pulled up his pants. After tonight, only thirteen days left.</p><p>\u201cThose was definitely her little titties pokin\u2019 through that dress,\u201d Fester whispered.</p><p>\u201cGod damn it!\u201d</p><p>Painter was out of bed and across the room in a heartbeat, dragging dumbass out of bed so hard that Puck\u2019s bunk shook.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d Puck snapped. \u201cYou fuck him up, could mess with our parole.\u201d</p><p>Painter stilled.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk about her,\u201d he said finally, dropping the other man to the floor.
