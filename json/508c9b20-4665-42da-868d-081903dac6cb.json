As one of the Breed, he\u2019d long grown used to the reaction he had on humans.</p><p>As a warrior member of the Order and a first-generation Breed male\u2014the most powerful of his kind\u2014Nathan\u2019s presence often put even other vampires on alert.</p> <p>But it was the other part of his nature, the fact that he was born and raised a Hunter, one of a dark legion bred for killing and stripped of all emotion or attachment, which broadcast an unspoken, visceral terror into the room. He saw it in every pair of eyes that furtively glanced his way now through the swirling dance lights in the darkened club.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t look happy to see us,\u201d quipped Rafe, one of three other Breed warriors who reported to Nathan as their squad captain.</p><p>\u201cI doubt Cassian Gray will welcome the Order with open arms either.\u201d This from Nathan\u2019s lieutenant, Elijah, in the slow, laid-back Texas drawl that belied the vampire\u2019s quick skill with any one of the blades or firearms bristling from his weapons belt.</p><p>From the other side of Eli, Jax, the third member of tonight\u2019s patrol, quirked a slender black eyebrow over his almond-shaped eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we left on the best of terms last time.\u201d</p><p>No, they hadn\u2019t. The last time Nathan and his crew had stepped inside the former church that was now one of the city\u2019s most popular\u2014and least reputable\u2014hot spots, it ended with the club\u2019s proprietor, Cassian Gray, calling in an armed unit of the Joint Urban Security Taskforce Initiative Squad. The Order didn\u2019t have time to deal with any public or political fallout from JUSTIS tonight.</p> <p>And if Cass thought he could hide behind the palms he\u2019d greased so well within that combined Breed and human police organization, he was wrong. Dead wrong, if that\u2019s the way he wanted to play it.</p><p>The Order had recently come across intel indicating Cass might have other, unknown allies in his pocket. Allies who would make his law enforcement and criminal underworld connections seem like worthless puppets.</p><p>Tonight, Nathan and his squad had been tasked with bringing the mysterious club owner in to the Order\u2019s Boston command center for questioning.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go find the bastard.\u201d Ignoring the sharp spike of adrenaline and anxious perspiration injected into the general m\u00e9lange of stale liquor, smoke, and perfume that hung like a fog in the club, Nathan gestured for his team to follow him deeper inside. \u201cEli, you and Jax search the public rooms. Rafe and I will take the offices in back.\u201d</p><p>With the two warriors heading off on his instructions, Rafe fell in alongside Nathan to cut a path through the crowds on their way to La Notte\u2019s owner\u2019s quarters. There was no security to stop them once they reached Cass\u2019s office, suggesting the man was either working the floor of his club as he so enjoyed or not in the building at all.</p><p>Nathan hoped it was the former. If not, this unannounced visit was sure to get back to Cass one way or another, and the Order didn\u2019t want to give the son of a bitch any cause for alarm. They wanted nothing to send him to ground before they could interrogate him about who\u2014or, rather, what\u2014he truly was.</p> <p>Nathan stalked up to the black-painted steel door with the word PRIVATE scratched into it from the tip of a serrated blade. The dead bolt and secondary lock were no trouble at all for the power of his Breed mind. Nathan freed the bolt and the other tumbled open with little more than a second\u2019s concentration.</p><p>He pushed the door wide and Rafe followed him into the darkened office. Neither of them needed artificial light; Breed eyesight was flawless, all the more so in the dark.</p><p>Nathan made a quick visual scan of the empty room and cursed. \u201cHe\u2019s already gone.\u201d</p><p>No sign of Cassian Gray at all. The desk was cleared of all papers and personal effects. No computer tablet lying conveniently in the open for them to confiscate. Nothing but a carefully vacated office.</p><p>If Nathan had to guess, he figured Cass had been gone for several hours at least. Maybe a full day or more.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d he gritted through clenched teeth.</p><p>Rafe meanwhile had broken into a cabinet of paper files and ledgers on the other side of the room. \u201cJust a bunch of accounting records and supply receipts in here. Bar equipment, liquor invoices, band contracts for the club.\u201d The blond vampire shot Nathan a wry look. \u201cWhere do you suppose Cass keeps the books for the real moneymaking parts of this operation? Nothing in here at all that mentions the fight arena downstairs or the gambling, pimping, and blood trading. Nothing in here about the other pursuits La Notte caters to either.\u201d</p><p>Nathan grunted. Cass\u2019s illegal and other unconventional activities provided in the restricted-access lower level of his club were no secret, but criminal or not, he was careful to protect the interests of himself and his clientele. The records for those parts of his business were surely kept somewhere far more secure than his office at the club.</p> <p>No, Cassian Gray was a man who knew when and how to keep his secrets.</p><p>Rafe had now abandoned the file cabinets to move farther into the gloomy office space. \u201cHey, check it out,\u201d he called over his shoulder to Nathan. \u201cThere\u2019s another door over here.\u201d</p><p>The warrior opened it and blew out a whistle. \u201cYou gotta see this, man.\u201d</p><p>Nathan walked over to find a bedroom on the other side of the door. A king-size four-poster bed draped in black satin sheets dominated the room. The rails between the posters dripped with leather straps and an assortment of manacles and buckled restraints, a few bearing sharp metal spikes.</p><p>Rafe barked out a laugh. \u201cWhoever Cassian Gray is, he\u2019s one twisted fuck.\u201d</p><p>Nathan stared at the accoutrements of sexual deviance and torture while his friend and comrade stepped inside to jingle one of the studded harnesses. \u201cLeave it alone, Rafe. We\u2019re wasting time. Cass isn\u2019t here, obviously. Let\u2019s go find the others and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>As Rafe dropped the leather strap and they prepared to leave, Jax rushed in to meet them. His face was drawn and grave. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find Cass?\u201d Nathan asked.</p><p>Jax shook his head. \u201cApparently, we just missed him, if you can believe any of the club staff. The problem is Aric Chase. He\u2019s downstairs at the cages. With Rune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Rafe hissed, coming up beside Nathan.</p><p>\u201cEli\u2019s trying to break it up,\u201d Jax said. \u201cBut Aric won\u2019t stand down. Shit\u2019s about to get ugly.\u201d</p><p>Nathan growled a curse. \u201cIs Carys here too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cShe\u2019s at the art museum with Jordana Gates. The two of them are hosting a patrons\u2019 reception. They\u2019ve been planning it for months.\u201d</p><p>Nathan gave a tight nod, grateful for that small mercy. The last thing Carys Chase needed was to see her twin brother take a beating from the cage-fighting killer who\u2019d recently begun sharing her bed.</p><p>If the Breed fighter and the daywalking female had shared anything else\u2014namely a blood bond\u2014Aric wouldn\u2019t be the only member of the Chase family determined to kick Rune\u2019s swarthy ass. Hell, Nathan would likely be willing to join that fight himself too.</p><p>He took off at a dead run, heading with Rafe and Jax for the cage arena in the lower level of La Notte. Shouts and roars and bloodthirsty applause thundered from the bowels of the former church.</p><p>And no sooner had he descended into the illegal sporting den than Nathan spotted Aric and Rune. They stood in front of the cages, Eli positioned in between them, mostly holding Aric back. Both Breed males were flashing fangs, eyes glowing bright amber in the dim light of the arena.</p><p>Nathan scowled at Jax. \u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It was already getting heated when Eli and I got down here.\u201d</p><p>Another of La Notte\u2019s fighters, a blond, long-haired Breed male named Syn, met Nathan\u2019s hot glare from nearby as the din ratcheted up even higher among the spectators gathered in the arena. \u201cBetter rein in your baby warrior before Rune leaves him in bloodied shreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Rune\u2019s problem with Aric tonight?\u201d</p><p>Syn smirked. \u201cRune\u2019s problem?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cRune was minding his own business, just taking a breather and enjoying some refreshment before tonight\u2019s first match.\u201d</p><p>The way Syn leaned on the word refreshment told Nathan that when Aric found him, Rune was likely feeding from one of the paid human blood Hosts employed by Cass to serve his fighters and VIP clientele.</p><p>\u201cYour boy started talking shit,\u201d Syn went on. \u201cStarted telling Rune the Order had its eye on him. That he\u2019d better watch his step or he was gonna get ashed.\u201d</p><p>Holy hell. Nathan acknowledged that this confrontation probably shouldn\u2019t surprise him, but Aric\u2019s personal dislike of the brutal cage fighter had nothing to do with Order business.</p><p>Not yet, anyway. If Aric and Carys\u2019s father, Sterling Chase, ever found out his daughter had taken up with an unapologetic underworld player like Rune, Nathan had no doubt the Order as a whole would definitely have something to say about it.</p><p>Nathan, Rafe, and Jax pushed through the jeering crowd just in time to see Aric lunge past Elijah to grab hold of Rune. Aric body-slammed the big fighter into the nearby cage, fangs bared and eyes aglow with fury. He threw a couple of wild punches, each deftly avoided by Rune. Aric\u2019s anger opened him wide for a punishing blow.</p><p>Rune didn\u2019t hit back. He was glaring lethally, his savage face twisted in rage. But under his shaggy mane of dark brown hair, the undefeated fighter with more kills to his name than any other before him stayed his hand.</p><p>Nathan shoved past the onlookers so he and Rafe could peel Aric off Rune. No easy feat, that. Although just twenty years old, Aric was Gen One like Nathan. He was strong as hell and deadly powerful, especially now, when his whole body was electric with animosity toward his sister\u2019s unsavory lover.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, man?\u201d Rafe shouted at his friend. \u201cYou lost your mind, Aric? What are you doing down here?\u201d</p><p>Aric continued to glower at Rune. He jabbed his finger at the deceptively cool fighter. \u201cYou keep to your own. Stay away from her. She\u2019s better than this, better than you.\u201d</p><p>Now Rune\u2019s lips twisted slowly, into an ironic smile. \u201cI tell her that all the time. She seems to think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>As Rune spoke, one of La Notte\u2019s blood Hosts sauntered over to drape her nearly naked body around him. She took Rune\u2019s earlobe between her teeth, whispering something against his dark, stubble-shadowed cheek. Rune gave her thong-strung behind a meaningful swat and told her to wait for him in one of the nearby booths.</p><p>Aric went apeshit. Snarling and seething, he struggled to break loose of his comrade\u2019s hold.</p><p>Nathan shot a hard look at Rafe. \u201cLet\u2019s get him out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise move,\u201d Syn agreed, as Nathan and his crew wrestled Aric away from the cages and out of Rune\u2019s reach.</p><p>They hustled the furious vampire out of the club and back onto the street outside. He tried to lunge for the door, but Nathan and Rafe blocked him. He shook them off and rocked back on his bootheels.</p><p>\u201cShe has to know this can\u2019t go on. Carys has to understand that asshole is beneath her. I can\u2019t stand by and let her get hurt by gutter filth like Rune.\u201d Aric cursed, low and savage. \u201cGoddamn it, I won\u2019t stand by.\u201d</p><p>Then he bolted. Not for the club again, but out into the street.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Rafe muttered, raking a hand over his head. He glanced over at Nathan. \u201cYou know where he\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>The museum reception. Nathan didn\u2019t have to guess. But he hated like hell to acknowledge it. No more than he hated to acknowledge that he and his patrol squad were going to have to abandon tonight\u2019s search for Cassian Gray and instead go after one of their own.</p><p>One of their own who was about to earn the wrath of his beloved sister, if Aric followed through on his threat to see Carys and Rune separated.</p><p>And going after Aric meant coming face-to-face with something else Nathan would rather avoid, especially under these circumstances.</p><p>Jordana Gates.</p><p>The beautiful, Darkhaven-raised female he\u2019d been trying to bar from his thoughts for the past week\u2014ever since she\u2019d pressed her mouth against his in an entirely unexpected, totally unforgettable kiss. A kiss that had unsettled him and, yes, enraged him.</p><p>Disturbed him on a level he was still struggling to comprehend.</p><p>\u201cThe art museum\u2019s on Huntington Avenue,\u201d Rafe said beside him.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s reply was short, almost a growl. \u201cI know where it is.\u201d</p><p>He knew more than he had a right to about lovely Jordana Gates and the places she frequented. Primarily so he could take steps to avoid them.</p><p>But there could be no avoiding her now. Not with Aric charging off to defend his sister\u2019s virtue.</p><p>Nathan rubbed his palm across his clenched jaw. \u201cFuck it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>As reluctant as he was to follow the path where this night was heading, Nathan was the first to step off the curb and race for their destination.</p><p>2</p><p>ON FOOT, GIFTED WITH THE PRETERNATURAL SPEED OF THEIR Breed genetics, it took all of three minutes for Nathan and his team to arrive in front of the museum across the city.</p><p>Aric was ahead of them, already shoving his way past the sputtering human doorman to barge inside. Nathan, Rafe, Jax, and Eli followed quickly behind him, but not fast enough to stop Aric from completely disrupting the invitation-only social event.</p><p>Storming through the knots of men garbed in tuxedoes and women swathed in elegant gowns and glittering jewels, Aric roared his sister\u2019s name. \u201cCarys!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Conversations halted abruptly. Heads turned from all directions, Breed and human alike. Only the string quintet in the gallery overhead seemed capable of ignoring Aric\u2019s intrusion on the private gathering. They played on, Mozart\u2019s spirited Serenade Number 13, an odd accompaniment to the current of alarm now spilling across the main floor of the museum.</p><p>With Nathan and his squad of warriors trailing close behind him, Aric stalked past the sculpture and art displays arranged specifically for the wealthy patrons assembled there tonight. \u201cCarys Chase!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cDammit, where are you?\u201d</p><p>Nathan was right at Aric\u2019s heels. Nathan reached for him, his hand coming down hard on Aric\u2019s shoulder to halt him in his tracks. \u201cThis is not the time or the place,\u201d he warned his comrade, low under his breath, prepared to yank the young Breed warrior out of there bodily before things got any worse.</p> <p>He would have. But at that same moment, Nathan\u2019s senses came to a full stop as she emerged from within the shelter of a nearby throng.</p><p>Not Aric\u2019s sister, Carys.</p><p>Jordana Gates.</p><p>Tall, slender, wrapped in a gown of sheer, pale blue fabric that floated around her body like a silken cloud, she stepped away from the throng of society\u2019s most privileged elite and met Nathan\u2019s eyes across the several yards that separated them. Her oceanic blue gaze locked on him in what he guessed to be surprise at first\u2014then confusion\u2014beneath the complicated twists and delicate spirals of her upswept white-blond hair.</p><p>The gauzy dress she wore hugged the swell of her breasts and her tiny waist, skimming the gentle flare of her hips. She was stunning, like a vision from an enchanted other world. And she was nervous, not because of Aric\u2019s furious disruption of her swanky society party but because of Nathan.</p> <p>Because he was standing there in front of her now.</p><p>Even at this distance, he could see the way her pulse kicked harder in the hollow at the base of her creamy throat as she looked at him. He could practically feel the acceleration of her heartbeat as he held her in an unapologetic stare, drinking her in from head to toe.</p><p>He could almost taste her mouth on his again, soft lips crushed against his in a startling kiss he never would have allowed. A sweet, reckless kiss that never should have happened.</p><p>Not with someone like him.</p><p>No, Jordana\u2019s anxiety wasn\u2019t misplaced at all.</p><p>She\u2019d had no idea what she\u2019d done, kissing him like that. The way his thoughts had been turning in the days since then, she damned well should be nervous around him.</p> <p>\u201cCarys!\u201d Aric called once more into the crowded reception.</p><p>His deep, booming voice made Jordana jump, one delicate hand coming up to her throat in alarm. In the gallery above, the music faded, then halted altogether. The museum patrons began to murmur and shuffle about to gape at Aric\u2019s spectacle, though none of the tuxedoed men seemed eager to play hero and take on the threat of a seething warrior from the Order by themselves.</p><p>Aric shouted for his sister again and tried to shake loose of Nathan\u2019s hold.</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d Nathan said, digging his grip deeper into the meat of Aric\u2019s shoulder. Rafe, Eli, and Jax were right behind him, waiting for his orders. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Aric. \u201cYou need to cool down. Let\u2019s take this outside. All you\u2019re going to do is piss her off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAric?\u201d Carys Chase rushed through the unmoving crowds, panic in her normally calm voice. Dressed as elegantly as Jordana and the other women, she gaped at her brother as she charged forward to meet him on strappy sandals that echoed the geometric cut of her curve-hugging copper silk gown. \u201cWhat are you doing here? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>While Jordana\u2019s beauty was diamond bright and icy fair, Carys Chase was earth and fire combined. Her eyes simmered with a fierce intelligence, and her caramel blond mane of hair swung around her face and shoulders like liquid bronze.</p><p>Of course, the differences between the two females went beyond the physical.</p><p>Where Jordana Gates was a Breedmate, half human in addition to the other, more elusive genetics that made her different from her mundane Homo sapiens cousins, Carys Chase was something rarer still. She was Breed, and a daywalker at that.</p> <p>The same as her twin brother.</p><p>\u201cAric, are you okay?\u201d she asked him, reaching up to touch his rigid jaw. She glanced at him then, studying him in a quick instant. Her shrewd eyes narrowed. \u201cWhere have you been tonight? Why is your shirt torn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Aric snapped at her.</p><p>Carys blinked. \u201cNow? Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m in the middle of some\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he snarled, finally breaking out of Nathan\u2019s grasp to grab hold of his sister\u2019s arm. \u201cThis is fucking serious, Car. I\u2019m not gonna let it wait.\u201d</p><p>He tried to maneuver her away from the onlookers, but Carys dug in her five-inch heels and stood her ground in front of him. \u201cHave you lost your mind? Let go of my arm.\u201d She wrenched loose, outrage sparking in her eyes. When she spoke, Nathan glimpsed the tips of her emerging fangs. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Aric. You\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d</p><p>Across the room, Jordana started to move away from the others, toward her distressed friend. She was prevented from getting any closer by a man who stepped up behind her now. He was Breed, tall and attractive, with clear blue eyes and golden hair.</p><p>One of the shiny people who belonged in this place.</p><p>The male\u2019s hand came to rest protectively\u2014possessively\u2014at Jordana\u2019s waist as he gathered her to him, subtly holding her in place. As if she belonged with the man.</p><p>Nathan observed this with cool logic and understanding, even if his blood spiked with an unwelcome jolt of disdain for the male who touched Jordana like he owned her.</p><p>He stared at her, watched her cheeks flame a little redder under his scrutiny before she abruptly glanced down and refused to look at him again.</p><p>Was this the source of her nervousness in front of Nathan tonight?</p><p>Not merely Nathan\u2019s presence tonight, but his presence when she was in the company of someone else.</p><p>This man, whose hand had drifted from her small waist down to the tempting swell of her hip, fingers idly caressing her even as he retrieved a comm device from his tuxedo jacket pocket and held it at the ready to make a call.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s gaze never lifted, not even as the conflict rose to troubling heights between Aric Chase and his sister.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s using you, Carys. Can\u2019t you see that? Trash like that will only hurt you in the end.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed, exhaled a curse under her breath. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRune.\u201d Aric practically spat the name at her. \u201cYou need to end it now. Before it goes any further with him. Before I have to kill the bastard for thinking he can touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about Rune and me.\u201d She glared, fury igniting in her pretty face. \u201cAnd you have no right to interfere\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aric cut her off with a harsh snarl. \u201cI\u2019m your brother\u2014your twin, Carys. And I love you. That gives me every right.\u201d</p><p>She slowly shook her head, glancing around at the silent spectators who made no effort to hide their rapt interest in the night\u2019s other, unplanned exhibit. When Carys looked back at Aric, her pupils had transformed from dilated circles to thinning, vertical slits. Although she projected total outward calm, Nathan and every other vampire in the place could plainly see the Breed female was furious.</p><p>Carys\u2019s voice was quiet, but as she spoke, her long fangs glinted razor-sharp and lethal in the low lights of the museum reception. \u201cGo home, Aric. For now, I\u2019ll forgive you because you claim you\u2019re doing this out of love for me. But this conversation is over.\u201d</p><p>The man at Jordana\u2019s side cleared his throat, an awkward interruption, and late as well. \u201cShall I call JUSTIS for assistance here, Carys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That won\u2019t be necessary, Elliott,\u201d she replied coolly. \u201cMy brother and his friends are leaving now.\u201d</p><p>Rafe stepped up beside Aric to take his other shoulder in a firm grasp. The two warriors were as tight as brothers, just like their fathers before them, Dante Malebranche and Sterling Chase, both long-standing members of the Order. When Aric didn\u2019t budge, Rafe cuffed him none too gently on the biceps. \u201cCome on, man. This is messed up and you know it. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Aric relaxed but kept his hard glare trained on his sister. \u201cEnd it, Carys. Don\u2019t make me do it for you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, wounded but unbowed. \u201cIf you so much as try, then I\u2019ll no longer have a brother.\u201d</p><p>The siblings faced off in tense silence, neither of them willing to bend to the other. Having watched the twins grow up within the extended family of the Order, Nathan had seen them lock horns on many occasions, but never like this. Their bond as brother and sister had always been iron strong and unbreakable, no matter how powerfully they clashed.</p><p>Tonight, Aric had stepped far over a line he had never crossed with his sister before. Not that he seemed willing to retreat.</p><p>Finally, Carys was first to let go of her fury. Head held high, she slowly pivoted away from Aric and strode back toward her friend Jordana and the rest of the stunned gathering as if the confrontation had never happened.</p><p>Aric stared after her for a moment, then wheeled around and stalked out of the museum. Rafe, Eli, and Jax fell in behind him, leaving Nathan alone to face the one other person still rooted to the floor and unmoving across the room.</p><p>At last, Jordana lifted her gaze to meet his once more.</p><p>Some savage, undisciplined part of him imagined how she would feel against him if he closed the distance now and hauled her into another uninvited kiss\u2014his, this time. On his terms.</p><p>At his mercy.</p><p>A dangerous temptation.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t make it any less intriguing.</p><p>Jordana held his stare for longer than he would have guessed she could. Longer than any woman would have dared, if she sensed the dark direction of his thoughts.</p><p>Her full lips parted on an indrawn breath as she looked at him, but she said nothing. She gave him nothing, standing there unmoving, her eyes locked on his as the music from the gallery began again and the reception resumed around her. Conversations buzzed once more, the crowds of museum patrons already putting the night\u2019s interruption behind them.</p><p>And still those ocean-blue eyes refused to let Nathan go.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the Breed male at Jordana\u2019s side cupped her bare nape in his palm that she finally glanced away. She smiled pleasantly at her companion, gave him a small nod. Then he took her hand and gently coaxed her back into the fold where she belonged, with the rest of the gilded elite.</p><p>3</p><p>ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW IT WASN\u2019T WISE, JORDANA COULDN\u2019T KEEP from glancing over her shoulder as she was led away from the scene of the night\u2019s disruption.</p><p>Nathan was still there.</p><p>Still watching her, his eyes simmering beneath the harsh black slashes of his brows, intimate and penetrating amid the very public throng of museum patrons. The massive Breed warrior was a study in darkness and intensity, from the severe cut of his military-style ebony hair, to the impossibly broad shoulders that topped a body honed of pure muscle and powerful, deadly menace.</p><p>Even his face was severe, if devastating, in its rugged male beauty. Fathomless dark eyes stared out of a face carved with a blade\u2019s precision. High cheekbones, proud brow, a squared, rigid jaw. His mouth was his softest feature by far, sculpted and lush, generous lips that called to mind all sorts of wicked ideas, even for a woman of Jordana\u2019s limited experience.</p><p>Nathan exuded a confidence few men seemed to possess. Perhaps that was why not even one male in the room made any move to confront him now. The women, however, practically vibrated with interest.</p><p>Not that Nathan seemed to notice any of the attention he drew.</p><p>He stared solely at Jordana. There was no mistaking the heat in his dark gaze; he looked ready to devour her. As if the thought of the crowd around them was of no consequence to him whatsoever.</p><p>Jordana struggled to find her breath under the weight of that piercing gaze. Her senses were keenly, instantly aware that if this powerful Breed male\u2014this warrior she\u2019d so foolishly kissed the other night\u2014were to decide he wanted something from her right now, not even the hundred men in the museum tonight would be able to keep him from her.</p><p>Even more alarming was her heart\u2019s reaction to that idea.</p><p>Save me, her pulse seemed to drum in her veins.</p><p>Take me.</p><p>The thoughts caught her unaware. Startled her, they were so unbidden and ridiculous.</p><p>Save her from what?</p><p>Take her where ... or how?</p><p>Her body answered that question with a warm throb deep in her core. The memory of their brief kiss replayed in her mind, only her imagination embellished the details now, turning an impulsive meeting of their lips into a passionate tangle of mouths and limbs and sweat-sheened, naked bodies.</p><p>God.</p><p>What was wrong with her that her mind would wander onto such a disturbing path?</p><p>And yet a swift, intense craving bloomed inside her as the mental picture filled her senses with an aching, terrible desire.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the way he\u2019s looking at you.\u201d</p><p>The baritone voice, muttered from close beside her, snapped Jordana out of her unwelcome musings like a splash of cold water to the face. She glanced away from dark, unsettling Nathan to blond, familiar Elliott Bentley-Squire, her self-appointed protector and date tonight. His handsome features were pinched into a disapproving frown. \u201cWhat do you know of that warrior, Jordana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she blurted, flustered by Elliott\u2019s notice and the still-burning sense of Nathan\u2019s eyes on her. Although her answer wasn\u2019t quite a lie, it left a bitter taste on her tongue. She shook her head and gave Elliott a vague shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know him at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood. Trust me when I say you wouldn\u2019t want to know that one. It\u2019s no secret that he\u2019s a killer, Jordana. One of those laboratory-raised monsters the Order seems so willing to recruit into their ranks.\u201d</p><p>As Elliott steered her farther toward the museum guests, Jordana chanced another look back to where Nathan stood.</p><p>He was gone.</p> <p>Why that should disappoint her, she didn\u2019t even want to guess.</p><p>As for Elliott\u2019s warning, she knew he wasn\u2019t exaggerating. Nathan had been born and raised under awful conditions. She\u2019d heard a little about his background from Carys over the past few days, information she\u2019d attempted to mine as casually as possible, afraid to let on even to Carys that her curiosity about Nathan was anything more than passing.</p><p>And it was only a passing curiosity, she insisted to herself now, despite the pang of sympathy she felt for the coolly remote warrior in light of his horrific upbringing.</p><p>Born to a Breedmate who\u2019d been abducted as a young woman and forced to breed, like many other captives who\u2019d been imprisoned in the lab of a madman named Dragos, Nathan had been created for one purpose: killing. As a baby, he and the other boys born into the program were taken away from their mothers and raised to be soldiers in Dragos\u2019s private army.</p><p>Worse than that\u2014they were born and raised to be emotionless machines. Assassins to be deployed on Dragos\u2019s whim to murder his enemies without mercy or remorse.</p> <p>Nathan had eventually been rescued by his mother and the Order, and he now led a squad of warriors for the Order\u2019s command center in Boston.</p><p>\u201cA Hunter,\u201d Jordana murmured belatedly.</p><p>Elliott frowned at her again. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunters. That\u2019s what they were called.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cHunter is too polite a term for what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he was,\u201d Jordana corrected him quietly, but Elliott wasn\u2019t listening, no longer interested in Nathan now that he was gone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry they ruined your reception,\u201d he said. \u201cYou worked so hard to make it perfect.\u201d</p><p>She dismissed the concern with a smile she didn\u2019t really feel. \u201cIt\u2019s not ruined.\u201d She gestured to the room full of well-heeled patrons at the private, invitation-only showing. The drone of conversation, even light laughter here and there, vibrated around them in the museum\u2019s main level. \u201cSee? Everyone\u2019s already moved on to enjoy the rest of the evening. You should too, Elliott. You worry too much about me sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I care,\u201d he said, reaching out to stroke the side of her face. \u201cAnd you should worry more than you do, particularly about the company you keep. What happened tonight will likely be gossiped about for weeks, if not longer.\u201d</p><p>Jordana drew away from his touch and his censure. \u201cIf tongues wag over this, it\u2019ll be free publicity for the exhibit. Museum contributions will probably double.\u201d</p><p>Elliott\u2019s look was skeptical, but he offered her a smile. \u201cI still think it was a mistake having Carys Chase host this event with you. The exhibit is your baby, Jordana. You\u2019ve been working on it for more than six months\u2014too long to let anything, or anyone, jeopardize its success. After all, how many times did you cancel or stand me up because your work kept you late at the museum?\u201d</p><p>Too many times to count, and Jordana inwardly winced at the reminder. Although Elliott was keeping his tone light, she knew it had wounded him that she\u2019d become so preoccupied and distant in recent months. She didn\u2019t want to hurt him or disappoint him.</p><p>Although they\u2019d never been intimate in the year they\u2019d been dating, Jordana did care deeply for him. She loved him. Of course, everyone loved Elliott Bentley-Squire. He was kind and attractive, wealthy and charitable. Everything that any woman could possibly want in a mate.</p><p>He was also a longtime family friend, having been her father, Martin\u2019s, attorney and business associate for several decades.</p> <p>Jordana\u2019s father, a male who had adopted her as an infant yet had never been inclined to take a Breedmate for himself in all his century of living, had hardly concealed the fact that he hoped Jordana might develop a fondness for Elliott. Despite that he was easily three times her age, being Breed like her father, Elliott Bentley-Squire was physically as fit and youthful as a thirty-year-old.</p><p>As for Jordana, her twenty-fifth birthday loomed less than a couple weeks away\u2014a date her father had emphasized since she was a child, reminding her constantly of the sizable trust she would be granted on that date, but only if she were mated and settled by then.</p><p>Not that she cared at all about the money. Neither did Elliott, who had already accumulated his own considerable riches.</p><p>No, their relationship had not been based on commerce or social standing. It had been the most natural thing in the world to assume that she and Elliott might one day seal their long-term friendship with a blood bond and take each other as their mate.</p><p>Except ...</p><p>Except the closer their relationship came to that eventuality, the more absorbed Jordana became in her work. It wasn\u2019t unusual for her to be at the museum seven days a week, including most nights. In her spare time, she served on a handful of charity boards and had picked up a couple of seats on city improvement boards.</p><p>She\u2019d developed a keen, consuming interest in a variety of things that had kept her too busy for any kind of social life. The upcoming art museum debut was only the most demanding of her long list of obligations.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been so tied up with the exhibit, Elliott. But you should know that Carys has worked on this as hard as I have. She deserved to host with me tonight. Besides, she\u2019s my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Jordana scanned the reception for Carys and found her near the rear of the exhibit, smiling and chatting with a deep-pocketed doctor and his wife. Although she was the picture of poise and professionalism now, Aric\u2019s awkward confrontation had to have upset her.</p><p>\u201cI should go make sure she\u2019s okay,\u201d Jordana said.</p><p>Elliott halted her with a small shake of his head before she even started to move. \u201cYou should attend your guests, Jordana,\u201d he advised gently. \u201cThey\u2019re here for you. Look around, they\u2019re all waiting for you. Carys will be fine until everyone is gone and the party is over.\u201d</p><p>He was right, and although she bristled a little at his hand now positioned at her elbow to guide her, Jordana nodded and fell in beside him as he led her toward a number of patrons she had yet to speak with that evening.</p><p>\u201cCarys Chase is not like you, Jordana,\u201d Elliott said quietly as they crossed the room. \u201cYou must see that, don\u2019t you, darling? She\u2019s too wild. Reckless. Whether that\u2019s due to her unusual Breed genetic makeup or an overly indulgent upbringing, I can only guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndulgent?\u201d Jordana nearly choked on a laugh. \u201cHave you met her father, Sterling Chase? Or her mother, Tavia, who\u2019s also Breed? Carys has always been held to exacting standards by her parents.\u201d That was one of the things that had made Jordana and her friend so close. Although they seemed very different on the surface, Carys being a bit too adventurous and Jordana suffering from chronic overcautiousness, the two young women had much in common. \u201cCarys and I may be different in some ways, but that\u2019s what I happen to enjoy so much about her. Is being a little wild and reckless such a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d said it playfully, a small volley of flirtation in Elliott\u2019s direction, just to test the waters. His mouth flattened and his blue eyes leveled on her from his sidelong look. \u201cWild and reckless usually gets someone hurt. You\u2019re smarter than that, Jordana.\u201d He reached over and gave her nose a light tap of his fingertip. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I happen to enjoy so much about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCounselor,\u201d called a jovial, elderly man who chaired one of Boston\u2019s biggest banks. In addition to being one of Elliott\u2019s human clients, he was also one of the museum\u2019s most generous donors. His contributions to Jordana\u2019s exhibit had helped her add ten more pieces to the sculpture collection.</p><p>\u201cCounselor, good to see you!\u201d the old man exclaimed, from beside his group of equally prominent colleagues representing the elite of both Breed and human society. \u201cCome here and give us an excuse to talk to your lovely fianc\u00e9e about Italian sculptors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure, Mr. Bonneville.\u201d Elliott chuckled and steered Jordana toward the men. She forced a pleasant smile, allowing Elliott to take her hand in his warm, firm grasp as he practically pulled her along beside him. Dutifully, she shook hands with the banker and his colleagues, and with the other patrons who soon came to join their little circle.</p><p>Jordana smiled and laughed at all the appropriate times, hoping no one could tell that her heart was now battering around in her breast like a caged bird that would find a way out or die trying.</p><p>At the urging of Elliott and her growing audience, she regaled them with a discussion of her favorite works in the exhibit by Italian masters Bernini, Canova, Cornacchini, and other lesser-known artists.</p><p>God knew she needed the distraction.</p><p>Because if she didn\u2019t have something keeping her feet rooted to the floor, Jordana was afraid she might be tempted to do something really wild and reckless.</p><p>She might walk out of the place\u2014out of her perfect life\u2014and never look back.</p><p>4</p><p>THAT NEXT MORNING, NATHAN AND HIS TEAM SAT AROUND THE large table in the conference room of the Order\u2019s command center in Boston, reviewing their failure to locate Cassian Gray and putting together a new plan for their patrol set to begin again at sundown. Boston\u2019s district chief, Sterling Chase, had every right to hand Nathan and his men their asses for returning to base empty-handed last night, but he seemed distracted today, his head not quite in the game.</p><p>Unusual for the experienced warrior who had twenty years with the Order and another few decades of Breed law enforcement under his belt before that.</p><p>Tavia Chase, Sterling\u2019s mate and a member of the Order in her own right, was also present in the morning\u2019s mission review and also less than fully engaged. She was seated with her spine rigid against the back of her chair. Her arms lay crossed in front of her, but the fingers of one hand drummed ceaselessly on her toned biceps. Her green gaze was distant, shadowed with a troubled preoccupation.</p><p>Had Aric and Carys brought last night\u2019s anger home with them? Nathan was by no means an expert on reading emotion or weighing familial strife, but he had to wonder if that was the problem here today for Chase and Tavia.</p><p>Aric hadn\u2019t betrayed his sister to their parents; that much Nathan did know.</p><p>The younger warrior had gone straight to the weapons room of the command center to work off steam after Nathan and the others brought him back to Headquarters. No doubt, he would be at it for a while, not only for the way he\u2019d been frothing but also because Aric wasn\u2019t part of the team\u2019s morning conference.</p><p>Fresh out of training and not yet a full-fledged member of the Order, in a few weeks he would find his own squad of warriors in Seattle, when he was scheduled to report to Dante Malebranche, Rafe\u2019s father, the head of that West Coast command center.</p><p>When the heavy mood in the room lengthened, Chase finally cleared his throat and brought the meeting back on task. \u201cWhen we wrap up here, I have to call Lucan Thorne in D.C. and tell him we came up empty on Cassian Gray last night.\u201d Chase\u2019s shrewd blue eyes swept each warrior at the table, pausing the longest on Nathan. \u201cI know I don\u2019t need to tell any of you that the Order\u2019s founder does not like failure. I don\u2019t fucking like failure much either. But I hate excuses even more. So I\u2019m not going to ask how the best team I ever trained\u2014my most effective squad leader\u2014pulled a patrol before either seeing it through to completion or running full-stop into daybreak.\u201d</p><p>Neither Nathan nor his comrades spoke. Even if Chase had demanded to know what had caused the mission to search for Cass to be aborted, none of them would have thrown Aric under that bus.</p><p>Besides, Nathan agreed with his commander: Blame solved nothing. And the truth was, Nathan felt equally culpable. He\u2019d gone easily enough to the museum reception after Aric.</p><p>And while he was admitting damning truths and personal derelictions of duty, Nathan had to count among his the fact that his curiosity about Jordana Gates hadn\u2019t ended when he returned to Headquarters with his team.</p><p>While Aric had vented his fury in the weapons room, Nathan had spent several hours online and in the Breed nation\u2019s International Identification Database, researching Jordana\u2019s apparent date at the event.</p><p>Or, rather, her imminent mate, Elliott Bentley-Squire.</p><p>Nathan had delved into every documented fact and figure he could find\u2014all told, hours of digging. But he\u2019d found no reason to dislike the wealthy, socially acceptable male.</p><p>Nor did he care to acknowledge that he\u2019d been looking for cause to despise the trusted friend of Jordana\u2019s father, simply for the way she had let Bentley-Squire touch her, even though her eyes hadn\u2019t seemed able to break Nathan\u2019s gaze from the moment they first saw each other at the party.</p><p>The look in Jordana\u2019s eyes haunted him, even now. As if she\u2019d been silently pleading for him to rescue her ... to claim her.</p><p>Until her would-be mate noticed her distraction and Jordana had denied even knowing who Nathan was.</p><p>If he needed a reason to convince himself that beautiful, tempting Jordana Gates was a bad idea, certainly this was it. Nathan preferred his sexual dalliances to be uncomplicated, impersonal. A biological satisfaction of something his body needed in order to perform at its peak.</p><p>The way he viewed it, fucking was no different than feeding.</p><p>And he preferred to do neither close to the place he called home.</p><p>\u201cWe did learn something about Cassian Gray last night,\u201d Nathan said, bringing his thoughts back in line where they belonged. \u201cCass\u2019s office at La Notte was orderly, too much so. Anything of value to someone looking into him or his interests had been removed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To the left of Nathan at the table, Rafe smirked. \u201cHis private apartment had been vacated too, except for an interesting collection of restraints and spiked collars in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Elijah and Jax chuckled along with Rafe, but Nathan remained serious, glad to put his mind back on the trail of their quarry. \u201cCass already knows he\u2019s being pursued. His employees at the club said we\u2019d just missed him, but it\u2019s probable they were lying to us. My guess is he cleared out of there days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if Cass realized he\u2019d been outed the moment Kellan touched him.\u201d This from Tavia, her first comment of the entire morning. \u201cHe might be fully aware that the Order suspects he\u2019s not human and would come after him soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>Nathan nodded with the rest of the warriors around the table. Kellan Archer was recently reunited with the Order and since mated to Mira, one of the few female squad captains. The couple had been at La Notte on a mission of their own no more than a week ago, when Kellan and Cassian Gray became embroiled in a brief altercation. Kellan pushed the club owner, tactile contact that had roused the Breed male\u2019s unique psychic gift to read human intention with a touch.</p><p>Cassian Gray had been a blank slate.</p><p>Cass wasn\u2019t Breed; there was no mistaking that fact. But Kellan had realized at once the man wasn\u2019t human either.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been sure what else Cass could be\u2014no one had been\u2014until a few nights ago in Washington, D.C., at a global peace summit event that had ended in an act of terror meant to sabotage the gathering and blow hundreds of Breed lives away in the process.</p><p>Lucan Thorne and most of the Order\u2019s elder members included.</p> <p>The individual who\u2019d tried to carry out the plot under the banner of a shadowy organization called Opus Nostrum hadn\u2019t been human or Breed.</p><p>No, Reginald Crowe had been something else entirely: Atlantean.</p><p>Known publicly around the world as a billionaire business magnate with holdings all over the globe, Crowe was, in actuality, one of a powerful race of immortals that had existed on Earth unknown for millennia. They had been as much a secret to the human population as the Breed.</p><p>And now the Order understood the Atlanteans to be an even greater threat than any enemy they\u2019d ever faced before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three days since Crowe\u2019s death and it\u2019s still trending on all the news outlets around the world,\u201d Jax said, spinning one of his hira-shuriken stars on the conference table. \u201cIf Cass is Atlantean, the killing of one of his own by the Order would be enough to send him to ground.\u201d</p><p>Eli exhaled a drawled curse. \u201cUnfortunately, Crowe\u2019s death\u2014and all the shit that went down before that\u2014was a little too public to be contained.\u201d</p> <p>The ultraviolet bomb at the summit had been only one of Crowe\u2019s crimes in his role as Opus Nostrum\u2019s leader. Before plotting to derail the gathering and ash every Breed dignitary in the building, Crowe\u2019s cabal had arranged for the murder of a brilliant human scientist and that man\u2019s uncle, a senior member of the Global Nations Council, the governing arm responsible for ensuring peaceful relations between the vampire and human populations of the world.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, we\u2019re at a disadvantage right now,\u201d Chase interjected. \u201cThe only good to come of the exposure of Crowe\u2019s actions and his death is the fact that now the public, Breed and man, is united in their fear of Opus Nostrum. Only the Order is aware of the Atlanteans and the bigger threat Crowe divulged before he died.\u201d</p><p>The threat of a brewing global war being plotted at the hands of the Atlanteans and their exiled queen.</p><p>\u201cThe Order has already waged a battle\u2014and won\u2014against a sinister member of our own race,\u201d Tavia murmured quietly. \u201cTo think that another, more insidious enemy has been lurking in the shadows all this time ...\u201d She slowly shook her head, unwilling or unable to finish the grave direction of her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll win again, love.\u201d Chase reached over to stroke his mate\u2019s cheek, then he turned his steely, determined gaze on Nathan and the others. \u201cLucan is making a very public show of working with human and Breed law enforcement to root out Opus Nostrum. However, the Order\u2019s primary mission is something far more crucial, more covert. If what Crowe said is true, then everything we\u2019ve been through to this point in time\u2014including our hard-won battle with Dragos\u2014was merely preparation for the war still to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Cassian Gray knows anything about Crowe\u2019s threat,\u201d Tavia added, \u201cworse, if he\u2019s part of it, he has to be contained. We can\u2019t let him get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Chase assured her. \u201cLucan has arranged for each of Crowe\u2019s former wives\u2014his widow and the five exes who came before her\u2014to be quietly interviewed at the D.C. headquarters.\u201d</p><p>Rafe grunted, his mouth spreading into a wide grin. \u201cInvitations to tea, followed by a friendly game of twenty questions and a mind-scrub?\u201d</p> <p>Chase slid him a wry look. \u201cSomething like that, yeah. If any of the women who knew Crowe best have any knowledge about his true nature or his dealings as part of Opus Nostrum, we\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for Cass,\u201d Nathan said, \u201cwe\u2019ll find him too. We\u2019ll bring him in. His employees, his known allies and associates\u2014we\u2019ll leave no lead unturned. Tell Lucan, neither Cass nor his secrets will elude us for long.\u201d</p><p>Chase gave him a tight nod. \u201cExcellent,\u201d he said, and dropped his open palms to the table in finality. He rose from his seat, and the rest of the group stood up with him. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, Tavia and I have some personal business of our own to contend with this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Carys,\u201d Tavia volunteered to Nathan and the other warriors. \u201cShe\u2019s moving out. Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving out,\u201d Nathan murmured guardedly, surprised by the news, though surely not as surprised as the young woman\u2019s parents must be. \u201cThat seems like a sudden decision.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, he caught the uncomfortable looks exchanged between his teammates as all three made a hasty exit from the conference room.</p><p>The bastards.</p><p>He\u2019d punish them later for abandoning him to this unwanted drama.</p><p>\u201cCarys says she\u2019s been considering this for a while now,\u201d Chase replied. \u201cBut I know my daughter, and she\u2019s holding something back. I\u2019ve already asked Aric if he knew of any reason she might be upset about something\u2014or upset with us\u2014but he\u2019s been no more forthcoming than her.\u201d</p><p>Nathan grunted. \u201cDo you know where she\u2019s going?\u201d</p><p>Tavia answered him. \u201cShe\u2019s moving in with Jordana at her apartment across town. Nathan, do you know anything about this?\u201d</p><p>He gave a slight shake of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s the first I\u2019m hearing of it.\u201d The answer was as close to the truth as he could slice it without betraying the sibling conflict of the night before.</p><p>\u201cI realize Carys is an adult, and she\u2019s free to live her own life,\u201d Tavia reasoned aloud. \u201cShe\u2019s always been impulsive, but this just doesn\u2019t seem like her. More than that, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to let go of her,\u201d she added, turning a baleful look on Chase. \u201cI know, I\u2019d never truly be ready for this day to come, but especially not now, knowing dangerous people like Cassian Gray are skulking around, unaccounted for. Who knows what he or his cage-fighting thugs might do if they realized one of the Order\u2019s children\u2014a female, no less\u2014was living somewhere in the city away from our protection?\u201d</p><p>A growl vibrated in Chase\u2019s chest now. \u201cI\u2019ll forbid her to leave.\u201d</p><p>Tavia sighed. \u201cYou can\u2019t and you know it. Trying to force her will only make her dig her heels in harder. Carys is a headstrong young woman\u2014not that either of her parents should be surprised by that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chase replied, his eyes gentle on his mate, even if his tone remained firm. \u201cBut if she\u2019s leaving because she\u2019s got a head full of steam over something, or if she\u2019s in some kind of trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tavia shook her head. \u201cIf she\u2019s upset or in any trouble, you know she\u2019ll only try to shield us from worrying about her. Nathan, what do you think? Are we being too protective if we try to make her stay?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. How he\u2019d found himself in the role of family mediator, Nathan had no bloody idea.</p><p>But it was difficult not to be moved by Chase and Tavia\u2019s obvious love and concern for their child, even if Carys was a full-grown woman, twenty years old. She was stronger than most later-generation Breed males, and more than capable of taking care of herself.</p><p>\u201cYou raised her to be independent\u2014Aric too. If Carys feels she\u2019s ready to live on her own, she\u2019s going to do it. No matter what anyone says or thinks. But if you\u2019ll sleep better knowing my team and I will keep a close eye on her, consider it done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Nathan,\u201d Tavia said, exhaling her relief while Chase gathered his mate close and gave Nathan a brief nod of appreciation for his offer. The three of them exited the conference room to the corridor outside. They paused there, and Tavia lifted her head from where it rested against Chase\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI still think it can\u2019t hurt to talk to her one more time, see if I can persuade her to change her mind.\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned. \u201cYour powers of persuasion may work flawlessly on me, love, but good luck dealing with your daughter. And you\u2019d better work fast. She\u2019s upstairs now, packing up her things with Jordana.\u201d</p><p>Nathan stood there as the couple excused themselves and strolled away hand in hand.</p><p>Jordana Gates was there right now, upstairs in the estate. Helping Carys collect her belongings, a task that would likely keep Jordana under the same roof as Nathan for the next couple of hours at least.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>He pivoted abruptly and stalked down the corridor in the opposite direction of Chase and Tavia, toward the passage that would lead him to the weapons room.</p><p>It was about as far away from the living quarters of the mansion as he could get. A few hours of physical training was just what he needed. Hell, the way his blood was churning through his veins now, he might not come up for air until the night\u2019s patrol was ready to head out.</p><p>With any luck, by the time he surfaced, Carys and her new roommate would be long gone.</p><p>5</p><p>JORDANA BLEW OUT A SIGH AS SHE CAME TO A STOP IN A LONG, empty corridor\u2014one of many confusing arteries in the Chases\u2019 sprawling estate.</p><p>Had Carys said to turn left-left-right-left once she was in the Order\u2019s command center wing of the mansion, or left-right-left-left?</p><p>Shit.</p><p>A simple quest to fetch more packing tape for her friend had now delivered Jordana deep into the warriors\u2019 domain. It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d wanted to be there. Not when the odds of encountering Nathan in that part of the mansion seemed a bit too likely for her peace of mind.</p><p>But Carys had been insistent. She\u2019d made it seem like no big thing at all: \u201cJust run down to the central supply room and grab another roll of tape for me, will you? Take you not even ten minutes round trip, and I\u2019ll have this box of shoes ready to go by the time you get back.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Jordana was still wandering the corridors, becoming more turned around with each step she took.</p><p>She was sure she\u2019d followed Carys\u2019s directions correctly ...</p><p>Whether she did or not, she was definitely in the wrong place now. Ahead of her at the far end of the passageway was a set of steel double doors with a security access panel mounted to the right of them on the wall. Above the doors, the dark, unblinking eye of a surveillance camera stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Carys,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNext time you have a fool\u2019s errand to run, you\u2019re doing it yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jordana edged backward a few steps, hoping she didn\u2019t look as uncomfortable or idiotic as she felt to whoever might be monitoring the corridor. Then again, it was probably too late to worry about that. She just needed to get out of there, before she wandered any farther afield.</p><p>Spinning on her heel, she hurried back the way she came. She was jogging at a good clip by the time she reached the end of the hallway and rounded the corner\u2014</p><p>Only to run full tilt into a wall of unmovable, warm flesh and bone.</p><p>Nathan.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>He caught her by her upper arms, muttering a curse that didn\u2019t sound happy to see her either. \u201cI might\u2019ve guessed,\u201d he growled, more to himself than her. \u201cNever did have much faith in luck.\u201d</p><p>Jordana struggled to find her voice for a second. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Caught in his grasp with only inches between them, she stood there immobile, her hands splayed on his broad chest. Though he was wearing a T-shirt, her palms burned with the heat rolling off the firm planes and bulges of his body beneath the soft black cotton that covered him.</p><p>His eyes bored into her, and she realized she never knew what color they were until now. Deep, greenish blue, they looked like the sky just before the arrival of a brutal storm.</p><p>That same dark, arresting stare had held her across the room of the museum last night.</p><p>Demanding.</p><p>Possessive.</p><p>Even now, she found it hard to tear herself away from Nathan\u2019s unnerving gaze. \u201cI, um ... I was looking for packing tape for Carys,\u201d she blurted. \u201cShe gave me directions for the supply room, but I must be lost.\u201d</p><p>He grunted, one black brow lifting almost imperceptibly.</p><p>Jordana rushed on, hating how he unsettled her. \u201cUsually when I\u2019m here at the mansion, I keep to the residential areas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong down here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The words were rough gravel, a deep rumble that vibrated through her spread fingers, which were still pressed against his chest.</p><p>The low thunder of his voice traveled into her limbs. Into the suddenly quivering center of her body.</p><p>Jordana yanked her hands away from him, cradling her crossed fists to her breast. \u201cI\u2019m just ... I\u2019m going to go now, then.\u201d</p> <p>God help her, but he kept on staring at her, watching her dangle on the strings of her own unease around him. His harsh, handsome face was so unreadable, she wondered if he was actually looking at her or through her.</p><p>The way he studied her, Jordana felt ... exposed. She felt stripped and vulnerable under his penetrating eyes. Completely at his mercy.</p><p>His dark eyes drifted to her mouth and she was instantly reminded of the kiss they shared. Well, not shared exactly, considering she was the one who\u2019d done all the kissing.</p><p>Nathan had stood there much the way he was now, rock solid, unshakable.</p><p>Maddeningly cool and in control.</p> <p>Jordana wondered how he did it\u2014how he could seem so unaffected yet hold her in a gaze that made her instincts come alive with an anticipation bordering on the profane. Ever fiber in her body was tuned to him, even though her head was telling her to run away. Telling her to avoid this dangerous man and the dark temptations that lurked in his stormy eyes.</p><p>What did her senses know about Nathan that her mind had not yet grasped?</p><p>Maybe if she kissed him again, she could figure out what it was about this Breed male that had her so flustered and confused.</p><p>A low snarl gathered at the back of his throat now. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a request. It was a command, and even though she wanted desperately to refuse, her feet were already moving beneath her, following his gruff order.</p><p>Jordana assumed he was bringing her back to the residential wing of the estate. Instead, she soon found herself trailing him down another snaking corridor, heading for a closed door near the end of the passageway.</p> <p>Nathan opened the door, then turned to her. \u201cInside.\u201d</p><p>She glanced past him to the unlit room on the other side of the threshold.</p><p>And apparently her body still trusted him more than her head, because she walked into the inky gloom without so much as a word of doubt.</p><p>He followed her in, so close she could feel his body heat searing the length of her back.</p><p>It was impossible not to acknowledge the danger of walking into a dark room in a long, empty corridor with the most lethal man she would probably ever know.</p><p>And yet her pulse was kicking in her veins. Her skin felt tight, too warm. Not with fear, even though it should be.</p><p>Expectation was a taut coil, twisting in her stomach ... and lower still.</p><p>When would he touch her?</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a question of if; she knew that in the same way she knew that when he did finally put his hands on her, she would let him.</p><p>Jordana waited to feel his fingers against her skin, his breath in her hair. She craved it, wanting it so badly in that moment, she could hardly breathe.</p><p>Nathan shifted behind her. He moved even closer now, and Jordana closed her eyes, lungs frozen.</p><p>A light flicked on overhead.</p><p>After the engulfing darkness of a moment ago, it blared jarringly bright, illuminating the small, enclosed surroundings.</p><p>\u201cThe supply room,\u201d Jordana whispered, trying to convince herself she was relieved.</p><p>Nathan stepped past her and prowled over to a tower of sturdy metal shelves. He grabbed a thick roll of clear tape from among a variety of stacked office products and tech equipment.</p><p>He returned, tape in hand, but drew it back when Jordana reached to take it from him.</p><p>\u201cCarys is moving out today.\u201d When Jordana nodded, he narrowed his eyes on her. \u201cBecause of what happened last night between her and Aric?\u201d</p><p>Jordana shook her head. \u201cNo. Because it\u2019s time. She wants to live her life.\u201d</p><p>Nathan made a dubious noise in the back of his throat. \u201cWhat kind of a life do you expect she\u2019ll have with a male like Rune?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to judge,\u201d Jordana replied. \u201cBesides, she\u2019s moving in with me, not him. What happens between Carys and Rune is their business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil he hurts her. Or worse,\u201d Nathan warned.</p><p>\u201cRune would never hurt Carys. He loves her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nathan scoffed. \u201cThat what he\u2019s telling her?\u201d</p><p>Jordana frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s told her as much, yes. But I see it when they\u2019re together too. Carys and Rune are deeply in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re some kind of expert in that emotion, I suppose.\u201d Something dark glimmered in his unwavering gaze. \u201cYou can tell what\u2019s in a man\u2019s heart just by looking at him?\u201d</p><p>Jordana had to work to keep from squirming in his presence. He wasn\u2019t talking about Rune and Carys now. She knew that, but imagining he might be talking about himself was a path she didn\u2019t dare tread.</p><p>Not here.</p><p>Not when she had nowhere to escape, even if she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cCarys is a grown woman,\u201d Jordana said, hoping to put the focus back where it belonged. \u201cIf she decides to be with Rune\u2014even if she takes him as her blood-bonded mate someday\u2014that\u2019s entirely up to her. No matter what you or her family thinks would be best for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really believed that, I doubt you\u2019d be with someone like Elliott Bentley-Squire.\u201d</p><p>Jordana couldn\u2019t even try to hide the fact that she was totally taken aback. \u201cYou know Elliott?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his shoulder in a negligent shrug. \u201cI know everything I need to know about him. I don\u2019t find him all that interesting. Which makes me wonder why you do.\u201d It was an impolite question, but Nathan didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cYou and Elliott Bentley-Squire have been a foregone conclusion for the past year, give or take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cLong time,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cAnd yet no blood bond.\u201d</p><p>Jordana frowned, feeling a need to defend herself. Elliott too. \u201cHe and I have known each other forever. Elliott has been a family friend since I was a child.\u201d When Nathan\u2019s face remained impassive, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll make things official when we\u2019re ready. We\u2019re in no hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d he agreed, but his tone was anything but light. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen of the man\u2019s professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9, it doesn\u2019t indicate an inability to close a deal. So I\u2019m guessing the problem must lie with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no problem,\u201d she insisted, surprised at how desperately she wanted to convince him of that. Right now, standing just a foot away from Nathan in the seclusion of the supply room, she needed to convince herself that she belonged to Elliott Bentley-Squire. Jordana lifted her chin. \u201cYou seem to think you know a lot about Elliott and me. Do you make a practice of invading civilians\u2019 privacy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Only women who make it a practice of kissing me, then insisting to their presumptive mates that they have no idea who I am.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Before he left the museum, Nathan must have heard her deny knowing him to Elliott. Jordana winced, remorseful now. She gave a mild shake of her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf you have to lie to Bentley-Squire to keep him happy, it\u2019s none of my concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, ignoring the jab. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m sorry about that night in my apartment ... when I kissed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d He didn\u2019t believe her. His tone was cool and level, but it contained a dangerous edge.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what came over me. I\u2019ve never done anything like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down, searching for an answer that would make sense to herself as well as to him. \u201cI did it because I was afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem afraid, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of what you might do if you found out Carys was there with Rune that night. I only wanted to stop you from finding out. I just wanted to distract you.\u201d</p><p>His face darkened in challenge. \u201cThere were a dozen different ways you could\u2019ve done that, none of which would\u2019ve involved putting your mouth on mine.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, feeling her cheeks go warm and red. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve already apologized. It was a mistake, and I\u2019m sorry, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>The way he looked at her brought every nuance of their kiss back to life in her senses\u2014the cushion of his mouth beneath hers, the softness of his lips combined with the rough abrasion of his dark-shadowed jaw. The powerful stillness of his body as she threw herself against him.</p><p>Punishing muscle and lethal strength caged inside a rigid, total control.</p><p>Some brazen part of her she barely recognized throbbed with the want to know that kiss again\u2014to have a taste of what it would be like to press against this deadly male and see if he ever let his iron discipline slip, even a little.</p><p>More uncomfortable heat flooded her face at the uninvited direction of her thoughts.</p><p>And deep inside her, another unsettling heat bloomed ...</p><p>Nathan\u2019s gaze lingered on her, those eyes seeing everything about her. Knowing everything. Ruthless in their study of her.</p><p>Jordana grew anxious suddenly, afraid that Nathan might touch her.</p><p>Afraid he might kiss her.</p><p>Afraid he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that tape now,\u201d she said, her voice thick and raspy.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give it to her, didn\u2019t move. \u201cTell me what you see in Elliott Bentley-Squire.\u201d</p><p>Jordana stared up into Nathan\u2019s dark eyes. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Although talking about Elliott was the last thing she wanted to do in that moment, Jordana drew a breath and tried to conjure words. \u201cHe\u2019s kind and affectionate,\u201d she murmured lamely. \u201cHe\u2019s loyal and steady and attentive ...\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s lips twisted with dark amusement. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019d expect you to describe a pet, not the man who\u2019s fucking you.\u201d</p><p>The frankness shocked her, embarrassed her. But she was also unwillingly aroused by Nathan\u2019s lack of delicacy. There was a rawness about him that was unlike anything she was accustomed to.</p><p>She was playing with fire where this dangerous male was concerned, and it only made her want to dance closer to the flame.</p><p>\u201cElliott and I are not lovers,\u201d she said, pushing the words out of her mouth before she was too afraid to bite them back. \u201cI\u2019ve never been with him in that way.\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in the depths of his dark eyes. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want him like that either.\u201d</p><p>Jordana frowned, hating that Nathan could know that about her so easily. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anyone like that. There\u2019s been ... no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one?\u201d Nathan seemed to go even more still where he stood. The only movement she could detect in him was the ticking of a tendon along the line of his jaw. \u201cHe wants you, this Elliott Bentley-Squire. He\u2019s waited a year to bond you to him by blood. How long do you think you can keep him from claiming you, Jordana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElliott is a patient man. He\u2019ll wait until I decide it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Nathan gave a harsh grunt. \u201cThen he\u2019s not the kind of mate you need. Not the kind of male a woman like you deserves.\u201d</p><p>She collected her courage enough to meet his challenge with one of her own. \u201cWhat could you possibly know about what I need or deserve?\u201d</p><p>He stepped in tighter to her, crowding her backward with the massive breadth of his body. \u201cHave you ever kissed Elliott Bentley-Squire the way you kissed me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, couldn\u2019t form words with him this close to her.</p><p>\u201cHas he ever made your cheeks flame just by looking at you, or made your pulse beat like a hammer in your veins because of the things you wish he\u2019d do to you?\u201d</p><p>Jordana swallowed. She exhaled a shaky breath edged with a humiliating whimper. Somehow she managed to find her voice amid the tumult of confusion and dark, unwanted desire that was swirling like a tempest inside her. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re arrogant enough to believe that I should want someone like you instead?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled then, low and humorless. \u201cNo, Jordana. I\u2019m the last kind of man you should want in your life ... or in your bed.\u201d</p><p>And yet he didn\u2019t move away from her. He just kept her caged with his body for a seemingly endless moment of time.</p><p>His irises crackled with tiny sparks of amber as he stared at her. Only the barest tips of his fangs were noticeable behind the lush line of his upper lip.</p><p>Jordana felt him reach between the scant distance of their bodies to take her hand. His fingers were warm and strong, so large and commanding as he held her in his firm, guiding grasp.</p><p>He uncurled her loose fist, only to place something hard and round, cold and sleek, in her palm. Of course. The roll of packing tape.</p><p>\u201cGo back to where you belong now, Jordana.\u201d He drew away from her at last, leaving her standing in a chilled, confused state of arousal and rejection. \u201cGet out,\u201d he said, a warning in the curt command.</p><p>Jordana held the tape to her chest and could hardly scramble for the door fast enough.</p><p>As she started to rush for the corridor, he added, \u201cThat kiss was a mistake, Jordana\u2014for both of us. But don\u2019t expect me to believe you\u2019re any more sorry than I am that it happened.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>IF HIS MORNING HAD STARTED OFF IN A BAD WAY, BY AFTERNOON it hadn\u2019t improved a bit. After his encounter with Jordana, as much as Nathan craved an outlet for his tightly leashed aggression, he didn\u2019t want to risk killing any of his teammates if he joined them in the day\u2019s combat exercises in the weapons room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead, he\u2019d spent the bulk of the day in the command center\u2019s technology lab, digging into public records\u2014and some not so public\u2014in his search for intel on Cassian Gray.</p><p>All he\u2019d discovered was that the man was proving to be as elusive on paper as he was in person. For all the lack of information, it was as if Cass had been taking careful steps to cover his tracks from the moment he first surfaced in Boston twenty-some years ago.</p><p>As if he\u2019d been planning all along for the day he\u2019d need to vanish.</p> <p>Nathan downloaded what little he had on Cass to a mission intel file, then shut down the computer and left the lab. With sundown just a few hours away, he had time to get in some solo training and prep his weapons for the night\u2019s patrol with his team.</p><p>His body was still tense, aggression still riding him, and he knew damn well it had less to do with frustration over a stymied mission than it did a certain platinum-haired, Darkhaven beauty he had no right to desire.</p><p>An unschooled virgin besides.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Never mind the fact that she was Carys Chase\u2019s best friend\u2014as of today, her roommate besides\u2014and the darling of Boston\u2019s high society, Breed and human alike. Never mind that she had all but promised herself to another male, out of obligation or naivete, it didn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>No, Jordana Gates was off limits for many reasons, but most of all this: Because she was pure. She was innocent.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be the one to take that from her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take that from anyone, not the way his hungers ran.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been merely trying to scare Jordana when he told her that he was the last man she\u2019d want in her bed. It had been a warning. One he hoped to hell she took to heart, because God help her if she trusted him to be the hero.</p><p>On a curse, Nathan stalked into the vacant armory of the Order\u2019s weapons room. He stripped off his black T-shirt and powered himself through a punishing hour of solo exercise with a pair of long daggers. The exertion woke up his muscles and bones, reminded his body of what it was trained to do.</p><p>More important, it woke up his Hunter\u2019s mind, put his thoughts in ruthless focus on executing the patrol ahead of him in the city tonight.</p> <p>Elsewhere, in the main arena of the weapons facility, he could hear Rafe, Eli, and Jax still running one another through the paces of mock combat. A fourth voice\u2014Aric must have joined them at some point\u2014whooped as blades clanked and sawed together, steel meeting steel.</p><p>Nathan finished his solo maneuvers and hit the shower. He hoped to be in and gone before the other warriors wrapped up their work in the adjacent room, but no sooner had he stepped under the hot spray than footsteps falling heavy on tile and lighthearted insults sounded in the locker area outside.</p><p>Elijah\u2019s low drawl echoed over the rest of the men. \u201cDamn, someone tell me why I thought that fifth round of hand-to-hand and blade work was a good idea.\u201d A moment later, the brown-haired vampire swaggered naked into the showers, slanting Nathan a casual nod of greeting.</p><p>Eli took his place across from Nathan and turned on the spray, groaning as the hot water coursed over him. Blood ran in thin, diluted rivulets down Eli\u2019s dermaglyph-covered arms and legs from wounds he\u2019d sustained in the practice, but already the lacerations were beginning to heal.</p><p>Minor injuries were of no consequence to their kind. Cuts and contusions vanished in minutes, sometimes less time than that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a sore loser,\u201d Aric Chase taunted. Grinning, he strode in and took a spot two down from Elijah. Rafe and Jax followed him inside, briefly acknowledging Nathan before going to separate corners of the showers. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Eli,\u201d Aric pressed, \u201cdon\u2019t want to admit you got trounced by a trainee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrainee,\u201d he said, smirking as he glanced at the younger warrior and sluiced water off his face. \u201cDaywalking, smartass punk, more like it. You\u2019re good with a weapon, I\u2019ll give you that. But don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice you waited to take me on until after I\u2019d already gone four rounds with two warriors who actually know how to fight.\u201d</p><p>Aric chuckled as he soaped up and shot a look at Rafe across the room. \u201cYou know, for a Texan, he\u2019s sure got a fragile ego. Must be that weaker, late-generation Breed blood in him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe hell you say.\u201d Eli snorted, his drawl thicker now. \u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 fragile about me. Next time you ask me to spar, I\u2019m gonna drop you on your daywalker ass before I kick it from here to the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>Aric laughed and rinsed off the suds. \u201cTell you what. If it\u2019ll make you feel better, I\u2019ll give you a handicap next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a handicap right now, sunshine.\u201d Elijah flashed his fangs at the other vampire and made a fast swat at Aric, cuffing his flaccid dick. It was a jest and a challenge\u2014one Aric tried to return, but wasn\u2019t quick enough.</p><p>Both laughing now, Eli grabbed him in a headlock under the water and let him sputter for a few seconds before letting him go. Before long, Jax and Rafe joined in the skirmish, the four big males wrestling around like a close-knit wolf pack.</p><p>Like the tight band of brothers they were.</p><p>Nathan watched for a moment, detached from the camaraderie. For all his expertise in stealth and combat, game play was a concept that eluded him. It went against his nature. Against the rigid discipline that had made him a consummate killer by the time he was seven years old.</p><p>He chased.</p><p>He conquered.</p><p>He destroyed.</p><p>His training as a boy in the Hunters\u2019 cells permitted nothing less. And although his rescue at age thirteen had saved Nathan, a part of him had never come out of Dragos\u2019s lab and likely never would.</p><p>He was the fighting dog, rescued from the squalor and violence of the betting pits and brought into a kind, loving home to live a better life.</p><p>He had been spared, given a new chance. He had parents and friends he cared for. He had fellow warriors who would die for him, as he would for them.</p><p>Yet, like the dog removed from the ring, when a hand reached out to him\u2014in play or in comfort\u2014it was all he could do to keep from biting it.</p><p>The distance between who he was now and what he\u2019d been raised to be was a thin razor\u2019s edge that he toed with meticulous discipline each and every day. No one knew the effort it took for him to seem normal. To appear that he fit in with decent people, that he belonged.</p><p>They saw what he wanted them to see, and nothing more.</p><p>No one knew him beyond what he\u2019d allowed them to perceive.</p><p>No one took anything from him that he wasn\u2019t prepared to give up.</p><p>No one ever had, until Jordana Gates.</p><p>His blood ran hot at the thought of her, their conversation\u2014and the all-too-tempting memory of her body in such close proximity to his\u2014making his veins light up with hunger.</p><p>If he\u2019d thought the beautiful Breedmate an unwanted distraction before, crossing paths with her this morning had only confirmed what he\u2019d been striving so hard to deny.</p><p>Jordana Gates was going to be a problem for him.</p><p>She already was. After one brief kiss and a couple of chance encounters\u2014all told, only a few minutes\u2019 time in her presence\u2014she had aroused a fierce desire in him. She was impacting his focus, diminishing his concentration.</p><p>Making him burn with the need to seek her out and take what he craved.</p><p>Nathan cursed under his breath and cut off the water.</p><p>With his squad and Aric trading insults and banter along with their punches and body checks on the other side of the showers, Nathan stalked out to dry off and dress in the other room alone.</p><p>Rafe came out as Nathan was pulling on a fresh black T-shirt. The blond vampire grabbed a white towel from a folded stack and wrapped it around his lean hips. \u201cSomething going on with you that I should know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Without looking over at his comrade, Nathan rubbed his towel over the damp black spikes of his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Rafe walked over to the lockers next to Nathan and leaned one beefy shoulder against the metal. \u201cSomething\u2019s bugging you. I noticed it in the meeting this morning. Your head is somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Christ. Nathan wasn\u2019t accustomed to being read by someone, let alone getting called on it. He bristled at the weakness in himself but shot his cold glare at Rafe as he slammed his locker shut. \u201cYou got issues with my leadership, take it up with Commander Chase.\u201d</p><p>Rafe blew out a curse and scowled, studying him closer. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the team, you asshole. I\u2019m asking as your friend. You\u2019ve been wound tighter than usual all day. Actually, ever since that night we went looking for Carys and ended up at Jordana Gates\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>Nathan froze, a muscle ticking in his jaw as he faced Rafe\u2019s steady, knowing blue gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou do know she\u2019s to be mated soon, don\u2019t you?\u201d Rafe pressed. \u201cSome good ol\u2019 boy Darkhaven lawyer who\u2019s been sniffing around her skirts practically since she came of age, according to Carys.\u201d</p><p>Nathan growled at the reminder. \u201cLike I said, there\u2019s nothing going on that you need to know about. Nothing I can\u2019t handle. And as your friend, I\u2019m asking you to trust me on that.\u201d</p><p>It took a long moment before Rafe finally nodded his agreement. He turned away and started getting dressed. \u201cAny further word from D.C. today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet,\u201d Nathan replied, glad for the change in subjects. \u201cThey\u2019re still arranging the meetings with Crowe\u2019s widow and exes. When I spoke with Gideon at Headquarters today, he said they expect to have the interrogations completed within a couple of days. Which is better than I can say about our mission to bring in Cassian Gray. I\u2019ve been digging into the bastard\u2019s records all day and coming up empty. No personal records, no past, no kin. The man\u2019s a fucking ghost.\u201d</p><p>Rafe grunted. \u201cHe\u2019s got property. La Notte.\u201d</p><p>Nathan gave a dubious shrug. \u201cMaybe, maybe not. I hit a wall trying to chase down the title holder of the club. Records are private, sealed. Far as I could tell, there\u2019s about half a dozen layers of lawyers and holding companies in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of anonymity and subterfuge for a nightclub,\u201d Rafe remarked. \u201cCage fighting is illegal, but it sure as hell doesn\u2019t warrant that kind of paranoia.\u201d</p><p>Nathan nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what Gideon said when I told him what I\u2019d found. He\u2019s running some hacks now, said he\u2019ll report back as soon as he turns up any leads.\u201d</p><p>As the Order\u2019s longtime chief intelligence officer and resident genius, Gideon in D.C. hadn\u2019t run field missions in many years, but the vampire was an absolute killer behind the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cGonna take a hell of a lot more than lawyers and corporate shields to keep Gideon from exposing Cass and whoever he\u2019s hiding behind,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a database in existence that he couldn\u2019t crack.\u201d</p><p>Nathan agreed, but time spent waiting was time wasted. While Headquarters was hacking into Cass\u2019s life from D.C., Nathan and his team needed to keep up the pressure locally.</p><p>\u201cTell Eli and Jax we\u2019ll meet in fifteen for a review of tonight\u2019s patrol. We may not know everything about Cassian Gray yet, but there\u2019s one obvious constant in his life and that\u2019s La Notte.\u201d Nathan headed for the exit. \u201cWe need to start disrupting his business, rattle the hive, and see what it stirs up. And we start tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jordana walked the exhibit floor at the museum, taking a slow measure of the entire collection and jotting notes on her tablet. Last night\u2019s patron preview had been a means of thanking the various donors and community supporters, but it had also been a dry run for the exhibit in preparation for its public opening in just a few nights.</p><p>She perused the pieces and their placement, making minute adjustments to temperature and humidity settings, double-checking text cards and lighting levels for each of the displays.</p><p>Anything to keep her mind from straying to her unsettling encounter with Nathan earlier that morning.</p><p>He\u2019d been crude and confrontational. Impolite and far too bold. He was terrifying, not because of his profession or his past but because of the way he seemed to see straight into her soul and lay her bare.</p><p>He was dangerous for so many reasons.</p><p>And yet she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the things he said to her. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the way he made her feel. Her pulse quickened at the memory of being alone with Nathan in close quarters.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even touched her, yet her body had thrummed with the need to feel his hands on her.</p><p>Have you ever kissed Elliott Bentley-Squire the way you kissed me?</p><p>Nathan\u2019s words came back to her in a heated rush, making the ache return again now. She tried to will it away, but it was already taking root deep inside her. In truth, it had never fully ebbed in all the hours since she\u2019d seen Nathan at the mansion.</p><p>Has he ever made your cheeks flame just by looking at you, or made your pulse beat like a hammer in your veins because of the things you wish he\u2019d do to you?</p><p>Jordana idly brought her free hand up to her lips, finding it all too easy to imagine it was Nathan\u2019s mouth brushing against hers, not the tips of her suddenly trembling fingers. He had been right about that too\u2014she didn\u2019t regret kissing him. Not even after the things he said to her today.</p><p>Not even after the mortifying things she\u2019d admitted to him about her relationship with Elliott and her lack of experience in general.</p><p>God, why had she told him that? What had possessed her to admit so much to him with so little provocation? Nathan knew more about her now than anyone besides her best friend. What more might she be willing to tell him\u2014or willing to do\u2014if she ever saw him again?</p><p>I\u2019m the last kind of man you should want in your life ... or in your bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t doubt that for a minute, yet her blood still throbbed in her veins, kindling the knot of heat that pulsed in her core. Her nape tingled beneath the loose chignon of her upswept hair, the pulse points in her neck echoing in her ears with each heavy beat of her heart. Warmth spread down her throat and across the tops of her breasts, making her light silk blouse feel as hot and confining as a winter sweater.</p><p>\u201cHello? Earth to Jordana.\u201d Carys\u2019s voice broke into Jordana\u2019s thoughts like a splash of cold water. \u201cDid you hear a word I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jordana blurted. \u201cI was just finishing a note on this display.\u201d</p> <p>Carys cocked her head and narrowed her eyes slightly, as if she didn\u2019t quite buy the excuse. \u201cI\u2019ve got the temps and humidity readings you asked for on the French tapestry displays.\u201d She tapped her tablet screen and sent the data to Jordana\u2019s device.</p><p>Jordana scanned the report and nodded her approval. \u201cThis looks good, Carys, thank you. I would like to see the lighting muted a bit on the Beauvais pastoral piece. I noticed last night that we were losing some of the more subtle colors of the weaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Carys replied. \u201cAre you still rethinking the placement of the Roman mosaics?\u201d</p><p>Jordana glanced over to the display of ancient tiles encased in a multi-tiered tower of Plexiglas in the center of the exhibit. She considered for a moment, then gave a nod. \u201cYes, let\u2019s have that switched with something else. Sleeping Endymion would be a better focal point for that section of the exhibit, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Carys smiled. \u201cYour favorite piece. Sure, I think it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p> <p>They walked over to the clear case that housed the Italian sculpture that was more than three hundred years old. The terra cotta depiction of the mortal shepherd Endymion reposed in eternal slumber where he waited for his lover, the lunar goddess Selene, had enchanted Jordana from the moment she first saw it. Donated anonymously, the sculpture had been part of the museum\u2019s permanent collection for at least two decades.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the most valuable, or even among the most historically important pieces Jordana had known. But the simple beauty of the work, and the myth it represented, never failed to move something deep inside her.</p><p>Jordana stared into the display at the handsome mortal who slept forever under the delicate sliver of a crescent moon. Just looking at the piece made a sadness swell in her chest. She glanced down at the inside of her left wrist, where she bore a small scarlet birthmark in the shape of a crescent moon with a teardrop falling into its cradle.</p><p>Her Breedmate mark.</p><p>Unlike Endymion, she wasn\u2019t fully mortal. She, like the other half-human females born with the teardrop-and-crescent-moon symbol somewhere on their bodies, could live agelessly once blood-bonded with one of the Breed.</p><p>Such an incredible gift, to entwine two lives forever. And yet it could also be an inescapable shackle.</p> <p>\u201cCan you imagine sleeping through your entire existence?\u201d Jordana murmured as Carys came to stand beside her, looking at Cornacchini\u2019s sculpture. \u201cHave you ever felt as though your life were taking place around you, outside of you? That everything was moving faster than you could catch it\u2014as if you were asleep and anchored to the ground like Endymion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carys replied, zero hesitation. \u201cIf I want something, I reach for it. I don\u2019t let anything stop me.\u201d</p><p>Her careful tone drew Jordana\u2019s gaze to her. \u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Jordana gave a mild nod. \u201cIt\u2019s different for you, Carys. You\u2019re Breed. You didn\u2019t grow up in the Darkhavens, or with a father who\u2019s been drumming into your head since you were a child that he expected you to be blood-bonded to a suitable mate by the time you were twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Carys said around a laugh. \u201cIf my father had his way, he\u2019d have chained me to the mansion banister until I was twice that age. Life is meant to be lived, Jordana. And we only get one shot at it, whether we\u2019re Breedmate, Breed, or basic Homo sapiens.\u201d</p><p>Jordana smiled at her friend, loving how sure Carys always seemed about what she wanted and where she was heading. \u201cI wish I had your bravery. You\u2019ve never been afraid to leap, no matter how deep or dark the crevasse beneath you.\u201d</p><p>Carys shrugged, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s only deep and dark if you pause first to look down. Besides, you\u2019ve got your own kind of bravery, Jordana. I mean, look what you\u2019re doing here with the exhibit.\u201d</p> <p>Jordana took in the collection she was so proud of, all the pieces she had lovingly, painstakingly, curated one by one. It was her joy, and she threw herself into her work wholeheartedly.</p><p>While she\u2019d made a rewarding, promising career for herself, sometimes she wondered if her father and Elliott would both be happier if she\u2019d spent her time in philanthropic or social pursuits like most of the other young Breedmates of the area Darkhavens.</p><p>But she\u2019d been a disappointment to them there too. She wasn\u2019t like most other Breedmates, no matter how much she or anyone else wished she were. Hell, she wasn\u2019t even sure what her unique ESP ability might be, a gift most women like her came into by puberty or earlier.</p><p>Jordana pulled her thoughts back to the exhibit and Carys\u2019s bolstering praise.</p><p>\u201cThis is all your vision, your work,\u201d her friend pointed out. \u201cNo one handed this project to you\u2014you wanted it, so you went after it and you made it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Jordana demurred. Her gaze drifted back to the sculpture under the glass. \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t know what you want? What if you wake up one day and realize that you never had a clue what you wanted? That someone had always been telling you what you needed or what was expected, and now all you want to do is close your eyes again and pretend you\u2019re still sleeping?\u201d</p><p>Carys\u2019s bright blue gaze softened. \u201cYou want me to tell you what I think, honestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jordana nodded. \u201cTell me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know what you don\u2019t want. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid to admit to anyone, even to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jordana blew out a slow sigh as she glanced away. \u201cThat\u2019s what Nathan said to me too. Well, not in so many words. He was far less polite about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan,\u201d Carys said. \u201cSo you did see him at the mansion this morning.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the obvious lack of surprise in her friend\u2019s voice, Jordana shot a frown at her. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>Carys smiled, devilish. \u201cI thought you might have. You came back with the packing tape looking kind of flushed and out of breath. I didn\u2019t think it was because you\u2019d been running around in circles down in the command center. Even though my directions to the supply room might\u2019ve gotten you a bit turned around ...\u201d</p><p>Jordana\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou did give me bad instructions! I knew it. I ended up so lost, I might never have found my way back.\u201d</p><p>Carys grinned. \u201cCivilians don\u2019t go unnoticed on the warriors\u2019 turf for long. I knew someone would help you find your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you deliberately sent me down there like that,\u201d Jordana said, appalled but not angry. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly have been hoping I\u2019d run into him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the way you looked at Nathan last night at the patrons\u2019 reception. And I saw the way he looked at you. I found it ... interesting. So I decided to take a little chance.\u201d She arched a brow at Jordana. \u201cI took a leap, thinking maybe you might need help taking one too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith him?\u201d Jordana scoffed. \u201cPlease. He\u2019s the rudest man I\u2019ve ever met. He has no social skills whatsoever. He\u2019s coarse and cold and menacing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you kissed him a few nights ago.\u201d</p><p>She hardly needed the reminder. Jordana felt her forehead crease harder with her deepening scowl. She\u2019d never been particularly comfortable in her own skin, had felt practically all her life that she was different somehow. That she was merely pretending so hard to be normal\u2014to be the good daughter, the exemplary woman, the pleasant Breedmate\u2014goals that seemed always just out of her reach.</p><p>No matter how hard she strived to be what everyone around her expected, inside she felt she was only going through the motions. Acting, not living.</p><p>Pretending to be something she wasn\u2019t and maybe never could be.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt that lack so markedly as she did in Nathan\u2019s company. He had the uncanny ability to strip her bare, to pare her down to her bones with just a glance. He had the unnerving power to unravel the tentative constructs of her life with just one uninvited touch.</p><p>\u201cHe scares me, Carys. When Nathan looks at me, I feel as if he\u2019s seeing all my flaws, every crack in who I am. When I\u2019m near him, it\u2019s as though I\u2019m standing naked in the middle of a raging storm. He makes me feel as if I\u2019m on the steepest cliff, about to lose my footing. That if I step too close to him, I might never get back on solid ground.\u201d</p><p>Carys stared at her. \u201cAnd this is a bad thing, the way you see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s the worst thing,\u201d Jordana said, uncertain who she needed to convince more: her friend or herself. \u201cI\u2019ll be better off\u2014safer\u2014if I stay far away from Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d Carys replied after a long moment. \u201cIt would be safer for you if you steer clear of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jordana said, pushing out the breath she\u2019d been holding. Having her best friend\u2019s agreement was just the confirmation she needed. \u201cI\u2019m glad you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, believe me, I do,\u201d Carys said. Her lips curved into a wry smile. \u201cBecause what you just described? That\u2019s how Rune made me feel from the moment we first met. I stepped off that cliff with him, and so far, I haven\u2019t missed solid ground beneath me for so much as a second.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>CASSIAN GRAY STEPPED OUT OF A TAXI AND INTO THE LATE-AFTERNOON sunlight on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston\u2019s Back Bay. He ambled up the street at a casual pace, even though daytime was ending in less than two hours and he had every reason to hustle his ass to where he was going.</p><p>This close to dusk, it was a risk for him to be out and about. Although he hadn\u2019t been in touch with anyone at La Notte in a couple of days, he had no doubt the Order was on his trail. He\u2019d suspected his cover had been blown from the instant one of their warriors\u2014an errant comrade-turned-rebel-leader named Kellan Archer\u2014had body-blocked him during a minor confrontation in the club.</p><p>Cassian didn\u2019t know what the Breed male\u2019s unique psychic talent might be, but something told him the warrior\u2019s touch had outed Cass as being other than human.</p><p>That bit of shitty luck had nearly been enough to make Cass cut and run from the life he\u2019d made for himself in Boston, but it was the more recent bout of bad news\u2014the death of Reginald Crowe\u2014that had Cass skulking around the city and constantly looking over his shoulder like the fugitive he truly was.</p><p>Crowe\u2019s attempt to disrupt the Global Nations Council summit several nights ago had made headlines all over the world. So had his slaying at the hands of the Order. As much as Cass dreaded the possibility of being captured for interrogation by Lucan and his warriors, there was another, equally lethal army of soldiers that he hoped to elude.</p><p>His Atlantean kinsmen.</p><p>Cass had been on the run from them for far longer than he had from the Order. Hiding in plain sight had worked well enough all these years, and it was that same method of concealment he employed now, as he made his way to an important appointment in the city.</p><p>As he strolled nonchalantly by a coffee shop window on the avenue, he caught his reflection and smiled to himself at how different he looked. His short crown of hair was dyed a nondescript brown and combed into an obedient side part. Dark sunglasses masked his eyes.</p><p>He\u2019d traded his usual public camouflage of leather and metal for thrift store denim and a faded Red Sox logo T-shirt that had probably started showing its wear a decade ago. Scuffed loafers covered his feet, their soles so thin he could feel every pit and bump in the concrete of the sidewalk as he made his way toward the designated meeting spot.</p><p>He looked more than passably pedestrian, hardly distinguishable from any other civilian man in his thirties. To anyone seeing him on the street today, Cass was unremarkable, forgettable. Just as he\u2019d intended.</p><p>No one would think that he and the platinum-haired, black-leather-clad Goth nightmare proprietor of La Notte were one and the same.</p><p>Nor would any of the humans around him on this stretch of crowded pavement ever guess that he was an immortal on the north side of a thousand years old.</p><p>Only his fellow Atlanteans might sense he was one of them, and he\u2019d been careful to keep his head down in the time since he\u2019d left their realm and come to Boston. He\u2019d constructed an all-new identity, a facade he\u2019d carefully maintained for twenty-some years, from his unsavory occupation and all the underworld connections that went along with it, to his offputting appearance and the presumed kink of his carnal proclivities.</p><p>Cassian Gray, proprietor of La Notte, was a mask he\u2019d perfected over a long period of time. Keeping his ear to the ground, his fingers busy greasing palms and pulling various strings in the shadowy underbelly of the city were cautious necessities of his new life.</p><p>He\u2019d had to be cautious, because he was a wanted man. A hated man. A defector.</p><p>A traitor to his queen.</p><p>He\u2019d taken something of great value to her when he fled, and her wrath knew no limits. She\u2019d called for his death. Then again, he\u2019d given her little choice. His death was the only hope she had of ever getting her hands on the precious treasure he stole away from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Cassian had anything to say about it, not even his death would assure the queen of that goal.</p><p>He figured it was only a matter of time before someone caught up to him\u2014his immortal comrades or the Order\u2019s warriors. There was nowhere completely safe for him now, and so long as he stayed in Boston, his presence alone posed an added risk to the very thing he\u2019d worked so hard to shield and protect.</p><p>Which was the reason for his clandestine appointment today. He needed further assurances that his interests would continue to be looked after, even if he was gone from the picture altogether.</p> <p>Cassian rounded a corner at the end of the block and made his way onto Newbury Street. He headed into a swanky sim lounge, bypassing the hostess before she could tell him what the current offerings were in each of the club\u2019s experience rooms. Cass wasn\u2019t there to spend time or money playing in the virtual reality realm with tourists looking to become spaceship captains or fairy-tale creatures at the rate of a couple hundred an hour.</p><p>He walked to the back of the club as had been arranged earlier that day. The individual he\u2019d come to meet was already waiting in one of the private VIP rooms.</p><p>Garbed from head to toe in dark, UV-protective clothing, the Breed male waited with his driver, a human\u2014hired help, by the anxious look of him. No doubt the driver\u2019s tip would come in the currency of a mind scrub once the meeting was concluded and his fare was delivered safely back to his home elsewhere in the city.</p><p>Cassian strolled in and faced the vampire\u2019s obscured form. \u201cMy old friend,\u201d he said, extending his hand to the vampire who knew all his secrets and had kept them faithfully. \u201cThank you for agreeing to meet me on such short notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Carys spread her arms wide and gestured around her to the display of French tapestries when Jordana sought her out a few hours later, as the museum was closing for the day. \u201cI had the guys mix the halogens with a few low-watt LEDs. If you think it\u2019s too dark now\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jordana shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s perfect like this. Good work.\u201d</p><p>Carys beamed. \u201cThanks. I also picked up the interior signage from the printer. It\u2019s in your office. They said they\u2019ll deliver the digital placards and exterior banners in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I have a placement mock-up almost finished for all of the banners and digital signs. I know it\u2019s getting late, but it shouldn\u2019t take me too long to wrap up. You want to wait for me? We can grab some carryout from the Thai place on the way home and a bottle of wine. Seems like we should do something to celebrate your moving in today, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Carys said slowly, her expression wilting in apology. \u201cJordana, I\u2019m sorry. I made plans with Rune earlier this week that I\u2019d be at the club. He\u2019s got a big match tonight and I want to see him before he goes into the cages. I hate watching him fight, but I can\u2019t bear to not be there, you know?\u201d</p><p>Jordana gave a mild shrug. \u201cSure, I understand. You should be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me instead. We can celebrate and have dinner there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s okay.\u201d Jordana was disappointed, but she knew how Carys worried herself sick when Rune was in the cages, despite the fact that the brutal Breed fighter had never lost a match.</p><p>Jordana could hardly stomach the fights either. And she hated to support an establishment whose proprietor made his living off the spilled blood and broken bones of others. Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if she didn\u2019t have plenty of work to keep her busy anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou go on and be with Rune tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can celebrate another time.\u201d</p><p>Carys frowned. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. I want to tie up a few loose ends before I head out anyway. I\u2019ll order takeout instead and bring home the leftovers for you in case you\u2019re hungry when you get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Carys pulled her into a quick, warm hug. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, then. And when we do go out to celebrate, it\u2019s my treat. Deal?\u201d</p><p>Jordana nodded. \u201cOkay. It\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>She went back to work as Carys gathered her things and left the museum. Two hours later, Jordana had finished the signage map for the exhibit and eaten half a container of veggie pad Thai, stowing the rest in the department refrigerator down the hall. The museum was quiet, everyone but her and the twenty-four-hour security guard on post in the lobby having long since left the building.</p> <p>Jordana saved the signage map on her computer and sent a copy to Carys\u2019s tablet for the morning. She got up to stretch her legs and walk to the restroom before she would have to make the drive home across town. When she returned to her desk, she had a voicemail from Elliott.</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound happy that she was working late again. \u201cApparently, I\u2019ve missed you most of the day, darling. Did you get the message I left on your mobile a few hours ago?\u201d</p><p>Shit. She\u2019d been so busy, she hadn\u2019t bothered to check the damn thing.</p><p>\u201cI want you to call me as soon as you get home tonight, Jordana. I want to know that you\u2019re safe.\u201d He cleared his throat, and she thought she heard irritation in his tone. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t hear from you today, I called your building and spoke with Seamus. Maybe you can tell me how it is that I had to find out from your doorman that Carys Chase has moved into your apart\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jordana disconnected from the message on a furious curse. What the hell was Elliott doing checking up on her behind her back?</p><p>She was half tempted to return his call right now and ask him that herself. But she knew if she did, she might also say something she could never take back.</p><p>Angry now, she deleted the voicemail and closed up her office for the night.</p><p>She took the elevator down to the lobby, said good-bye to Lou behind the reception desk, and walked out to the parking lot.</p><p>Hers was the only vehicle there, the pale silver compact car gleaming under the overhead lamps at the far end of the pavement. Jordana got halfway across the lot before she remembered the Thai food in the refrigerator upstairs.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>She turned to go back and froze. A pair of eyes was trained on her in the dark; she could feel it.</p><p>There\u2014a shadow near the building.</p><p>It skulked away quickly when she peered in its direction, though not soon enough to escape her notice. Someone was there, watching her. Waiting for her?</p><p>The hairs on her nape rose in a wave. Fear shot down her spine like a cold electrical current. Her heart raced, palms going damp.</p><p>Someone was there.</p><p>Hiding, but not gone.</p><p>Watching her, even now.</p><p>Who was it?</p><p>What did they want?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to go back to the building and find out. Carys\u2019s leftovers weren\u2019t going anywhere tonight.</p><p>As for Jordana, the idea of going home alone to an empty apartment while her pulse was still jackhammering in fear didn\u2019t sound very appealing. Of course, she could always call Elliott. He\u2019d come over in a moment\u2019s notice if she asked it of him. But she didn\u2019t want Elliott.</p><p>The sad fact was, she never had wanted him.</p><p>And he deserved to know that.</p><p>But that was a problem she\u2019d have to deal with soon enough.</p><p>Right now, Jordana just wanted to make it to her vehicle in one piece. She needed to go somewhere public, somewhere she knew she\u2019d be safe among friends.</p><p>She hurried across the dark pavement and hopped in her car, then peeled out of the parking lot.</p><p>Her penthouse was just a few blocks away from the museum, but Jordana passed her building and kept on going, heading deeper into the city, to La Notte.</p><p>8</p><p>NATHAN LED HIS TEAM INTO CASSIAN GRAY\u2019S CLUB AT THE height of the evening\u2019s most lucrative hour. The dance floor and bar on street level were jammed with people who\u2019d shelled out the steep cover charge just to get in, but the real commerce\u2014Cass\u2019s bread and butter\u2014was taking place in the cages below.</p><p>With fearful glances and anxious murmurs rising in their wake, the heavily armed patrol squad cut a path through the crowd upstairs and headed down to La Notte\u2019s arena.</p><p>The fights, and the sizable bets that accompanied them, were already well under way. Rune always drew the largest numbers, and tonight appeared to be no exception. The immense, dark-haired Breed male was matched against an opponent almost his equal in size and menace.</p><p>At six and a half feet tall and 300-plus pounds apiece, the two vampires dressed in little more than leather breeches and locked in brutal hand-to-hand combat inside the cage was a sight few humans would ever see in their lifetimes.</p><p>So much the better that the Breed-on-Breed blood sport could be enjoyed from the perceived safety of the club surrounding the steel-reinforced arena.</p><p>The crowd gasped as Rune drove a hard right hook into his opponent\u2019s jaw. Bone cracked and blood spewed from the vampire\u2019s slack mouth.</p><p>The blow was punishing, catastrophic, given that each fighter wore titanium-spiked, fingerless leather gloves in the ring. The metal was meant to increase the savagery of the contest, but it also served to discourage the fighters from doping their performance with excessive feeding before a match.</p><p>If a Breed pushed himself into Bloodlust\u2014the addiction only a rare few had ever beaten\u2014the titanium of his opponent\u2019s knuckle spikes would enter his diseased bloodstream and kill the vampire faster than any pounding he might suffer in the cages.</p><p>With the spectators cheering wildly, Rune\u2019s opponent sank down onto his knees on a low howl of anguish. Nathan assessed the damage with a shrewd assassin\u2019s eye. Another strike like the last one and Rune\u2019s kill count would increase along with the stakes on him at the cashier.</p><p>Rune didn\u2019t seem interested in beefing up his record or his worth. The big male stood back, allowing the other vampire the choice to either hit the mercy button on the cage and deliver Rune a jolt of electricity to the U-shaped steel collar each fighter wore around his neck or continue the match without the benefit of the handicap. Shouts of disapproval traveled the crowd near the cages as their champion refused to end the bout with an easy, but unnecessary, kill.</p><p>As the fight resumed, Nathan gestured to his squad to begin clearing the place out. It took only moments\u2014and the flash of fangs from a group of combat-ready Order members\u2014to send the bulk of the club\u2019s clientele in the direction of the nearest exits.</p><p>But the intrusion also got the swift attention of La Notte\u2019s security staff. Nathan and his men played rough with them tonight, no need to pretend they weren\u2019t there to stir things up and make their presence known.</p><p>Elijah, Jax, and Rafe bounced a few Breed guards into the brick walls of the place, while Nathan soon found himself going hand to hand with a couple of the other fighters employed by Cassian Gray.</p><p>He disabled both in seconds, stopping just short of killing them. He wheeled around to face yet another of Cass\u2019s fighters, but Syn made no move to take him on. Just shy of Nathan or Rune\u2019s size, and handsome to the point of being pretty, the blond Breed male held his own impressive record in the cages. But he seemed to know better than to invite further problems with Nathan. All around them, the club was emptying out.</p><p>\u201cTell your boss we\u2019re gonna come back every night and toss this place until we hear from him,\u201d Nathan warned. \u201cThe longer he takes, harder the Order\u2019s gonna push.\u201d</p><p>Syn merely stared, unfazed, watching the arena empty further. Only the drunks and diehard fight fans remained now, a clot of about forty people still riveted to the match winding down in the cage.</p><p>Nathan stared into that crowd and felt his veins go tight as his gaze locked on to a pair of young women in the front row of the straggling spectators.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>Carys was easy enough to spot. Her loose caramel waves bounced around the shoulders of her form-fitted black sweater as she cheered on her man, dark denim hugging her backside. She jumped up and down on high-heeled black boots, clapping her hands and whistling as the clock ran out and Rune\u2019s victory was assured.</p><p>The other female was a surprise Nathan neither wanted nor needed tonight.</p><p>With her back to him, Jordana Gates stood beside Carys, dressed by contrast in a soft gray pencil skirt and pale pink silk blouse. Her long white-blond hair was gathered into some kind of knotted updo at her nape.</p><p>Jesus, she looked like she belonged in a boardroom meeting uptown, not a blood match down in the cages of Boston\u2019s least reputable club.</p><p>Except Jordana seemed as rapt as Carys with the match taking place tonight. Neither woman paid any attention as Nathan left Syn standing behind him and made his way toward the pair. He smelled liquor on them even before he was halfway across the room. And now he noticed that the women were less than steady on their feet, even Jordana in her conservative pumps.</p><p>When the bell on the match rang out, Carys and Jordana cheered Rune\u2019s name along with the handful of spectators around them. Nathan stalked forward, idly aware that Rune had peeled off his gloves and collar in order to catch Carys as she threw open the cage door and flew into his arms.</p><p>He felt Rune\u2019s dark gaze light on him in disapproval for the Order\u2019s interruption of the night\u2019s commerce, but Nathan\u2019s focus was trained elsewhere now.</p><p>Jordana went still suddenly, then slowly turned around. Her gaze collided with Nathan\u2019s glower, a connection he felt like a lightning strike that sent heat straight to his groin.</p><p>If he\u2019d thought Jordana looked suited for a board meeting from behind, facing her now threw that lame comparison out the window. Her blouse was carelessly untucked in front, the first three buttons unfastened, creating a tempting plunge of bare flesh that ended just between the perfect swell of her breasts.</p><p>Her skin there was flushed, a pretty rose hue that traveled up her throat and into her cheeks now as well. He couldn\u2019t help imagining her blood rushing through those delicate capillaries. Hell, he could almost taste it. His mouth watered at the thought, making his fangs punch out of his gums. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Desire ignited in a flash, hot and consuming. His cock answered the surge of need coursing through him, suddenly straining behind his black combat fatigues.</p><p>Nathan knew his pupils were winnowing down to narrow slits as he drank in the sight of Jordana\u2019s disheveled beauty. The amber light of his transforming irises bathed her face in a dim glow.</p><p>His body\u2019s swift reaction shocked him. And he was more than a little disturbed that he couldn\u2019t seem to master his urges when it came to this particular woman.</p> <p>Never one to back down, however, Nathan advanced on her. He called a command to his teammates to sweep out the back rooms and VIP lounge, ordering them to send every last person out of the place.</p><p>\u201cThe party\u2019s over,\u201d he snarled, his eyes still rooted on Jordana.</p><p>She scowled up at him, planting her hands on the tempting curves of her hips. \u201cWhat right did you have to do that?\u201d she demanded, her words sounding thicker than normal, no doubt thanks to the alcohol she\u2019d consumed.</p><p>Nathan held her annoyed stare. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t notice this place makes its profits off illegal blood sport and gambling. Not to mention other deviant amusements you\u2019d rather not know about,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s about time someone shuts this hellhole down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, tossing her head back and forth. The motion collapsed her loosely gathered mane and sent the platinum waves tumbling around her shoulders and down her back. \u201cNo, I\u2019m talking about you, Nathan. What right did you have to storm into my life and mess everything up?\u201d</p> <p>He frowned, taken aback, not only by the question but by the sound of his name on her lips. \u201cI stormed into your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d She moved closer to him, until there was hardly an arm\u2019s length between them. Then closer still. \u201cYou\u2019re a dark, dangerous storm, Nathan.\u201d She tilted her head back, her glacial blue eyes arresting, even in the darkness of the club. \u201cIf I\u2019m not careful, I\u2019m going to leap off a cliff with you.\u201d</p><p>He blew out a curse, peering harder at her. Christ, just how much had she had to drink tonight? She might be speaking nonsense due to one too many cocktails, but her steady, searching gaze and parted lips were communicating to his senses clearly enough.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst thing that could ever happen to me, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we agree on something.\u201d She listed toward him and he growled, whether with need or irony, he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cCollect your things, Jordana. I\u2019m going to have one of my men take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she murmured, shaking her head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go home to my apartment alone. I want to wait for Carys.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced over, recognizing that Carys was in no better shape herself. Plus, she was wrapped around Rune in one of the booths outside the cages. It didn\u2019t appear she would be leaving for a while, and Nathan had no intention of allowing Jordana to hang around the club in the condition she was in now.</p><p>And despite Carys\u2019s obvious trust and affection for Rune, there was no way in hell Nathan would leave Jordana\u2019s well-being in that male\u2019s hands.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Her apartment wasn\u2019t far. He could drop her off safely and be back on task with his patrol team in no time.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Nathan clamped his hand around her wrist and took her with him outside.</p><p>9</p><p>FIVE MINUTES LATER, JORDANA WAS SEATED ON THE PASSENGER side of her car, watching Nathan navigate the Back Bay\u2019s maze of one-way streets en route to her apartment. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t necessary for you to take me home. I could\u2019ve managed on my own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOut of the question,\u201d he said, his stern profile bathed in the milky glow of the dashboard.</p><p>His deep voice brooked no argument, and she was instantly reminded that Nathan was no Darkhaven gentleman. He was an Order squad captain. A Gen One Breed male and former assassin.</p><p>A man adept at killing in God only knew how many ways. And yet here he was, playing designated driver to her after she\u2019d foolishly over-imbibed.</p><p>Already she was sobering up, the mild alcohol buzz replaced by the twitchy flutter of her pulse as she sat beside Nathan in the dimly lit vehicle.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, thank you,\u201d she murmured belatedly, unable to tear her eyes from him.</p><p>He was handsome in a harsh way, his cheekbones too sharp, his jaw too square and unyielding. His eyes were stormier than ever as he sped her home, a blue-green thundercloud under the severe slashes of his black brows.</p><p>His mouth was easily the softest of his features, his lips far too full and lush for the cool, almost constant grimness of his expression. Jordana knew all too well how warm those broad, sculpted lips could be. As she looked at him beside her in the vehicle, she was wildly tempted to taste them again.</p><p>He glanced her way, no doubt feeling her eyes on him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed La Notte was your kind of place, considering what goes on there.\u201d</p><p>Jordana shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t spend much time at the club normally. The only reason I went tonight was because I knew Carys was there with Rune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooked to me like you were having a pretty good time up there in the front row outside the fighting cages.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, hating that she\u2019d let herself get caught up in the seedy entertainments of the club. Elliott would be upset if he found out, but her father would likely go apoplectic if he found out she knew the place even existed, let alone that she\u2019d been inside.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t condone the violence of the matches,\u201d she murmured, \u201cnor the fact that profits are being made off spilled blood. It\u2019s an appalling business.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cThe fights aren\u2019t the only way La Notte\u2019s owner fills his purse.\u201d</p><p>Jordana knew he wasn\u2019t talking about the bar and dancing at street level, nor the sim lounge where people could slip into their choice of several virtual reality landscapes at a hefty hourly rate. \u201cYou mean the BDSM dens downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Nathan swung a dark look on her. \u201cYou know about the sex rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t actually seen them,\u201d she hedged. \u201cCarys told me about them.\u201d</p><p>He cursed, low under his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me Rune has taken her in there. For fuck\u2019s sake, tell me he doesn\u2019t do that with her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jordana gave a dismissive shake of her head. \u201cNo, of course not. He might make his living in the cages, but Rune\u2019s nothing but gentle with Carys. He\u2019s protective of her, always. He wouldn\u2019t even want her near that part of the club.\u201d</p><p>Another grunt from Nathan, this time with a mix of relief and something else that Jordana couldn\u2019t discern. He seemed to grow more tense now, staring back at the road ahead, a muscle ticking hard in his jaw. \u201cIf Rune truly cared about Carys, he\u2019d make sure she never stepped foot in La Notte at all. It\u2019s no place for you either.\u201d</p><p>Jordana arched a brow. \u201cNow you\u2019re starting to sound like Elliott. He\u2019s all but forbidden me from the place.\u201d</p><p>Nathan gave her a sidelong look. \u201cAnd yet you went there tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElliott Bentley-Squire doesn\u2019t own me. I\u2019m perfectly capable of handling myself.\u201d She scoffed lightly, realizing how perfectly incapable she must appear to Nathan right now. \u201cWell, I can usually handle myself. Tonight was an exception. I\u2019m embarrassed that you feel you have to see me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he replied.</p><p>But it was something to Jordana. It was a chivalrous gesture from a man who hadn\u2019t exactly struck her as the noble type. She would not have imagined he\u2019d had it in him, considering he was more accustomed to combat and brutality and death.</p><p>There was probably a lot she had to learn about Nathan, and as she studied his grave profile, she found herself hoping she might have the chance to understand everything about the remote, unreadable man.</p><p>\u201cBefore we left the club,\u201d Nathan said, \u201cyou told me you didn\u2019t want to go home alone. What was that about?\u201d</p><p>Jordana tried to wave off the question. \u201cIt was silly. Something happened at work tonight as I was leaving, and I got spooked. I\u2019m sure it was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Nathan was all warrior now, no longer posing a light inquiry but demanding an answer.</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw someone outside the museum tonight, as I was heading for my car. I thought he was watching me.\u201d It sounded foolish to her now, even though at the time she\u2019d been more than a little rattled.</p><p>\u201cHe,\u201d Nathan said, his deep voice edged with suspicion and a protectiveness that surprised her, warmed her. \u201cDid you see this man? Did he threaten you in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cNo, nothing like that. I saw someone standing outside the museum as I was leaving, that\u2019s all. As I said, I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t anything but my imagination running away with me.\u201d</p><p>Nathan made a noise in the back of his throat that sounded less than convinced, but he didn\u2019t press any further. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he announced, slowing down as they approached her building. He drove around to the underground parking, then found Jordana\u2019s assigned space without her telling him where it was.</p><p>She stared at him from the other side of the vehicle as he killed the engine and handed her the remote starter. \u201cI can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m impressed or unnerved that the Order not only knows where I live but where I park my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the Order,\u201d he said, slanting her a look that made her nerve endings tingle in response. \u201cJust me.\u201d</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t give her much chance to process that information. Before she could stammer a reply, he was already out of the car and coming around to the passenger side. He opened the door and took her wrist to help her to her feet. His strong fingers clamped around her in a grasp that was equal parts command and comfort.</p><p>Heat sizzled through their connection, and Jordana struggled to appear unaffected as she came to stand in front of him with hardly two inches of space between their bodies. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, forcing a lamely polite smile. \u201cThanks again for seeing me home, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not there yet.\u201d</p><p>When she would have demurred, he released his grasp on her and gestured toward the elevator leading to the lobby of her building. He strode alongside her to the waiting lift and rode up with her.</p><p>Seamus was on duty, as usual. The doorman rose from behind his wide reception desk and gave her a welcoming nod as she stepped into the quiet lobby. \u201cEvening, Miss Gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Seamus,\u201d she greeted, trying to walk nonchalantly across the polished marble floor.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bentley-Squire\u2019s looking for you, Miss Gates,\u201d Seamus informed her. \u201cHe called several times tonight to ask if I\u2019d seen you, even stopped by a short while ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doorman abruptly clammed up the instant he noticed Jordana wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Seamus,\u201d Jordana said, keenly aware of Nathan\u2019s presence as he followed her out of the elevator and across the lobby, neither waiting for permission nor asking for it.</p><p>She saw the middle-age human guard warily eye the dark and dangerous-looking Breed warrior at her heels. It wasn\u2019t every night that Jordana traipsed through her building in the company of a man, let alone one dressed in patrol gear and bristling with deadly weapons.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t help that she likely carried the unsavory fragrances of the club on her as she sailed past Seamus\u2019s desk.</p><p>The doorman cleared his throat. \u201cEverything okay tonight, Miss Gates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Everything is fine. Good night, Seamus.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a practiced smile, one that invited no further comment, as Nathan proceeded to trail her to the penthouse elevator in broody silence.</p><p>As soon as the polished steel doors closed behind them, Jordana closed her eyes and blew out a sigh. \u201cThe whole building\u2019s going to know about this tomorrow. Seamus is sweet and well meaning, but discretion isn\u2019t one of his strong suits.\u201d She slowly shook her head, then pressed the button for the penthouse floor. \u201cI can only imagine what he must be thinking about me right now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care what that human rent-a-cop thinks?\u201d Nathan\u2019s low voice was little more than a growl as he moved so he was facing her inside the lift. \u201cWhy do you care what anyone might think of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a Gates.\u201d An automatic answer, a standard she held herself to from the time she was a child. \u201cCertain things are expected of my family. And of me. I have to care what people think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked up into Nathan\u2019s stormy gaze, realizing only now just how close he stood to her. Heat radiated from the large, muscular bulk of his body, sending a flush to her cheeks and down between her breasts. Then lower still.</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t need to say anything\u2014he didn\u2019t need to do anything\u2014and yet his presence was so dominating, it seemed to suck all the air out of the small space.</p><p>Although some insane compulsion drew her toward all of that heat and power, Jordana inched backward, not stopping until her spine bumped against the rear of the ascending car.</p><p>He was right there too, crowding her physically, forcing her to hold his probing stare. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, and you know it. You hide behind the crutch of your family\u2019s name and whatever obligation you feel toward it, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking you. I want to know why you hide.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer, leaving her no room to escape. No room to avoid his piercing eyes or the chaos of her own senses as every nerve ending inside her came alive with awareness of this man and her dangerous craving for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to know why you feel the need to clamp a hard lid down on who you truly are, Jordana. The woman who kissed me in this very building last week. The woman who looked at me at the museum party last night like she was drowning under the weight of everything that was expected of her.\u201d Nathan came closer still, until his chest brushed hers, his body searing the length of her. \u201cI want to know why you try so hard to deny the woman you truly are, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Her voice sounded very small, unconvincing, even to her own ears. \u201cI\u2019m not hiding behind anything. And you don\u2019t know the first thing about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d His dark eyes flashed with amber. When he spoke again, she spied the razor-sharp tips of his fangs behind his sensual upper lip. \u201cYou wanted me to take you out of that party last night. You would\u2019ve fought me and denied it, but in the end, we both know you would\u2019ve gone with me.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, God. He was right.</p><p>Even so, she gave a sharp toss of her head. \u201cNo. I would have done no such thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Jordana, you would have.\u201d He smiled now, a confident, knowing smile that gave her no mercy at all. \u201cAnd today in the supply room of the command center, you wanted me to touch you, to kiss you. To do whatever wicked things I wanted to you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, her mouth going dry under the scorching heat of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou waited for it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou crave it now, as much as I do.\u201d</p> <p>A sound curled up from her throat, but if she\u2019d hoped to be able to deny what he was saying, the soft moan that slipped past her lips was a pitiful effort. \u201cDon\u2019t say such things. You have no right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, Jordana?\u201d he pressed. \u201cWhy not say it if it\u2019s the truth? Why should either of us pretend we can stop what\u2019s going on between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d She sucked in a breath, searching for the strength to refuse him.</p><p>\u201cBecause, why?\u201d he asked, more gently now, yet no less commanding. \u201cTell me why you\u2019d rather scurry back behind your family name and the obligations you\u2019ve constructed into your own prison?\u201d</p><p>Jordana brought her fingers up to her lips, trying to bite back the words that would betray her. They spilled out anyway, a whispered rush. \u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Something flickered over Nathan\u2019s stern features\u2014shock or understanding, sympathy or pity; she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p> <p>He reached behind him and hit the stop button on the elevator. With a soft rock, the car came to a cushioned halt inside the shaft.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t answer. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re afraid of.\u201d</p><p>Anxiety shot through her. \u201cSeamus will notice that we\u2019ve stopped. He\u2019ll wonder what\u2019s going on in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck,\u201d Nathan growled. \u201cNeither should you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can see us,\u201d Jordana pointed out, glancing past Nathan, toward the small security camera lens staring down at them from the ceiling of the lift.</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t so much as flinch, the tiny red light on the monitoring device blinked out, snuffed by the power of Nathan\u2019s Gen One Breed mind. \u201cNow it\u2019s just you and me, Jordana. I\u2019m the only one who can see you. I\u2019m the only one who will hear you. Are you afraid now?\u201d</p><p>When she looked down in silence, Nathan\u2019s warm, strong fingers came to rest beneath her chin. He lifted her face, refusing to let her hide even her gaze from him. \u201cAre you afraid of me, Jordana?\u201d</p> <p>She gave a weak shake of her head, astonished that it wasn\u2019t fear she felt with this man right now. It was something far more powerful than that. More powerful than the desire he stirred in her as well. She trusted him.</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t have to demand she bare her soul to him; his turbulent blue-green eyes and unexpectedly gentle touch compelled her with equal measure. \u201cMy father\u2019s had a very strict path laid out for me to follow from the time I was a child. He wants things for me. Expects me to act a certain way, to achieve certain goals he\u2019s set for me. He does it out of love, I know that. He only wants what\u2019s best for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does.\u201d Nathan closed the scant distance between them, a towering wall of muscle and dark, simmering intent. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted quietly. \u201cBut sometimes I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never be the daughter he wants me to be. I\u2019m terrified I\u2019m going to wake up one day and realize I no longer want the things he thinks are best for me.\u201d She let out a soft sigh, still holding Nathan\u2019s stormy gaze. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I already have.\u201d</p><p>He growled a curse, something low and dark, under his breath. His features sharpened, making his face more fierce, as profane as it was handsome. Jordana lifted her hand, wanting to brave a touch of his angled cheekbone and rigid jaw.</p><p>Nathan caught her in midmotion, wrapping his fingers around her wrist before she could make contact. His grip was warm but firm. Wordlessly, he raised her hand up and away from him, pinning it over her head against the back wall of the elevator car.</p><p>Jordana didn\u2019t know what to say\u2014she didn\u2019t know what to think\u2014as he then brought her other hand up as well and held it there. She tested his hold and found it unyielding. As unbreakable as iron.</p><p>Staring up at him, she swallowed, all too aware of how her current position left her totally at Nathan\u2019s mercy. With her hands held above her head, her spine pressed against the solid wall of the elevator car, the only place she could possibly move was toward the crowding heat of his body. Her breasts strained against the buttons of her conservative silk blouse. Her legs were spread slightly to keep her balance, and cool air tickled up the bare lengths of her calves and thighs, making her even more aware of the moist heat pulsing at her core.</p><p>Every feminine particle of her being thrummed in response to Nathan\u2019s presence, anticipation pounding in her blood.</p><p>He switched his grasp so that one hand shackled her wrists, leaving his other free to roam. He stroked the backs of his knuckles along the slope of her cheek, then down along the swells of her breasts, hardly touching her yet making her burn with sensation. \u201cAre you afraid of me now, Jordana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her reply was little more than a gasp, breathless not from worry but from the startling sense of her own vulnerability.</p><p>Nathan held her completely under his control. She couldn\u2019t have broken loose of his hold if her life depended on it. Nor did she want to.</p><p>He owned her in that moment, and damn him if he didn\u2019t know it too.</p><p>He reveled in it; she could see the dark pleasure in his eyes as he drank her in from head to foot in the tight confines of the lift. Amber sparks pierced the thundercloud color of his irises. His broad mouth was grim yet sensual, barely concealing the growing length of his fangs.</p><p>He bent toward her and took her mouth in a scorching, commanding kiss.</p><p>Jordana had no experience with such hard passion, such hungered demand. She could only surrender to it, moaning as his lips covered hers, claimed her. His tongue pushed at the seam of her mouth, and she opened to him, submitting to this further claiming with a shudder of raw pleasure that rippled through her, then pooled molten hot between her thighs.</p><p>She\u2019d never been kissed like this. She was lost to it, her limbs languid and boneless, her veins lit up and electric.</p><p>Where Elliott\u2019s kisses were earnest, even passionately inflamed at times, Nathan\u2019s mouth was wild and untamed on hers. Possessive and fevered. His kiss branded her in a way that left all other comparisons in ashes.</p><p>When he abruptly broke contact and reared back from her, Jordana couldn\u2019t contain her cry of dismay. Nathan stared at her, his dark eyes glittering with bright amber light that swamped the thin vertical slits of his transformed pupils.</p><p>She wanted more. Jordana tried to reach for him, only to remember that he still held her hands in the manacle of his iron grasp. She frowned, struggling a bit more determinedly against his hold.</p><p>The corner of his mouth quirked with dark amusement, but his eyes were serious, unflinching, as he gave her an admonishing shake of his head. \u201cTonight we play on my terms.\u201d</p><p>Jordana stood there, panting and confused. So alive with desire, she thought she might explode if he didn\u2019t give her more.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, Miss Gates?\u201d Seamus\u2019s voice came over the emergency speaker inside the elevator car, the intrusion unwelcome but no surprise. \u201cLooks like the lift\u2019s not moving for some reason ...\u201d</p><p>She knew she should answer him. If she had any hope of saving her dignity\u2014of lessening the man\u2019s suspicions of what might be going on inside the elevator\u2014she needed to assure Seamus that they had halted the lift by accident.</p><p>But to do so meant she\u2019d have to push the intercom button on the panel on the other side of the car. And that meant she\u2019d have to insist that Nathan let her go.</p><p>He stared at her in waiting silence, seeming to understand her inner struggle, even if his smoldering gaze said he had no intention of offering her any mercy.</p><p>\u201cMiss Gates?\u201d</p><p>Jordana couldn\u2019t speak. She couldn\u2019t break the hot connection of Nathan\u2019s eyes as he leaned into her in a full-body press that ignited her every nerve ending and made her acutely aware of just how masculine and powerful this Breed warrior truly was.</p><p>He cupped her nape with his free hand, stroking the pulse point of her carotid with the pad of his thumb. So tender, even as he restrained her, even as he tempted her to shred her reputation and her virtue in the same reckless moment.</p><p>And yet Jordana swayed into his touch, as helpless to resist him as a sapling bending for the wind.</p><p>He splayed his fingers into her unbound hair, then gathered the mass of platinum waves into his hand, winding her tresses into a coil around his fist. He slowly pulled her head back, baring her throat to his hot gaze. Jordana gasped, shivering with a heady combination of fear and arousal.</p><p>Danger gleamed in Nathan\u2019s otherworldly amber eyes. His fangs were enormous, as sharp as daggers. He bent forward in aching deliberation, then kissed a searing trail from the underside of her chin to the sensitive hollow at the base of her throat.</p><p>\u201cMiss Gates, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she whispered, letting the doorman\u2019s concerned voice fade into oblivion as Nathan delved deeper and began to lick and nip his way down toward her breasts.</p><p>10</p><p>NATHAN HAD LONG CONSIDERED DISCIPLINE TO BE HIS GREATEST strength\u2014even more so than any of his Breed-born abilities or his myriad lethal skills that made him one of the most dangerous of his entire race.</p><p>But as he dragged his mouth along the silky arch of Jordana\u2019s throat, then down, toward the delectable valley between her pert breasts, he clung to his self-control by a thin tether.</p><p>She was sweet against his tongue. Responsive to his every touch. Open and compliant, her trust a gift he hadn\u2019t expected and was certain he didn\u2019t deserve.</p><p>She was so damned hot and sexy, it took all he had not to rip away her boardroom blouse and sensible skirt and bury himself to the hilt inside her beautiful body.</p><p>Nathan released the thick rope of her hair only because his palm itched to feel the pebbled buds of her nipples. His other hand stayed locked around her wrists where he still held them pinned above her head. She moaned as he fondled her breasts over the fabric of her blouse.</p><p>She gasped a moment later, when he put his hand inside and cupped one rounded, perfect globe.</p><p>\u201cNathan, please,\u201d she whispered, testing his grip on her hands. \u201cI want to touch you too.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a dark look and a sober shake of his head. \u201cMy terms tonight, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her ice-blue eyes went a bit wider, but she didn\u2019t deny him. Her tension leaked away, and Nathan went back to the business of her breasts, hissing with the pleasure of her warm heat filling his palm.</p><p>He squeezed and caressed, then pinched the little knotted peak between his fingers. It wasn\u2019t a gentle tweak\u2014he wasn\u2019t capable of softness under the best circumstances, and right now he was on the verge of a need that could easily consume him if he allowed it.</p><p>Despite what he told her, all it would have taken from Jordana was a flinch and he would have released her. One shudder of fear or uncertainty and he would have known enough to stop.</p><p>He would have accepted that this thing that burned between them could go no further than this moment.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t fight him.</p><p>No, she submitted to him now. Sweetly. Trustingly.</p><p>Dipping her chin, she watched him roll and tug her tender nipple in his fingers, her eyes heavy-lidded, their color gone from cool blue to the shadowed hue of dusk. She cried out, breathless and panting, her gaze rooted to his as he lowered his head and suckled the abused bud between his teeth and fangs.</p><p>\u201cMiss Gates, do you need help?\u201d The doorman\u2019s voice had taken on a more anxious tone now. No doubt the aging human worried that his building\u2019s most attractive, high-society tenant was being devoured by the blood-drinking monster she\u2019d brought in with her tonight.</p><p>Nathan smirked as he drew Jordana\u2019s breast more deeply into his mouth. Devouring her definitely had its appeal.</p><p>\u201cMiss Gates, please,\u201d the rent-a-cop urged. \u201cI need to know if you\u2019re all right in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, Jordana?\u201d Nathan\u2019s voice was a rough snarl in his throat, sounding more savage than normal for the way his veins were throbbing, his fangs filling his mouth. He glanced up at her in sensual challenge, the amber light of his irises washing her pale skin in a burnished glow. His cock ached, growing harder, more demanding, with each hammered beat of his pulse. \u201cAre you all right in here, or do you need Seamus to save you from me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She whimpered, squirming against him as he slowly rose before her and caged her with his body. When she spoke, the words tumbled out in a breathless gust. \u201cOh, God ... I shouldn\u2019t be doing this. I shouldn\u2019t want this ... shouldn\u2019t want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me to stop.\u201d He pressed himself against her, fusing them from chest to thigh as he licked the fluttering artery on the side of her neck, then took her earlobe between his teeth. \u201cTell me to let you go, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his free hand down the front of her body, then around her backside, squeezing one firm cheek over the fine wool weave of her skirt. When she parted her lips on an indrawn breath, he took her mouth in a deep, heated kiss, at the same time delving his fingers into the cleft of her ass.</p> <p>She gasped against his mouth, tensing for a moment, before she accepted his wicked caress. He slid deeper along that crevice, reveling in the way she quivered under his hand. He didn\u2019t cease until his fingertips were nestled in the juncture of her thighs. Her sex was a furnace against his palm, tantalizingly soft.</p><p>He wanted her bared to his touch, couldn\u2019t stand the impediment of her clothing. But some shred of reason warned him that to see her naked, here and now, in his current state of need, was a temptation not even his iron will could withstand.</p><p>Instead, Nathan satisfied his craving by gathering up the hem of her pencil skirt and slipping his hand beneath it. The hand that held Jordana\u2019s wrists began to tremble as he used his other to sweep aside her delicate panties, uncovering the moist haven between her legs.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed, exhaling a thready cry as he stroked her mound and the slick seam of her core. \u201cOh, my God ... Nathan ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me I go too far, Jordana.\u201d He dragged in a slow breath, inhaling the sweetness of her arousal. \u201cAh, Christ. Say the words and this will stop right here and now. Say you don\u2019t want it, and this is the last you\u2019ll ever see of me.\u201d</p> <p>Was the mercy he offered now\u2014rare though it was\u2014intended more for her or for himself?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know. He hadn\u2019t intended for the night to end up like this. This thing with Jordana had never been fully in his control, and seducing her like this wasn\u2019t going to make it better for either one of them.</p><p>That realization alone should have been jarring enough to cool his need. But it was impossible to deny himself the satisfaction of pleasuring Jordana. She shuddered under his touch. Her flesh was wet and lush, her petals open to him, welcoming all he had to give her.</p><p>He wondered how far he could push her. How much of his dark urges could she take?</p><p>When would she break\u2014if not in denial, then in climax?</p><p>Her cream coated his fingertips as he started to slide one finger inside her. He met with a slight resistance, reminded at once that Jordana was not the kind of experienced partner he had always preferred.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, Jordana,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou are so tight. You\u2019re so wet.\u201d Her virginity made him want to protect her and claim her at the same time. He inched his finger in only a fraction, exercising caution despite the fact that everything male in him was rampant with the urge to possess, to plunder.</p><p>But not here. Not like this.</p><p>For now, he spared her untried body, stroking her tender flesh as he smoothed the pad of his thumb over the swollen pearl of her clit. She arched into him, whimpering as he began a slow but building rhythm. She trembled and bucked, her soft moans growing more intense as he steered her toward the orgasm he felt rising in her with each fevered pound of her veins.</p><p>\u201cMiss Gates, please respond,\u201d the guard in the lobby insisted now.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she moaned. \u201cOh, God ... I\u2019ve never, not like this ... Nathan, I can\u2019t hold on any longer ...\u201d</p><p>Her body quaked with release as Nathan stroked her deeper, harder. She uttered something raw and wordless in the instant she shattered, her pale blond hair tossing around her shoulders as she was caught up in a powerful climax.</p><p>Nathan watched her splinter in wave after wave of pleasure, unable to curb the satisfied curve of his lips for knowing that she came for him. Her first time, by her own breathless admission. He had the sudden, fierce urge to show her many other firsts, each one more wicked than the next.</p><p>\u201cMiss Gates, since I can\u2019t be assured of your well-being, I\u2019m going to override the system and bring the elevator back down to the lobby\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d she gasped, panic instantly replacing pleasure on her pretty face. \u201cLet me go, Nathan.\u201d When he didn\u2019t immediately release her, Jordana\u2019s voice rose. \u201cDammit, let go!\u201d</p><p>As soon as he had, she flew to the other side of the elevator car and hit the intercom switch on the emergency panel. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Seamus. There\u2019s nothing wrong. I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Her voice sounded more than a little out of breath to Nathan, but the guard downstairs didn\u2019t seem to notice enough to remark on it. Jordana canceled the stop button and the lift resumed its ascent. \u201cWe\u2019re moving again, Seamus. I don\u2019t know what the problem was, but everything\u2019s back to normal now.\u201d</p><p>Back to normal.</p><p>Nathan studied the woman who\u2019d been writhing and moaning under the illicit touch of his hand just a minute ago. Now Jordana smoothed her skirt back in place with crisp efficiency. She reached up to finger-comb her loose platinum waves, then adjusted her disheveled blouse. Crossing her arms over herself like a shield, she blew out a long sigh.</p><p>She was trying to become Jordana Gates again, retreating back into her carefully constructed, perfectly proper cocoon. She glanced at him now, no longer watching him through passion-drowsed eyes but eyeing him with a look that was equal parts bewilderment and shame.</p><p>Nathan said nothing to ease her discomfort. His body was still raging with hunger for her, and there was a darker side of him that wanted to see how quickly he could have Jordana surrendering to him again, panting and crying out in pleasure, once he had her alone in her penthouse.</p><p>He moved up close behind her, giving her a good long feel of his stiff erection against her backside. He ground into her with his pelvis, wanting his intentions to be clear. With his head lowered, he placed his mouth near the delicate pink shell of her ear.</p><p>\u201cUntil I say otherwise, we\u2019re still on my terms, Miss Gates,\u201d he warned her, his voice rough and thick with promise. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m finished with you yet.\u201d</p><p>She shivered as he spoke his erotic threat, and he could sense her slow, spreading smile as the car came to a stop on her floor.</p><p>The doors slid open, revealing the black wrought iron grate that secured the white marble vestibule of Jordana\u2019s lavish apartment.</p><p>The grate was ajar. Someone waited inside.</p><p>A Breed male, seated on a delicate, velvet-upholstered antique chair, his head down, forearms braced on his knees. A dark wool coat was folded over his lap as if he\u2019d been sitting there for some time.</p><p>\u201cElliott.\u201d Jordana practically squeaked the vampire\u2019s name.</p><p>He lifted his head at once, worry etched deeply into his face as he stood up to greet her. \u201cJordana, thank God. I\u2014\u201d His eyes narrowed the instant he spotted Nathan behind her. Disapproval and suspicion ate away his look of concern.</p><p>Jordana stepped off the elevator and walked into the vestibule. \u201cElliott, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her at first, instead stared coldly at Nathan, lurking behind her.</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t so much as blink under the outraged scrutiny of Jordana\u2019s would-be mate. Part of him flared hot with the urge to haul Jordana against him and kiss her like he had in the elevator\u2014show Elliott Bentley-Squire that she would never belong to him.</p><p>But a possessive display like that was unnecessary.</p><p>The other Breed male could smell freshly spent desire on Jordana as easily as any of their kind, and Nathan\u2019s still-rampant erection\u2014to say nothing of his amber-swamped eyes and elongated fangs\u2014was equally hard to overlook.</p><p>Nathan would have ripped apart any male who had the bad judgment to lust after a woman he cared for, let alone touch her. Yet the Darkhaven lawyer seemed to let the affront slide with little more than a bitter scowl.</p><p>Nathan had a mind to throttle the undeserving man simply for his lack of reaction.</p><p>Bentley-Squire swung his frown on Jordana. \u201cI tried reaching you tonight, several times. When you didn\u2019t return any of my calls, naturally, I became worried something might have happened to you. Did you get my voice messages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked late,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDid Seamus let you in?\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cI don\u2019t need a human to give me permission to make sure you\u2019re all right, Jordana. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>Panic spiked in her, a feeling so intense and visceral, Nathan could practically hear the sudden race of her heartbeat from where he stood near her. She swiveled her head in his direction, and there was misery in her wintry blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was out, with Carys. We were at La Notte.\u201d Her voice quieted then, an apology swimming in her gaze. \u201cI had one too many drinks, so Nathan kindly offered to drive me home.\u201d</p><p>Bentley-Squire grunted, his lips pressed flat in disapproval. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize the Order was running a chauffeur service.\u201d Sneering, he glanced once more at Nathan. \u201cHow much do I owe you for taking care of my lady tonight?\u201d</p><p>Vibrating with menace, Nathan had already calculated ten different ways he could kill the male. He said nothing, half hoping Bentley-Squire would be fool enough to try him.</p><p>Jordana must have realized the dangerous direction of his thoughts. She pivoted back around to face him.</p><p>Please, she mouthed silently, giving him a nearly imperceptible shake of her head.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t looked so desperate, so terrified of what he might do in that moment, Nathan might have acted on the anger simmering just below his deceptively cool surface.</p><p>\u201cThank you for seeing me home safely,\u201d she told him, her politeness grating after what had happened between them just a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cJordana,\u201d Bentley-Squire said from his position behind her in the gleaming finery of the vestibule. \u201cI\u2019m sure this warrior has more pressing business to attend to tonight. You\u2019ve delayed him from his work long enough, don\u2019t you think, darling?\u201d</p><p>Nathan ignored the other vampire, his blazing eyes locked on Jordana. If she gave him any inkling that she didn\u2019t want to be there\u2014if she looked at him even remotely like she had last night at the museum reception, when her gaze seemed to all but beg him to take her somewhere, anywhere, else\u2014Nathan would have dragged her back into the elevator in that same instant.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she murmured softly. \u201cPlease try to understand.\u201d</p><p>She stepped away from him, back to the Breed male who was part of this other world she inhabited. The world that drew her back into its orbit, even while Nathan could still her hear climax in his ears, could still smell her sweet juices on his fingertips.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the anger that seethed in him as he watched her fade out of his reach.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t accustomed to letting emotion rule him.</p><p>He\u2019d survived his childhood by learning to master his feelings\u2014by learning to master every facet of his life with ruthless control and punishing discipline.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to let that hard-won control slip out of his grasp now.</p><p>Without a word, without acknowledging Jordana or the sting of her retreat, Nathan stalked into the elevator and hit the down button.</p><p>Elliott Bentley-Squire had been right, after all. Nathan did have more pressing business to attend to tonight, back in his own world.</p><p>About damned time he got back to it.</p><p>Forcing her feet to remain rooted to the floor, Jordana watched the elevator doors close behind Nathan.</p><p>Instantly, she regretted that she hadn\u2019t had the nerve to walk right in with him. Not to follow him like some passion-blinded fool but to taste some of the freedom he seemed to enjoy as someone who walked his own path, controlled his own destiny.</p><p>And yes, she had to admit, there was a wild, reckless part of her that did want to taste some of Nathan\u2019s freedom firsthand, as the woman at his side. As the lover in his bed, abandoning herself to his every powerful, wicked whim.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t promised her anything tonight. Even if he had, she couldn\u2019t throw her life away on an impetuous impulse.</p><p>Why not? some dangerous voice whispered in the back of her mind.</p><p>How long could she act as if she wasn\u2019t slowly suffocating under the burden of what everyone in her life expected of her?</p><p>Nathan\u2019s words came back to her in a rush\u2014all the intimate truths he seemed to know about her, when a few days ago they\u2019d been all but strangers to each other.</p><p>His words had made her angry. Even in his absence now, she felt cornered and exposed, stripped bare in a way no one had ever done to her before.</p><p>His touch had made her burn. Tonight Nathan had made her feel as if she\u2019d been living and breathing for the very first time in all her nearly twenty-five years.</p><p>And she\u2019d simply let him walk away.</p><p>Not that it had taken much for him to go.</p><p>Jordana hadn\u2019t missed his seething reaction to her attempt to pretend nothing had happened between them\u2014that he hadn\u2019t just given her the most explosive experience of her life.</p><p>She\u2019d done it out of fear, and out of a feeble respect for Elliott. She didn\u2019t love him, but that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to wound or humiliate him. Even so, Elliott was an intelligent man, and Jordana knew only an imbecile would mistake the intense, erotic energy that sizzled between Nathan and her for anything other than what it was.</p><p>\u201cJordana,\u201d Elliott said now, his tone soothing as it broke into her private torment. \u201cDarling, you can\u2019t intend to stand out here all evening. Come inside with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced at him over her shoulder, a frown etching into her brow. \u201cAren\u2019t you upset with me about what happened tonight?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her slowly, then gave a mild shake of his head. \u201cYou\u2019re home safe, and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? A bubble of hysteria climbed into the back of her throat. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to you that I was with another man?\u201d At Elliott\u2019s prolonged silence in response, she exhaled a sharp laugh. \u201cMy God, it doesn\u2019t bother you at all. You don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p> <p>There was no venom in her words, only a sense of disbelief that she\u2019d never realized this truth until now. The discovery didn\u2019t upset her. It liberated her.</p><p>\u201cYou never really wanted me at all, did you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily, his expression patient, kindly indulgent. \u201cAre you trying to provoke me, Jordana? Of course I care about you. I always have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, seeing it now. \u201cYou care for me, the same way my father does. The same way a dear uncle would. Like a child, a ward in need of guidance and protection. Not the way you would if I really meant something to you.\u201d</p><p>He cursed now, but there was no passion there either. \u201cCome inside, Jordana. I forgive whatever went on between you and that miscreant from the Order. Let\u2019s put this night behind us where it belongs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest, her feet refusing to move, even when Elliott came over and tried to guide her away from the elevator. He put his arm around her shoulders, and she ducked out of his embrace. \u201cI can\u2019t do any of this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of what, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis. Us. All of it.\u201d God, she hadn\u2019t imagined she\u2019d be standing there, ending the farce of her relationship with him like this, but it felt good to let it go. It felt right, for both of them. \u201cI\u2019d like you to leave now, Elliott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d He studied her cautiously for a moment, then shook his head in denial. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will, Jordana. I understand. It\u2019s late, and you\u2019re upset. I don\u2019t think you realize what you\u2019re saying or doing right now.\u201d</p><p>She barked out a sharp laugh. \u201cStop telling me how I feel, Elliott. Dammit, I wish everyone would stop telling me what they think I should do and think and feel!\u201d</p><p>He stared at her like he might look at a furious, hissing snake suddenly dropped in his lap. \u201cThis kind of outburst isn\u2019t like you, Jordana. You\u2019re only proving my point that you need someone to look after you right now. I really think it best that I stay awhile\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she replied. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>She punched the elevator call button, half hoping it would come back up with Nathan still inside. But when the doors whisked open a moment later, the car was empty.</p><p>\u201cJordana, you\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d Elliott said as she stepped into the lift. \u201cThis kind of behavior isn\u2019t like you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut maybe it should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordana\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Elliott.\u201d She pushed the down button, feeling a sudden surge of exhilaration\u2014her first taste of newfound freedom\u2014as the doors slid closed in front of Elliott\u2019s incredulous expression.</p><p>11</p><p>NATHAN MADE THE TREK BACK TO LA NOTTE ON FOOT. NOT EVEN the brisk run through the cool night streets managed to curb the rawness of his need for a woman he should never have pursued in the first place.</p> <p>He was a man used to being in control of every situation, especially when it came to sex. He fucked who he wanted, when he wanted. He called the shots. He controlled the rules, the pace, the boundaries. He decided how things started and ended\u2014all of it, every time.</p><p>And then she came along.</p><p>Jordana, and that impulsive kiss that had ignited a flame in him that he couldn\u2019t seem to put out.</p><p>Taking things as far as he had tonight had only made that heat flare hotter. If he\u2019d expected to have a taste of her only so he could finally get her out of his head\u2014get the need for her out of his blood\u2014then he\u2019d just proven himself a goddamned fool.</p><p>He could still see her face as she pleaded with him to keep his silence, to play along with her where Elliott Bentley-Squire was concerned. It shouldn\u2019t have mattered to him, but it did. What she had with the other Breed male was a fucking farce that burned Nathan almost as much as the fact that he still craved her with a fierceness he could hardly reconcile.</p><p>She had made it pretty clear that she intended to keep to her own, even if she had to do it unhappily. So now Jordana was back at her place with a male who didn\u2019t deserve her, and Nathan was hoofing it into Cassian Gray\u2019s seedy club with a raging hard-on and a deadly bad attitude.</p><p>He found Rafe down in the empty arena of the old neo-Gothic church, questioning a trio of humans employed as blood Hosts to serve the club\u2019s vampire clientele. As Nathan strode in, the blond warrior lifted his chin in acknowledgment and dismissed the group with a low command.</p><p>\u201cGot the place swept out, except for the fighters and some of the staff,\u201d Rafe informed him. \u201cNobody\u2019s giving up anything on Cass, though. We\u2019ve questioned everyone. They\u2019re all telling the same story\u2014no one\u2019s seen hide or hair of the son of a bitch for the past several days.\u201d</p><p>Nathan grunted, his voice gravel in his throat for the way his blood was still pounding in his veins. \u201cMaybe the disruption of tonight\u2019s revenue stream will get his attention.\u201d</p><p>Rafe arched a tawny brow. \u201cRight now, that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got. Where the hell did you go? I looked for you an hour ago, but you were gone. When I saw Carys with Rune a few minutes ago, she said she thought you left with Jordana Gates.\u201d</p><p>Nathan bit back the ripe curse on his tongue. Barely. \u201cShe was in no shape for driving, so I brought her home. Took longer than planned.\u201d</p><p>His friend and teammate studied him, then blew out the curse that Nathan strived to contain. \u201cYou and Jordana. Jesus, Nathan. Do you really think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he replied, not interested in explaining himself, nor in reliving what had gone on between Jordana and him tonight. \u201cI think it\u2019s one bad fucking idea. And after tonight, it\u2019s not happening, so feel free to drop the subject and tell me what you and the rest of the squad have been doing while I was gone.\u201d</p><p>As Rafe gave him a quick rundown, one of the club\u2019s other service workers came out of the back corridor that led to the BDSM dens. Dressed in a few straps of black leather held together by silver metal rings, the brunette female sashayed into the arena in a pair of tall, glossy boots with sky-high heels.</p><p>She\u2019d taken care of him once or twice at the club, one of the many nameless partners who had long been his preference. The sex worker spotted him now and her hips took on a more languid, inviting sway as she headed to the bar a few feet away from him.</p><p>\u201cWe cleared the sim lounge and dance club upstairs,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cEli and Jax are giving Cass\u2019s office and private apartment another once-over. I came down here to see if I could squeeze anything useful out of the service staff, since Syn and Rune and the other fighters are less than cooperative.\u201d</p><p>Although he was listening to the report, Nathan couldn\u2019t help but notice how the woman leaned over the bar to reach for a bottle of liquor, giving him a good long look at her ass and the leather thong wedged between her cheeks. His body was still fevered from want of Jordana, and it responded to the obvious invitation from this other woman the same way his fingers would reach to scratch an itch.</p><p>And she worked hard to get his attention. Grabbing a bottle of whiskey from the bar, she poured herself a shot and checked to make sure he was watching. As she tilted her head back and downed the amber liquor in one long, open-throated gulp, Nathan saw another delicate neck in his mind.</p><p>In a hard, heated instant, he relived the sight of Jordana\u2019s pale, pretty throat, bared to him as he\u2019d tugged her head back, the silky platinum rope of her hair wound around his fist.</p><p>Hunger drew his fangs out, and he wondered how long it had been since he fed. About as long as it had been since he satisfied the other craving that was gnawing at him, both made worse after the way his encounter with Jordana had left him feeling.</p><p>The sharp, nagging edge of his twin needs aggravated him, but even more disturbing was the fact that everything male and primal in him demanded he head right back to her place and slake the need she stirred in him\u2014even if he had to tear through Elliott Bentley-Squire to have her.</p><p>Dangerous thoughts.</p><p>And a craving he could not permit himself to act on, no matter how tempting.</p><p>The leather-clad female plopped her shot glass back on the bar and sauntered past him, an inviting look in her eyes as she slinked back to the corridor leading to the BDSM dens.</p><p>Rafe stared after her too and let out a low, approving whistle. \u201cMaybe I should do a more in-depth interrogation of some of the backroom staff. Wouldn\u2019t want to leave any stone unturned.\u201d</p><p>Nathan slanted him a dark look. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more for us to do here tonight. Go tell Jax and Eli to wrap things up. I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Rafe shrugged, then took off to carry out his captain\u2019s order.</p><p>Once he was gone back up to the club at street level, Nathan crossed the arena floor on a direct course for the VIP rooms in back.</p><p>The brunette was waiting for him, already arranged for his pleasure on a red leather settee with her legs spread wide and her hair gathered off to the side to give him open access to her carotid. \u201cHow can I serve you tonight, sir?\u201d</p><p>Nathan stepped inside the room. A pair of buckled restraints hung from a hook on the wall near the door. He took them down, then kicked the door closed behind him with the heel of his combat boot.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you walked out on Elliott?\u201d Carys\u2019s voice sounded incredulous on the other end of the line. \u201cWhat happened? Does this have something to do with you and Nathan? I saw you leave the club with him. Did something happen between you? Is Nathan with you right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s gone.\u201d After the way she\u2019d acted, probably gone for good.</p><p>Jordana hated the way things had ended tonight. She\u2019d been a coward and a fool, and she owed him an apology at the very least. She hoped he would accept it, if she ever saw him again.</p><p>If she was being honest with herself, she hoped for far more than that.</p><p>While she hadn\u2019t broken it off with Elliott because she expected anything from Nathan, she\u2019d be a liar if she tried to deny her attraction to him.</p><p>Attraction? Good lord, the way her heart raced at the thought of him\u2014the way her body still hummed with electricity from the wicked things he did to her, things he warned that he intended to continue before they\u2019d come face-to-face with Elliott at her apartment\u2014Jordana had to admit that what she felt toward Nathan was a pull as fierce as the tide to the moon.</p><p>He was darkness, as cool and untouchable as night itself, and she craved to know him, to be close to him, like nothing she had known before.</p><p>Tonight he\u2019d taken her to the edge of that cliff she feared, but she\u2019d been too terrified to step off.</p><p>Jordana blew a sigh past the receiver of her phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, Car. One I don\u2019t particularly feel like reliving at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jordana heard her friend whisper the gist of the situation to Rune. \u201cSo, if you left Elliott at the apartment, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Commonwealth, just outside my building,\u201d Jordana said, her low heels clicking on the sidewalk. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fine. I just needed to get out of there.\u201d</p><p>Part of the problem with making a dramatic exit, she had realized pretty quickly, was the need to have someplace else to go.</p><p>The thought of going home to her father\u2019s Darkhaven didn\u2019t hold much appeal. It was late, and although she would have been welcomed with open arms, Jordana didn\u2019t want to show up on her father\u2019s doorstep to disappoint him with the news that she\u2019d failed at the relationship he wanted so badly to work for her.</p><p>Ordinarily, she might have gone to the museum to escape. It had been her secret refuge on numerous occasions in the past, but she hadn\u2019t quite been able to shake her sense of unease about being watched as she\u2019d gone to her car in the parking lot earlier that night. And although her cocktail buzz was long past, Jordana wasn\u2019t about to climb behind the wheel and drive aimlessly through the city so late at night.</p><p>\u201cCome back to the club,\u201d Carys told her. \u201cFrom the sounds of it, the Order has the place pretty well shut down, but I\u2019m still here with Rune. We can both crash in his quarters overnight and sort everything out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Carys. I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not far from the train. It\u2019ll get you here in less than ten minutes. I\u2019ll be waiting for you. Come around back and I\u2019ll let you in through the staff entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarys\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of you for once, okay? Be here in ten, or I\u2019m sending Rune out to drag you here.\u201d</p><p>Which is how Jordana found herself getting off the train in the old North End some seven minutes later and walking the short block to La Notte\u2019s rear door.</p><p>Carys was there before she even had a chance to knock, opening the door and pulling Jordana into a warm embrace. \u201cYou\u2019re shivering,\u201d Carys pointed out. \u201cCome in, and tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Jordana walked with her friend into the back corridor, feeling relieved to have come, now that she was there.</p><p>But the feeling was short-lived.</p><p>No sooner had she stepped inside when a door opened farther ahead of them in the gloomy passageway. A man walked out and strode in the opposite direction of Jordana and Carys. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, not just a man\u2014a Breed warrior. Six and a half feet of sinew and dark, stormy menace. Jordana knew that massive build and prowling swagger anywhere.</p><p>She could still feel his hands on her. She could still hear the sinful rumble of his deep voice against her ear.</p><p>Nathan.</p> <p>God help her, she almost called his name out loud.</p><p>But then, in that next awful instant, a woman came out of the room behind him.</p><p>More naked than not, she strutted out on spiked boots, her breasts strapped into a complicated web of black leather and metal rings, another skimpy, punishing-looking set of straps emphasizing the round globes of her bare behind.</p><p>There could be no mistaking the brunette\u2019s line of work. Nor the fact that she and Nathan had been in the room together behind the closed door.</p><p>The woman glanced over her shoulder and spotted Jordana and Carys gaping at her in the corridor. In the sex worker\u2019s hand was a wad of cash, which she ceremoniously slipped beneath one of the tight black strips of leather on her bosom before sauntering off.</p> <p>Jordana felt sick. If she\u2019d been afraid of how she\u2019d left things with Nathan tonight, apparently she shouldn\u2019t have worried. He certainly hadn\u2019t wasted any time finding a replacement for her.</p><p>Disappointment and hurt roared up on her. She was pissed too\u2014at him, but even more so at herself, for caring enough to be upset.</p><p>\u201cGet me out of here,\u201d she whispered to Carys.</p><p>Her friend looked equally miserable. \u201cOh, God, honey. I had no idea. I never would\u2019ve told you to come\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t know I was here,\u201d Jordana hissed urgently. \u201cDon\u2019t let him see me, please. He can\u2019t know that I saw him here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Carys took her hand. \u201cCome on. Rune\u2019s quarters are this way.\u201d</p> <p>Jordana followed her friend down another length of dark hallway, feeling as if that cliff she\u2019d been so afraid of had suddenly broken away under her feet and left her falling.</p><p>12</p><p>\u201cYOU TRYING TO CLEAN THAT FIREARM OR RUB OFF THE SERIAL number?\u201d</p><p>Jolted, Nathan swung his head around from the table and chair where he was seated and found Sterling Chase leaning against the jamb of the open weapons room door.</p><p>Jesus Christ. He\u2019d been so engrossed in his work, his head full of steam and troubling realizations, he hadn\u2019t even heard the commander arrive.</p><p>It was early morning at the Order\u2019s Boston headquarters. Most everyone in the compound and the connected estate would be in bed. Nathan, however, had been awake and twitchy ever since he and his team returned to base last night. A couple hours ago, he\u2019d finally given up the idea of sleep and decided to make some productive use of his restlessness.</p><p>He met Chase\u2019s stare. Years of old training schooled his expression to a bland, unreadable mask before he went back to cleaning and lubricating the field-stripped black Beretta 9 mm. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect to see you down here at this hour. How long you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of minutes,\u201d Chase said. \u201cLong enough. You wanna talk about it?\u201d</p> <p>With nimble fingers, Nathan reassembled the pistol and set it aside. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Chase strode into the room now and took up a position next to Nathan\u2019s worktable, his thick arms crossed over his chest. He wore a white short-sleeve T-shirt and loose gray sweats, his trim golden hair rumpled.</p><p>At the moment, Sterling Chase looked less like the impeccable, tight-ship captain he was and more like a man with troubles of his own. Troubles that dragged him from the comfort of the warm bed he shared with his mate at an unholy, early hour.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been up for a while yourself.\u201d Nathan glanced at him sidelong. \u201cMaybe you wanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Chase smirked and blew out a short sigh. \u201cI guess I\u2019m still trying to get used to the fact that Carys moved out. Tavia doesn\u2019t like it either, but she says we have to give her time. Give her space.\u201d A growl rumbled in the vampire\u2019s chest. \u201cIf anything happens to her ... if anyone hurts her now that she\u2019s living outside my direct protection\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing all right,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cShe has people looking out for her.\u201d</p><p>Chase scoffed. \u201cJordana Gates may be well connected in the Darkhavens, but no one she knows is going to keep my little girl safe the way her mother and I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour little girl is a full-grown woman,\u201d Nathan pointed out. \u201cShe\u2019s making her own choices. You have to trust her. Hold her too close and you\u2019ll only make her pull away harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhilosophy at this hour\u2014and from you, besides?\u201d Chase chuckled, then gave a nod. \u201cIt\u2019s good advice, Nathan. Gonna be damned hard to follow it, though. And if Carys ends up getting harmed by anyone in any way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll have you and all the rest of the Order making sure someone pays,\u201d Nathan said.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight she will,\u201d Chase agreed, his blue eyes glittering with menace. He went quiet for a moment, then cleared his throat. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s actually not the only reason I\u2019m pacing the halls this morning.\u201d</p><p>Nathan glanced up. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon called a few minutes ago from D.C. One of Crowe\u2019s exes surrendered some interesting news under tranced interrogation today. Seems Reginald Crowe had a mistress.\u201d</p><p>That was the most promising intel they\u2019d uncovered so far. \u201cWho? Where can we find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIreland. Dublin, according to the former Mrs. Crowe,\u201d Chase said. \u201cAs for the who of it, we\u2019re still trying to figure that out. We don\u2019t even have a name yet. All we know is that Crowe\u2019s ex claims he saw this woman frequently during their marriage and that it had been going on for quite some time.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s veins lit up with the instinctive, predatory spark of his assassin past. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find her. We\u2019ve got to find her now. I can be ready to roll out anytime, if you need me to go in solo and see this done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re best utilized right here in Boston, going after Cassian Gray. Besides, we have boots on the ground over there already. Mathias Rowan\u2019s team in London will be mobilizing at sundown tonight. Lucan\u2019s put this in their court for now.\u201d Chase narrowed a look on him. \u201cYou\u2019ve never walked away from a mission. You\u2019re not looking to do that now, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Nathan replied, a brisk denial, even though his conscience pricked him.</p><p>Had he been hoping for a reassignment? One that would put a whole continent between him and Jordana Gates?</p><p>Fuck, he didn\u2019t know what to think about that.</p><p>Chase studied him now. \u201cYou seem ... unfocused, my man. Like you\u2019re walking a dangerous edge. What\u2019s going on with you? When\u2019s the last time you fed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with a blood Host last night,\u201d he replied, the unwanted reminder of the brunette from La Notte\u2019s BDSM club making his voice darken to a growl.</p><p>Chase seemed to consider for a long moment, his shrewd gaze lingering for longer than Nathan liked. But his commander didn\u2019t challenge the lie, even if he suspected it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your work,\u201d he said, and headed for the door. \u201cGood job last night. If nothing bubbles up to the surface on Cassian Gray today, let\u2019s hit him even harder again tonight.\u201d</p><p>Nathan gave him a vague nod. Only after Chase was gone back up the corridor did Nathan release the curse that had been burning like acid on his tongue.</p><p>Although Chase seemed satisfied with his answer, Nathan knew the elder vampire had seen through him. Self-directed anger heated Nathan\u2019s blood at the dishonor he\u2019d shown the other Breed male just now. He had never been compelled to lie to his comrades, least of all his commander. His training as a Hunter would have deemed a breach like that suicidal.</p><p>And while Nathan was many years away from the brutality and punishments of his handlers, their lessons had never left him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect they ever would.</p><p>No one knew what he had endured as part of his shaping into the killer he became for Dragos. Not even his mother, Corinne, who rescued him from that life, or her mate, Hunter, a Breed male brought up in the same program as Nathan decades earlier.</p><p>Not even Nathan\u2019s closest friends and teammates in the Order knew what he went through\u2014no, especially none of them. They would never see him the same way again if they knew how he\u2019d been degraded, shamed.</p><p>He\u2019d kept that corrupted, dirty part of him a secret all his life. Stuffed it down deep, the only way he was able to move on, move past it.</p><p>And he intended to keep it there forever.</p><p>As for Jordana, he would turn his deadly skills on himself before he would ever let her know his truth. Ironic that he\u2019d pressed her so hard to open herself to him when he had no intention of truly letting her in.</p><p>It was a small mercy that he hadn\u2019t been able to seduce her completely last night. He might have done things he could never take back.</p><p>Far better that he slake his carnal appetites elsewhere. That had been his thinking when he went with the female at La Notte. But his effort to purge his hunger for Jordana with another woman had only made him want her more.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t taken the sex worker\u2019s vein, as he\u2019d implied to Chase. He hadn\u2019t taken anything from the woman, in fact, but he\u2019d paid her just the same.</p><p>And after he and his team left the club soon afterward to search the city for leads on Cass, Nathan had made sure his path took him past Jordana\u2019s building. Just to assure himself she was safe, he\u2019d told himself, but it had taken all of his increasingly questionable restraint to keep his feet from carrying him inside and back up the elevator to her penthouse.</p><p>But the apartment had been dark from the street.</p><p>He\u2019d moved on but spent the rest of the night\u2019s patrol trying\u2014and failing\u2014to keep her out of his thoughts. Recalling her orgasm with him was only slightly less tormenting than picturing her home in her dark apartment with Elliott Bentley-Squire.</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t like the violence that perked to life inside him at the thought of another male being with Jordana. Especially one with less obsession for her than him.</p><p>Not that Nathan was worthy of her. His background made him unfit for anyone, but particularly a woman as pure and clean as Jordana.</p><p>He had already brought her too close to his world. And he knew he would have taken things much further last night if not for running into her undeserving, would-be mate.</p><p>He had to be done with Jordana Gates.</p><p>Already she was starting to mean more to him than he cared to admit, and that, if nothing else, was cause enough for him to keep his distance.</p><p>Even if that meant watching her bind herself in blood and vow to a male she would never love.</p><p>By five o\u2019clock that afternoon, Jordana had already put in an eleven-hour day at the museum.</p><p>She\u2019d gone in alone, hours before anyone else had shown up for work. After everything that had happened the night before, the solitude of her workplace had been welcome, even more needed than sleep.</p><p>Jordana had eventually left La Notte around two in the morning, accompanied back to her apartment by Carys and Rune. Elliott had been long gone by then. He\u2019d politely turned off the lights and locked up for her, apparently departing her life as ambivalently as he\u2019d entered it.</p><p>Jordana wasn\u2019t sure how she would break the news of their split to her father. Then again, dutiful Elliott probably had taken care of that for her too.</p><p>Instead, she had chosen to put all of the drama and emotional stress on hold for a while, letting her work at the museum absorb her. It was the one thing she had that had always been hers all on her own, historic art being her passion.</p><p>Her personal sanctuary and escape.</p><p>Fortunately, her work was giving her plenty of things to think about, aside from the sudden mess of her private life. The exhibit\u2019s grand opening was little more than twenty-four hours away and was nearly sold out. She and Carys had reviewed the final list of preparations top to bottom twice today, ensuring that everything was in place for a successful event.</p><p>Still, that didn\u2019t keep Jordana from obsessing over the details yet again. She was in her office on the phone with the local florist when she felt a queer prickling of the fine hairs at her nape.</p><p>Was someone in the closed exhibit room outside?</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be Carys. She\u2019d left just a few minutes ago to pick up a last-minute printing order across town. As for the rest of the museum staff, most would be packing up and preparing to close for the night.</p><p>But there was definitely someone in the exhibit. Jordana felt the presence like a cool hand settling against the back of her neck. She felt observed somehow, much as she had been in the parking lot the other night. Anxiety spiked through her as she ended her phone conversation and walked out of her office.</p><p>A man stood inside the closed exhibit.</p><p>Dressed in a rumpled, rain-dappled gray overcoat, he pivoted to face her as she approached. He was tall and fit beneath the drooping coat, worn jeans, and faded T-shirt. His short, bland brown hair was combed neatly to the side.</p><p>Everything about him was average and nondescript, except for his eyes. An arresting shade of peridot, they held her in an unrushed, considering stare.</p><p>Although nothing about him broadcasted a threat, Jordana\u2019s senses remained alert, expectant in some odd way. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the exhibit hasn\u2019t opened to the public yet. You can\u2019t be in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay long,\u201d he said. \u201cI only wanted to come in and have a quick look.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to ask you to leave. We have tickets for sale at the museum website, or you can come back tomorrow evening at the grand opening and purchase a ticket at the door.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t acknowledge the offer or her request for him to go. Slowly, fluidly, he strolled from one art display to another.</p><p>\u201cA Canova,\u201d he said, walking over to the clear case containing a marble bust of Beatrice from the famous, epic poetry of Dante Alighieri. \u201cAn impressive piece.\u201d</p><p>Jordana followed the man to the sculpture, taking in his modest attire more closely now. None of his clothes looked newer than a decade old, and they fit him like they\u2019d been broken in on someone else and cast off years later. His brown leather loafers were scuffed and scarred, faded and timeworn like the rest of what he wore.</p> <p>\u201cCanova is considered one of the greatest neoclassical sculptors,\u201d Jordana said, unable to resist sharing her knowledge of the collection. \u201cHe was probably the most famous artist of his day, but I don\u2019t find many people who know his work on sight. Particularly the lesser-known pieces like this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore\u2019s the pity.\u201d Her uninvited visitor\u2019s mouth curved in a faint smile. \u201cCanova\u2019s work is exquisite, no question. There is a calmness to his sculpture, from the smoothness of his subject\u2019s skin, to the fluid form of each curve and the flawless stroke of every line.\u201d</p><p>Listening to him speak so eloquently and so well informed, Jordana suddenly felt awkward for insisting he\u2019d have to pay to view the art that belonged by rights to the world. In spite of her earlier misgivings about him, she found herself intrigued.</p><p>He went on, still studying the sculpture. \u201cThe perfection of Canova\u2019s work\u2014the pure idealism of it\u2014invites the eye to linger, to study and admire.\u201d The man glanced to Jordana. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>Jordana shrugged. \u201cHonestly, I find it too perfect. His art is too ... I don\u2019t know. Too controlled, I suppose.\u201d She gestured to a neighboring marble piece, one of the collection\u2019s most important acquisitions. \u201cTake this Bernini bust, on the other hand. Look at the energy of his work. It\u2019s unsettling, unrefined. Aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>The sculpture they looked at was Anima Dannata, depicting a condemned soul staring into the abyss of hell. Jordana drew closer to the display. \u201cBernini shows you every crag in his subject\u2019s face, every livid vein and hair standing on end. You can actually see the torment in the man\u2019s face\u2014you can feel it. You can almost hear the scream of horror from the man\u2019s open mouth. Bernini shows you everything. He dares you to experience it.\u201d</p><p>The stranger nodded. \u201cYou take your art very seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d Jordana admitted. \u201cIt means everything to me.\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in his unusual green eyes. \u201cWe share that in common, then. I am a lover of art myself. And today, a newfound appreciation for Bernini. Your favorite piece, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jordana said, shaking her head. \u201cNo, there\u2019s another sculpture that I like even more. But it\u2019s not as important as either of these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you show me?\u201d</p> <p>For a moment, Jordana forgot all about the fact that the exhibit was currently off-limits to anyone but museum staff. She led him to another of the pieces housed inside a Plexiglas display.</p><p>\u201cCornacchini\u2019s Sleeping Endymion,\u201d he said, a smile on his lips. Jordana noticed he hadn\u2019t needed to read the placard. \u201cYou know this one too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been in the museum\u2019s collection for many years, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it has.\u201d He must be a longtime patron of the museum, to be so familiar not only with art in general but with this particular piece as well. \u201cEndymion came to us by anonymous donation a couple decades ago. It was in another exhibit most of that time, but when I began planning this collection, I had to have it.\u201d She gazed at the reclining human shepherd, sleeping under Selene\u2019s crescent moon. \u201cThere\u2019s not another piece in the entire museum that I love more than this one.\u201d</p><p>A cryptic smile played at the corners of the stranger\u2019s mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it being in better hands.\u201d</p><p>Jordana considered the odd compliment, her curiosity about the man deepening the longer she spoke with him. He couldn\u2019t be more than thirty years old, she guessed, but he had a wisdom about him\u2014an indefinable aura that made him seem far older than his age.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t Breed; he had no dermaglyphs that she could see, nor would he be walking around during daylight hours without being wrapped in yards of UV-protective gear, if he was one of Nathan\u2019s kind.</p><p>And yet her senses seemed to resist the notion to call him human.</p> <p>Flummoxed, she extended her hand to him. \u201cI\u2019m Jordana Gates, by the way. The exhibit curator.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated momentarily before taking her hand in a warm, firm grasp. \u201cYes, I know who you are.\u201d At her uneasy look, he indicated the ID badge hanging from the lanyard looped around her neck.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jordana laughed nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but ... who are you?\u201d</p><p>At first, she didn\u2019t think he would answer. Then, carefully, he said, \u201cCassian.\u201d No more, no less.</p><p>Did she know that name from somewhere?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be sure, but Jordana knew she\u2019d never seen this man before.</p><p>Jordana withdrew her hand from his. \u201cWell, Mr. Cassian, I really have enjoyed talking with you. But it\u2019s getting late and no one is supposed to be in the exhibit before it officially opens tomorrow, so ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he replied politely, even dipping his head slightly in an almost courtly bow. \u201cAnd I assure you, Jordana, the pleasure has been all mine.\u201d</p><p>She took in his shoddy attire again and felt a pang of regret for the way she\u2019d discounted him on sight. And she couldn\u2019t just push him out the door, especially not knowing how much he enjoyed the exhibit. \u201cWait here a moment. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t pause for his answer. Impulsively, she pivoted away and hurried back into her office. Riffling through her desk, she grabbed a pair of complimentary tickets to tomorrow\u2019s grand opening event and full-day admission to the museum.</p><p>\u201cI just remembered I had a couple of leftover passes in my office,\u201d she said as she returned to the exhibit room. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to have\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cassian?\u201d Jordana scanned the area, then made a quick search of the nearby exhibits.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>She hurried to the gallery overlooking the museum\u2019s main entrance lobby.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He had left.</p><p>No, he\u2019d vanished.</p><p>Mysterious Mr. Cassian was gone, as swiftly and cleanly as a ghost.</p><p>13</p><p>HE HAD RISKED FAR TOO MUCH.</p><p>Cass made a hasty dash through the city streets, oblivious of the rain that soaked his thrift store clothes and cheap, soggy shoes.</p><p>He was across the city from the museum now, unsure where he was headed except that it had to be away. Far away. As far as he could get, and he had to go at once.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected to linger as long as he had. In his mind, he\u2019d imagined entering the museum for a few short minutes\u2014just long enough to visit the treasure that had branded him a wanted man, traitor to his queen and his kind.</p><p>A treasure that he was giving up today ... forever.</p><p>Of course, the anonymous donor of the Sleeping Endymion sculpture twenty-five years ago was no mystery to him. He couldn\u2019t deny his satisfaction\u2014his relief\u2014at knowing that particular treasure was in a safe place, and had been all this time.</p><p>But the terra cotta figure wasn\u2019t the only secret he\u2019d been keeping since he\u2019d fled the Atlantean queen\u2019s court.</p><p>Either one of his secrets could have gotten him killed.</p><p>The risk of discovery was too great now. He was jeopardizing all he cherished by remaining in Boston.</p><p>He\u2019d almost chanced this visit to the museum a couple of nights ago, but he\u2019d lost his nerve and instead skulked outside the building like a wraith. He\u2019d barely gotten away without creating undue notice.</p><p>But he had to look upon his greatest, most precious secret one last time\u2014an indulgence he had been careful to avoid at all costs for nearly a quarter century.</p><p>Now he was content. He had to be, because today he was leaving for good. He could only hope that his secrets\u2014and the treasure he cherished most of all\u2014would be safer for his absence.</p><p>Cass had placed his trust in an ally who had proven his loyalty through years of silence and sacrifice. That trust had been reaffirmed at their meeting a couple of days ago.</p><p>Another ally\u2014this one across the globe\u2014one who risked as much as Cass in aiding him, had agreed to look out for Cass\u2019s interests once he\u2019d fled for his permanent exile.</p><p>An exile that would begin now.</p><p>Resolved, Cass pulled up his collar to shield himself from the slanting rain as he ducked down a side alley.</p><p>That\u2019s when he noticed them\u2014the trio of dark figures that had fallen in behind him.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder and his stomach went cold.</p><p>Atlantean soldiers.</p><p>The three immortals were disguised in pedestrian street clothes, much as he was. But their purposeful stride and menacing presence were unmistakable.</p><p>And beneath the long hem of one of their sodden trench coats, Cassian spied the glint of an Atlantean blade.</p><p>There was a time he might have turned around and faced this threat. A time when he would have fought it, even unarmed as he was now.</p><p>But today, he knew true fear.</p><p>Not for himself, but for the secrets he would die to protect.</p><p>Cass took off running, leading the legion guards as far away from the museum as he could, calling upon every ounce of his preternatural agility and speed.</p><p>The queen\u2019s men were close behind him\u2014too close. They zigged and zagged as he did, never losing sight of him for a second.</p><p>In minutes, Cass and his pursuers were in the city\u2019s old North End. He hadn\u2019t intended it, but his feet had carried him to the only home he\u2019d truly known since coming to Boston.</p><p>La Notte was just ahead. Through the rain, Cass saw the back entrance of the club a few hundred yards in front of him.</p><p>The Atlantean guards had split up at some point.</p><p>Cassian lost track of one of them.</p><p>He didn\u2019t see the assassin until it was too late.</p><p>The soldier from Selene\u2019s royal court appeared out of nowhere, standing in front of him, long blade gleaming.</p><p>I\u2019m dead, Cassian realized. It was over now.</p><p>He knew it, even before he felt the ice-cold kiss of Atlantean steel biting into the side of his neck.</p><p>\u201cA toast,\u201d Carys said, raising a glass of red wine across the table from Jordana at one of their favorite Italian restaurants in the city\u2019s old North End. \u201cTo the exhibit grand opening. I know it\u2019s going to be a huge success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Jordana sighed and clinked her glass against her friend\u2019s. \u201cDid you check to make sure the placard on the French tapestry was corrected? And now I\u2019m wondering if I shouldn\u2019t have moved that display of Roman pottery from where we had it for the patrons\u2019 reception. Do you think it should go back to its original place?\u201d</p><p>Carys grinned and rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, Jordana, all of it. You thought of everything. The exhibit couldn\u2019t possibly be in better hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Jordana smiled at the compliment, but she couldn\u2019t help being reminded of her odd visitor, Mr. Cassian, and the fact that he\u2019d said something very similar to her.</p><p>Carys gave her a quizzical look. \u201cDid I say something funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just ...\u201d Jordana shook her head. \u201cA man came in to view the exhibit this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Carys frowned. \u201cSomeone you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d never seen him before. He apparently just wandered in from the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the exhibit doesn\u2019t open to the public until tomorrow night,\u201d Carys pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told him.\u201d Jordana took a sip of her wine. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem bothered that we weren\u2019t officially open yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d Carys said, twisting some pasta onto her fork. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>Jordana shrugged. \u201cI suppose he wanted to look at the art. That\u2019s what he said, anyway. We talked for a while about Italian sculptors and compared some of the pieces in the collection, then he left.\u201d</p><p>Carys eyed her over the rim of her wineglass. \u201cLike I said, weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was ... nice,\u201d Jordana said, taking a bite of her scampi as she thought about the man and the short time she spent with him in the exhibit.</p><p>He was a stranger, a peculiar one at that, and yet she\u2019d felt almost instantly at ease around him. Despite his oddness and his uninvited presence in the museum, she had felt comfortable with him; safe, in some indefinable way. And she would have enjoyed talking with him a bit longer, had he not left the museum without explanation as soon as she turned her back.</p><p>Vanished, more like it.</p><p>Maybe Carys was right, there was something weird about the man.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s musing was interrupted when her friend\u2019s comm unit pulsed on the edge of the table with an incoming call.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Aric.\u201d There was a note of bitterness in Carys\u2019s voice as she spoke her brother\u2019s name. Her fingers hovered over the device for less than a second before she drew her hand back onto her lap with a shallow sigh. The comm unit buzzed again, but Carys remained still, her mouth pressed into a flat line.</p><p>Jordana studied her across the small table. \u201cYou can\u2019t shut him out forever, Car.\u201d The Chase siblings hadn\u2019t spoken since their heated confrontation over Rune the other night, and Jordana knew it was killing Carys to have a wall standing between her and her twin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The device vibrated again, and with reluctance written all over her face, Carys finally picked it up. Before she even had the chance to utter a word of greeting, Aric\u2019s deep voice came over the receiver. \u201cCarys, where the hell are you right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello to you too, brother dear.\u201d</p><p>His response was clipped and dark. \u201cAre you at La Notte?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince when do I have to answer to you, Aric?\u201d Amber light sparked in the Breed female\u2019s blue eyes. \u201cWhere I am is no business of yours. I thought I made that clear to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Carys! I\u2019m not playing a fucking game here,\u201d he snarled, and suddenly it was obvious that Aric\u2019s demanding tone wasn\u2019t about anger but something more visceral. Something more urgent than that. He was calling out of fear and worry for his sibling. \u201cCarys, tell me you\u2019re nowhere near that goddamn place right now.\u201d</p><p>Carys\u2019s voice dropped to a near whisper. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Jordana could no longer hear Aric on the other end, but judging from his sister\u2019s stricken expression, the news wasn\u2019t good. Carys inhaled a sharp breath, her fingers coming up to her mouth for an instant before relief flooded back into her features. She listened for a moment, her face grim, then she quietly ended the call.</p><p>She glanced across the table at Jordana. \u201cThere\u2019s been a killing at La Notte.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Jordana murmured. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Carys shook her head. \u201cNot Rune, thank God. Aric said it wasn\u2019t any of the fighters, but he didn\u2019t have any more information than that. Some of the warriors are heading there now to investigate. Aric told me to stay away from the club tonight.\u201d</p><p>And yet Carys was already pulling out cash enough for the bill and a generous tip from her pocketbook. \u201cI have to see Rune,\u201d she explained as she got up. \u201cI just need to see for myself that he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>The depth of Carys\u2019s love for the fighter was evident in her eyes. So was her fear. The strong Breed female trembled where she stood, visibly shaken by the news of a death at the place where her lover risked his life every night in the cages.</p><p>And while Jordana had no wish to be anywhere near the Order if it meant she might run into Nathan, she wasn\u2019t about to let her friend go there alone.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jordana said. \u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p> <p>Carys managed a faint nod and followed Jordana out to her car.</p><p>They made the short trek across town, arriving at La Notte\u2019s block in mere minutes. The club was closed, the arched wooden doors of the old church building barred.</p><p>A pair of immense bouncers was parked at the top of the steps leading up to the place, standing shoulder to shoulder in the dark beneath the thin lamplight at the front entrance. As the club\u2019s usual stream of patrons arrived to party upstairs or do other, less savory things in the lower level, the two bouncers turned them away on arrival.</p><p>\u201cDrive past and turn down the side alley,\u201d Carys instructed Jordana as she slowed outside the club.</p><p>They rounded the corner and found the alleyway access blocked by one of the Order\u2019s huge, unmarked black patrol vehicles. Carys hopped out of the car the instant Jordana brought it to a full stop. Jordana followed her, only to be halted along with Carys by one of Nathan\u2019s team.</p><p>\u201cOut of my way, Jax,\u201d Carys said as the pantherlike Asian vampire moved out of the shadows to intercept the women.</p><p>\u201cCaptain said no civilians, Carys. We\u2019ve got a crime scene back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Aric called me. I just want to see Rune.\u201d</p> <p>Jax gave a shake of his dark head. \u201cHe\u2019s around back with some of the other club staff, but you ladies are gonna have to stay out here for now. Trust me, you don\u2019t wanna see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back there.\u201d Carys shoved past the warrior, breaking into a bolt before he was able to react.</p><p>Jordana followed her, jogging to keep up as her friend rushed around to the rear of the building. Rune may not have been injured here tonight, but it was obvious there was no one, not Carys\u2019s brother or any of the Order itself, who could keep the female away from the fighter she loved.</p><p>\u201cRune!\u201d Carys called to the dark-haired Breed male as she and Jordana rounded the back of the club. Standing among a few of the other fighters and La Notte staff gathered in the gloom behind the old brick church building, Rune glanced up at Carys\u2019s shout.</p><p>His hard face was grave, his eyes shadowed and grim as he broke away from his colleagues to meet her as she and Jordana approached. Carys launched herself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cRune, I was so worried! Aric called and told me someone died at the club. Even though he said it wasn\u2019t you, I had to see for myself. I had to be sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d the brutal fighter soothed, stroking his broad palm over the back of Carys\u2019s head as she clung to him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>While the couple embraced, sharing private words of comfort and affection, Jordana drifted away from them. Although she\u2019d never been to a crime scene before, and didn\u2019t want to be at one now, she found herself drawn toward the dark stretch of pavement where the apparent victim lay, surrounded by the team of warriors from the Order.</p><p>Her heels ticked hollowly on the asphalt, an odd sense of dread snaking around her with every careful step. Death hung in the air, cold and cloying. It lifted goose bumps on her arms, put a chill knot behind her sternum.</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t want to look\u2014didn\u2019t want to know what kind of violent end someone had met with a short while ago\u2014Jordana couldn\u2019t keep her gaze from peering between the warriors at the slain individual on the ground.</p><p>She caught a glimpse of baggy, worn denim on the skewed legs of the victim. The brown loafers on the man\u2019s feet were scuffed and aged ... familiar.</p><p>Oh, no. It couldn\u2019t be ...</p><p>She was holding her breath. She knew that even before the ache in her starving lungs forced her to suck in air.</p><p>Even before she saw all the blood on the asphalt, and the object lying next to the body. An object that looked unmistakably like the dead man\u2019s\u2014</p><p>Before her horrified mind could confirm what her eyes were seeing, a deep voice was at her ear. \u201cHoly hell.\u201d A pair of strong arms swept her away from the scene, a firm hand holding her head against a rock-solid chest covered in black combat fatigues. \u201cJesus Christ, Jordana. What the fuck are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s words were rough and dark, but his hands were warm and gentle on her as he held her close, keeping her face averted from the carnage. She didn\u2019t want to acknowledge how welcome his touch was in that moment. She meant nothing to him, so feeling his comfort now only added a deeper sting to the shock she was feeling.</p><p>She pulled out of his hold on a ragged cry. \u201cIt\u2019s him,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI know him.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s black brows crashed together over his stormy eyes. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Jordana gestured in the general direction of the victim, too stricken to look again. \u201cThat man. I was just talking to him a couple of hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s scowl deepened. \u201cYou talked to him?\u201d His dark voice went from concerned to demanding, almost bordering on suspicious. \u201cYou saw him today? Where, Jordana? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordana,\u201d Carys said, walking over now with Rune. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, honey? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him. The man I met in the exhibit this afternoon. He was alive earlier today and now he\u2019s\u2014\u201d Jordana\u2019s stomach lurched, choking off her words. Her chest ached with a sense of loss she could hardly reconcile for a stranger she\u2019d known only a few minutes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this could happen. Why would anyone want to kill Mr. Cassian?\u201d</p><p>A swift, uncertain look passed between Carys and the two Breed males. Even in her distress, Jordana noticed the change in the air.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cassian?\u201d Carys asked gently. \u201cJordana, that man over there is Cassian Gray.\u201d</p><p>When Jordana didn\u2019t react, Nathan added, \u201cLa Notte\u2019s owner. Until tonight, no one would admit to having seen the bastard or to knowing where he might be.\u201d He slanted a dark look at Rune. \u201cI guess the Order wasn\u2019t alone in trying to track Cass down.\u201d</p><p>The fighter held the warrior\u2019s stare. \u201cLike everyone told you, Cass dropped off-grid for a few days without warning. It wasn\u2019t that unusual for him.\u201d</p><p>Nathan grunted and turned his attention to Jordana. \u201cWhy was Cass at the museum today\u2014did he tell you that? What exactly did he say to you? What did he want?\u201d</p><p>Jordana shook her head, confused. She hadn\u2019t known the club\u2019s proprietor by name, had only glimpsed him once or twice from a distance on those rare occasions when she\u2019d gone with Carys to watch Rune fight.</p><p>What she vaguely recalled was a man with a shock of stiff, white-blond hair and black leather clothing bristling with metal studs and buckles. Not the drab-dressed everyman she\u2019d met today.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be some mistake. I don\u2019t know the man who runs this club. He\u2019s not who I saw in the exhibit. He doesn\u2019t even look like him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cass,\u201d Nathan insisted. \u201cHe\u2019d altered his appearance and stayed out of the public eye, no doubt because he knew the Order was after him. Maybe he did it because someone else was after him too. The one who chased him down and took his head tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jordana winced at the reminder. \u201cThe man at the museum today wouldn\u2019t have those kind of enemies. He talked to me about sculptors he admired, about art and some of the pieces we have in the collection. He seemed like a decent, nice man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a criminal,\u201d Nathan cut in. \u201cMore than likely, far worse than a criminal. If I\u2019d seen him anywhere near you, it would have been my blade biting into his neck.\u201d</p><p>She stared up into his sternly handsome face, into stormy blue-green eyes that kindled with the faintest embers of amber light. She didn\u2019t know what skewed reality she had to be living in that would make the kind of possessive, violent remark he\u2019d just made seem like a pledge of affection. Certainly not in her reality\u2014the one she\u2019d chosen to retreat back into after she\u2019d let Nathan nearly seduce her in her building\u2019s elevator.</p><p>He cared for her about as much as he might care for any of his bed partners here at La Notte\u2019s sex dens. Possibly less.</p><p>Jordana forced herself to break his arresting eye contact. \u201cIf I\u2019m supposed to be flattered that you would use me as an excuse to murder an innocent civilian, you\u2019re sadly mistaken.\u201d</p><p>His thundercloud eyes narrowed on her. \u201cHe was no innocent, Jordana. Trust me on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you?\u201d She scoffed. \u201cI don\u2019t even know you.\u201d</p><p>She turned and started walking away, needing space to breathe, to process everything that had happened today. She felt sickened by the death of the man she\u2019d genuinely enjoyed meeting\u2014whoever he truly was. And she couldn\u2019t deny that seeing Nathan again, even under these awful circumstances, had affected her more deeply than she cared to admit.</p><p>In spite of how it hurt her to see him at La Notte with another woman so soon after he\u2019d left her, Jordana couldn\u2019t keep her pulse from beating a little harder around him. She couldn\u2019t keep her foolish heart from wishing things had gone differently last night, that they could start over again, beginning with that reckless first kiss.</p><p>She hurried her pace, hoping she could round the corner and make it to her vehicle before the weight of everything she was feeling overwhelmed her.</p><p>While Carys and Rune stayed back, she heard Nathan\u2019s long strides coming up fast on her heels. \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean\u2014you don\u2019t even know me?\u201d His already deep voice dropped to a lower, arrestingly intimate tone. \u201cSeems to me we got pretty familiar last night.\u201d</p><p>She stopped abruptly and wheeled around on him, struggling to keep her voice controlled enough so that only he would hear. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t remind me about last night.\u201d</p><p>He halted where he stood, his square-cut jaw rising a notch. \u201cYou\u2019re upset with me. Because of what happened between us in the elevator, or the fact that Bentley-Squire interrupted us and we didn\u2019t get the chance to finish what we started?\u201d</p><p>Jordana exhaled a sharp, outraged laugh. \u201cI wish last night had never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d he said quietly, his face hard and unapologetic.</p><p>So he regretted it too? God help her, but she didn\u2019t want to feel wounded by that admission. She wanted to feel only anger that he could bring her to the crest of something so incredible\u2014something she\u2019d shared with no other man before him\u2014then turn around and slake his need on one of the trained professionals at the club.</p><p>Jordana spotted the leather-clad brunette sex worker near the back door of the building, one of several La Notte employees who\u2019d since come out to gawk at the crime scene. She couldn\u2019t help picturing Nathan\u2019s hands on the female.</p><p>Equally painful to imagine was the thought of what the brunette might have done for him to earn the fistful of money Jordana had seen the woman tuck away after Nathan left one of the club\u2019s private BDSM dens.</p><p>\u201cI never should\u2019ve kissed you,\u201d Jordana murmured. How much simpler would her life be if she\u2019d just stayed on the safe, secure little path that had been laid out for her?</p><p>How much happier would she be if she\u2019d never let herself reach for something reckless, something as dangerously seductive as the Breed male standing before her now?</p><p>\u201cI never should\u2019ve let you touch me, Nathan. I wish I could take it all back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A low growl escaped his throat as he reached for her. She pulled back, avoiding the contact. \u201cNo, don\u2019t. Stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment, his eyes locked on her. \u201cTell me you really mean that, and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d She forced herself to hold steady, in spite of the widening ache in her breast. She had to do this. For her own sanity, she had to put him out of her mind and out of her life. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you again, Nathan. I wish I\u2019d never met you.\u201d</p> <p>He said nothing. Just stood before her in agonizing silence, his inscrutable gaze seeming to cut straight through her, as cold and unfeeling as a blade. His face was unmoving, impossible to decipher if he was relieved or insulted by her rejection.</p><p>The walls she\u2019d so naively thought she might pull down were in full force as she looked at him now, perhaps rising even taller than they had been before. Nathan wasn\u2019t someone who let others in easily; she\u2019d sensed that about him early on.</p><p>Now that she was pushing him away, he would shut her out completely. And she knew once he did, there would be no getting back inside.</p><p>One of his teammates\u2014Aric Chase\u2019s best friend, Rafe\u2014called to Nathan from back at the crime scene. \u201cCaptain, heads up. Squad from Joint Urban Security is en route from downtown. This place\u2019ll be crawling with JUSTIS officers in less than ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Nathan acknowledged the report with a vague lift of his hand. In flat, maddening silence, he stared at Jordana for what seemed an eternity.</p> <p>Then he simply turned away from her, walking back to his waiting crew of warriors and the grisly reality of his dark world.</p><p>14</p><p>NATHAN LEANED BACK AGAINST THE ORDER\u2019S PATROL VEHICLE next to Rafe, trying to pretend he wasn\u2019t brooding from his confrontation with Jordana as he idly watched a team of six officers from the Joint Urban Security Taskforce Initiative Squad process the crime scene outside La Notte.</p><p>Shit, he was worse than brooding. He was pissed off and bewildered.</p><p>She wished she\u2019d never met him? She had no idea. The best thing she could do for him was take her haughty indignation and all-too-tempting body and stay far the hell out of his way.</p><p>Out of his head.</p> <p>Out of his life.</p><p>And the fact that he was stewing over the female an hour after she\u2019d gone only jacked his frustration higher. He wasn\u2019t used to letting anything, or anyone, get under his skin. His Hunter training had conditioned him to ignore distractions, to dismiss anything that might sway him from his course. Any obstacle in his path was either shoved aside or trampled beneath him, left behind and instantly forgotten.</p><p>It was how he survived. It was how he came through the fire of his childhood, his mind and body equally honed, his heart as ruthless as a blade.</p><p>He was a master of control, and yet Jordana Gates had somehow begun to chip away at that impenetrable foundation. Like a small trickle of water through a mountain of stone, she\u2019d managed to find a breach and slip inside.</p><p>Try as he might to put her out of his thoughts, to close himself off to the desire he felt for her\u2014to deny his maddening need to possess her, now that he\u2019d had the first taste\u2014he couldn\u2019t get her out of his head.</p><p>The best thing she could have done for him was storm off in justifiable fury, determined that she never see him again.</p><p>And yet he brooded.</p><p>He stewed.</p> <p>Told himself to let her run back to her safe life with Elliott Bentley-Squire and consider it a bullet dodged.</p><p>He tried to pretend that every muscle in his body wasn\u2019t twitchy with the hunger to go after Jordana right now and take her down beneath him, show her pleasure like no other man ever would.</p><p>With more effort than he cared to admit, Nathan wrestled his focus back to the situation at hand. While most of the combined human/Breed JUSTIS unit stood around trying to look important as they made phone calls and manned crime scene blockades set up around the club, they\u2019d tasked one of their junior members with the unpleasant job of photographing the evidence. The twenty-something human, an obvious rookie, had already vomited twice since his team arrived an hour ago.</p><p>Rafe chuckled beside Nathan as the young officer butterfingered his camera and nearly dropped it into the blood pool surrounding Cass\u2019s headless body. \u201cTwenty bucks says the new guy doesn\u2019t make it back to his squad car before he passes out.\u201d</p><p>As Rafe spoke, Elijah strode over with Jax to join them. \u201cNow, that\u2019s just mean, picking on the human.\u201d Eli grinned. \u201cI got forty on the Breed detective over by the club door. He\u2019s been trying to hold his shit together, taking statements from the staff and fighters, but that vampire\u2019s gonna need an assist before the kid does. I give him about two minutes before he goes all fangy standing around this much spilled hemoglobin.\u201d</p><p>Jax grunted. \u201cHell, we don\u2019t get out of here soon, I\u2019m about to sprout fangs myself.\u201d</p><p>Although the blood was dead and no longer viable to any of their kind as sustenance, there was hardly a Breed in existence who could ignore the prolonged sensory torment of the lake of blood surrounding Cassian Gray\u2019s remains. Even Nathan felt the throb of his lengthening canines and the sharpening of his pupils as he stared at the headless body across the dark, wet pavement.</p><p>Then again, blood thirst was only part of his problem tonight.</p><p>The bigger instigator to his dangerous mood was more than likely tucked away safe and sound in another male\u2019s arms right about now. Nathan growled at the thought.</p><p>The unbridled sound of aggression drew his team\u2019s gazes, Rafe\u2019s more questioning than that of the others. \u201cYou okay, Captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nathan muttered. Refusing to acknowledge the reason for his lingering discontent, he jerked his chin in the direction of the crime scene. \u201cInstead of putting Cassian Gray\u2019s ass in an interrogation cell back at Headquarters, I\u2019m watching JUSTIS mop up our best potential source of intel on Reginald Crowe. Hell, Cass might have been our best source of intel on the Atlanteans themselves as well.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s nod was grim. \u201cTrue, but this slaying did answer one question. How many deaths by decapitation do we see on average?\u201d</p><p>Eli arched a brow. \u201cNot counting Crowe\u2019s little helicopter blade mishap on that rooftop in D.C. last week? Exactly none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone was making a statement here,\u201d Jax suggested.</p><p>Nathan had to agree. \u201cAs we suspected, Cass wasn\u2019t human. Whoever killed him obviously knew that too.\u201d</p><p>Rafe met his gaze in the dark. \u201cBut who would want Cass dead\u2014Opus Nostrum? Or someone Cass might\u2019ve crossed in his business dealings at La Notte? No doubt the man took a lot of secrets with him tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be whoever wanted him dead had a secret of their own to protect,\u201d Eli added.</p><p>Nathan stared at the carnage across the way, considering all of the disturbing possibilities where Cassian Gray\u2019s murder was concerned. \u201cSomeone knew what he was and how to kill him. This was an execution. But even so, that doesn\u2019t tell us why.\u201d</p><p>And there was another question still gnawing at Nathan.</p><p>What the hell was Cassian Gray doing at the art museum today? That the bastard had gone there within hours of his being killed was suspicious enough. But to have gone there and merely chatted with Jordana about art, when he was so concerned with being found out he\u2019d changed his appearance and been MIA from his club and staff for nearly a week?</p><p>What business did he have at the museum? It didn\u2019t make sense that he would spend precious time\u2014not to mention risk coming out of hiding\u2014to go there today.</p><p>Nor did it sit well that Jordana was evidently the last person to see Cass alive.</p><p>What did he want with her? Because Nathan was damned certain it wasn\u2019t coincidence that put the elusive club owner at Jordana\u2019s exhibit. He\u2019d had a reason to go there. She may not realize it, but Cassian Gray left something with her today. He did something, said something\u2014something Nathan was determined to find out.</p><p>And if he was looking for that answer, what was to say Cass\u2019s killer wasn\u2019t doing the same thing?</p><p>For all he knew, Jordana could be in the crosshairs already.</p><p>Holy fuck. If Cass had put Jordana in harm\u2019s way, intentionally or otherwise\u2014</p><p>A murderous flare of rage shot through Nathan at the thought, a deep protective instinct that he had no right to feel where the Darkhaven female was concerned. Still, the ferocity of his emotion stunned him.</p><p>But his fury was self-directed too.</p><p>He\u2019d let Jordana walk away from him tonight. Hell, he\u2019d all but shoved her away.</p><p>Bad enough he\u2019d let jealousy and stung pride rule his warrior\u2019s logic in neglecting to debrief a possible intel source. But in allowing Jordana to leave the crime scene, he\u2019d left her completely unprotected, should Cass\u2019s killer trace the Atlantean\u2019s steps back to his visit to the museum.</p><p>That logical part of him that had been missing earlier tonight tried now to remind him that Jordana likely wasn\u2019t without a Breed male to keep her safe from imminent harm. She had her de facto mate to protect her\u2014a choice she\u2019d willingly made last night.</p><p>As if Elliott Bentley-Squire were capable of looking after a woman like Jordana.</p><p>She needed a better male, a stronger male. The kind of male who would throw down his life for her in an instant.</p><p>The kind of male who would have leapt on Nathan last night and pounded him into a bloody pulp for the liberties he\u2019d taken with her in that elevator.</p><p>Nathan snarled low under his breath. Told himself the current of urgency coursing through him was more about protecting a potential Order asset than assigning himself as a personal bodyguard to the woman he craved so fiercely, so unwelcomely.</p><p>The woman who just a short while ago had insisted she wanted nothing more to do with him, and rightly so.</p><p>As the JUSTIS officers cleared the crime scene and packed up the body, Nathan ordered his team to report back to base. Then he pivoted away and began to stalk across the dark pavement.</p><p>Rafe jogged after him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordana,\u201d Nathan stated simply. \u201cShe was the last person to see Cass alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Rafe muttered. \u201cAre you sure? How do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me. Cass showed up at the museum this afternoon. She spoke with the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Rafe frowned. \u201cAbout what? Why the hell would he go there?\u201d</p><p>Nathan kept walking. \u201cThat\u2019s what I intend to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean we,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cAs in the Order. As in we call this in to Headquarters and let them decide how best to proceed with the female.\u201d When Nathan didn\u2019t respond, Rafe grabbed his shoulder. \u201cJordana Gates is a civilian and a potential intelligence lead now, Nathan. You know the protocol on something like this.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did.</p><p>He knew Order procedure and protocol inside and out. Hell, he\u2019d lived and breathed it for most of his life. But that didn\u2019t keep his feet from moving in the opposite direction of what he knew was the right and proper thing for a warrior to do.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Rafe murmured. \u201cYou really care about her.\u201d</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t have the patience to try to deny it. Not that his friend would believe him, even if he wanted to pretend it was true.</p><p>All that mattered in that moment was getting to Jordana, making sure she was safe.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Nathan. You know I have a duty to report this.\u201d</p><p>Nathan picked up his pace. He heard Rafe\u2019s curse behind him, low and incredulous, in the instant before Nathan vanished into the darkness.</p><p>The teakettle started to howl in the kitchen as Jordana sat on her sofa, sweeping fresh tears from her cheeks. The sweet ending of the romantic comedy she was watching shouldn\u2019t have inspired more than a smile or a satisfied sigh, yet as the credits rolled, she was about two seconds away from breaking down into a full sob.</p><p>Not that the movie was what had her so emotionally on edge. She\u2019d been shaken up since she arrived home tonight. The long bath she\u2019d taken when she first got there had helped calm her nerves, but she didn\u2019t think she would ever be able to purge the memory of what she\u2019d encountered outside La Notte.</p><p>She had cried inexplicably for Mr. Cassian\u2014for Cassian Gray, or whatever his true name was. She\u2019d never been so close to death before, and she hated that the kind man she\u2019d spoken with had met such a seemingly senseless, violent end.</p><p>No matter what he\u2019d apparently done for a living, the odd stranger Jordana had found inside the exhibit had appeared to be a decent, interesting person. What he could have possibly done to earn the death he\u2019d been dealt tonight, she couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><p>Sniffling as she got up from the sofa, Jordana padded barefoot to the kitchen to rescue the whining kettle. She had donned lavender silk pajamas after her long soak in the tub. Beneath a loosely tied matching robe, the light tank and shorts felt cool against her bare skin as she trekked through the empty apartment.</p><p>Carys and Rune had checked in on her a short while ago, practically insisting that she come out with them and not sit around the penthouse by herself. But alone time had been just what Jordana had wanted. Except now she felt a sudden, keen ache for the comfort of family. She longed for the reassurance of her father\u2019s protecting arms.</p><p>Martin Gates would welcome her back to his Darkhaven anytime; she knew that. She also knew that going home would only make her father try to persuade her to move back in permanently. And that was a conversation she didn\u2019t want to have with him again. Especially not tonight, when learning where she\u2019d been and what had happened would send him into a fit of worry.</p><p>Although the wealthy Breed male had brought her up selflessly as his daughter from the time she was an infant, providing her with anything she could possibly ever need in life, Martin Gates could not seem to fully adjust to the idea that Jordana had become an adult woman. She was nearly twenty-five years old, yet he still wanted to direct her life as if she were a child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, her birthday. Jordana poured a cup of tea and groaned, thinking about the trust that would become hers in less than a couple of weeks. A payoff her father held out to her as incentive to settle down and take a mate\u2014so long as that mate was the Breed male of his choosing.</p><p>As much as she loved seeing her father, if she went home tonight, she would never hear the end of how disappointed he was that she\u2019d rejected a fine male like Elliott. At times, his desperation seemed so great, Jordana half expected she might be physically forced into the bond with Elliott. But her father loved her too much to do something so unforgivable, no matter how deep and misguided his belief was that she needed to settle down.</p><p>Jordana had to start taking steps on her own path. Walking away from a relationship she didn\u2019t want and couldn\u2019t honor with her whole heart had been a good start to that goal.</p> <p>Halting her dangerous attraction to Nathan had also been a step in the right direction.</p><p>A good, sensible step.</p><p>Except telling Nathan tonight that she didn\u2019t want to see him ever again hadn\u2019t done anything to curb how she felt about him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t begin to deny that she was attracted to him. After the pleasure he gave her in the elevator, her traitorous body only wanted more.</p><p>But worse than her physical need for him was her interest in him emotionally. He intrigued her. He frustrated and infuriated her.</p> <p>He confused her, enflamed her, made her crave things she hardly dared think, let alone act on with anyone but him.</p><p>And he\u2019d hurt her more than anyone ever had too. A pain that shouldn\u2019t have surprised her so much. Shouldn\u2019t have wounded her so deeply.</p><p>She\u2019d felt more for Nathan in a period of a few days than she had for Elliott in all the years she\u2019d known him.</p><p>Everything about Nathan was intense, from the rugged perfection of his face and bleak, thundercloud eyes, to the seductive power that clung to him as menacingly as the darkness of his Hunter past.</p><p>And she must be a fool of the highest order to imagine she might have gotten close to him without getting burned.</p><p>Thankfully she\u2019d come to her senses before she\u2019d done something really stupid, like letting him into her bed.</p> <p>Or worse, letting him into her heart.</p><p>Too late for that.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d she muttered to herself, scolding the all-too-eager, all-too-knowing voice of her conscience.</p><p>And dammit, that merciless little voice was right. It was too late to pretend there was nothing between Nathan and her.</p><p>Too bad she was the only one feeling it.</p><p>Jordana took a sip of her tea, grimacing at the bitterness. Stirring in a large spoonful of sugar, she scowled into the swirling tendril of steam rising up from the cup. \u201cAnyway, he\u2019s gone now, so what does it matter?\u201d</p><p>Her cup of tea clutched in both hands as she sipped the sweet brew, Jordana stepped out of the kitchen, back into her living room.</p><p>And felt her grip go slack as she nearly collided with six and a half feet of black leather and dark, simmering male.</p> <p>Nathan caught the cup as it slid from her grasp, not so much as flinching when the hot tea sloshed over his strong fingers. Stormy eyes held her startled gaze beneath the slash of his raven\u2019s-wing brows.</p><p>Seeing him sent a surge of emotions flooding through Jordana, but the first one to leap to her tongue was outrage. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing here?\u201d</p><p>Damn him, he didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cProving a point,\u201d he replied, his deep growl doing all kinds of bad things to her heart rate. \u201cThis is how quickly you can go from thinking you\u2019re safe and secure, to pushing out your last breath.\u201d</p><p>Jordana hiked up her chin. \u201cI thought I told you I didn\u2019t want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>He might as well have shrugged one of those bulky shoulders for the lack of apology or excuse in his tone. How dare he think he could just ignore her wishes?</p><p>\u201cBreaking into my apartment hardly qualifies as staying away from me.\u201d</p><p>No acknowledgment, but as he set her steaming teacup down on the sofa table next to them, his dark gaze flicked past her briefly, toward the kitchen. \u201cIs someone here with you? Maybe I\u2019m here at an inopportune time ... again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She frowned, unsure what to make of that comment. Did he think Elliott was with her? \u201cNo one\u2019s here with me. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were talking to someone as I came in.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Talking to herself. Trying to assure herself that if she never saw Nathan again, it would be too soon. And now here he was, standing in front of her in the middle of her apartment, questioning her like a jealous lover and making her blood race like wildfire through her veins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here by myself. As if it\u2019s any concern of yours,\u201d she added, grasping feebly for anger when his dark gaze\u2014his very presence\u2014had her breath coming shallow and fast, her heart pounding frantically in her breast. She crossed her arms as if to contain her body\u2019s eager reaction to him. \u201cWhat do you want, Nathan?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth quirked slightly, more scowl than smile. \u201cI doubt you really want to know the answer to that question, Miss Gates.\u201d</p><p>Was he toying with her, getting some kind of twisted enjoyment out of her discomfiture the way he got other thrills from the women who serviced him at La Notte?</p><p>Jordana swallowed hard, half tempted to make him tell her so. But she couldn\u2019t let herself fall back into that trap. She was nothing to him; he\u2019d demonstrated that clearly enough last night.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave now, Nathan. I\u2019m not interested in playing your games, and I certainly don\u2019t appreciate you breaking into my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play games,\u201d he said, crisp and cool. \u201cNor did I break in. I leapt up to the balcony from the street. The slider was unlocked, which only helps to prove my point. You\u2019re not safe. I might just as easily have been whoever killed Cassian Gray tonight.\u201d</p><p>Shit. She wasn\u2019t actually in any kind of danger, was she? Dread knotted in her belly as she glanced to the slider across the room. The large glass door was locked now, the latch securely in place.</p><p>She looked back at Nathan, hating that she now had to add gratitude to the list of unwanted emotions his unannounced visit was stirring inside her.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you tormented me enough already?\u201d She paced away from him, suddenly needing some distance in order to keep from leaning into his warmth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come here like this and scare me nearly to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intent to scare you, Jordana.\u201d A pause behind her, then his voice, soft but demanding. \u201cWhat do you mean, I\u2019ve tormented you enough?\u201d</p><p>Forget it. No way was she about to explain that reckless slip of her tongue. If he didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d affected her since the moment their paths first crossed, then she would gladly take that knowledge to her grave.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go,\u201d she said, not looking back at him as she marched barefoot across the living room toward the vestibule where the penthouse\u2019s private elevator was located.</p><p>The elevator where less than twenty-four hours ago, Nathan had given her the most intense climax of her life.</p><p>God, she should not be thinking about that right now.</p><p>\u201cI told you tonight that you had to stay away from me, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>He was right behind her now, so close she could feel his big body throwing off heat and coiled male power. The thin silk of her robe and pajamas was no barrier at all. From head to toe, her skin felt too exposed, seared, every nerve ending tingling and alive with awareness.</p><p>Everything female within her was tuned on him implicitly.</p><p>\u201cI know what you told me, Jordana. I know it\u2019s a bad idea for me to be here.\u201d He swore under his breath. Firm hands came to rest on her shoulders and he slowly turned her around to face him. \u201cUnfortunately for both of us, when Cassian Gray decided to spend some of the last hours of his life with you, he put you in the middle of my investigation for the Order.\u201d</p><p>Jordana stiffened in his grasp but couldn\u2019t quite find the will to pull herself away from the contact. \u201cSo you\u2019re just here in an official capacity, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we both know better than that,\u201d he answered, deliberate and calm. So maddeningly arrogant. But he drew nearer then, and the heat of him, the leather and dark spice scent of him, nearly made her moan with pleasure.</p><p>His eyes smoldered, locked on hers as he closed the distance, leaving scant inches between their bodies. Amber light sparked in the murky blue-green depths of his gaze. His normally hard-to-read face was harsh with grim purpose, his angular cheekbones seeming more pronounced under the subtle blaze of his mesmerizing irises.</p><p>As she looked up at him, his pupils began to narrow, the tips of his fangs just visible behind the fullness of his lips. Along his neck, the intricate pattern of dermaglyphs that tracked over his smooth skin and into the ebony hairline at his nape began to churn and surge with rising hues of indigo and gold.</p><p>Nathan may have been born and raised a Hunter, but he was Breed as well, and not even his cold origins or discipline seemed enough to mask the desire Jordana saw in his transformation.</p><p>His hands still holding her, he moved in closer, crowding her with the delicious heat and scent of him. \u201cNothing about my being here right now is official in nature. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re currently my best potential source of intel on Cass\u2019s final hours. Why was he at the museum? What did he do there, how long did he stay? What did he say to you? These are all things the Order will need to know. I\u2019m going to need you to tell me everything, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already interrogated me once tonight,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything more to tell you, so you might as well leave.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. Eyes flashed with brighter flames. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to interrogate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to make sure you were okay.\u201d His expression tightened as his gaze swept over her, fierce yet gentle. He blew out a low curse. \u201cI needed to know that you were safe, and I trust no one else to make sure of that but me. Fuck, Jordana ... I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to see her get hurt?</p><p>As tender as his words were\u2014as deeply as she wanted to believe the concern in his voice\u2014Jordana stared up at him, unable to bite back her quiet scoff. \u201cI\u2019m not your responsibility, Nathan. It\u2019s not your job to look after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. But by Christ, I\u2019m going to protect you, no matter whose job you think it is to keep you safe. Whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like it. At least that\u2019s what she tried to tell herself as he held her in his strong hands, in his possessive amber-flecked gaze.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to like that flare of raw hunger she saw in his expression. Didn\u2019t want to ache with want to feel his mouth crush down on hers while he kept her captive in his grasp.</p><p>Her shallow breaths mingled with the hot gusts that rolled out of him, her heartbeat pounding furiously, frantically, while his thrummed as hard and steady as a drum.</p><p>He was saying all the right things, acting as though she mattered to him. Drinking her in just now as though she belonged to him.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t belong to him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t belong to him, not if she wanted to keep her heart intact. Their worlds were too different. She saw that last night.</p><p>And no matter how much she wanted to believe him now, to trust what he was telling her with his words and hands and eyes, Jordana clung to the tiny shred of sanity that warned her she was looking at the very thing that could hurt her more than any other potential threat of danger.</p><p>She dropped her head and let a sigh slip out of her, chagrined to hear it manifest as a pained moan. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to do this to me, Nathan. You can\u2019t come into my home uninvited and say things to me like that. You don\u2019t have the right to appoint yourself my protector. You\u2019re not my anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he answered, but instead of drawing back from her, he leaned closer.</p><p>To her combined agony and delight, he removed one hand from its loose grasp on her shoulder only to bring the backs of his fingers toward her face in a caress so light it robbed her of both breath and good sense.</p><p>His touch drifted lower, along the side of her neck, then down the length of her silk-covered arm. \u201cIt\u2019s all true, Jordana. I don\u2019t have any right when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>And yet her veins were throbbing as she stared at him, warmth rising up her throat and into her cheeks, igniting in her core. The heavy beat in her veins was nothing compared to the deep pulse centered between her thighs. Her sex ached with a longing that spread through her limbs, making her legs feel unsteady and boneless.</p><p>He leaned closer, his mouth very near to her ear. \u201cTell me how I tormented you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, all the response she could muster as his free hand moved around to the silk sash that loosely tied the front of her robe.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Jordana.\u201d A command, not a request, even though his deep voice was pure velvet. \u201cI tormented you. That\u2019s what you said. Now tell me what you meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The refusal rushed out of her, airless and desperate.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to explain how he\u2019d hurt her last night after giving her so much pleasure. It was too humiliating to admit how easily she\u2019d been wounded. Or that she was too inexperienced to participate in the kind of wicked pursuits he seemed to enjoy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be that sheltered, untried girl. Not with him.</p><p>And she supposed that made her an even bigger fool.</p><p>With one deft hand, he worked the knot of her robe\u2019s sash loose, then coiled the twin lengths of silk around his fist, forcing her to step toward him now, until there was no space left between them at all. Her breasts pressed against the hard muscles of his chest, and lower still, his thick thigh parted her legs to nestle firmly against the molten core of her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow have I tormented you, beautiful Jordana?\u201d When she tried to glance away, he caught her chin in his other hand and guided her gaze back up to him. \u201cYou won\u2019t say it?\u201d</p><p>When she gave him a wordless, weak shake of her head, his gaze flashed with amber fire and a dangerous smile curved his grim mouth. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to guess. Was it torment when I kissed you like this?\u201d He bent toward her and took her mouth, swallowing her breathless gasp in a kiss so deep and fevered, she nearly collapsed in a quivery puddle on the floor. His tongue invaded, pushing past her teeth in a profane rhythm that made her hips respond in time with his movements, answering some primal call she had no will to resist.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t torment. Not until he drew back, denying her any more than a heart-stopping taste of what she craved.</p> <p>\u201cWas it torment when I touched you?\u201d he asked, pulling her to his body by the hand wrapped tight in her sash, while his other hand slipped inside her robe and beneath the loose pajama tank to cup her bare breast in the heat of his palm.</p><p>He caressed her breast, tweaking the hard nipple with his thumb, pinching it with a pleasure-pain that made her sink her teeth into her lower lip as her body shuddered with excitement.</p><p>God, she could hardly take it, the dark need he stoked in her. She was already half mad with desire and mounting pleasure when he abandoned her breast to begin a descending trail along her ribs and abdomen.</p><p>He met with little resistance from the drawstring waistband of her silk shorts. His fingers delved between her thighs, into the slick juices of her sex.</p><p>\u201cWas the feel of my hands on you last night\u2014inside you\u2014a torment, sweet, wet Jordana?\u201d He stroked the swollen pearl of her clitoris, making her moan in pure abandon. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t enjoy what we shared last night. Tell me it was torment. Torment enough to send you running into the arms of another male, is that right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped, too lost in sensation to deny him now. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. You were the one ... you ran to someone else. Not me.\u201d</p><p>He reared back as abruptly as if she\u2019d slapped him. His sharp amber-drenched eyes narrowed on her, suspicious and questioning. \u201cI ran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to La Notte,\u201d she replied, still panting, her body still throbbing with need.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want the pleasure to end, but it was too late to call it back. Nathan was staring at her in a dark, dangerous silence, his jaw clenched.</p><p>He released her, let the silk ties of her robe fall away from his grasp. In the sudden quiet, Jordana felt a coldness sweep over her, replacing the heat she\u2019d been enjoying so thoroughly a moment ago.</p><p>\u201cI know you go to the BDSM dens at the club,\u201d she said lamely. \u201cI know what you do there.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t try to deny it, which was a relief in some small way. \u201cRune told you?\u201d</p><p>Jordana shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t him. It doesn\u2019t matter how I know. I only wish I\u2019d understood how interchangeable I was to you before I let you touch me last night.\u201d She blew out a jagged laugh. \u201cThen again, I knew that today and I didn\u2019t stop you just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Nathan demanded, his deep voice taking on a thunderous edge. \u201cWhat the hell makes you say I think you\u2019re interchangeable with anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you were with one of the club\u2019s sex workers after you left me with Elliott last night. I saw you, Nathan. That\u2019s what I meant by torment.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pivot from him, but he caught her, didn\u2019t give her the chance to get away. \u201cAre you saying you were there? When? Just what do you think you saw, Jordana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you with her\u2014the brunette,\u201d she blurted, glad she didn\u2019t know the woman\u2019s name for fear that she would sound even more jealous and injured. \u201cYou were in one of the private rooms with her. You paid her a lot of cash and the two of you walked out together.\u201d</p><p>He listened, more calmly than she might have expected. He didn\u2019t say anything, but as she spoke, the hardness began to ebb from his ruthless gaze. His square jaw was still rigid but no longer seemed on the verge of shattering. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Jordana. I did take one of La Notte\u2019s sex workers into the dens with me last night. As you saw, I compensated her for her service.\u201d</p><p>Jordana stared up at him. Had she really felt relief that he hadn\u2019t tried to spare her feelings by lying about what he\u2019d done? Hearing him admit it all so casually seemed to chip off tiny pieces of her heart with each detail he confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s best if you go now, Nathan. I hope you\u2019ll respect my wishes and not come back again.\u201d</p><p>He gave the slightest shake of his dark head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Jordana frowned. \u201cI want you out of my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His hand was still wrapped around her wrist. With one flex of his powerful arm, he drew her toward him. Their bodies contacted, his hard and unyielding, hers boneless and melting at the feel of so much hot male power pressed against her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want any such thing. You want me to tell you I didn\u2019t do things with the human female at the club that you want me to do to you. You want to hear that I didn\u2019t fuck her. That I wouldn\u2019t have used you last night the same way I\u2019ve used the workers at La Notte. As a meaningless, interchangeable tool for my release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of me, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d He exhaled a sharp, humorless laugh. His eyes glittered, sparking with fresh embers. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019d like nothing more than to be able to let you go. I\u2019d like to tell you that I\u2019m every bit the asshole you think I am. I\u2019m no prize, make no mistake there. I did leave here to finish what we started with someone else at the club. Touching you, feeling your tight, wet heat with my fingers made my cock so hard, all I could think about was burying it inside you. God help you, it\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about right now too.\u201d</p><p>His erection crushed into her abdomen, thick and alive with heat. It pulsed through the thin barrier of her clothing, each heavy throb making her own heartbeat pound deeper in response. Awareness made her stomach clench, turned the ache in her core into a molten yearning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Hunter, Jordana. I don\u2019t wait for invitations. I don\u2019t ask for permission. I pursue, I conquer. Then I move on and I don\u2019t look back. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been for me. That\u2019s how I live.\u201d Cold truth, made all the more cruel when he was stroking her cheek and neck, his thumb moving in maddening little swirls over her throbbing carotid. \u201cI\u2019m not a gentle man. Neither are my needs. You wouldn\u2019t like my methods for slaking them. So when I left here last night, it was because I wanted to fuck my need for you out of my head, out of my system. I had to, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered brokenly.</p><p>Despite the harshness in him, despite the fear she knew she should be feeling because of all that he said and all that he was, it was this last admission that was the hardest to accept.</p><p>It was all too easy to picture him doing just what he described. His mouth on another woman. His hands giving pleasure to someone else.</p><p>Someone else whose heart probably wasn\u2019t as foolish as hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more, Nathan. I can\u2019t do this with you anymore. I\u2019m not like those other females you prefer. Those other females you ... fuck.\u201d</p><p>The word felt foreign on her tongue, not something she\u2019d ever uttered in front of a man before. Certainly not to a man who\u2019d had his tongue down her throat and his fingers between her legs more than once in the past twenty-four hours.</p><p>A man she wanted inside her with a yearning that bordered on sheer, reckless lunacy.</p><p>Nathan growled then, low and deep and lethal.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not like them, Jordana.\u201d When she tried to look away, to hide her need from him, he brought her face back up, forcing her to meet his gaze. \u201cI wanted to prove that to myself last night. I wanted to convince myself that you meant nothing to me and that my craving for you could be satisfied by someone else. Anyone else. I wanted to ... but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jordana gaped at him, afraid to believe. Afraid to hope. \u201cBut I saw you with that woman. You said yourself you paid her for servicing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted evenly. \u201cShe offered me her vein and her body, for a price. But once I took the woman into the dens, I realized she didn\u2019t have anything I wanted. I paid her because the problem wasn\u2019t with her, it was with me.\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? The human female hadn\u2019t been with him at all\u2014not even to serve as his blood Host?</p><p>Jordana could hardly contain the surge of relief that flooded through her.</p><p>His seductive mouth curved in satisfaction and challenge. \u201cNow tell me you want me to leave.\u201d He put his face beside hers, the rough scrape of his cheek and jaw a delicious abrasion that sent a shiver up and down her spine. \u201cLast night, you had the excuse of Elliott Bentley-Squire to keep you from taking what you really wanted. He may have saved you from me then, but I don\u2019t see him here right now.\u201d</p><p>With his free hand, Nathan palmed her breast, then splayed his fingers up toward the base of her throat and coaxed her head back onto her shoulders so he could place a hot, deliriously erotic kiss to the pulse point that kicked into a frantic rhythm under his warm, wet tongue.</p><p>He growled against her skin, and for the briefest instant, Jordana felt the sharp tips of his fangs dragging over her vein. \u201cChrist,\u201d he hissed. \u201cEven if the son of a bitch walked in the door right now, I wouldn\u2019t take my hands off you, Jordana. I want him to know he\u2019ll never have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d she panted. \u201cAnd he won\u2019t be coming here anytime soon because I ended things with him.\u201d</p><p>Nathan stilled. Then his head lifted, his stormy eyes ablaze with crackling heat. \u201cYou ended it.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a small nod. \u201cLast night. Just before I went after you and found you at La Notte.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment, he didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t speak a single word.</p><p>When his lips parted, his fangs gleamed, the tips as sharp as daggers.</p><p>He muttered something dark and hungered.</p><p>Then, without warning or excuse, he scooped her up into his arms and headed toward the bedroom.</p><p>15</p><p>JORDANA WAS LIGHT IN HIS ARMS AS NATHAN BROUGHT HER TO the bedroom at the end of the hallway.</p><p>A delicate crystal chandelier hung from the center of the vaulted ceiling, casting soft light in the room. Beneath the elegant fixture sat Jordana\u2019s sumptuous king-size bed, which was heaped with fluffy pillows, frothy white coverlets, and fine, crisp sheets. The walls were painted in an equally snowy hue, the plush area rug just inside the door crushing easily under his black combat boot as he entered the room.</p><p>Everything about Jordana\u2019s private sanctuary was soft like her, pure like her.</p><p>And he, the invading darkness soon to defile both.</p><p>Crossing the threshold into her bedroom, Nathan recognized the moment now was do or die. Jordana could leap out of his arms and barricade herself inside. Or he could set her down on her feet and make his escape.</p><p>Run? Hell, yes. That was exactly what he was contemplating\u2014admittedly, not for the first time where this woman was concerned.</p><p>The thought perished swiftly, scorched into oblivion, when instead of fighting to get loose from his arms, Jordana turned her head and buried her face into the crook of his neck and shoulder.</p><p>Christ, the feel of her so close to him was arresting. It shot through him like a jagged flash of lightning, impossible to ignore.</p><p>And bewildering too. He didn\u2019t know what to do with the humid rush of her breath against his throat. The touch was too intimate. Too tender.</p><p>Too honest and trusting.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t too late to stop this. His intellect was quick to warn him of that, but his body had other ideas. With blood pounding furiously through his veins and to points lower, his cock grew even more demanding behind the confines of his patrol fatigues. His lust was vying for control of the situation now, and it had no intention of backing down.</p><p>Jordana nuzzled closer, innocently unaware of the depth of her impact on him. The scent of her swamped his nose, drugging him with the combined fragrance of the vanilla soap that she must have used in her bath and the more intoxicating perfume that was simply Jordana. She smelled warm and soft and innocent, yet heady with the scent of arousal.</p><p>How would her body taste against his tongue? And if he pierced the tender vein that fluttered so temptingly in the side of her neck, would her Breedmate\u2019s blood flow down his throat like sweet nectar or boldly exotic spice?</p><p>Saliva surged at the mere idea. His fangs were already filling his mouth, but now they ripped farther out of his gums, the long canines pulsing with an even darker need than the one that practically owned him tonight.</p><p>Nathan set Jordana down on her feet beside the bed, his entire being vibrating with a barely restrained hunger.</p><p>If she were any other woman, he\u2019d already have her naked and spread open wide to receive him\u2014facedown or tied down, his long-standing requirement of anyone he fucked.</p><p>No kissing him.</p><p>No touching him.</p><p>No watching him as he exorcised the weakness of his flesh-and-bone body.</p><p>He fed and fucked because he had to, but he did it on his terms. Always under his strict control, in order to retain the edge of the honed, unfeeling weapon he\u2019d been born and raised, mercilessly trained to be.</p><p>Jordana Gates had broken all of his rules.</p><p>If she were anyone else, he wouldn\u2019t be standing there with a raging hard-on, a need that bordered on savage, and no damned clue how to begin what he\u2019d started here tonight, let alone how to finish it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She must have finally sensed the threat in him as he stood before her near the bed. She retreated a couple of steps, only until the backs of her thighs hit the mattress and she dropped down onto its edge. She swallowed hard as she looked up at him, her alabaster face and wide blue eyes gilded in the amber glow of his transformed irises.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid,\u201d Nathan said, the statement rolling out of him like a growl.</p><p>She gave a small shake of her head, her long, loose platinum hair tumbling around her like a bridal veil. \u201cNot afraid,\u201d she murmured, her voice somehow more steady than his. \u201cYou don\u2019t frighten me, Nathan.\u201d</p> <p>He grunted, incapable of speech as heat spiked into his bloodstream. Jordana\u2019s lavender robe had fallen open, revealing the flimsy excuse for clothing underneath. Her spaghetti-strap tank did nothing to conceal the buoyant shape of her breasts, nor could it hide her nipples, which stood erect and far too tempting under the pale silk. Her loose-fitting shorts were nothing but a whisper of fabric that covered her hips and the tops of her thighs.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s legs were naked and seemed to go on forever. Nathan followed the line of them with his gaze, drinking in every flawless inch.</p><p>He could hear her breath racing now. He watched the rapid rise and fall of her chest and the frantic ticking of her heartbeat at the pulse point in the hollow above her sternum.</p><p>His own lungs were soughing hard, air rasping past his teeth and elongated fangs. \u201cI only know one way to do this, and that\u2019s me in control,\u201d he said, feeble apology or warning, he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cDo you trust me, Jordana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No hesitation. No waver in her voice or her beautiful, brave eyes.</p> <p>Nathan swore, low under his breath. He moved closer to the bed, trying to resist the urge to pounce on her. He took off his weapons belt and let the blades and other lethal tools of his profession fall to the floor beside him.</p><p>It was all he dared remove for now.</p><p>Jordana might truly trust him, but that was more than he was willing to say for himself. He needed to keep a steady hand on the reins; he owed that to her for her trust in him. His focus would be entirely on her.</p><p>Nathan moved between her legs, urging them to part wider, and wider still. He drew forward, until the heavy bulge of his erection was brushing against the damp center of her sex.</p><p>She gazed up at him, as fearless as a goddess, as pure as an angel. By contrast, standing in front of her now, he felt dirty and unfit. As profane as a demon come to pray in the center of a cathedral.</p><p>For the first time in his life, Nathan realized he felt afraid\u2014afraid that he would hurt her, disappoint her. That she would suddenly realize how unsuited he was for the gift of her body, of her passion.</p> <p>Most especially, for the gift of her trust.</p><p>He reached out to move a thick wave of blond hair from where it had fallen into her face. It sifted through his fingers, sleek and shiny as pale, liquid gold.</p><p>\u201cEverything about you is so soft,\u201d he murmured, winding the thick, gleaming lock around his hand. \u201cSoft but strong.\u201d</p><p>He released the errant tendril and hooked it behind her ear, exercising a care he never imagined he possessed. \u201cTonight, I need to see that you\u2019re okay at all times. I don\u2019t want you to hide your reactions from me, no matter how small. I need to know if I\u2019m pushing you too far. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI need you to say it out loud. I need you to be clear, Jordana. I don\u2019t want to guess at anything. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again, then surprised him with a smile. \u201cI understand, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he murmured, then he reached down to touch her breasts, rubbing his thumb over one lovely nipple, then the other. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be your first. Then again, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got honor enough to stand aside and let you give yourself to anyone else. Not now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want this,\u201d she whispered resolutely. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>She reached for him as she said it, her hands nearly taking hold of his face before he had the chance to elude them.</p><p>A cold panic seized him and he reared back, catching her in a firm grasp.</p><p>Her wrist tendons tightened. She gave a small flex of her hands, testing his hold.</p><p>He didn\u2019t relent, not so much as a fraction. Uncertainty flashed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLast night, in the elevator,\u201d he said, trying to keep the hard edge from his voice. \u201cI told you that when we did this, it would be on my terms.\u201d</p><p>He could see the question in her eyes now. Apprehension washed over her face, flattening her lips and making her already racing heartbeat drum even harder as he held her, unyielding.</p><p>\u201cMy terms, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed at once. Her hands lay in his grasp easily, her fine muscles loosening, surrendering to him.</p><p>He sucked in air, let it out on an approving growl.</p><p>Guiding her down onto the bed on her back, he pushed her arms up alongside her head. \u201cDon\u2019t move. I want to look at you.\u201d</p><p>He drew back slowly, and simply gazed upon her.</p><p>And Jordana didn\u2019t move. She lay there, spread out before him like an offering. Her bare inner thighs were open, warm against the outsides of his legs. Her heat was intense, permeating his combat fatigues and scorching the taut muscles of his thighs.</p><p>Need coiled even hotter in him, dangerously close to breaking.</p><p>God help him, he wasn\u2019t used to taking things slowly. He wasn\u2019t sure he could now either. She was so beautiful, so arousing.</p><p>Everything male in him was hammering hard with the need to take.</p><p>To possess.</p><p>To vanquish.</p><p>He bent over her and drew her robe off her shoulders, letting his palm rasp over the top of her little silk tank. The pebbled points of her nipples teased the underside of his hand as he caressed her breasts. He almost hated to leave them as he skated his touch lower, over the flat plane of her abdomen.</p><p>He could feel her strength in every flex and contraction of her stomach as she breathed, sighed, gasped under his fingers. He lifted the hem of her pajama top so he could touch her without the barrier of clothing and feed his craving for her nakedness.</p><p>He knew her skin would be as flawless as the rest of her, and it was\u2014as fair and smooth as cream. Her breasts, which felt so incredible under the silk, were perfection unclothed. Round and firm, tipped with rosy little areolas the same shade as her kiss-bruised lips.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s gums throbbed in time with his cock, all of his senses fevered with the need to feast on her. He lowered his face to her belly and licked a slow trail along her skin, up the center of her rib cage, before venturing off to the side to capture one of her nipples in his mouth.</p><p>He suckled, groaning with the sweetness of her, the purity of her\u2014something he\u2019d never known.</p><p>Greedily, he moved on to her other breast, his hand following the path his lips had just blazed. Jordana trembled under his touch, against his tongue. Her fluttering pulse rang in his ears and sent hot need surging into his already granite-hard cock.</p><p>As he played the tight bud of her nipple between his teeth, her breath caught. Her hips lifted off the mattress in wordless plea for contact.</p><p>Nathan let his hand drift down her body then and beneath the loose waistband of her silk shorts. She moaned as he cupped her sex. She was wet and scorching against his fingers, her juices like liquid velvet. Her petals bloomed even more as he stroked her. Her folds swelled, slickened with each stroke of his fingertips.</p><p>The feel of her softness was driving him quickly to the brink. His skin felt tight and overheated, his erection straining so heavy and hard within his clothing, he could barely think straight.</p><p>But as demanding as his desire for her was, some distant shred of sanity punched at him with the reminder that she was untried.</p><p>As tempting as he found her, she was not at all prepared for the depth of his hungers.</p><p>She writhed and moaned with need, but she wouldn\u2019t be truly ready to receive him until she was on the other side of that raw ache.</p><p>With a restraint nothing short of Herculean, Nathan drew back from her luscious body, slowly peeling off her pajama shorts as he went. Next, he removed her robe and tank, baring her completely for his fevered gaze.</p><p>A curse leaked out of him, as coarse and dry as gravel. \u201cAh, Christ ... you\u2019re so lovely, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>Lame praise, hardly worthy of her. But it was sincere. One look at him\u2014at his blazing irises, sharp fangs, and very obvious approval of his cock\u2014would be enough to tell her how the sight of her affected him.</p><p>He drank her in from head to toe, a long, unhurried appraisal. Her face was flushed and dewy, her eyelids drooping over the dusky, darkened blue of her eyes.</p><p>He could practically see the blood coursing through her veins. He could hear it, every heavy throb of her pulse, the rush of red cells flowing like a thousand rivers under the milky white perfection of her skin.</p><p>His vision sharpened even more, and he knew that by now his pupils must be all but nonexistent, winnowed down to the thinnest, catlike slits in the ember-bright furnaces of his irises. His glyphs pulsed across his body, churning and alive with the intensity of everything he was feeling and seeing. All the carnal things he wanted to do with this woman.</p><p>His woman, an eager voice promised him from the lowest depths of his consciousness.</p><p>He dragged his searing gaze down to the pale blond curls on her mound and the long legs he couldn\u2019t wait to feel wrapped around him as he rode her, buried to the hilt in her wet heat.</p><p>The scent of her arousal wreathed him as he moved in closer, unable to resist the temptation of her any longer.</p><p>He put his palms on the tender insides of her thighs, exposing her further to him. \u201cYour sex is so pretty, Jordana. So juicy and red and inviting.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her, groaning in approval at the way she flushed a deeper shade for him, her wetness coating his fingers like honey. She squirmed as he caressed her, a soft cry curling up from her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything so beautiful,\u201d he told her, his voice deepening, sounding too thick for the presence of his fangs and far less human than he cared to admit. \u201cYour petals are so swollen and ripe. And your clit ... I\u2019ve never craved anything more, Jordana. It\u2019s as dark and glossy as a cherry, just begging to be eaten.\u201d</p><p>He moved down and sank onto his knees between her legs. The instant his mouth touched her, she sucked in a sharp gasp, arching high off the bed. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she sighed. \u201cNathan ...\u201d</p><p>He breathed her in as he suckled her, murmuring against her flesh how delicious she was. He slid his tongue through her cleft, growling as her intoxicating nectar hit the back of his parched throat.</p><p>One taste wasn\u2019t nearly enough. He delved deeper, lapping at her tight opening before licking upward, toward the pert, cherry-dark knot nestled between her folds.</p><p>Jordana bucked now, squirming under his mouth. He stoked her even higher, lavishing her with his whole mouth as he teased her with his fingers.</p><p>Suckling her clitoris with ruthless demand, he eased one finger inside her. \u201cHoly hell,\u201d he muttered roughly, lost to the silken grip of her channel as he worked his digit in and out of her in a tempo he couldn\u2019t wait to find with his cock.</p><p>Jordana panted and gasped. Her sex clenched at him greedily as he drew her clit deeper into his mouth, sweeping his tongue over her in the same urgent rhythm of his fingers.</p><p>She moaned, pushing her hips against him as a tremor wracked her in a head-to-toe shudder. A pleasured scream started to boil out of her, but she stifled it, her head thrashing back and forth on the bed.</p><p>She tried to rise up, tried to reach for him again.</p><p>Nathan growled and put his hand on her belly to press her back down.</p><p>\u201cLet it go,\u201d he ordered her. And he kept his mouth fixed on her trembling flesh, merciless in his command of her body. \u201cLet me hear you, Jordana. Don\u2019t hide anything from me. That was our agreement.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered and writhed as he coaxed her toward a higher peak now.</p><p>And when she came, it was on a powerful roar, unbridled and raw. The sexiest sound he\u2019d ever heard. She climaxed immediately again, grinding against his face in unabashed pleasure, his name tearing out of her throat like a curse and a prayer.</p><p>16</p><p>HER EVERY NERVE ENDING WAS CHARGED AND THRUMMING WITH a current unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced. Her skin felt seared, her limbs trembling, boneless.</p><p>Deep inside, the very core of her being had gone molten, all of her thought and logic\u2014every last inhibition and fear\u2014obliterated by the shattering intensity of her release.</p><p>And Nathan\u2019s scorching gaze promised even more.</p><p>Breath racing short and shallow, Jordana lay back on the bed and watched, mesmerized, as he began to strip out of his combat boots and clothing in an economy of movement. Just the sight of his muscles bunching and flexing as he tore off his black patrol shirt and bared his arms and chest to her made more wet heat surge between her legs.</p><p>Dermaglyphs tracked all over his light olive-hued chest and shoulders, then lower, along the ridged planes of his abdomen and down below the waistband of his black fatigues. There could be no mistaking he was Gen One Breed. Jordana had seen precious few glyphs on other males, but nothing compared to the complicated pattern of interlocking swirls and elegant flourishes of Nathan\u2019s otherworldly skin markings.</p><p>Nothing so erotic as the way his glyphs followed the contours of his body as she yearned to do with her fingers ... and her tongue.</p><p>Her mouth went dry on the thought and she swallowed the urge, her full attention now caught on his hands as he unfastened his dark fatigues. The black fabric slumped loosely on his tight hips. And not so loosely on the massive bulge straining at the front.</p><p>She licked her parched lips, her lungs gone still as he let his pants drop and stepped out of them.</p><p>The glyphs that had her so fascinated with his chest and arms now dragged her gaze farther south, where their pattern continued into the dark thatch at his groin and onto the thick, jutting length of his penis. His muscular thighs were wrapped in glyphs too, and all of the swirling, arcing patterns that covered him were alive with deep shades of indigo, wine, and gold\u2014the Breed colors of fierce desire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordana stared at him, at the sculpture of his body and the masterwork of his dermaglyphs, helpless to keep her hungered little moan from escaping her throat.</p><p>In his warrior\u2019s garb and weapons, Nathan was forbidding and lethal. Awe-inspiring by the darkest of definitions.</p><p>Naked and fully aroused, he was all those things and more.</p> <p>Immense.</p><p>Terrifying.</p><p>Heart-stoppingly, dangerously beautiful.</p><p>And he was looking at her as if nothing else existed but the two of them in this moment. As if the sight of her nakedness affected him every bit as intensely.</p><p>He stepped closer to the bed now, skimming his warm palms along the insides of her thighs as he took up residence between them. She exhaled a tremulous sigh at his touch, at the heated, hard presence of his body positioned so intimately against hers.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, the word shaky, more breath than sound.</p><p>Nathan grunted, low and contemplative, his smoldering eyes locked on her face. \u201cPlease, what, Jordana? Tell me.\u201d Demand in his deep, coaxing voice, nothing close to request.</p><p>As he spoke, his hands caressed her, moving upward until he reached her damp curls and hypersensitive flesh. He teased her with long strokes and deft fingers, stoking her so easily back to a state of writhing need.</p><p>Jordana closed her eyes as pleasure swamped her, pulling her under on another dizzying tide. She let it take her, gave herself up to the bliss of his hands on her, his fingers inside her.</p><p>And when she didn\u2019t think she could hold on for another second, Nathan\u2019s touch slid away, leaving her gasping his name, her body vibrating and fevered with an ache she could hardly bear.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she murmured, lifting heavy lids to find Nathan poised above her on the bed now, braced on his fists with elbows locked straight on either side of her.</p> <p>His erection pulsed from its upright position against her cleft, the feel of him like warm steel sheathed in velvet. As if he knew how badly her body craved him, he flexed his hips, sliding his hard length through her wetness, cleaving her folds with his heavy shaft.</p><p>Jordana moaned at the torment, growing mad with want. Desire kindled and burned, stronger than ever, and with it seemed to form another awakening within her, this one more elusive but no less powerful.</p><p>Something more than physical need, deeper than simple craving.</p><p>Something queer and unfamiliar to her, an unfolding awareness, reaching out from the furthest corners of her consciousness for what seemed the first time.</p><p>And all of that heat, all of that power, all of that strange, rousing energy arced toward Nathan as surely as a divining rod trained on a font of clear, quenching water.</p><p>She felt it in her blood and bones, in her senses ... in her very soul.</p><p>\u201cNathan, please ...\u201d She lifted her shoulders up off the bed, her palms hot and itching to feel him. To touch his skin and trace the tantalizing lines of his extraordinary glyphs.</p><p>But not until after she felt him inside her, filling her with more than just his wicked fingers.</p> <p>\u201cMake this ache stop,\u201d she demanded, her voice husky and rough with desire. She reached for him, prepared to take hold and drag him down atop her if he didn\u2019t ease her yearning soon.</p><p>But Nathan moved faster than she could even dream to. For the second time tonight, he dodged her touch and captured her hands in his strong grasp.</p><p>This time, however, he didn\u2019t seem content to merely hold her away from him.</p><p>Straddling her now, he rose up onto his knees above her, his fingers wrapped around her wrists like iron clamps. His eyes flared with amber sparks, something hotter than desire or even anger. Something darker, menacing in its intensity.</p><p>His face was so serious, his pupils nearly swallowed up by the light radiating from his Breed irises. His sensual mouth was unsmiling, merciless, his fangs gleaming and deadly sharp behind his parted lips.</p><p>And yet despite his ferocity and unforgiving hold, he carefully brought her hands toward him, pressing a tender kiss into the center of one tingling, hot palm, then the other.</p><p>His thumb stroked the underside of her left wrist where her Breedmate mark resided, a growl curling up from the back of his throat.</p><p>Jordana didn\u2019t notice he held the tie from her robe until he began to loop the lavender silk sash around both of her wrists, binding her hands together.</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>No excuse or explanation.</p><p>No request for permission.</p><p>She\u2019d come to accept his dominating nature in most everything he did, but now it took on new meaning. Nathan wanted total control when it came to sex.</p><p>He needed it, assumed it.</p><p>Demanded it.</p><p>Jordana could have broken out of her bonds if she tried. But she didn\u2019t wish to try. There was something wildly erotic about the satiny abrasion of the tie against her skin.</p><p>Even more arousing than that was the idea of surrendering herself so completely to Nathan.</p><p>A shiver raced through her, part in trepidation, part in breathless anticipation. She was a strong woman with a strong head. She\u2019d always chafed against even the lightest reins someone attempted to place on her. But with Nathan it was different. She was different. After tonight, she knew she would never be the same again.</p><p>If she was being honest with herself, she hadn\u2019t been the same since the moment she took that first impulsive kiss from him. Nor did she want to go back to the life she had before.</p><p>And for now, she was right where she wanted to be\u2014safe with the most dangerous man she would ever know.</p><p>Jordana let him ease her back down onto the mattress. Allowed him to push her arms up, so that her bound hands rested above her head as he moved off her.</p><p>She submitted to him willingly, unabashedly, when he parted her trembling thighs and gazed upon her, naked, open to him, for the longest moment of her life.</p><p>His eyes roamed unhurried over every bare inch of her, a slow lick of flame that left her quivering and overheated, restless for him to quench the burn. He tangled his hand in her loose hair, lifting the pale strands, watching it sift through his fingers and settle back down around her shoulders and naked breasts.</p><p>Eyes blazing, fangs glinting as sharp and white as diamonds, he lowered his face to the front of her throat, sending her pulse into a wild hammer.</p><p>His breath skated over her tender skin, then his lips closed over the vein that throbbed like a drumbeat pounding in her temples and in her ears.</p><p>His tongue soothed, but she could feel the hunger radiating off his immense body. His kiss was gentle, sensual, seducing her body into a boneless state of passion, of fearless, wanton trust.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped, giving him the submission his skilled mouth and hands demanded.</p><p>At her carotid now, a faint graze of his fangs\u2014whether in his own temptation or to demonstrate to her how totally she was at his mercy right now, Jordana couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Nor did she care.</p><p>He could have sunk his sharp canines into her in that moment, and she would have been helpless to stop him.</p><p>God save her, but there was a reckless part of her that would have welcomed Nathan\u2019s bite ... and the eternal blood bond that would come with it.</p><p>Jordana moaned his name, caught between pleasure and frustration over the fact that he\u2019d denied her the ability to touch him and kiss him too. She wanted to run her hands over him as he moved, feel the power of his muscles as his strong body covered her. She wanted to feel his hard shaft filling her, claiming her.</p><p>She wanted Nathan to do whatever he pleased with her, a wish that should have terrified her but only made her need wrench tighter.</p><p>And that peculiar, unfurling coil of energy deep within her seemed to agree.</p><p>It rushed up from the center of her like a live current, jagged and white and consuming.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said, astonished to hear the growled command push past her lips. \u201cNathan ... oh, God ... I can\u2019t bear this. Please, I beg you ... do it now.\u201d</p><p>His head came up sharply from her throat, his face hard and impassive. Maddeningly, unbreakably in control.</p><p>But his eyes ... they gave him away.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone in the violence of her desire, not even close.</p><p>Nathan snarled a curse, amber light flaring hotly in his transformed irises. He moved between her legs, his erection standing thick and upright, terrifyingly large.</p><p>Doubt flickered through her mind, a sudden fear making her brace for certain pain. Her breath stopped, heart rate speeding now, as he shifted his hips and the blunt head of his cock slid through her wet cleft, coming to rest at the virgin opening of her body.</p><p>Nathan stilled above her. \u201cOpen your eyes, Jordana. Let me see you.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed at once, not even aware she had closed them. Nathan stared at her, eyes locked on hers as another subtle pivot of his hips seated him more fully at her entrance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so slick and hot,\u201d he murmured. He pushed slightly, testing her. Studying her. Patiently allowing her to prepare for his invasion. \u201cYour body is ready for me. I need to know you are too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, her stifled breath gusting out of her on a tremulous sigh as he moved against her, teasing her with the promise of what was still to come.</p><p>She bit her lip but kept her gaze trained on his as he\u2019d demanded. Another nudge of his hips coaxed her untried channel to accept more of him. A flood of liquid heat pooled in her core, all her fears drowning quickly in that rising tide.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s mouth curved in a knowing, wicked smile. His hips drew back slightly, then pushed forward in one sure thrust.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s body bowed as he entered her, filled her. There was pain, but it was as fleeting as it was sharp. There and gone in a few instants, obliterated by the incredible feel of their bodies pressed tight together, naked and joined as one.</p><p>\u201cAh, fuck.\u201d Nathan\u2019s voice was rough, guttural. And the raw sound of it only made Jordana\u2019s arousal spike higher. He moved inside her, his pelvis rocking smoothly, gently, even as his big body shook with hard tremors. He rasped a low curse beside her ear. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to feel this good. Dammit, you shouldn\u2019t feel so right.\u201d</p><p>He thrust deeper as he said it, impaling her as if in punishment, yet Jordana could only revel in the fullness and the tempo that sent pleasure into all of her senses.</p><p>It felt more than good. It felt more than right, Nathan deep inside her, their bodies answering each other\u2019s rhythms as if they were meant to be together.</p><p>As if they had always belonged like this.</p><p>Jordana spiraled toward orgasm, climbing higher and higher as Nathan drove into her welcoming sheath. She cried out as the first wave crashed over her. Gripped by the force of her oncoming release, she arced into each rock of his hips, tugging against the silken bonds that still held her hands above her head.</p><p>Nathan showed her no mercy, increasing his speed and depth until she was lost and adrift, every particle of her being turned electric with pure, powerful sensation. She screamed as an explosive climax overtook her, splintering her from the inside.</p><p>And then Nathan followed her, pushing deep, grinding his hips against hers at an urgent, violent pace. Lips peeled back off his enormous canines, he bucked into her, riding her hard.</p><p>Jordana loved the wildness of his passion. Nathan, the cold, cool warrior\u2014the ruthlessly in-control Gen One male\u2014scorching her with desire-drunk eyes and an expression caught somewhere between fury and rapture. That she had done this to him, turned him so savage with lust, was astonishing. Empowering.</p><p>The headiest aphrodisiac she could imagine.</p><p>She was already coming again when a fierce shudder gripped him. Nathan roared her name, his voice unearthly, untamed. One hand clamped on her hip, he buried himself to the hilt and yet another coarse shout ripped from between his teeth and fangs as a jet of fluid heat shot inside her.</p><p>Jordana lay there, floating on a strange new plane, her senses both satiated and hyperaware. She heard every breath, felt every heartbeat\u2014her own and Nathan\u2019s both.</p><p>Her body felt loose and relaxed, newborn in many ways, as it recovered from the dull pain of her lost virginity and the even greater pleasure of what she and Nathan had just shared.</p><p>He was still inside her, still firm, stretching the walls of her sheath as his erection pulsed with renewed life. The feel of him growing bigger, hard all over again, made her own body react like tinder near an open flame.</p><p>She exhaled a deep sigh, moving beneath him in effort to create more delicious friction.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s muscles twitched, and inside her, he thickened in swift response. Eyes narrowed on her, he lifted his head and uttered a low groan.</p><p>\u201cToo soon for you,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cYour body needs time to mend, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>No, it didn\u2019t. What it needed was more of him.</p><p>But Nathan withdrew and rolled off to the side of her. He reached up and freed her hands from the soft tether above her head. He paused for a moment, the length of silk crushed in his tightly clenched fist.</p><p>When his gaze met hers again, she saw regret there. An apology he didn\u2019t speak but communicated with his light caress on the bare undersides of her arms, then in the tender stroke of his fingers along her flushed cheek and parted lips.</p><p>The torment in his expression pulled at her. He struggled with very private demons; she might have guessed that, in light of his background. Now she saw his internal struggle playing across his handsome, tortured face. A struggle he seemed accustomed to battling alone.</p><p>Her heart clenched at that thought. There was so much about this solitary, remote man that she didn\u2019t know. Things she wanted to understand.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if he would share any more of himself than what he gave her tonight. And despite the real fear of his rejection, Jordana couldn\u2019t let her questions go unasked.</p><p>\u201cNathan,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWill you tell me ... why?\u201d</p><p>Black brows furrowed\u2014an instantaneous reaction, and one that he swiftly schooled into the cool aloofness she\u2019d come to know and expect in him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How adept he was at erasing all traces of emotion from his face, even from his eyes. What had he endured that he could mask his feelings with such little effort?</p><p>He held her inquisitive stare, almost as if he challenged her to see through him. \u201cI told you what to expect before we began any of this.\u201d Mouth flat, grim, he poured the crushed length of silk out of his fist and onto her nude torso. \u201cThis is the way it is with me. You can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>Cold words. No doubt meant to freeze her into silence as he pivoted away from her on the bed. His defensive walls had gone up, blocking her out. That is, if he\u2019d ever been inclined to let her inside in the first place.</p> <p>His bare feet hit the floor and when he went to stand up, Jordana tossed the sash aside and drew up onto her knees behind him. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. The bondage ... it doesn\u2019t matter to me. Your need to be the one in control doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She took a fortifying breath and crept closer to him, very much aware that of the two of them, only he seemed frozen and silent now. Jordana edged up behind his broad back, with its masterpiece of dermaglyphs adorning the flawless canvas of his skin.</p><p>She lifted her hand, but drew it back, unwilling to dare that much.</p><p>Not when she could feel the caged power radiating off him. A menace so dark it nearly stole her voice.</p><p>\u201cNathan,\u201d she whispered carefully. \u201cWhy is it that you can\u2019t bear to be touched?\u201d</p> <p>The answering silence seemed to stretch on forever. He sat on the edge of the bed, unmoving. Jordana wasn\u2019t even sure he was breathing.</p><p>She\u2019d overstepped. She realized that now. They had shared something incredible tonight\u2014something intimate and real to her, at least\u2014and now she\u2019d ruined it by pushing him to open up a part of himself that wasn\u2019t hers to examine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t pry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you want to touch the bloodied edge of a blade?\u201d He spoke without turning to face her, his deep voice even, utterly devoid of emotion. \u201cOr willingly put your hand in the jaws of a fighting dog?\u201d</p><p>He slowly pivoted then, his stormcloud gaze flat and unblinking. \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of man you should want to get close to. I don\u2019t function the way you expect me to. A weapon doesn\u2019t require touch or comfort. And if you reach out to a creature bred and trained to kill, it\u2019s liable to be your last mistake.\u201d</p><p>Jordana swallowed, a keen ache opening up in the center of her chest for what Nathan must have endured as a young man\u2014as a mere child\u2014while he was part of the Hunter program.</p> <p>She\u2019d heard little more than rumors about the secret breeding labs that had been disrupted by the Order some twenty years ago. There were whispers of neglect and brutality, of terrible abuses suffered on the Gen One boys who\u2019d been created to serve as the private army of one diabolical Breed madman.</p><p>Boys like Nathan who, according to Carys, had been removed from his mother as an infant and spent the first thirteen years of his life under those unthinkable conditions.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s heart broke for that infant, for that tragic little boy.</p><p>And for the detached, battle-hardened man who sat before her now. The beautiful, deadly Breed male who had shown her such unexpected tenderness tonight and who had awakened her to a passion that still stirred, potent and alive, within her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a blade or an animal, Nathan. Whatever awful things you were forced to do in your past don\u2019t define who you are today.\u201d She inched closer, braved the smallest caress of his stern jaw. \u201cNathan, you are not what they tried to make you.\u201d</p><p>This time, he didn\u2019t remove her hand from where it rested lightly against him. But he stared at her with a calmness that chilled. \u201cYes, Jordana, I am. Don\u2019t try to imagine I can ever be like the other men you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d She gave a small shake of her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d proven that to herself in recent days, if not to Nathan. All her life, she\u2019d known the warmth of a loving home and the safe embrace of family and friends. She\u2019d had no shortage of admirers, no lack of even the smallest thing she\u2019d ever wanted or required.</p> <p>And yet she would give all of that up right now, trade her past with his, if it would remove the hauntedness from Nathan\u2019s stormy eyes.</p><p>Oh, she was in trouble here.</p><p>She was falling fast, one foot over the edge of that steep, storm-swept cliff she felt teetering beneath her whenever Nathan was near.</p><p>Tonight, she\u2019d given him her virginity. If she wasn\u2019t careful, he would own her heart as well.</p><p>Maybe he already did.</p><p>The realization washed over her, left her speechless as she stared into his impenetrable gaze.</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t permit the silence to linger. Nor her touch either.</p><p>He pulled away. \u201cIt\u2019s late. I should go.\u201d He started to get up, then scowled and uttered a low curse. \u201cFuck ... you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Jordana glanced down at the sheet beneath her. A faint pink stain wet the pristine white cotton where she\u2019d lain with Nathan. Embarrassment flooded her face with heat. \u201cOh ... no, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell it is.\u201d He grunted, his brow furrowing deeper. \u201cDammit, I didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Awkwardly, she shook her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. It was just a little blood, and I\u2019m not hurt. I\u2019ve actually never felt better in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Jordana.\u201d He snarled under his breath. \u201cYou deserved someone who would\u2019ve been more gentle with you. You still deserve that.\u201d Another curse boiled out of him, but with less venom now. He held out his hand to her. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Jordana slipped her fingers into his grasp, not that he had intended to wait for her agreement, of course. That dominating side of him was in full control of the situation\u2014and her\u2014before she could even utter a syllable.</p><p>He hauled her up from the bed. In the adjacent bathroom suite, the shower turned on with a sharp hiss, obeying his mental command.</p><p>Led by the hand, Jordana followed after him. As her bare feet padded softly on the hardwood a pace behind his long-legged strides, she tried not to gape at the lusciousness of his naked body. Six and a half feet of muscle and gorgeous, glyph-adorned skin, all of it moving in catlike fluidity as he prowled across the room with her in tow.</p><p>Her blood warmed in her veins, and that molten pool in the center of her began to simmer all over again.</p><p>God, she really had it bad for this man.</p><p>Nathan brought her into the steam-filled bathroom, his fingers yet clamped around hers. When he opened the tall glass door of the shower, she half expected him to toss her inside and order her to attend herself.</p><p>Instead, he led her inside, bringing her under the hot spray with him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t explain. Nor did Jordana need his words. Not when his hands were tender as he began to wash her, handling her with utmost care and gentle attention.</p><p>She needed nothing more than this.</p><p>This moment.</p><p>This man.</p><p>Jordana closed her eyes as Nathan\u2019s cleansing touch eventually turned sensual and his mouth found hers through the steam of their surroundings.</p><p>Heaven help her, she was on unsteady ground here.</p><p>She was stepping off that ledge tonight, falling too fast.</p><p>Falling too hard for a lethal, untouchable Breed male who\u2019d promised her nothing.</p><p>She knew this, the same way she understood that if reality waited for her at the bottom of this mad leap, it was certain to break her.</p><p>17</p><p>AS THE NIGHT CREPT PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO DAWN, NATHAN REALIZED he had never been further outside of his element.</p><p>When he\u2019d shown up at Jordana\u2019s apartment, he hadn\u2019t intended a full-scale seduction.</p><p>Nor had he intended to use their time in the shower together as a prelude to still another round of mind-blowing, incredible sex.</p><p>He sure as hell had not intended to find himself seated in a chair in her bedroom sometime afterward, watching over her as she slept curled up like a kitten in a nest of fluffy sheets and coverlets.</p><p>When he\u2019d crawled out of her bed to get dressed so he could head back to the command center, he told himself it was only reasonable for him to stay awhile to ensure she was safe for the night. Once she was comfortable and resting, he would go back where he belonged.</p><p>That was hours ago now.</p><p>Night was ending soon, and if his own free will wouldn\u2019t drag him away from her, the coming daybreak would.</p><p>Damn, how had he allowed himself to get so entangled with this woman?</p><p>When had she slipped through his defenses to become something more than a sexual itch he needed to scratch?</p><p>How did he imagine this whole thing would continue\u2014worse, how would it ultimately end\u2014when he had nothing to offer a woman like Jordana?</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been empty flattery when he told her she deserved something more, someone better, than him. It had been a warning. One of many he\u2019d issued that didn\u2019t seem to sway her. His dark look or growled threat had always been enough to cower man and Breed alike, but not her.</p><p>Jordana Gates was nowhere near as delicate or conservative as she looked. Nothing like the pampered, fawned-upon Darkhaven female he\u2019d often guessed her to be. Right now, he wished like hell she was.</p><p>Instead, he\u2019d found her to be strong, unshakable. There was a roaring warrior inside her, buried deep but clawing to get out. She was unlike any woman he\u2019d ever encountered, with her sharp, curious mind and sensitive artist\u2019s soul. It didn\u2019t help that she also had the face of an angel and the all-too-tempting body of a goddess.</p><p>He\u2019d never known a need as consuming as the one he felt for this woman. And if it had been confined to purely physical hunger, that would be bad enough.</p><p>No, what Jordana stirred in him was something deeper.</p><p>She intrigued him. She confronted him, challenged him.</p><p>She gentled him, when his entire existence had been built on violence and cold detachment.</p><p>Jordana was, in a word, extraordinary.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s veins thrummed in agreement, his blood still running hot for her.</p><p>He had no right to be the one she gave herself to for the first time. But looking at her sleep so trustingly under his watch, recalling the fevered way she\u2019d responded to him\u2014the open, accepting way she\u2019d submitted to his every desire and demand\u2014made something possessive and primal churn deep inside him.</p><p>For a moment, he let himself imagine what it might be like to be one of the golden, privileged males of her world, not the rough enforcer he was now. Not the assassin whose hands had been stained with death from the time he was a seven-year-old child.</p><p>He had never looked back in shame on where he\u2019d come from or on what his past had done to him. But as he considered Jordana and the way he still craved more of her, a cold hollow opened in his chest. Regret for the choices that had been taken from him.</p><p>Anger and, dammit, a sudden, fierce longing for the future that had been denied him even before he\u2019d been conceived in Dragos\u2019s lab.</p><p>Useless feelings.</p><p>Weakness he\u2019d been disciplined never to let manifest.</p><p>He\u2019d allowed Jordana more than most tonight. Intimacy he\u2019d never granted anyone. Insight into his bleak beginnings and how they shaped him.</p><p>He\u2019d let her past a threshold all her own tonight, but she hadn\u2019t seen everything.</p><p>He could never permit that.</p><p>There were things no one knew, not even the few of his closest friends and squad members in the Order. Not his tenderhearted Breedmate mother, Corinne, or her devoted warrior mate, a formidable Gen One Breed male who\u2019d been a product of the Hunter program decades before Nathan had been born into it.</p><p>Nathan had endured things, done things, that were better left inside him.</p><p>Locked away.</p><p>Memories best held to the dark, which he managed with the same iron control he employed in every other aspect of his life.</p><p>Just thinking on the days and nights\u2014the decade and more\u2014of his enslavement under Dragos\u2019s command and his torture at the hands of the Minion assigned as his keeper made Nathan\u2019s skin go taut.</p><p>He could still hear the crack of the lash, the jangle of chains ... the sharp, olfactory punch of his own spilled blood and viscera.</p><p>Even worse was the recollection of the suffering inflicted on others.</p><p>Because of him and, ultimately, by him.</p><p>Absently, his fingers grazed his throat in search of the ultraviolet collar that had been every Hunter\u2019s shackle from the time he was old enough to crawl. It wasn\u2019t there, of course. It had been gone since the night his mother and her mate tracked him down and rescued him at the age of thirteen.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>Twenty years away from his past, yet it still surprised him to reach up and find his neck bare.</p><p>And this was what he\u2019d brought into Jordana\u2019s bed, into her life.</p><p>If he were a better man, he\u2019d wake her with an apology and hope she could eventually forgive him for taking the gift of her innocence and her trust. No, if he were a better man, he\u2019d have never let her kiss him those few nights ago. A better man would have never let himself crave her the way he did.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>True to his born-and-bred nature, he\u2019d lived up to the warning he gave Jordana tonight: He pursued. He conquered. And if he were a better man, he\u2019d carry out the rest of his warning and walk out now, never looking back.</p><p>Nathan stood up on a low curse, bewildered that his discipline had failed him so badly when it came to Jordana.</p><p>The sight of her drew him toward the bed when he tried to command his feet to leave the room. The scent of her pulled a ragged moan out of him, the intoxicating combination of warm skin and soft, sensual woman proving almost too much for him to bear.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s bloodscent lingered faintly on the air as well. Nathan\u2019s Breed senses seized upon the elusive fragrance, which called to both the man in him and the beast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Every Breedmate\u2019s veins carried a unique scent, but Jordana\u2019s natural perfume was beyond unique. It was unearthly, addictive. He found it impossible to describe the mix of exotic spice and crisp, delicate citrus that tickled the back of his throat and made his gums tingle with the presence of his emerging fangs.</p><p>All he knew was that he wanted her.</p><p>Again.</p> <p>Still.</p><p>Nathan leaned over her in the dark, watching as the banked but burning embers of his transforming eyes illuminated her face. She must have sensed him in her sleep, just enough to coax a quiet little sigh from between her parted lips.</p><p>Nathan wanted to taste those lips again. He couldn\u2019t resist sweeping aside an errant tangle of her platinum hair that snaked across the smooth column of her throat. He wanted to press his mouth to the fluttering pulse point below her ear.</p><p>He wanted to do more ... much more.</p><p>He likely would have, if a faint noise outside the bedroom hadn\u2019t jolted him to full attention.</p> <p>Someone was entering the apartment.</p><p>In an instant, desire was doused with concern for Jordana\u2019s safety. Nathan moved with lightning speed, battle instincts switched on and lethal as he flashed out of the bedroom.</p><p>He rushed the opening elevator doors, total stealth and menace, prepared to kill.</p><p>Carys Chase stood in the center of the lift. She gaped, her eyes going wide.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Nathan hissed. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here at this hour?\u201d</p><p>Her brows hiked upward. \u201cI live here. Rune just dropped me off. What the fuck are you doing here at this hour, Nathan?\u201d</p> <p>Damned good question. He backed off on a snarl and raked a hand over his scalp. \u201cI came to check in on Jordana earlier tonight. I had questions about what she and Cassian Gray discussed before he was killed.\u201d</p><p>Questions he\u2019d all but neglected to ask, because he was too busy getting naked with her.</p><p>Carys\u2019s narrowed look said she suspected as much.</p><p>She stepped off the elevator to jab a finger in his chest, her voice a sharp whisper. \u201cYou asshole. I can\u2019t believe you would come back here like this. I can\u2019t believe she even let you in, after what you did to her the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what I\u2014\u201d Fuck. Of course. Carys had almost certainly been with Jordana at La Notte when he\u2019d come out of the private room with the human female.</p><p>Jordana had probably confided the evening\u2019s entire chain of events to her best friend, starting with his near seduction of her in the elevator. A seduction that would have been a certainty if running into Bentley-Squire hadn\u2019t put a damper on Nathan\u2019s plans.</p><p>And Jordana hadn\u2019t exactly let Nathan in tonight, but somehow he didn\u2019t think Carys needed to hear that. The Breed female was furious enough with him already. She glared, her blue eyes crackling with sparks of amber outrage.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked things out,\u201d he said, all the explanation he intended to give. What happened between Jordana and him tonight was their business. Not that Carys didn\u2019t have a pretty good idea anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. I don\u2019t want to see her get hurt. Not by anyone.\u201d He paused, trying to find the words to summarize all the things he felt where Jordana was concerned. \u201cShe\u2019s become ... important to me. I care about her.\u201d</p> <p>Carys stared at him for a long moment. \u201cMy God. I believe you actually mean that.\u201d</p><p>He stepped around the daywalker without further comment. \u201cIt\u2019ll be morning soon. I have to go. Look out for her today,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced she\u2019s safe so long as whoever killed Cass is out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think his death could be linked to Reginald Crowe and Opus Nostrum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d Nathan replied, unable to keep the gravity from his tone.</p><p>In his gut, he dreaded that the truth might prove to be something even worse. Until further word came in from the Order in D.C. about Crowe\u2019s apparent mistress and any useful intel she might provide, Nathan wasn\u2019t ruling out anything.</p><p>\u201cI will protect Jordana with my life, Carys. No one will do her harm so long as I\u2019m able to keep her safe. But during the daylight hours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Her gaze softened with understanding now. \u201cShe\u2019s important to me too, Nathan. I\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head in acknowledgment. \u201cTell her I\u2019ll be back tonight at sundown to look in on her again. We\u2019ll talk more about Cassian Gray then.\u201d</p><p>Carys shook her head. \u201cShe won\u2019t be home. The exhibit opens this evening,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cWe\u2019ll both be at the museum reception tonight, along with a couple hundred invited guests and visitors.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He didn\u2019t want Jordana out of his sight tonight, let alone out of reach entirely and surrounded by a museum packed to the gills with the general public.</p><p>\u201cYou could always come as her date,\u201d Carys suggested, a teasing glimmer in her eyes. \u201cMight do you some good to take a night off for once. You might even have fun.\u201d</p><p>Fun? He scoffed at the idea. Even if he did decide to attend the event, fun would be the last thing on his mind. He\u2019d be there for the sole purpose of ensuring Jordana\u2019s safety, making certain every person in the vicinity understood that if they intended harm toward her, they would have to come through him first.</p><p>Not that Jordana needed him showing up to disrupt everyone else\u2019s good time. He\u2019d already done that once this week with his team and Carys\u2019s brother. None of the Darkhaven and human elite of Jordana\u2019s social circle would appreciate having the Order present in the room\u2014no doubt that sentiment would be doubled for the soulless killer Nathan\u2019s past had branded him in the public\u2019s eye.</p><p>Not gonna happen.</p><p>Jordana didn\u2019t need him barging into every aspect of her life, least of all an event she\u2019d obviously poured her heart into for weeks or months. It was her moment to shine; he owed it to her to let her have it without him distracting from her accomplishment.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eye on her, Carys. Let me know if you have any cause for concern. Anything seems off, you call me at once. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a nod. \u201cYes, of course. But I still say you should come to the museum tonight and look after her yourself.\u201d</p><p>Nathan dismissed the idea with a curse as he strode for the waiting elevator car.</p><p>At the Order\u2019s global headquarters in Washington, D.C., Lucan Thorne leaned back in his chair in the war room, listening in displeased silence as Sterling Chase briefed him via video feed early that morning on the night\u2019s patrol report out of Boston.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t good news.</p><p>Then again, good news was something the Order had been coming up short on for too many months to count now. Years, in fact. Hell, more than a couple of decades, if he really wanted to do the math.</p><p>Lucan felt a dark rage building in him as he received the details of Cassian Gray\u2019s slaying. A crucial lead lost. Possibly their only viable lead on the race of immortals reputed to be plotting war against the Order and the rest of the planet.</p><p>And now that lead had been severed on the edge of a hidden enemy\u2019s blade. An enemy with unknown motives, and still at large.</p><p>Damn it all to bloody hell.</p><p>Before his fury had a chance to explode out of him in a roar that would bring his mate, Gabrielle, flying into the room in alarm, Lucan vaulted out of his seat.</p><p>He began an agitated pace behind the conference table where Gideon and two of the Order\u2019s district commanders had assembled with Lucan to review current missions and organize further operations. Tegan, chief of the New York City operation, and Hunter, who oversaw the Order\u2019s presence in New Orleans, had remained in D.C. with their mates since the Global Nations Council summit last week.</p><p>A peace summit that had nearly resulted in catastrophe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you that this was not what I wanted to hear right now,\u201d Lucan said, glancing at Chase\u2019s grim expression on the screen. \u201cWe had slim prospects to begin with\u2014just two potential sources of intel on this operation\u2014and now we\u2019re down one before we even get out of the gate. As for the other, the way things are going in Ireland with Mathias Rowan and his team, we may end up holding nothing but our dicks before this whole thing is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be worse,\u201d Gideon said without looking up from the array of 3D touch-screen monitors laid out before him and illuminated with countless servers\u2019 worth of data, which he swept through and resequenced like a deranged symphony composer. \u201cA few nights ago at the summit, if we hadn\u2019t stopped Reginald Crowe and Opus Nostrum\u2019s Morningstar bomb, today we\u2019d be engulfed in certain world war between the humans and the Breed.\u201d</p><p>Lucan grunted. \u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s off the table yet. If what Crowe promised\u2014that Opus Nostrum and their plans are nothing compared to what the Atlanteans mean to do\u2014then we stand on the brink of war every second of every day that we let Crowe\u2019s kind elude us.\u201d</p><p>On the video screen, Chase\u2019s face remained sober. Lucan knew the serious warrior long enough to realize that failure didn\u2019t sit well with him either. \u201cNothing to report out of Dublin yet, I take it?\u201d</p><p>Lucan shook his head. \u201cRowan\u2019s got a full squad on the ground in that city and outlying areas, searching for anything they can find on Crowe\u2019s purported mistress. Without a name or physical description, they\u2019re getting nowhere fast.\u201d Lucan blew out a low curse. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that Rowan\u2019s had his hands full with JUSTIS in London recently as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been dealing with a rash of unsolved murders in that city recently. Human and Breed victims, a few of them high profile. Joint Urban Security finally got so desperate to make the killings stop, they extended an olive branch to the Order in exchange for an unofficial assist on the investigation.\u201d</p><p>Tegan grunted. \u201c \u2018Unofficial assist\u2019 meaning handle it for them quietly and by any means necessary, so long as they don\u2019t have to get their hands dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the old Enforcement Agency all over again,\u201d Gideon said, his hands flying from one large display to another. \u201cExcept now it\u2019s got a shiny new, politically correct name. Same old shit, but someone else is doing the shoveling.\u201d</p><p>A onetime career Enforcement Agent himself, Chase arched a golden brow. \u201cAnd there\u2019s twice as much of it, now that the bureaucracy has been extended into both Breed and human law enforcement combined under the JUSTIS banner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir inefficacy is our advantage right now,\u201d Hunter said, his deep voice unnervingly level, his input logical as always. \u201cIf local law enforcement decides to wash their hands of Cass\u2019s slaying too, then the Order can investigate unimpeded by JUSTIS red tape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better hope for that,\u201d Lucan said. \u201cHell, we\u2019d better do more than hope. We need to run this thing down with every resource at our disposal. If Nathan and his team are right about this killing\u2014this immortal-style execution in the middle of a city street\u2014then we need answers, and we need them yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood and agreed,\u201d Chase replied. He hesitated for a moment, then pointedly cleared his throat. \u201cThere was a witness ... not on scene at the time of the killing, but someone who saw Cass\u2014spoke to him\u2014within hours of his murder.\u201d</p><p>Lucan frowned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that a witness had been identified in the team\u2019s reports.\u201d</p><p>Another pause, and Chase\u2019s mouth flattened. \u201cBecause she wasn\u2019t included in any of the field reports that Nathan or his team filed. Rafe came to me a short while ago and personally informed me about the female. She\u2019s a Breedmate from one of the Back Bay Darkhavens. Actually, she\u2019s Carys\u2019s best friend and roommate as well.\u201d</p><p>Hunter cocked his head, eyes narrowed on Chase. \u201cYou\u2019re saying Nathan overlooked a key detail of his investigation? He doesn\u2019t make mistakes. That\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the Boston commander said carefully. \u201cI\u2019m saying Nathan deliberately omitted a key detail of his investigation when he sent in his report this morning.\u201d</p><p>Lucan practically snarled his response. \u201cWhy the hell would he do something that stupid?\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s look said it all.</p><p>\u201cAh, Christ.\u201d Lucan ran a hand over his jaw and barked out a humorless laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s fucking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan didn\u2019t report back to base from patrol until just before sunrise,\u201d Chase explained. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he was out taking a long stroll.\u201d</p><p>Lucan shot a hard look at Hunter. \u201cYou and Corinne don\u2019t know anything about this?\u201d</p><p>The former assassin who\u2019d taken Nathan\u2019s mother as his mate some twenty years ago gave a shake of his head, looking every bit as displeased as Lucan was. \u201cNathan is our son, but he came to us as a man, even at his young age. He keeps his private life private. That wall has been in place for a very long time. That said, Nathan would never allow his physical urges to overrule his duty. Or his training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect this could be something more than just a physical urge,\u201d Chase interjected. \u201cHe\u2019s distracted. Maybe even a bit obsessed. He thinks he\u2019s keeping a lid on it, but the only one he\u2019s fooling is himself.\u201d Tegan chuckled darkly. \u201cHe\u2019s hardly the first of us to fit that description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d Chase agreed. \u201cBut if he doesn\u2019t watch his step, he\u2019s going to leave me no choice but to pull him off the mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase is right,\u201d Lucan said. \u201cThis shit is too critical. We need every team working as a unit\u2014no exceptions. If Nathan can\u2019t get on board with that, then we regroup and keep moving without him.\u201d Lucan glanced back at Chase on the video screen. \u201cWhat else do we know about this witness?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer name is Jordana Gates. Her father, Martin Gates, is one of Boston\u2019s most prominent residents. Gates is unmated. He adopted Jordana as an infant.\u201d</p><p>Lucan grunted. \u201cNot a typical arrangement, for a single Breed male to take in a Breedmate as his child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot typical, but not unheard of,\u201d Chase said. \u201cMy family has been friendly with Martin Gates since his arrival in Boston from Vancouver a few years before First Dawn. His reputation over those twenty-plus years has been spotless. He made his fortune in the stock market and investments in fine art. As for taking in an orphaned infant to raise on his own, I\u2019ve personally heard Gates say more than once that without blood heirs or family to look after, he felt it a shame to have acquired so much and have no one to share it with. The man is as charitable as he is wealthy. And Martin Gates is very, very wealthy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Jordana?\u201d Lucan asked.</p><p>\u201cA nice girl,\u201d Chase said. \u201cA bright, beautiful woman. She could probably have her pick of any man in the city, Breed or human. For some time, there were rumors that she was involved with a vampire named Elliott Bentley-Squire, Martin Gates\u2019s prominent, longtime attorney and friend. To hear Bentley-Squire talk, it was only a matter of time before they would be mated. Back Bay society rags have been speculating on the match for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like dragging a high-profile civilian into the middle of covert Order business,\u201d Lucan muttered under his breath. He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Nathan thinks he\u2019s doing with this female, or what his intentions might be where she\u2019s concerned. So long as she\u2019s a potential intelligence source, I don\u2019t give a damn about any of that. Our mission is all that matters. We fuck that up, people die, wars happen.\u201d</p><p>Lucan glanced to Hunter, who met his comment with a concurring nod. The former assassin\u2019s tone was steady, coolly logical. \u201cNathan pledged himself in duty to the Order. If he can\u2019t uphold that promise, he will expect nothing less than to have it taken from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that ought to go over well,\u201d Gideon remarked, furiously sifting through what looked to be thousands of digital files and sweeping them off the screen one after another. He slowed after a moment and raked his fingers through the short blond spikes of his hair.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d He glanced at Lucan and the other warriors over the rims of his ever-present pale blue glasses. \u201cMy packet sniffer just encountered a remote back door on one of La Notte\u2019s commerce account firewalls.\u201d</p><p>Lucan, along with Chase on video and the other warriors seated in the room, all stared at Gideon in questioning silence.</p><p>A grin spread over the vampire hacker\u2019s face. \u201cI found a way in. Once I machete through a few more layers of tangled security and subterfuge, I\u2019ll have all of Cassian Gray\u2019s secrets cracked open like a walnut.\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>JORDANA HAD BEEN AWAKE SINCE DAWN.</p><p>Her head was buzzing with a thousand thoughts and minutiae about the exhibit opening that evening, but it was the deep, blissful thrumming of her body that roused her from sleep hours ago.</p> <p>That enlivened vibration of her limbs and core\u2014of her very blood\u2014was also to blame for the secret, irrepressible smile she couldn\u2019t seem to wipe from her face no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>Making love with Nathan last night had been nothing short of spectacular.</p><p>Even now, when she closed her eyes, she could still feel his strong hands on her, his hot mouth on her. His hard body moving over her, inside her ...</p><p>Jordana groaned into her teacup as she took a sip of her favorite morning blend. She\u2019d showered a while ago and now sat in her robe on her bed, answering emails before she and Carys needed to head in to the museum for the day.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s up early.\u201d Carys stood in the open doorway of Jordana\u2019s bedroom, leaning against the jamb. Her caramel-brown hair was swept up into a ponytail, baggy gray sweats hanging loosely on her athletic figure. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jordana nodded, wondering if she looked any different to her friend today. God knew she felt different. Everything seemed different today. \u201cJust getting a jump on a few things since I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder,\u201d Carys replied. \u201cQuite a night you had.\u201d</p><p>The ghost of a smile played at the corners of her mouth, and Jordana realized instantly that her friend wasn\u2019t referring to the awful incident at La Notte. \u201cYou know Nathan was here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ran into him before sunrise here in the apartment. He was trying to slip out just as I was coming home.\u201d</p><p>Jordana hadn\u2019t really expected Nathan to be next to her when she woke up, but she couldn\u2019t deny the pang of disappointment she\u2019d felt when she opened her eyes earlier and found him gone.</p><p>And she had to admit, at least to herself, that she\u2019d been hoping to hear from him by now. All she needed was some small indication that last night meant something to him too.</p><p>\u201cHow did he seem to you?\u201d she asked, setting her tea on the nightstand to give Carys her full attention. She was hungry for every last detail her friend could provide. \u201cWhat did he tell you? Did he say anything about me?\u201d</p><p>Carys arched a slender brow. \u201cYou mean after he realized I wasn\u2019t someone he needed to attack for coming in to harm his woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say that\u2014those exact words?\u201d Jordana\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cHow did he say it? Did he specifically call me his woman?\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, Carys entered the room and took a seat on the edge of the bed. \u201cI see this is even worse than I first suspected.\u201d She leaned in and whispered, \u201cIf you want to write him a note, I\u2019ll ask Rune to pass it to him after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what he said!\u201d Jordana gave her friend\u2019s shoulder a light shove, giggling with her now. \u201cCome on, Car. I need details. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d Carys relented. \u201cAnd so is Nathan, I think. More serious than I\u2019ve ever known him to be.\u201d</p><p>Without saying any more, Carys got up from the bed and strode into Jordana\u2019s walk-in closet. \u201cDid you decide what you\u2019re wearing tonight?\u201d</p><p>Jordana hurried after her. \u201cI\u2019ve narrowed it down to the black tea-length or the pale rose silk cocktail dress.\u201d It was hard to think about clothing choices, let alone discuss them when her breath had suddenly caught in her lungs. \u201cWhat do you mean, Nathan is more serious than you\u2019ve ever known him? Serious ... about me?\u201d</p><p>Carys found the two dresses Jordana mentioned and was now pulling them out of the wardrobe. She held them up, one in each hand. \u201cI\u2019d have to see these on you before I could decide which one is best. Here. Try the black one first.\u201d</p><p>Jordana grabbed the dress her friend pushed toward her. \u201cDid Nathan say he was serious about me?\u201d</p><p>Carys waggled her hand dismissively. \u201cLet me see the dress, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>On a grumble, Jordana twisted her long blond hair into a makeshift knot on top of her head, then shucked her robe and bra and slipped into the fitted black dress. It was her original choice, a purchase she\u2019d been saving for months specifically for the exhibit opening. Classic, conservative, perfect.</p><p>Carys cocked her head to the side, then feigned a yawn. \u201cNext.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like this one at all?\u201d Jordana turned to one of the full-length mirrors in the massive walk-in. The portrait-collared, mid-calf-length dress was lovely.</p><p>It would have been an excellent choice for any social event ... particularly if Jordana was officiating at a funeral instead of an art exhibit.</p><p>She slanted her friend\u2019s reflection a conceding look, then crossed her arms over her breasts. \u201cTell me what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want anything to happen to you. He doesn\u2019t want to see you get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly a love song, but it made Jordana\u2019s heart pound heavy and hopeful in her breast. \u201cThat\u2019s it? He didn\u2019t say anything more than that?\u201d</p><p>Carys gestured for her to continue with the fashion show. Jordana frowned but quickly took off the black frock. When she reached for the equally uninspired rose silk dress, Carys snatched it away and pulled a different one from out of the sea of elegant attire. \u201cTry this instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jordana said, already beginning to shake her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not appropriate for tonight, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to know what else he said,\u201d Carys teased. \u201cSo put it on.\u201d</p><p>Given little choice, Jordana accepted the red cocktail dress from Carys\u2019s outstretched hand. The silken fabric was sleek and soft in her fingers, if somewhat shapeless on its hanger.</p><p>Jordana recalled the impulse buy with alarming clarity now. She\u2019d bought this dress the day after she\u2019d so recklessly\u2014insanely\u2014forced a kiss on Nathan in the other room of this very apartment.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the kind of dress she\u2019d ever have chosen for herself normally, and she had no idea why she hadn\u2019t immediately returned it.</p><p>She gathered the light bundle of fiery fabric over her head and let it settle down over her body. It felt like liquid skating along her skin, decadent, luxurious. Deliciously sinful.</p><p>\u201cTell me what else Nathan said,\u201d she ordered her friend as the red dress smoothed into place.</p><p>\u201cHe told me that you\u2019re important to him,\u201d Carys replied from behind her. \u201cHe said he cares about you.\u201d</p><p>Jordana pivoted around. Cool air caressed her spine where the swooping, low-cut back of the knee-length cocktail dress plunged daringly low. \u201cHe really said that? He said I\u2019m important. That he cares about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Carys looked her up and down, then a broad, slow smile broke across her face. \u201cDamn, Jordana. You just found your dress.\u201d</p><p>Dubious, she turned to face the long mirrors again.</p><p>She hardly recognized the woman staring back at her. The sleeveless red dress clung in all the right places and showed just enough leg, yet still managed to look tasteful and sophisticated. In front, its draped neckline only hinted at her curves and cleavage, while the real show was in the back.</p><p>\u201cMy father will choke on his tongue if I walk into the exhibit opening in this dress,\u201d Jordana mused. She shook her head and could hardly bite back her giggle when she pictured all of the stunned reactions she would stir. \u201cElliott will be completely scandalized\u2014possibly apoplectic.\u201d</p><p>Carys shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019ll be their problem. You look amazing.\u201d</p><p>Jordana studied her reflection, wondering if it was merely the powerful hue of the fabric that intensified the ice-blue color of her eyes and made her features seem somehow bolder, indomitable. Not the good girl held back by propriety and expectation but a fearless woman ready to take on the world.</p><p>Or maybe that fierce look came from the way thoughts of Nathan had her blood running hot and quick through her veins.</p><p>She felt different. Not simply because of her lost virginity and the incredible passion she experienced last night.</p><p>She was different.</p><p>Changed in a way she couldn\u2019t quite define. It was as if she were evolving into a new skin, into a new sense of herself, and doing it at an accelerating pace that should have frightened her.</p><p>Yet it didn\u2019t. She felt strong and alive. And all she knew was, regardless of where she was headed with Nathan, her life now could never go back to what it was before.</p><p>\u201cCarys,\u201d she murmured, \u201cdo you remember when I told you how Nathan makes me feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Carys stared at her with clear-eyed understanding. \u201cLike you\u2019re on the edge of a cliff and he\u2019s a storm about to sweep you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like that. Well, last night ... I did it. I stepped off.\u201d Jordana sighed. \u201cI stepped off with my eyes wide open and now I\u2019m falling. What if no one\u2019s there to catch me? What if what I\u2019m feeling for Nathan is sheer, heedless stupidity and I end up crashing and burning on the ground?\u201d</p><p>Carys smiled at her in the mirror. \u201cSweetheart, if Nathan sees you in this dress, the only one in danger of crashing and burning will be him.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s comm device vibrated just as he was about to drop his knuckles on Commander Chase\u2019s study door at the Boston compound. Paused there, he frowned and glanced at the incoming message. Probably Rafe or another member of his team, wondering why he wasn\u2019t down in the weapons room with them, putting the crew through their daily paces.</p><p>He stared at the number on the display.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t any of the warriors.</p><p>Jordana.</p><p>How the hell did she know his private call code?</p><p>Curious now, and more intrigued than he cared to admit, Nathan tapped the message open.</p><p>Hi. Carys gave me your number. Hope you don\u2019t mind.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Yes, he did mind, but that didn\u2019t keep him from scanning to the next short message, his veins going suddenly electric.</p><p>Can\u2019t stop thinking about last night. About us.</p><p>Neither could he, and the distraction was driving him out of his damned mind.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop thinking about you, inside me.</p><p>Holy fuck.</p><p>Now that hot current racing through him arced sharply south, rendering him instantly hard. He shifted his stance, for all the good that did.</p><p>He had a crystal-clear mental image of Jordana lying naked and open beneath him, and there was no way to relieve the pressure of his huge erection, which strained full and heavy in his fatigues.</p><p>Scowling furiously, he glanced to the next line.</p><p>I\u2019ll be thinking of you at the exhibit party tonight too. Join me, maybe?</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss the real invitation she was extending. Neither did his cock. Every blood vessel in his body lit up with eager agreement. As tempting as it was to pick up again where he and Jordana left off, Nathan growled and tried to push the idea out of his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d already let his hunger for her trump his good judgment. He may have jeopardized his team\u2019s entire mission by taking Jordana\u2019s virginity last night instead of bringing her in to take her statement as he would any other witness.</p><p>That was the reason he now stood outside Chase\u2019s office, fully prepared to take whatever punishment he was due.</p><p>He\u2019d placed his own selfish wants above his greater responsibility to his brethren last night. He couldn\u2019t regret a moment of the hours he\u2019d spent in Jordana\u2019s bed, but the fact he\u2019d done it in spite of the hard-won discipline he prided himself on\u2014worse, that he pursued Jordana at the expense of his duty to his teammates\u2014was a failure he intended to rectify by any means possible.</p> <p>He read Jordana\u2019s message again and groaned at his loss.</p><p>He would call her after his meeting with Chase and tell her not to expect him.</p><p>Dammit. He was going to have to try to explain to her that the next time she saw him, it would likely be on instructions to collect her and hold her at the command center as a witness until the Order felt she was of no further use in their investigation.</p><p>He could only hope she wouldn\u2019t despise him for not having that conversation with her before she surrendered to him so openly last night.</p><p>As he berated himself for that further failure, his comm vibrated with another incoming transmission.</p> <p>No message this time. Just an image.</p><p>Jordana, in a red dress.</p><p>A sexy, back-baring, curve-hugging, stupefyingly hot red dress.</p><p>And she had to know how incredible she looked in it. Posed from behind in front of a full-length mirror inside her dressing room, she looked over her shoulder at the camera with an expression that was confident, provocative, utterly sensual.</p><p>And meant just for him.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s fangs punched out of his gums and his already uncomfortable hard-on became unbearable. He stared at her photo in abject lust, his fingers clamped so tight around his comm unit, it was a wonder the device didn\u2019t shatter. All the air left his lungs on a ragged exhalation.</p> <p>\u201cHoly. Fucking. Hell.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, the door to Commander Chase\u2019s study opened.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Nathan jerked his head up, at the same time casually but quickly stowing his comm unit in the pocket of his fatigues. As an afterthought, he shoved his hands into both pockets too, hoping the added bulk would conceal the very obvious evidence of his arousal.</p><p>His fangs and amber-flecked irises were equally difficult to hide.</p><p>\u201cNathan.\u201d Sterling Chase\u2019s shrewd blue eyes hit him like twin-focused laser beams, missing nothing. The commander\u2019s deep voice was low, his mouth grave and unsmiling. \u201cI reviewed the reports from your team\u2019s patrol last night. I was just about to call you in here to discuss them.\u201d</p><p>Nathan gave a grim nod. \u201cI thought you might, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Chase turned and strode back to his desk inside the spacious office. \u201cClose the door and sit down.\u201d</p><p>Nathan did as instructed, taking a seat in one of a pair of leather chairs on the opposite side of Chase\u2019s desk. Even though he\u2019d arrived there of his own volition, he knew full well that this was a reprimand waiting to happen.</p> <p>More than likely, Chase had already spoken with Lucan and the two Order elders had discussed his failing ... and his fate.</p><p>Nathan waited in respectful silence for his commander to address him. And he was glad for the opportunity to wrestle his libido into submission\u2014no easy feat when that image of Jordana dressed in flame red silk was burned indelibly into his mind.</p><p>Chase put his elbows on the surface of his desk and studied Nathan for a long moment. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about what the hell you think you\u2019re doing with her\u2014and why she\u2019s messaging you on a secure comm port\u2014after we cover our other business this morning.\u201d</p><p>With that, Chase leaned back and pulled up Nathan\u2019s patrol report on the touch-screen monitor perched on the edge of his desk. \u201cAs I said, I reviewed the team\u2019s reports on Cassian Gray\u2019s slaying last night. Disappointing, to say the least. Not only did he manage to elude our sweeps and shakedowns these past several nights, but his death provides the public with a story they\u2019ll be talking about for years. A beheading in the middle of the goddamned city of Boston?\u201d Chase\u2019s eyes crackled with angry sparks. \u201cFortunately, JUSTIS is operating in typical head-up-the-ass fashion, so they\u2019ve officially declared it a random homicide, subject and motive undetermined. We know that kind of killing, not to mention the victim, was anything but random.\u201d</p><p>Nathan inclined his head in agreement. \u201cWhoever killed Cass knew what it would take to end him. They had to understand what he was.\u201d Chase\u2019s mouth pressed flat. \u201cOr they are the same as he was. Atlantean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my guess,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cThe question remains, why would someone\u2014particularly one of Cass\u2019s own kind\u2014want him dead?\u201d Chase grunted, his stare unwavering. \u201cI\u2019m informed there is a witness who saw Cassian Gray just hours before his death was discovered. A witness who did not seem to warrant a mention in any of the patrol reports. I wouldn\u2019t have heard about this at all if Rafe hadn\u2019t come to me with the information earlier this morning. Seems he wanted to shield a friend, so he omitted this crucial detail from his findings.\u201d</p><p>Nathan struggled to keep his face neutral, but inside he was kicking himself. Damn Rafe for trying to protect him. Nathan hadn\u2019t asked it of him; he would never have expected it.</p><p>\u201cFortunately for Rafe, his loyalty to the Order won out before the breach of trust was discovered on its own, or the consequences for him could be severe,\u201d Chase said. He glanced over at the patrol report still displayed on the monitor. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with Rafe later. Right now, I want to know why this same witness isn\u2019t noted on my patrol team captain\u2019s report\u2014which also wasn\u2019t filed until daybreak this morning. I want to know why one of my best men, a warrior who\u2019s served this unit faithfully, flawlessly, for more than a decade, suddenly decides to defy protocol.\u201d Chase slammed his fist on the desk. \u201cDammit, I want to know why you\u2019re practically forcing me to remove you from your command of the team.\u201d</p><p>Nathan remained calm, knowing he had earned every bit of Chase\u2019s fury. \u201cI can offer no excuse. I failed my team and you. I can only give my word that it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Chase studied him silently with a long, measuring look. Then he blew out a harsh sigh. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Nathan? Forgetting for the moment that Jordana Gates is currently a lead in an ongoing investigation for the Order, she\u2019s also a Breedmate, for crissake. How far do you intend to take things with her? You\u2019ve already slept with her. What\u2019s next? Am I going to find out you\u2019ve blood-bonded to this female?\u201d</p><p>Now Nathan\u2019s schooled calm faltered slightly. His lip curled, the barest hint of a snarl. \u201cAll due respect, sir, but that\u2019s none of your damned business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it isn\u2019t.\u201d Chase got up. He walked around the desk and sat on its edge, directly in front of Nathan. \u201cThis won\u2019t do. You know that. The stakes are too high. If we\u2019re soon to face another rising war\u2014this time against an entire other race of immortals\u2014then we can\u2019t afford distractions. And Jordana Gates is a very big distraction for you. There\u2019s too much at risk for you to allow an emotional entanglement to hamper your effectiveness.\u201d</p><p>Although Chase couldn\u2019t have known, the charge he leveled now was a direct hit to Nathan\u2019s soul. Like a tide of black water, memories from his past swelled up around him.</p><p>The shattering impact of thick chains striking his back. The threat of sunlight breaking in through the weathered slats of the old barn\u2019s roof where he and the other young Hunters were brought after lessons in obedience and duty had failed to teach them who\u2014and what\u2014they were meant to be.</p><p>You are a weapon.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Effective weapons do not feel.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Effective weapons do not bend. Not ever. Not for anyone.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Nathan said nothing, silently working through the vivid, unexpected recollection of his conditioning. He reached for the part of him that was the detached Hunter. The survivor who endured his merciless training and lived to find a better life for himself outside of that other, brutal, bleak existence.</p><p>But there was a part of him that would always recall the stench of spilled blood and urine and other offending body fluids ... and taste the salty tears of a terrified, brutalized little boy.</p><p>\u201cNothing will hamper my effectiveness,\u201d he murmured evenly.</p><p>Chase stared. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>A quick, sharp denial sat on the tip of his tongue, but he couldn\u2019t seem to spit it out.</p><p>Whatever it was that he felt for Jordana, it surpassed simple desire or affection. It consumed him. Made his heart feel squeezed in a tight fist yet soaring free at the same time.</p><p>He glanced down, gave a mute shake of his head. \u201cMaybe I do. Fuck, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better figure it out,\u201d Chase replied. \u201cBecause anything less than that is a waste of our time here. Especially when it could cost you your rank under my command. Possibly even your place in the Order as a whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Nathan assured him. \u201cNo matter what I have with Jordana, the Order is my family. My duty. I\u2019ve got this under control.\u201d</p><p>Chase grunted. \u201cThen prove it to me. Prove it to yourself, and bring her in, as you should\u2019ve done last night.\u201d</p><p>Nathan pictured her in her stunning red dress, surrounded by half of Boston as she proudly unveiled her exhibit.</p><p>Then he imagined walking in there, just as he\u2019d dreaded, not as the man she hoped to have at her side for that important moment but the warrior sent to ruin her night and likely earn her hatred.</p><p>He swore roundly under his breath. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. Not tonight. She\u2019s got this event at the museum. She\u2019s been planning it for months\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chase rose to his feet on a snarl. He scrubbed his hand over his brow, then leveled a hard look on Nathan. \u201cListen, I didn\u2019t live nearly two hundred years without more than a few fuckups and near disasters to my credit. You know my history; it\u2019s far from spotless. I\u2019m hardly the one to lecture you on duty or how you should live your life. But I\u2019m your commander. I\u2019m taking you off patrol for the night. Tell Elijah he\u2019ll captain in your place.\u201d</p><p>Nathan absorbed the edict with a conceding nod. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Chase challenged. He motioned for Nathan to stand up. \u201cConsider this a chance to figure your shit out with Jordana. I need to know if you can come back and continue your mission as captain of your squad. I\u2019ll expect your answer first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Nathan gave him another nod. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Chase slanted him a thoughtful but frustrated look. \u201cNow get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>Nathan left and headed down the corridor.</p><p>Rafe rounded a corner up ahead and immediately jogged forward to meet him. Worry etched his face.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Commander Chase yet today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He just finished chewing me a new asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Rafe looked at him, contrite. He fell in alongside Nathan and walked with him toward the warriors\u2019 wing of the compound. \u201cI had to name Jordana as a witness, man. I left her out of the patrol report because I didn\u2019t want to make things hard for you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Nathan replied. He could hardly be upset with his friend for simply carrying out his duty. \u201cYou had to report. I would\u2019ve done the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d he say?\u201d</p><p>Nathan shrugged. \u201cNothing I didn\u2019t deserve to hear. Then he yanked me off patrol for tonight. I need to let Eli know he\u2019ll be heading things up in my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Nathan.\u201d Rafe frowned, gave a slow shake of his head. \u201cThis is serious shit.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it was. But what he felt for Jordana was serious too.</p><p>And Chase was right, he needed to sort it out. He needed to see if there was any way for both the Order and her to fit into his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Rafe asked.</p><p>Nathan chuckled. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to go to Jordana\u2019s exhibit opening at the museum tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rafe gaped. \u201cWhat? You mean, like some kind of date? You\u2019ve got to be joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d When Rafe paused outside the weapons room, Nathan kept walking, heading for his quarters.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t plan to go there in full patrol gear,\u201d Rafe called out from behind him, laughing now.</p><p>Shit. Nathan hadn\u2019t considered things that far. He, the consummate tactician. The expert at weaponry and warfare didn\u2019t have the first clue how to present himself as anything even remotely resembling a man going to be with his woman in a social gathering.</p><p>A date, for crissake.</p><p>Nathan pivoted and strode back to find Rafe. He pulled him outside the weapons room and lowered his voice. \u201cWhat the fuck does someone wear to a museum party?\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>JORDANA STOOD IN THE GALLERY OUTSIDE THE EXHIBIT HALL of the museum, feeling a sense of relief\u2014a sense of pride and accomplishment\u2014as she looked out over the packed house at the grand opening that evening.</p><p>She had been hoping the event would be well attended, but the sea of benefactors, society elite, museum members and general public arriving to fill the space far exceeded anything she\u2019d dared to imagine.</p><p>Everyone was there tonight, her father included. Martin Gates mingled easily among his Darkhaven peers and the other upper-class citizens of Boston. Dressed in a conservative charcoal gray suit, pristine white shirt, and perfectly knotted silk tie, the handsome, staid, dark-haired Breed male looked every bit the wealthy investor and businessman that he was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was hard even for Jordana sometimes to remember that her father wasn\u2019t a Brahmin product of this city but a self-made man who\u2019d established himself in Vancouver before relocating to Boston with Jordana almost twenty-five years ago.</p><p>She\u2019d been just a newborn then, an orphaned Breedmate adopted by Martin Gates only days after her birth. She could never repay her father for the life he\u2019d provided her, and it warmed her heart to see him there to support her tonight.</p><p>Hundreds of people strolled the exhibit, conversing with one another, admiring the art and sculptures, enjoying the canap\u00e9s and champagne being served by catering staff in tuxedoes while a small orchestra played softly in the background. The exhibit hummed with conversation, laughter, and enthusiastic energy.</p> <p>Even Elliott had come, despite the graceless way she\u2019d ended their nonrelationship. But that was Elliott\u2014dutiful, political, in all things. Then again, watching him blithely chat up a couple of Back Bay socialites in front of the French tapestry collection, she had to wonder if his prior interest in her had been more about pleasing her father than any kind of true affection he may have felt for her.</p><p>It certainly hadn\u2019t been desire, not even during Elliott\u2019s most ardent moods. Jordana knew true desire now\u2014scorching, insatiable, consuming desire. What she and Elliott had was little more than a tepid, companionable regard for each other.</p><p>Nothing like what she\u2019d experienced the past few nights with Nathan.</p><p>Jordana scanned the exhibit hall again, looking for the one face in the crowd she longed to see above all others.</p><p>She knew better than to think Nathan would actually come. This wasn\u2019t his kind of place, not his kind of event at all. He had far more important things to do. She knew that even when she\u2019d sent him those impulsive messages earlier in the day.</p> <p>God, what did he think of her now? She was sure she wouldn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>If only she could erase those messages, take back the photo she\u2019d sent him. He hadn\u2019t responded, so there was a chance he hadn\u2019t seen her messages. Maybe Carys had given her the wrong number.</p><p>She could only hope to be that lucky.</p><p>\u201cOld Mr. Bonneville sends his regards,\u201d Carys said with a wry grin, emerging now from inside the exhibit hall to join Jordana in the quiet of the adjacent gallery. \u201cAs do Mr. Delano, Mr. Putnam, and Mr. Forbes. I told you that dress was amazing. Every man in that room who still has a pulse is waiting to get another glimpse of you. What are you doing hiding out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting,\u201d Carys gently finished for her. She strolled over, catlike and graceful in a pair of strappy, stiletto sandals that perfectly complemented the midnight hue of her body-hugging cobalt blue dress. \u201cCome on. Rune won\u2019t be here either, and we both look much too hot to be flying solo.\u201d Carys looped her arm around Jordana\u2019s elbow and gave her a bolstering smile. \u201cLet me be your date tonight.\u201d</p> <p>They walked into the noise and bustle of the party, offering greetings to clusters of happy patrons and supporters who sought Jordana out as soon as she entered the hall.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for her to put aside her disappointment that Nathan hadn\u2019t come. There were too many people to welcome, endless hands to shake, one conversation after another to attend to as she slowly circulated through the crowd. Carys drifted away as the attendees converged on Jordana.</p><p>\u201cAn exquisite collection, my dear,\u201d enthused the jewel-draped Breedmate of a prominent Darkhaven leader from within her circle of elegant society companions. The ladies all nodded in agreement. \u201cEach display offers something to delight or intrigue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust lovely,\u201d added the petite, silver-haired human of the group as she wrapped cool fingers around Jordana\u2019s hands. \u201cIf the museum doesn\u2019t take care of you properly, tell your director I may have to steal you away to curate our family\u2019s private collection.\u201d</p><p>Jordana accepted the praise with a polite smile to the elderly matriarch who\u2019d raised a powerful Boston political clan the likes of which hadn\u2019t been seen since the middle of the twentieth century.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you to say, Mrs. Amory,\u201d Jordana demurred. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you\u2019re all enjoying the exhibit.\u201d</p><p>The old woman winked and leaned in close. \u201cIf any of my unwed sons were here tonight, I might attempt to convince you to join our family in a more permanent capacity. Not that they would complain. Have you met my youngest, Peyton? He\u2019s quite the charmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um ...\u201d Jordana stammered, eager to make her excuses and move on, but then her father stepped in to do it for her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll find my daughter is immune to matchmaking, Mrs. Amory,\u201d Martin Gates replied smoothly, placing a light, sheltering arm around her shoulders. He offered a gracious smile to the now-giggling ladies before turning a warm, if less jovial, look on Jordana. \u201cTake it from someone who knows.\u201d</p><p>She winced inwardly at the private chastisement. So much for hoping she might delay having to explain about her abrupt breakup with Elliott.</p><p>\u201cMay a proud father steal his daughter away for a moment?\u201d he asked the women, to a collective round of approval. As he guided Jordana away from the well-meaning society hens, he murmured quietly, \u201cAn interesting choice of dress tonight. You look ...\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to disapprove, to tell her it was too provocative, drawing too much attention. Or maybe her father would say no more than he had, merely give her the silent, pensive look that always made her worry she was letting him down by not doing what he expected of his only child.</p><p>He paused and affectionately smoothed his hand over her hair. \u201cYou look beautiful, Jordana. And what you\u2019ve done here tonight is remarkable. I\u2019m very impressed.\u201d</p><p>His praise was heartfelt; she could see as much in his caring expression. That he approved meant more to her than all of the other attendees\u2019 compliments combined.</p><p>Jordana reached up and squeezed his hand. \u201cThank you, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that I\u2019m pleased that you\u2019ve found something that gives you so much obvious satisfaction\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she prompted, noting the faint crease forming between his dark brows. He was trying to be supportive, but it was obvious he couldn\u2019t turn off the part of him that seemed determined to direct the way she lived her life.</p><p>His frown deepened, and he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cJordana, this is hardly the best time or place\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d she said without venom or dread. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been avoiding this conversation long enough. I\u2019ve got a few minutes before I need to make my welcome speech. We might as well have this talk right here and now.\u201d</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t seem to agree, Martin Gates lowered his voice to a private tone. His features were pinched with genuine concern. \u201cI\u2019ve always been proud of your accomplishments, Jordana. You\u2019ve given me so much reason to be proud that you\u2019re my daughter. But when I took you in as my own, I made a promise\u2014to myself, and to you. I made a promise to the parents you would never know. I vowed to do the best for you, to provide everything you could ever possibly need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have.\u201d</p><p>Unmated and without heirs of his own, it was common knowledge that Martin Gates, the Vancouver hospital\u2019s most generous benefactor, had stepped in to take personal responsibility for Jordana after learning that a Breedmate had been orphaned there by a penniless, unwed mother who died giving birth to her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He slowly shook his head and muttered a low curse. \u201cI made a vow that I would see your future was secured. It\u2019s all that matters to me, and I\u2019m failing you in that, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>Seeing his genuine distress, she reached up to touch the tense jaw of the Breed male who had always been her father, her only family. \u201cElliott Bentley-Squire was never my future. I know you hoped he would be. That wasn\u2019t your failing, Father. It wasn\u2019t even Elliott\u2019s. It was mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s at fault now. We must fix it,\u201d he argued quietly but firmly as he took her hand in his. Idly, his thumb moved over her Breedmate mark on the inside of her wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you find a suitable mate. Time is running out, Jordana. You must do this\u2014for me, if you won\u2019t do it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened, desperation filtering into his stern gaze as he spoke. Jordana\u2019s veins jangled at the urgency in his voice. She\u2019d seen him argue this point before, but never with such intensity. \u201cI\u2019m a grown woman. You worry about me too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he snapped, giving a taut shake of his head. \u201cJordana, we must talk this through. When this event is over tonight, I want you to come home with me to the Darkhaven. I\u2019ll tell Elliott to stop by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cFather, I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t want Elliott.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s mouth flattened, but his tone was tender with concern. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. Can\u2019t you understand, I only want what\u2019s best for you. Someone worthy. Someone decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone of your choosing?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>His gaze sharpened a bit, intense with purpose. \u201cSomeone I trust implicitly to have your best interests in mind, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my happiness? What about love?\u201d She stared up at him. \u201cWhat about the things I need?\u201d</p><p>Clearly taken aback, he went silent for a long moment, regret creeping into his features. \u201cHave you ever felt unloved or unhappy as my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted for anything, Father. You\u2019ve given me more than I ever could\u2019ve hoped for.\u201d She smiled sadly. \u201cExcept the freedom to become an adult woman with my own mind, my own dreams ... my own plans for my future.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, not for several endless seconds. \u201cPlease come home, Jordana. Let me fix this ... before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t love Elliott. I never did, no matter how much you seemed to wish it were so. And now there\u2019s someone else\u2014\u201d</p><p>The words seized up in her throat as her senses prickled to attention. A shiver of awareness traveled through her bloodstream, making her veins sizzle and her palms tingle with the dancing of a thousand needles.</p><p>He was here.</p><p>Nathan.</p><p>Jordana felt him even before she turned around to confirm it with her eyes. The entire room seemed aware of his powerful presence too. She watched as a clearing began to form down the center of the exhibit hall.</p><p>Bit by bit, a path opened between Jordana\u2019s place in the room and Nathan, standing just inside the doors.</p><p>He came after all.</p><p>And, God, he looked good.</p><p>Tall and dark and dangerously handsome in a basic black suit that looked anything but basic on him. He wore an ebony silk shirt, unbuttoned below his throat, exposing just the sexiest hint of the Gen One dermaglyphs beneath his clothing.</p><p>Glyphs Jordana was now intimately familiar with and couldn\u2019t wait to see in their full, naked glory once again. Along with the gorgeous Breed male they belonged to.</p><p>Her mouth watered just thinking about it, and her heart rate kicked into a faster, heavier tempo.</p><p>Without a word of excuse to her father or anyone else who had stopped to gape, Jordana waded into the parting crowd and headed straight toward Nathan. She could hardly keep from running to him, and there was no curbing the smile that spread across her face as she came to a halt in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>His stormy eyes took a long, slow trip from her face to her toes. When he met her gaze again, amber sparks glowed in his irises. \u201cHow could I refuse such an enticing invitation?\u201d</p><p>She felt warmth flood her cheeks. It had nothing to do with shyness, but an eager reaction to the hunger she saw written so plainly on Nathan\u2019s face. It was written on his skin too. The tawny-hued glyphs at his throat surged with deeper saturation, and she knew the rest of his Breed markings would be livid with wild, waking colors underneath the urbane dark suit.</p><p>She smiled, barely resisting the urge to touch him. To kiss him and press herself against him, even in front of hundreds of observing eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI realize you probably can\u2019t stay long. Your patrols\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy patrols will wait. For tonight, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Hope flared in her belly. \u201cYou have the night off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d he replied, his sensual lips flattening slightly. \u201cI was instructed to take the night off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of me?\u201d She frowned, reading the meaning in what he didn\u2019t say. \u201cBecause you stayed with me last night. Oh, God ... not because of the messages I sent you today? I never should\u2019ve done that. I overstepped\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>His hand lighted gently along the side of her face, an unexpected touch Jordana savored. She tilted her head into his palm, greedy for the brief contact.</p><p>\u201cI chose to be with you,\u201d he said, bringing his hand back down to his side. \u201cI knew what I risked last night.\u201d Nathan\u2019s voice was a rumble in the back of his throat, low and deep, as his heated gaze drank her in once more. \u201cAs for the messages you sent, I haven\u2019t been able to focus on anything else since I saw the photo of you in this dress. You look even more incredible in the flesh.\u201d His mouth curved wickedly. \u201cBut then, I already knew that.\u201d</p><p>Her veins thrummed in response to his innuendo. All it took was his dangerous smile and her core bloomed with liquid heat at the remembrance of their night together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wanted him now, again ... always, she was certain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she murmured, wishing he\u2019d touch her again. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to cause problems for you with the Order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny problems there are mine to deal with.\u201d That devastating smile faded as he sent a dark glance around the gathering. When his eyes came back to her, they glittered as bright as embers. \u201cAnd there was no way in hell I was going to let you wear this dress for anyone but me. Even if I had to put on a monkey suit and try to play nice with the natives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very nice monkey suit,\u201d she said, melting under his possessive stare. \u201cOddly enough, seeing you in it only makes me want to sneak away somewhere and tear it off you.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s answering growl vibrated all the way to her bones. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me, female.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but she wanted to tempt him. She wanted to be the one in control, the one making him crazy with pleasure and need, until she was certain she owned his body the same way he had mastered hers.</p><p>She wanted to kiss him. She wanted to be naked with him again, feel him crashing into her, filling her.</p><p>The urge swamped her, feral and fierce.</p> <p>\u201cKeep looking at me like that and watch this civilized facade turn to ash right where we stand.\u201d</p><p>Jordana grinned. \u201cIs that a promise?\u201d</p><p>Another growl, this one darker, accompanied by a flash of his fangs. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>She gazed up at him for a long moment, surprised by the current of interest that lit up her veins. She felt daring with him, fearless. Too aroused by him to let inhibition put any limits on what they could share together.</p><p>\u201cI think we should definitely explore the idea,\u201d she said, but it was a knowing tease when she was already late for the podium. She gestured vaguely behind her. \u201cI have a little speech to give right now. It shouldn\u2019t take very long.\u201d Jordana stepped in closer to him, putting her lips almost against his ear. \u201cSo, whatever wicked thoughts you have, hold them until I get back.\u201d</p><p>At his rumble of interest, she drew back, out of his reach. Then she slowly pivoted to give him time to watch her stroll away from him.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have to glance back to check if he was watching her, but she did anyway.</p><p>Oh, yes, he was watching.</p><p>His smoldering eyes threw off a palpable heat, desire so intense it nearly burned everything in its path. And all of it trained on her.</p><p>Jordana tossed him a flirty smile, then headed for the dais at the front of the crowded exhibit hall.</p><p>20</p><p>EVERY BLOOD VESSEL IN HIS BODY SEEMED TO HAVE MIGRATED south as Nathan watched Jordana walk away from him to take her place at the raised podium. His ear was still warm from her whispered suggestion\u2014a suggestion he had every intention of holding her to as soon as she finished greeting her event\u2019s guests.</p><p>Damn, he wanted her naked beneath him now. How he was going to survive the rest of the night without burying himself inside her, he had no idea.</p><p>Nathan shifted his stance and tugged at the jacket he\u2019d borrowed from Rafe. For all the good it did. Nothing was going to ease his ache except the sheath of Jordana\u2019s hot, wet body.</p> <p>And her hands.</p><p>Or her pretty, pink mouth.</p><p>Had he actually believed at one point that a taste of this woman would be enough to satisfy his need for her?</p><p>Christ, what an idiot he\u2019d been.</p><p>Now he craved her more than ever. She captivated him completely, held the power to render him hard as steel with just a few simple words.</p><p>He tried to tell himself he didn\u2019t like the feeling. He\u2019d kept such a merciless grip on his needs and desires for so long, it should chafe more to realize he was losing his hold so easily where she was concerned.</p><p>Jordana was magnetic, her blond hair and flame-colored dress a beacon across the sea of darkly attired men and women. Watching her smooth command of the room and everyone in it filled Nathan with a possessive, selfish pride.</p><p>How had such an extraordinary woman become part of his life? Why choose him, when she had her pick of a hundred other more worthy males in this room alone?</p><p>But she had chosen.</p><p>The private glance she sent him through the thick crowd as she delivered her welcome would have erased any doubt. The instant their eyes connected, Nathan\u2019s blood simmered with added fire. His veins throbbed, and the erection he\u2019d been sporting when she left him a minute ago now worsened to near agony.</p><p>He felt his glyphs surge with heat and knew his desire would be plain in the deepening colors that were blooming at his collar and up the sides of his neck. His fangs pricked his tongue, sent saliva surging into his mouth.</p><p>Jordana belonged to him.</p><p>And whether he wanted to admit it or not, he belonged to her too.</p><p>A throat cleared pointedly from beside him. \u201cRemarkable, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Nathan swung a hard look over his shoulder at the Breed male who\u2019d moved in from the surrounding crowd without his notice.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d he replied stiffly, then extended his hand to the Darkhaven leader. \u201cMr. Gates. I\u2019m Nathan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d Gates kept his arms folded over his tuxedoed chest, his gaze trained on the podium across the wide hall. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t know is what interest you have in my daughter.\u201d Now he turned his head in pointed observation of Nathan\u2019s ember-flecked eyes and churning dermaglyphs. \u201cAside from the obvious, that is.\u201d</p><p>Nathan bristled but could hardly take offense at her father\u2019s disapproval. \u201cMy interests are no different than yours, sir.\u201d</p><p>Gates scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m sure they couldn\u2019t be any more different.\u201d His cutting stare narrowed. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re the reason she cast Elliott aside?\u201d</p><p>Nathan glanced toward the dais, where Jordana had just finished her speech to a round of enthusiastic applause, and was now being swamped by adoring party guests. \u201cMaybe you should ask her that question instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Gates replied. \u201cI saw the way she looks at you, the way she\u2019s acting ... the way she\u2019s dressed tonight. It\u2019s all because of you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Nathan met the elder vampire\u2019s accusing gaze. There was something more than suspicion or disapproval in the male\u2019s eyes. A protectiveness that verged on desperation.</p><p>\u201cJordana has her own mind,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cShe has her own will. How she acts or thinks or behaves is up to her.\u201d</p><p>Gates grunted. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like it. I want this to stop. Immediately, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I do,\u201d Nathan challenged. He had no wish to make an enemy out of her father, but if Gates thought he had anything to say about Nathan\u2019s relationship with Jordana, he was sorely mistaken.</p><p>\u201cJordana means the world to me,\u201d Gates said. \u201cShe\u2019s a very special young woman. I don\u2019t expect someone like you to comprehend that, or to care\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like me.\u201d Nathan all but growled the words.</p><p>\u201cStay away from her,\u201d Gates ordered tightly. \u201cAs a man\u2014as a fellow Breed male\u2014I am asking you to leave my daughter alone.\u201d</p><p>Nathan thought back to a mere week ago, to who he was before the night Jordana crashed into his life with one impulsive, unforgettable kiss.</p><p>That man\u2014the street warrior whose nights were filled with ugliness and violence\u2014would have never imagined himself standing in the middle of a glittering society event in a borrowed suit, waiting to be reunited with the most exquisite, extraordinary woman in the room.</p><p>He would have never imagined a time or place where he would want to belong to that kind of world, or wish that he had all along, if only to be part of it with her.</p><p>To be worthy of her.</p><p>To have some kind of future to offer her that didn\u2019t consist of darkness and war and bloodshed.</p><p>As the Hunter bred and trained for destruction, he never would have dared permit himself to care for someone as he did for Jordana.</p><p>There was no turning back.</p><p>Now that he had let her in, no one was going to tell him to let her go.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. He gave a solemn shake of his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do that.\u201d</p><p>Martin Gates studied him in a searching, scrutinizing glare. Resignation bled into his face and he huffed out a brittle sigh. \u201cVery well. How much will it take for you to comply?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bribe?\u201d Nathan\u2019s voice was cold and level, even while his outrage spiked. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>But Gates was unswayed. \u201cName your price and it\u2019s yours. She need never know.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s answering curse was ripe with outrage. Dark with fury. \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough goddamn money in the world. If you really love Jordana as much as I do, you\u2019d know that.\u201d</p><p>Gates reeled back, his head snapping up as if he\u2019d taken a physical blow.</p><p>Only then did Nathan realize what he\u2019d said.</p><p>He loved her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bite the words back, not because he\u2019d already let them out, but because they were the truth.</p><p>Holy hell ... he meant it. He was in love with Jordana.</p><p>Gates said nothing, not for a long time. Then, face blanched, hands visibly shaking at his sides, he lowered his voice to a savage whisper. \u201cStay away from Jordana. Or you will leave me no choice but to make deadly certain that you do.\u201d</p><p>A threat? Nathan saw the menace\u2014and the abject alarm\u2014in the Breed male\u2019s dark eyes.</p><p>Martin Gates would have Nathan\u2019s head before he allowed him to continue with Jordana. Or, rather, he would try.</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t want to think about a confrontation between the elder vampire and himself. And Gates had to know that taking on one of the Order, particularly a Gen One Hunter like Nathan, would be tantamount to suicide.</p><p>Yet that was his intent. Gates would risk anything, including his own life, to keep his daughter away from Nathan.</p><p>\u201cLeave my daughter alone,\u201d Gates ground out. Then, as quickly as the threat had been thrown down, he flashed away, vanishing into the thick crowd.</p><p>Nathan understood why in that next instant. Jordana was approaching from behind.</p><p>Nathan sensed her like a current in his blood. The air stirred with her bright energy. Her voice drifted to him, vibrant and rich, as she accepted praise and offered thanks to the patrons and museum guests who vied for her attention as she made her way through the throng.</p><p>He turned toward her, prepared to explain what had happened with her father. But Jordana\u2019s beaming expression stopped him short.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know. She must not have seen them talking while she was at the dais.</p><p>And Nathan wasn\u2019t going to be the one to ruin her night. Not when she was looking at him with such exuberance and satisfaction. Despite all the eyes on her, she looked at him as though he were the only other person in the room.</p><p>\u201cStill want to make good on that promise?\u201d She reached up and touched his face, just the briefest contact.</p><p>Old, battered instincts clenched inside him, but newer ones\u2014the ones she\u2019d awakened in him\u2014responded to her fleeting caress with heat and hunger for more.</p><p>Mischief danced in Jordana\u2019s ice blue eyes. Her smile broke slowly, seductively. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She breezed past him, the sight of her bare back in that red dress, her hips swaying with each fluid stride of her long legs, leaving him no choice but to obey. Nathan stalked after her, out of the exhibit hall and into a gallery outside. She kept going, leading him farther away from the buzz and activity of the party.</p><p>He was enjoying the view so much he hardly realized what she was doing until she disappeared into the gloom of a nearby office. When he reached the open doorway, she yanked him inside by the lapel of his suit coat and shut the door behind him.</p><p>Her mouth came down hard on his as she pushed him backward against a desk.</p><p>No warning.</p><p>No waiting for him to make the first move.</p><p>Not the slightest trace of uncertainty as she pressed her body against his and pushed his lips apart with her demanding little tongue.</p><p>And fuck if that didn\u2019t shoot molten fire into his veins.</p><p>Outside the closed door of the office, the drone of conversation and soft music carried from the exhibit hall several yards away. Low light from the gallery filtered through the shuttered blinds of the window behind the desk. A bark of laughter sounded from just outside as a small group of party guests walked the promenade that led to the museum lobby.</p><p>He and Jordana were secluded enough in the private office, but there was no escaping the knowledge that the risk of discovery lurked just beyond its four walls.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>Hell, she seemed to revel in the risk. As she kissed him, he felt her hands at the collar of his shirt. His mind was slipping, getting pulled under the more powerful force of his need.</p><p>He only vaguely registered that his shirt was open, his chest bared to her gaze, to her touch. When she dragged her mouth down along his throat to the glyphs that rode his pectorals, he wrenched up off the desk on a lust-filled groan.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she admonished him with a playful smile and a daring glimmer in her eyes. Her pretty pink tongue followed the arc and flourish of his dermaglyphs, making them flush with darkening colors. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do this all night.\u201d</p><p>Ah, Christ. Nathan watched, entranced, hard as granite, as she licked and suckled him, each wet kiss igniting a dangerous fire in his veins. She drew his nipple into her mouth, grazing the tight peak with her teeth.</p><p>Her touch shouldn\u2019t have been so welcome, so easily accepted. It didn\u2019t fit into the way he lived his life. It went against everything he\u2019d been taught. Defied the years of training and hard lessons that still haunted his dreams, all too often left him soaked in cold sweat, stomach pitching with nausea for what he\u2019d witnessed. What he\u2019d been made to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But those nightmares and horrors had no hold on him when Jordana\u2019s lips were warm and questing on his skin. All he knew was the ecstasy of her mouth and his yearning for everything she would give him.</p><p>Nathan growled with pleasure, his cock straining with unbearable demand. He brought his arms around her and urged her up to his mouth once more, leaning back onto the desk as he took her in a scorchingly deep kiss.</p><p>Her skin was hot beneath his palms, her bare back like velvet under his fingertips. She moved against him as their tongues tangled together, their bodies creating a friction that drove him swiftly to the edge of his need.</p> <p>He moaned as his cock surged against the warmth of her abdomen. Greedy for more, he smoothed his hands down over her dress and onto her ass. Gripping her firmly, he ground deeper into her heat, angling his pelvis to meet every sinuous movement of her body.</p><p>It was torture, plain and simple. All it did was ratchet him tighter, harder.</p><p>Made the tether of his self-control stretch taut, near to breaking.</p><p>If they didn\u2019t stop soon, nothing was going to keep him from taking her right there on the desk. Shit, he was already past that point of no return. And if anyone from the party had the bad judgment to come looking for Jordana\u2014if anyone walked in on them now or in the next few minutes\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to reel in his urge to kill.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you feel good, Jordana,\u201d he muttered through gritted teeth and fangs. \u201cJust the sight of you makes me wild to fuck you. To feel you on me like this, knowing how sweet your body is going to be when I get you naked and drive into you\u2014\u201d He sucked in a sharp breath and moved against her in a more fervent rhythm, astonished that their combined heat didn\u2019t incinerate their clothing. He stared into her eyes, the dim light from of his transformed irises gilding her in an ember glow. \u201cIf you think you can tease me like this then walk away, you\u2019ve got a hard lesson coming.\u201d</p> <p>A snarl rumbled out of him as she drew out of his embrace to stand between his legs. \u201cWho says I\u2019m teasing?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth was kiss-bruised and glossy, her eyelids heavy over the now dusky blue of her eyes. Without further words, she reached for his hand and urged him to his feet. He stood, breath caught in his lungs as she began to unfasten his belt. It jangled softly as it fell loose, the only other sound besides her soft, shallow panting as she undid the button on his pants, then let down the zipper.</p><p>Her hand slipped inside, cupped his rigid shaft. Nathan hissed, steeling himself to the bliss of her gentle touch.</p><p>He\u2019d been raised not to require touch or comfort, feeling or emotion ... least of all pleasure. He had been brutally conditioned to reject all these things, and so he had.</p><p>But he\u2019d never known Jordana\u2019s touch. He\u2019d never known her kiss, or how silky and hot\u2014how utterly perfect\u2014it could feel to lose himself in the one woman he wanted above all others.</p><p>The only one he would ever want again.</p> <p>Jordana stroked him briefly, catching her lower lip between her teeth as she palmed the head of his cock, smoothing the bead of slick moisture along his length. He groaned when she released him, but then her hands went to the slack waistband of his opened pants and his throat suddenly went dry.</p><p>With her gaze locked on his, she freed him in agonizing increments, until the fabric slid down his legs to pool at his feet. His cock jutted out, thick and heavy, dripping with need. The glyphs that encircled its base and tracked onto his shaft throbbed with furious hues of darkest indigo and bloodred wine, the colors of extreme desire.</p><p>Jordana stepped forward and wrapped her hand around his nape, dragged him down for another deep, unhurried kiss. He obliged, parting his lips to let her in, savoring the sweetness of her tongue and the hunger of her mouth.</p><p>His heart was hammering, his fangs filling his mouth by the time she released him. Jordana ran her fingers along the underside of his swollen shaft, wringing a hiss from him as she squeezed the head and slicked him with his own juices.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he whispered raggedly. Her touch would be the death of him. A death he\u2019d gladly welcome.</p><p>Through blazing eyes, he watched her lower her head and place tender kisses across his chest. She stroked him some more, then began a downward trail of warm, wet heat with her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAh, fuck,\u201d he snarled again, incapable of anything more.</p><p>Her lips and tongue skimmed down his abdomen, over every hard ridge and muscle, along one path of churning dermaglyphs to another. Sensation electrified him, left him shuddering with fevered anticipation. All centered on her.</p> <p>He speared his fingers into her pale blond hair, needing something to hold on to as she slowly sank to her knees before him.</p><p>She tilted her head and gazed up at him, her dusky blue eyes holding his searing amber gaze as she moved forward and took him into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cJordana ... holy fuck,\u201d he rasped out savagely as her lips and tongue closed around his cock.</p><p>21</p><p>JORDANA HAD NEVER FELT MORE AROUSED, OR MORE ALIVE, THAN in that moment as she watched Nathan\u2019s pleasure mount while she suckled him deep into her mouth.</p><p>He dropped his head back on his shoulders and moaned, his muscled thighs braced apart and trembling as she worked her lips and tongue along the entire delicious length of him. His fingers lightly caressed her skull where they\u2019d sunk deep into her hair, his broad palm curved along the back of her head as she took him deeper with each stroke of her mouth.</p><p>With the slightest change of tempo or flick of her tongue, she quickly learned how to make him growl in sensual agony or shudder in passion.</p><p>Nathan, the lethal warrior. The remote, unreadable Hunter. The Breed male who so easily assumed the lead in any situation, who dominated in everything he did.</p><p>The solitary man who\u2019d stormed into her world and changed everything.</p><p>Changed her.</p><p>Here and now, Jordana had absolute control over him, and something about that knowledge made her feel both humbled and drunk with power.</p><p>She held him in her hands, stroking his velvety shaft as she drew him deeper into her mouth. He gasped as she leaned in and took all of him, hissed when she slowly withdrew all the way to the smooth, plum-shaped crown.</p><p>\u201cYou taste good,\u201d she murmured, running the tip of her tongue through the hot, silky fluid that coated the engorged head of his cock. His hips bucked when she enveloped him in her mouth again. His curse was raw, ragged, as she abraded him lightly with her teeth. She smiled, pleased with this newfound power. \u201cYou taste good enough to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, Jordana,\u201d he bit off harshly, his already visible fangs elongating like bone-white daggers behind his parted lips as she sucked him even harder. \u201cGonna make me fucking lose it ...\u201d</p><p>His voice was gravel, little more than a coarse rumble in his throat. Just hearing him so close to the edge made wet heat boil in her core.</p><p>He grunted, his pelvis knocking forward in a spasm she knew he couldn\u2019t control. \u201cChrist, that sweet mouth of yours ...\u201d</p><p>She moaned around his girth, thrilling in his response and taking far too much satisfaction in the torment she was delivering.</p><p>As she rode his length with her mouth, he clutched at her, tremors raking his immense body. His gorgeous face became something darker, otherworldly. His stormy eyes went volcanic, nothing but pools of amber swallowing up the catlike slits of his pupils.</p><p>His full lips peeled back on a feral snarl, his angular cheekbones sharpening to bladelike slashes as he stared down at her. His pulse drummed against her tongue and the roof of her mouth as he slid in and out of her lips, making her own heartbeat spike into the same hard tempo. Between her legs, she was drenched, aching to be filled.</p><p>Fueled by her own rising need, she dragged his cock deep, suckled him mercilessly, until at last he tore her away from him on a strangled growl.</p><p>No words, no gentle touches. He grabbed her under the arms and lifted her to her feet. Spun her around in front of him, then put one strong hand around the back of her neck and pressed her facedown onto the desk.</p><p>It was a primal move, his fingers like heated iron against her nape. With a low growl, he put his bare thigh between her legs, nudged them wider apart.</p><p>Jordana couldn\u2019t move, even if she wanted to.</p><p>She\u2019d pushed him to the brink, but now he was back in control. And she could hardly breathe for how totally that turned her on.</p><p>Nathan held her down with one hand, while his other lifted the skirt of her dress up over her backside. She knew the precise moment when he saw her skimpy black thong. He stilled, sucked in a short gust of air.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d he rasped thickly. His fingers skimmed up the inside of her legs, to where her soaked crotch throbbed.</p><p>He brushed her sensitive flesh, then she felt the thin excuse for underwear pull tight in his grasp. It snapped and fell away.</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Nathan grunted. \u201cThat\u2019s even better.\u201d</p><p>She trembled, every nerve ending lit up with anticipation. Outside her office window, shadows passed by the closed blinds as people strolled through the museum, conversations muffled, but not entirely muted, by the walls and glass.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s hand slid between her drenched folds. He penetrated her slowly, his fingers caressing the inside of her walls and wringing a strangled cry from the back of her throat. She wanted more. Needed more. Had to have all of him now.</p><p>\u201cShould I make you scream when you come for me, Jordana?\u201d Nathan\u2019s voice was a low murmur behind her, his breath fanning hotly across her naked spine as he leaned over her prone body.</p><p>His mouth came down between her shoulder blades. She shivered, then panted softly as his open lips and tongue followed the shallow valley of her spine.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe I should make you scream for me,\u201d he uttered against her skin. \u201cI want every male in this building to know that you belong to me. Only me.\u201d</p><p>She moaned, ready to give him anything he demanded if only to ease the fierce ache roiling within her. He stroked her until she was squirming helplessly, her lip caught tightly in her teeth to bite back the sounds of her pleasure and her need.</p><p>Each wicked thrust of his fingers made her arch to receive more, her body totally exposed to him, her sex inflamed, juices trickling along her cleft.</p><p>\u201cSo greedy,\u201d he admonished, dark amusement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNathan,\u201d she gasped as he teased her swollen petals, making her legs quake beneath her. \u201cPlease ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d he commanded. \u201cStay just like that.\u201d</p><p>He moved off her, leaving chill air in his wake. But then she felt his bulky shoulders between her parted thighs. Felt his breath rush against her wet core in the instant before he buried his face in her sex. Heat blasted her as he licked a slow, fiery trail from her clit to her ass.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Jordana\u2019s voice was threadbare, choked with pleasure as he cleaved her slit with his tongue. She had no voice at all when he returned to the pulsing little nub and suckled it ruthlessly, the quivering seam of her body pressed tight to his face with nowhere to escape.</p><p>Not that she wanted to. There wasn\u2019t anywhere else she\u2019d rather be. The world could go on without her on the other side of her office walls. Everything could float away and she\u2019d be happy, so long as Nathan didn\u2019t stop touching her, tasting her, making her mad with pleasure.</p><p>She started to come, orgasm roaring up on her in a powerful wave of sensation.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Nathan ordered her, nipping her just enough to bring her back to earth.</p><p>He kissed her shamelessly, relentlessly, until her bones felt liquefied and her blood seemed made of lava. Only then did he release her, rising to his feet behind her. The head of his cock was a blunt, demanding presence in the slickness at her core.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d Nathan growled savagely. \u201cI can\u2019t stay away from you. Fuck, Jordana ... I will never have enough of you.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he thrust deep, impaling her to the hilt.</p><p>Nathan couldn\u2019t slow down and sure as hell couldn\u2019t stop. He couldn\u2019t curb the ferocious need that wracked him as he pumped hard and deep into Jordana\u2019s slick, tight sheath.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold back the primal drum of his pulse, his blood running hot and molten through his veins.</p><p>She was his.</p><p>No one could tell him otherwise. No plea or command or lethal threat would change how he felt about her.</p><p>Jordana belonged to him.</p><p>Her body, her pleasure, her heart. Maybe one day, her blood bond.</p><p>Just the thought of taking her vein as he claimed her body made his fangs erupt farther from his gums. The recollection of her bloodscent, that ethereal, delicately elusive mix of citrus and spice, made his mouth water with the thirst to make her his in the one way no worldly force could ever break.</p><p>But not here.</p><p>Not like this.</p><p>He\u2019d already taken more than he deserved from her.</p><p>She had driven him to the razor\u2019s edge of his control tonight, but he still had some sanity left.</p><p>Admittedly, too damned little, when she looked so sexy for him tonight and tasted so sweet. When she felt so incredibly perfect as he held her pinned beneath him and crashed into her welcoming heat with an abandon he\u2019d never known.</p><p>All he knew in that moment was her. She consumed his senses, obliterating everything but the pleasure of their joining, the erotic sounds of their bodies moving together in slick and frenzied rhythm.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to last long.</p><p>Each thrust of his hips sent him deeper, jolted him further away from reason and control and discipline. His veins were lit up, sizzling. Tension coiled deep inside him, pressure that turned every tendon and sinew to the breaking point. His cock had never been harder, ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cCome for me now, Jordana,\u201d he muttered fiercely beside her head as he leaned forward and angled himself even tighter into the milking tightness of her womb. \u201cI want to feel it. I need to feel it right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her response was immediate, her release a sudden, violent shudder that vibrated all along his shaft and down into his marrow. She cried his name on a broken gasp, arching into his thrusts as his own release roared up to overtake him.</p><p>He was gone in that same instant. He came hard and fast, blinded by pure, white-hot ecstasy as his seed shot loose into the contracting glove of her sex.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how long they remained there, Jordana panting softly beneath him, splayed over the desk; he braced above her on locked elbows and fists, unmoving, unwilling to break the sexual connection of their bodies.</p> <p>He was hard again. More accurately, still hard.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s pulse was a heavy, seductive thrum against his shaft. Her delicate muscles gripped him snugly, even now. When she shifted her hips in tempting invitation, Nathan groaned.</p><p>\u201cKeep that up, and I\u2019ll never let you out of this room.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and regarded him over her shoulder, her lips curved in a satisfied smile. \u201cI think I might like that.\u201d</p><p>So would he, but they couldn\u2019t stay there much longer and expect her not to be missed. Exercising more self-control than he\u2019d been able to claim since he met her, Nathan slowly eased out of her. Her disappointed moan nearly undid him.</p> <p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d he said, and reached down to help her rise up off the desk.</p><p>She turned around to face him, her light blue eyes dusky below the thick fringe of her lashes. Her cheeks were flushed, her lips cherry red and glistening.</p><p>He drew her close, brushed his fingers over her moist, tantalizing mouth. \u201cYou make me hard as stone, just thinking about how good your lips felt on me tonight.\u201d His cock twitched in agreement, ready to start all over again. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get you out of here and into bed with me. I\u2019ve got some very creative ideas for how I\u2019m gonna pay you back.\u201d</p><p>She grinned up at him. \u201cMm, I can\u2019t wait to hold you to that.\u201d</p><p>Tilting her face, she caught the tip of his finger between her teeth. Her tongue played him the same way she\u2019d tormented his cock, maddening little flicks combined with ruthlessly intense suction.</p><p>Nathan grunted, a spasm shooting up his spine and straight into his rigid shaft. \u201cHoly hell ... on second thought, who needs a bed?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed softly as she released him. Nathan grabbed for her, but she ducked away, playful. The sexiest damned woman he\u2019d ever seen. He wanted her badly, and he wanted her now.</p><p>She smoothed the hem of her red dress down over her fine bare ass and long legs, shimmying to adjust the silky fabric back into place. \u201cI should get back out there, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, eyes hot on her. \u201cI think you belong right here, with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s the greedy one?\u201d she tossed back at him, arching one delicate brow. Bending down, she retrieved the tattered remains of her thong from near his discarded pants. \u201cI\u2019m going to go freshen up, and, ah, destroy the evidence.\u201d</p><p>The scrap of black silk dangled from her fingers, and the understanding that she would be naked under the dress for the remainder of the night sent another shock wave of lust into his bloodstream. How he was going to survive the next few minutes, let alone potentially another couple of hours, in public without pouncing on her again, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>As he contemplated all the things he wanted to do to her, a low buzz sounded from somewhere near his feet. Despite his preternatural senses, he could hardly hear the faint hum over the roar of his pulse in his ears.</p><p>Shit. His comm unit.</p><p>Jordana gestured toward the floor where the device lay forgotten in his pants pocket. \u201cYou take care of your business,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll go take care of mine.\u201d</p> <p>Nathan stooped to pick up the comm, bringing his pants up at the same time. He fastened them hastily, unable to tear his eyes away from her as she strode for the door.</p><p>\u201cSee you back inside the exhibit hall in a few minutes,\u201d she said, beaming as she opened the door and slipped out.</p><p>Nathan glanced down at the comm unit buzzing again in his palm.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said into the receiver, struggling to wrench his attention away from thoughts of Jordana as he took the call from the Boston headquarters.</p><p>\u201cNathan.\u201d Chase\u2019s deep voice held a grim edge. \u201cWe just got intel from Gideon in D.C.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s combat instincts went on immediate full alert. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you with Jordana?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. This couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cShe was just here with me a minute ago.\u201d Nathan gripped the comm device harder in his fist, started stalking toward the office door. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Gates,\u201d Chase said. \u201cHe\u2019s been allied with Cassian Gray this whole time, partnered with him in the club. Gates isn\u2019t who he\u2019s pretending to be. The son of a bitch is dirty.\u201d</p><p>Ah, Christ. No.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s part of Opus Nostrum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d Chase said. \u201cWe\u2019re digging deeper. If it turns out Gates is involved with Opus ...\u201d</p><p>The commander let the statement trail off, but Nathan knew well enough what it meant. If Gates\u2019s partnership with Cassian Gray tied back to Opus Nostrum in any way, the Order would have no choice but to deal with him as an enemy and terminate him.</p><p>Nathan didn\u2019t even want to consider what all of this would do to Jordana.</p><p>He exited to the gallery outside, swiveling his head to ascertain which direction she might have gone.</p><p>\u201cIn light of this new intelligence,\u201d Chase said, a carefulness to his tone, \u201cit makes Cass\u2019s visit to Jordana at the museum the day he was killed more than a bit troubling. Is it possible she\u2019s aware of the link between her father and Cassian Gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know any of this,\u201d Nathan blurted. He would stake his life on it.</p><p>Jordana couldn\u2019t have been keeping a secret like that. She was too open, too innocent. She couldn\u2019t have been playing Nathan for a fool this whole time.</p><p>\u201cThe team and I are en route to the museum now,\u201d the commander said. \u201cWe know Gates is there tonight. We have to take him in for questioning. No delays. No warnings.\u201d</p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Nathan replied, his cold warrior\u2019s logic instantly at war with the man who dreaded the heartbreak about to visit the woman he loved.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him leave,\u201d Chase ordered. \u201cWe\u2019re two minutes out at most. I need you to do whatever you must to hold him until we arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Nathan confirmed woodenly, ending the communication on a harsh curse.</p><p>Outside the open entryway of the exhibit hall, he spotted Carys chatting pleasantly with a small group of ladies. He motioned her toward him as he marched at a soldier\u2019s clip across the marble floor. \u201cFind Jordana. Now. Keep her out of the exhibit hall.\u201d</p><p>The Breed female\u2019s face blanched. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her,\u201d he barked sharply. \u201cTake her home. Don\u2019t leave her side, do you understand? And tell her ... ah, fuck. Tell her I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan?\u201d Carys called from behind him, but he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>His heart as heavy as his feet, he strode into the glittering society event like a wraith, his ruthless Hunter\u2019s gaze searching out his quarry through the crowds.</p><p>22</p><p>STANDING IN FRONT OF THE RESTROOM MIRROR, JORDANA finger-combed her hair back into some semblance of order and checked her appearance one last time after freshening up.</p><p>Aside from the cat-in-the-cream grin she couldn\u2019t seem to suppress, she supposed she looked presentable enough. Although no one in the exhibit hall would detect what she\u2019d been up to, Jordana wasn\u2019t sure how she was going to manage to look anyone in the eye without blushing from head to toe over the knowledge of where she\u2019d been and with whom\u2014or the fact that her shredded thong now lay in the bottom of the ladies\u2019 room waste bin.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d be able to pretend as if she hadn\u2019t just been thoroughly, magnificently fucked just a few scant yards and one closed door away from hundreds of Boston\u2019s most affluent, important citizens.</p><p>Not to mention her father.</p><p>She\u2019d intended to seek him out after her welcome speech and introduce him to Nathan. So much for that plan. Her libido had other ideas.</p><p>Very good ideas, as it turned out.</p><p>She would just have to introduce the two men later in the evening\u2014</p><p>Someone let out a scream in the exhibit hall outside. There was a crash of glassware and china, then a loud, discordant note from the orchestra before the music cut off abruptly.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s stomach dropped like a stone. \u201cWhat on earth?\u201d</p><p>The restroom door swung open and there was Carys. \u201cJordana,\u201d she said gently. Her friend\u2019s face was drawn and sober, her tawny brows pinched over anxious eyes. \u201cNathan wanted me to come find you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Now Jordana\u2019s stomach plummeted even further. A cold pit opened up in her gut. \u201cWhere is he? What the hell just happened out there?\u201d</p><p>Jordana lunged for the exit, but Carys held her back. \u201cHe told me to keep you out of the exhibit hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why would he do that?\u201d Confusion, incredulity, a barrage of disorienting emotions collided inside her as she tried to process what was going on.</p><p>She shook it all off and tried to step around her friend.</p><p>Tried, and failed.</p><p>Carys\u2019s halting grasp was Breed strong, and so was the female\u2019s determination. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should go out there\u2014\u201d</p><p>Outrage spiked through Jordana\u2019s haze of confusion. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>Wrenching out of her friend\u2019s hold, she pushed out to the hallway. People were pouring out of the exhibit hall and adjacent gallery, faces awash in alarm.</p><p>A growing crowd gathered at the railing of the promenade that overlooked the museum\u2019s lobby, where the sounds of a struggle\u2014the shouts of a furious man, the rapid drum of boots traveling over polished marble tiles\u2014carried up from below.</p><p>Someone was being physically dragged out of the party, fighting and cursing every inch of the way.</p><p>Jordana raced to the balcony edge and her heart stopped.</p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d</p><p>He was fighting madly, fangs bared, head thrashing.</p><p>Bucking and twisting, Martin Gates tried desperately to get loose of the larger Breed male who held his arms behind his back like a criminal, ushering him swiftly across the lobby toward the main exit.</p><p>\u201cFather!\u201d Jordana cried. She ran to the wide staircase leading to the lobby, panic beating in her breast like a caged bird.</p><p>Cool night air gusted in as the glass doors opened to admit a team of warriors from the Order. They swarmed in to assist, garbed in black combat gear, bristling with deadly weapons.</p><p>\u201cUnhand me!\u201d her father shouted. \u201cYou have no right to treat me this way!\u201d</p><p>Distantly, as though caught up in the slow-motion horror of a terrible dream, Jordana could hear herself screaming.</p><p>She could feel the hard marble floor beneath her tall heels as she ran down the stairs, yet each step seemed mired in quicksand, agonizingly slow.</p><p>She saw the grim faces of the Boston warriors positioned at the door as her father was pushed toward them in unyielding, merciless purpose.</p><p>And, with terrible dawning, she finally caught a glimpse of the immense Breed male whose hands were gripped so punishingly on her father. Hands that had only minutes ago been hot and pleasurable on every inch of her naked body.</p><p>\u201cNathan. Why are you doing this?\u201d she gasped brokenly, stricken with shock. It took him a long moment before he turned his head at her approach into the lobby. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Where are you taking my father?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read the flat expression that Nathan held on her. His storm-cloud eyes were emotionless, chillingly so.</p><p>Gone was the passionate lover she\u2019d left behind in her office. In his place stood the cold Breed warrior.</p><p>The merciless Hunter.</p><p>\u201cCarys.\u201d Nathan\u2019s impenetrable gaze was looking past Jordana now. His voice was airless, a low command. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, I told you to keep her out of here.\u201d</p><p>Gentle hands came down on Jordana\u2019s shoulders. She jerked out of the comforting hold on a strangled cry. Jordana shook her head mutely, blindsided and lost for words under the weight of her confusion.</p><p>Nathan gave her one last glance\u2014this time, a note of regret shadowing his gaze. Then he shoved her father forward and the rest of the Order closed in to surround them.</p><p>In moments, they were all gone, swallowed up into a waiting black SUV at the curb, then vanished into the night in a squeal of tires on pavement as they sped away.</p><p>Most of Gates\u2019s fury and venom had left him by the time Nathan and the Order brought the Darkhaven leader into the command center for questioning. He\u2019d roared and protested for most of the quick drive across town, but once seated in the interrogation room, the Breed male\u2019s broad shoulders sagged in his rumpled tuxedo.</p><p>His gaze was no longer simmering with anger but cautious. Cagey and wary, as he eyed Nathan and the other warriors from beneath the dark brown slashes of his brows. \u201cI demand to know what this is about,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cThis is an outrage! I am a private citizen. The Order has no right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have every right,\u201d Sterling Chase informed him. The Boston commander leaned against the back wall of the closed room, his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cWe have evidence linking you to criminal activity in this city\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCriminal activity?\u201d Gates scoffed. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You have no cause to believe that, let alone evidence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI assure you, we do,\u201d Chase said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure JUSTIS would be very interested to hear how one of Boston\u2019s most upstanding pillars of polite society has secretly been involved in illegal sport and various other unsavory pursuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d Gates refuted with a scowl and a dismissive shake of his head. Then he turned a pointed glower solely on Nathan. \u201cIf you think humiliating me in front of my daughter and my peers will change my promise to you tonight, you\u2019re sorely mistaken.\u201d</p><p>At Chase\u2019s questioning look, Nathan grunted. \u201cMr. Gates made it clear to me that he does not approve of my interest in Jordana and won\u2019t permit it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe threatened you?\u201d</p><p>Nathan shrugged. It hadn\u2019t fazed him then and hardly mattered now. After the way things went down tonight\u2014the way Jordana looked at him, so hurt and betrayed\u2014he doubted Gates had anything more to worry about when it came to Nathan\u2019s intentions with her.</p><p>She might never want to speak to him again, would most likely never forgive him for taking her father away from her. She might despise Nathan forever for breaking her heart.</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>He had never deserved her. Their worlds had been too different from the start, and tonight had proven that.</p> <p>Bitter truth, and it didn\u2019t make the cold hollow in his chest ache any less.</p><p>He wanted nothing more than to go to her now and offer comfort, explanations. Reassurances that everything would be all right.</p><p>But as he watched her father protest and begin to squirm under his interrogation, Nathan knew he couldn\u2019t give Jordana any of those things.</p><p>Martin Gates\u2019s guilt was written all over him. He was a man with deep secrets, secrets he\u2019d apparently kept hidden for many years. His darting, anxious gaze said he knew the respectable mask he\u2019d worn for so long was about to be ripped away. Gates had been living a lie that was suddenly about to be exposed.</p><p>And when it was, nothing in Jordana\u2019s life would ever be the same.</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of putting up with this thuggery for a moment longer,\u201d Gates announced, one final, obvious bid to halt the disturbing conversation before it went any further. \u201cI demand you release me at once, or I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr you\u2019ll what, Mr. Gates?\u201d Chase interjected calmly. \u201cGo running to law enforcement? Complain to your Darkhaven cronies and country club colleagues? Or maybe you have other alliances you think you can lean on. The kind of alliances you and Cassian Gray thought you could keep in the shadows, along with your other less-than-respectable business dealings?\u201d</p><p>Gates\u2019s expression went slack. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Chase stared at him in dangerous silence. Gates endured the prolonged quiet for a few moments, his gaze flicking from Chase and Nathan standing before him to Jax, Eli, and Rafe positioned near the door of the interrogation room.</p><p>Abruptly, he bit off a curse and vaulted to his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t have to sit here and listen to this bullshit. I\u2019m leaving. You can expect to hear from my lawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nathan took a half pace forward, subtly blocking Gates\u2019s path. There was no need for words or physical persuasion. Gates took one look at the flat intent in Nathan\u2019s eyes and immediately backed down.</p><p>As Gates dropped into his seat again, the last of his bravado fled and he peered up at Nathan, studying him nervously. There was defeat in the male\u2019s face, the kind of look that told of a crushing burden carried for far too long.</p><p>Gates lowered his head. When he spoke, his voice was subdued, reduced to a thready murmur. \u201cHave you known all along, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Cass covered your tracks very well,\u201d Chase answered. \u201cIt took us a while to unravel it all, but you couldn\u2019t hide forever. We know you own La Notte. Cass may have run the place, but the club and all its profits\u2014illegal and otherwise\u2014belong to you. Now we need you to tell us about any other dealings you\u2019ve had with him.\u201d</p> <p>Gates looked up, eyes narrowed. \u201cSince when does the Order have the license to police a citizen\u2019s private or business affairs?\u201d</p><p>Chase wheeled on the vampire with a snarl. \u201cSince the night last week when Opus Nostrum tried to blow up a global peace summit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpus Nostrum,\u201d Gates replied, genuinely taken aback. \u201cAre you saying you suspect that I\u2014or Cassian Gray\u2014had anything to do with that?\u201d</p><p>Chase lifted a shoulder. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard you say you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t. Neither did Cass, I promise you that,\u201d Gates said. Then he exhaled a sigh and leaned back in his seat. \u201cI should hope the Order has better leads on the attack last week than whatever supposed evidence you seem to think you have linking me, or Cassian Gray, to those terrorists of Opus Nostrum.\u201d Gates paused, pointedly cleared his throat. \u201cIf there is nothing further\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not telling us everything.\u201d Nathan approached him, taking in the look of relief on the Darkhaven male\u2019s face. \u201cThe club isn\u2019t the only thing he\u2019s invested in with Cassian Gray. What else are you trying to hide?\u201d</p><p>Gates scoffed. \u201cCassian Gray is my friend. Our business dealings are between us. We may not run in the same social circles, but last time I checked, that wasn\u2019t a crime.\u201d</p><p>Nathan grunted. \u201cDo you have many Atlantean friends?\u201d</p><p>Gates stared, unspeaking for a long moment. \u201cIf you have questions about Cass, maybe you should ask him, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cBut unfortunately, someone took his head last night.\u201d</p><p>Gates\u2019s mouth moved soundlessly. He swallowed then. \u201cWha\u2014what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassian Gray is dead. He was attacked and killed outside La Notte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d Gates\u2019s face went white. \u201cHe worried that he\u2019d risked too much. Stayed in the city too long. He was fearful when I saw him the other day. That didn\u2019t seem like Cass.\u201d</p><p>There was shock in the Breed male\u2019s voice, and true grief as well. He\u2019d lost a friend, and it took him a moment to process what he\u2019d just heard.</p><p>Then a new shock seemed to overtake him. There was an even greater hush to the Darkhaven vampire\u2019s voice. \u201cAh, Christ ... Jordana. I must see Jordana right away. Cass made me promise, should this day ever come ...\u201d</p><p>Nathan exchanged a look with Sterling Chase. \u201cWhat about Jordana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Gates asked, a franticness creeping into his voice. \u201cDammit, I have to get out of here.\u201d Gates rose, his muscles tensing as if he were about to bolt for the door. \u201cI have to talk to Jordana right now. I need to make sure she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Chase stepped in, scowling as he faced Gates. \u201cWhat the hell does any of this have to do with her?\u201d</p><p>The Darkhaven male turned a troubled look on them. \u201cMy God,\u201d he breathed. \u201cYou really had no idea, did you? My friendship with Cass, the business partnership. It was all about her. Jordana is Cassian Gray\u2019s child.\u201d</p><p>23</p><p>JORDANA STOOD IN THE CENTER OF THE MUSEUM LOBBY, PARALYZED, watching in a state of numbed detachment\u2014of staggering, surreal shock\u2014as her father was taken away and the exhibit party abruptly ended, all of her guests scattering in the Order\u2019s wake.</p><p>There were whispers and curious, pitying glances as people hurried out. A few murmured reassurances that it must be some kind of mistake, just a terrible misunderstanding that Martin Gates could have somehow run afoul of Lucan Thorne and his warriors.</p><p>Jordana wanted to believe that.</p><p>She wanted to believe Nathan would come back any moment and tell her it was a joke or a bad dream\u2014anything to alleviate the ragged hurt inside her.</p><p>A hurt that told her this was no mistake.</p><p>Her father hadn\u2019t acted like an innocent man. He\u2019d fought and fumed with a desperation that had made Jordana\u2019s heart quake as she watched Nathan take him away.</p><p>Jordana had never seen him like that before, so terrified and combative. As though he knew he had something awful to hide.</p><p>As for Nathan ... the hurt Jordana felt tonight was all the worse when she thought of him.</p><p>Had she been wrong to get so close to him?</p><p>Could her father have been the reason Nathan had shown any interest in her?</p><p>Nathan told her from the start that he wasn\u2019t the kind of man she might have wanted him to be. He\u2019d told her that as recently as last night.</p><p>By his own description, once locked on a target, he pursued, he conquered. Then he moved on, never looking back.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>Jordana felt physically ill. Had he used her to buy the Order necessary time or opportunity to go after her father?</p><p>Was that all she\u2019d been to Nathan\u2014a means to an end?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t pretended to be anything other than what he said he was: a warrior, a Hunter. Jordana had fallen in love with him anyway.</p><p>Last night she thought she\u2019d seen a different side of him. A tender side, as though he\u2019d let down some of his armor and shown her the wounded, noble man behind the forbidding wall of impenetrable stone and cold, cutting steel he reserved for the rest of the world.</p><p>At the party tonight, and during their stolen passion in her office, Jordana had felt as if she were seeing Nathan in a way no one else ever had. He\u2019d made her feel special, as though she meant something to him.</p><p>As though he might even have loved her too.</p><p>Had it all been a facade meant to lull her into trusting him further?</p><p>Could he and the Order have been plotting to spring some kind of trap for her father with her as the unwitting bait?</p><p>It staggered her to think so.</p><p>Her heart wanted to reject the idea outright, but doubt ran like oil in her veins.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, sweetie?\u201d Carys\u2019s heels clicked lightly on the marble as she came out to the lobby, turning off the museum lights behind her as she approached. \u201cEveryone\u2019s gone now, and I\u2019ve closed up. Come on, let\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jordana numbly shook her head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go home. I want to see my father. I want to see Nathan. I need to know if what happened tonight was his plan all along.\u201d</p><p>Carys\u2019s brows pinched in a mild frown. \u201cJordana, you have to know Nathan would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything anymore,\u201d she replied hotly, hurting so badly she thought her chest might crack open. \u201cI need my father to tell me what he\u2019s done. I need Nathan to tell me that he hasn\u2019t been using me, playing me as part of his mission for the Order. I need to know if the two men I care most about in this world have been lying to me this whole time.\u201d</p><p>When Carys reached out with a touch meant to soothe, Jordana wrenched away from her. \u201cI\u2019m going there now. I can\u2019t stand by another minute without knowing the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordana, wait.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her friend\u2019s plea, she started across the lobby, heading for the exit at a brisk pace.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get far.</p><p>From behind her, Jordana felt a disturbance in the air. Carys sucked in a sharp gasp, then went utterly silent.</p><p>Jordana spun around\u2014just in time to see her friend\u2019s legs crumble beneath her.</p><p>A large, hooded figure dressed in a black trench coat stood over the fallen Breed female. As he released Carys\u2019s limp body to the floor, the man lifted his head, his face obscured in deep shadows.</p><p>He bore no weapon, but his palms were bright with an unearthly glow as he stepped away from Carys to stalk toward Jordana.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>Panic exploding in her breast, she lunged for the exit.</p><p>She pushed the glass door open, inhaling a breath of chill night air as another scream built in her throat.</p><p>No sound left her lips.</p><p>Her feet simply stopped moving. All her fear\u2014all conscious thought\u2014went softly, swiftly silent as her skull filled with sudden heat and light ...</p><p>Then all went dark.</p><p>\u201cCass made me keep his secret,\u201d Martin Gates said, misery in his voice and in the droop of his mouth as he spoke. \u201cHe made me vow she would never know he was her father\u2014not unless the worst should occur and his enemies caught up to him.\u201d</p><p>Nathan had to admit, there was a part of him that wasn\u2019t completely shocked to hear that Jordana\u2019s true father was Cassian Gray. Aside from a passing similarity in their fair coloring, in hindsight Cass\u2019s visit to Jordana at the museum the day of his death had been more telling. Had he gone there because he feared his enemies were closing in, and he wanted to see his child one more time?</p><p>As for the fact of Jordana being the child of an Atlantean father, that in itself was hardly a revelation. Although the truth had been unknown for many centuries, and was still kept secret from the public at large, a couple of decades ago the Order had discovered the link between the Breed and the immortal race that had fathered the rare females born Breedmates.</p><p>\u201cIf Cass wanted to keep her safe from enemies among his own kind,\u201d Nathan said, \u201che would\u2019ve done better to leave Jordana in your care and stay far away from Boston.\u201d</p><p>Gates nodded. \u201cHe tried. And he never stayed in the city more than a few weeks at a time, just in case he might be found out. But Jordana meant everything to him. Cass loved her just as much as I do. I think that\u2019s why he understood when I couldn\u2019t make good on the other part of my original promise to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat promise was that?\u201d Chase interjected, narrowing a hard look on the Darkhaven leader.</p><p>\u201cThat I take Jordana as my mate before her twenty-fifth birthday.\u201d</p><p>Nathan recoiled at the idea, confused and suspicious. \u201cWhy the hell would he ask that of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCass wanted her blood-bonded to someone he trusted. Someone he knew would keep her safe.\u201d Gates gave a slow shake of his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be that man. I raised her as my own child. Jordana was my daughter every bit as much as she was Cass\u2019s. No matter what I promised all those years ago, I couldn\u2019t force my blood onto her. As she got older, I knew I had to safeguard her some other way. I had to find someone else I could trust with her secret.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something still wasn\u2019t making sense. Nathan failed to find the logic in Cass\u2019s plan.</p><p>And deep down, a possessive, protective brand of fury sparked to life in him when he thought of Jordana with any male other than him.</p><p>\u201cWhy not let her choose who she wants to take as her mate? The blood bond is sacred. It\u2019s unbreakable.\u201d Nathan nearly spat the words, recalling how easily Gates would have pushed Jordana onto his crony, Elliott Bentley-Squire. A decent man, maybe, but a man who didn\u2019t love her.</p> <p>Not like Nathan did, fiercely and with his whole heart.</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve locked her into an irrevocable union, all for the sake of a promise made without her consent?\u201d Nathan blew out a violent curse. \u201cJordana is an extraordinary woman. You raised her; you ought to know that. She deserves more than you or anyone else of your choosing could give her as her mate. God knows she sure as hell deserves more than I could ever give her.\u201d</p><p>Gates lifted his chin, understanding flickering across his features. \u201cYou really do love her.\u201d</p><p>Nathan gave a firm nod, his chest heaving with the intensity of everything he felt for Jordana. \u201cI do,\u201d he answered solemnly. \u201cBut even if I didn\u2019t\u2014even if I\u2019d never met her\u2014I would tell you that no Breedmate should be forced into a bond she doesn\u2019t want. Not for any reason.\u201d</p><p>Gates stared at him. \u201cI never said Jordana was a Breedmate.\u201d</p> <p>A sound of disbelief went up, though whether it came from Chase or one of Nathan\u2019s team members in the room, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Nathan could count on one hand the number of times he\u2019d been struck silent for any reason. Never like this. Never with the sense that the floor had opened up beneath him and left him dangling over an abyss of uncharted terrain.</p><p>Chase spoke where Nathan was unable. \u201cWhat do you mean, she\u2019s not a Breedmate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordana\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t human,\u201d Gates said. \u201cShe was one of Cass\u2019s kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying Jordana is fully immortal?\u201d Chase pressed.</p><p>Gates nodded. \u201cShe is Atlantean, as were both her parents.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, Nathan found his voice. \u201cShe has the Breedmate mark.\u201d He could see the small, scarlet-colored teardrop and crescent moon symbol in his mind. He\u2019d stroked it more than once as they\u2019d made love. \u201cIt\u2019s on the inside of Jordana\u2019s left wrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tattoo in the shape of the mark,\u201d Gates clarified. \u201cCass inked it on her himself when she was an infant, soon after he took her out of the Atlantean realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Rafe murmured from his position across the small interrogation room. \u201cWhat for? Why try to pretend she was something other than what she truly was?\u201d</p><p>Nathan knew. \u201cTo hide his child among the Breed,\u201d he said, the pieces beginning to fall into some logical pattern now. \u201cCass wanted to hide Jordana where he thought she\u2019d be safest. In plain sight.\u201d</p><p>Chase looked at Gates narrowly. \u201cHow was he so certain you\u2019d keep his secret, or that you could be trusted with raising his child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d already proven myself to him the night I found Cass hiding with an infant in my barn outside Vancouver. He\u2019d been on the run for days. He was bleeding, gravely wounded, even for an immortal,\u201d Gates explained. \u201cNaturally, the scent of so much blood drew me to the barn. But when he pleaded with me to help him and I saw the baby girl in his arms, I put aside my thirst and allowed him to recuperate in my home.\u201d</p><p>Nathan pictured the scene, imagining what he might have done, had he been in Martin Gates\u2019s place.</p><p>Having been raised not to feel mercy or compassion\u2014to have been conditioned as a Hunter to exploit weakness and punish kindness\u2014Nathan couldn\u2019t deny that he was humbled by Gates\u2019s actions and his honor. He was grateful to the man as well.</p> <p>\u201cCass was fortunate to have ended up in your care. There aren\u2019t many who would\u2019ve been so charitable with their trust.\u201d</p><p>Gates shrugged in mild dismissal of the praise. \u201cI was fortunate too. Back then, I was alone, with no mate or kin of my own. All I had was a meager farm in the middle of nowhere.\u201d Gates\u2019s expression softened in remembrance. \u201cIt\u2019s because of Cass that I live in luxury now. It was his wealth that allowed me to start a new life here in Boston. He made me who I am today. And he gave me the most precious gift of all, my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows nothing of this?\u201d Nathan asked. \u201cJordana has no idea that she\u2019s not a Breedmate but full-blooded Atlantean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But soon enough, she\u2019ll know.\u201d Gates leveled a sober look on Nathan and the other warriors in the room. \u201cWhen Jordana turns twenty-five, her Atlantean powers will mature. In addition to extrasensory gifts a Breedmate might have, she will become stronger both physically and psychically. Her aging will stop, and she\u2019ll be impervious to all but the most severe injuries. She will know that I\u2019ve been deceiving her all along about who she is. But even worse, Cass warned that unless she\u2019s shielded by a blood bond, the enemies who hunted him will now be able to sense her as one of their own kind.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Jordana being pursued by the same killers who caught up with Cass made Nathan\u2019s veins go icy with dread. If he had to take on the entire Atlantean race to protect her, he would. There wasn\u2019t anything he wouldn\u2019t do for her, and if he\u2019d known his blood might keep her safe, he would have already begged her to accept his bond.</p><p>Hell, he wanted that connection to her regardless of anything he\u2019d heard here just now.</p><p>And he could only hope she would let him make it up to her for how things had gone so wrong tonight.</p><p>\u201cShe has to be told.\u201d Nathan pulled out his comm unit and hit Carys\u2019s number. As it started to ring, he stalked for the door. \u201cJordana should have been told all of this long before now.\u201d</p><p>And she needed to be told how he felt about her. That he loved her. That he was sorry if he hurt her tonight. She needed to hear that she was the only woman he would ever want, if she would have him.</p><p>Carys wasn\u2019t picking up.</p><p>The realization seeped into him like acid. Something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Nathan knew it in his marrow.</p><p>He was already bolting into the corridor outside the interrogation room before he heard the rise of panicked female voices carrying from the other end of the long hallway.</p><p>Tavia Chase had her arm around her Breed daughter, Carys staggering alongside her mother. When she saw Nathan heading toward them, Carys let out a ragged sob.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see him until it was too late,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHe did something to my head. Bright light in my skull. Too much power\u2014I couldn\u2019t fight it. I\u2019m so sorry, Nathan. I couldn\u2019t do anything. It just happened so fast.\u201d</p><p>All the blood in Nathan\u2019s body seemed to halt. Froze solid in his veins. \u201cWhere is Jordana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took her.\u201d Carys shook her head weakly, her face wrenched with anguish and worry. \u201cWhen I came to in the museum lobby a few minutes ago, there was no trace of her. Oh, God, Nathan ... Jordana is gone.\u201d</p><p>24</p><p>THE SUDDEN, BRIGHT TWITTER OF A SONGBIRD PIERCED THE FOG of Jordana\u2019s waking senses. A soft, warm breeze blew in from somewhere, carrying the fragrance of a nearby garden\u2014flowers and lemons and rich, fertile earth. Farther away, quiet thunder rolled, its rhythm drawing her out of a deep, dreamless sleep.</p><p>No, not thunder, she realized.</p><p>Waves.</p><p>The sea.</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>With a jolt of alarm, she recalled the dark intruder in the museum. The attack that came out of nowhere. Carys lying motionless on the lobby floor, the hooded man standing over her unconscious body.</p><p>Then a blinding, powerful light exploded inside Jordana\u2019s skull before everything around her went black ...</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Where had he taken her?</p><p>Jordana opened her eyes, expecting to meet the horror of her imprisonment. She expected to feel pain. She braced herself to feel the cold bite of restraints or any number of other abuses dealt to her by her captor.</p><p>But she felt no discomfort. Her limbs moved freely as she gingerly tested her muscles. Nothing but velvety bedding beneath her on a pillowy, decadent mattress.</p><p>And the room she awoke in was nothing remotely close to a prison cell.</p><p>Spacious and inviting, it was elegantly furnished with antiques and the king-size bed she lay in, which was canopied with sumptuous white silk and flanked by a pair of delicate, French Provincial nightstands. Creamy, lacquered millwork festooned every wall; snowy, polished marble covered the floors, luxury that extended into the adjacent palatial bathroom suite.</p><p>Jordana cautiously sat up to better take in her surroundings.</p><p>The place was quiet, all was still, except for the gentle stirring of the airy silk drapes drawn over the open window across from the bed. Where was her abductor?</p><p>Jordana scooted carefully to the edge of the mattress and put her bare feet down on the cool marble. She was still wearing her red dress from the museum event, her high heels placed neatly beside what appeared to be a Louis XV bureau. Atop the expensive piece was a vase full of cheery, fresh-cut flowers. A vase that appeared to be museum-quality Italian porcelain.</p><p>Good Lord, that Renaissance-era painting hanging behind the bouquet couldn\u2019t be an original Raphael, could it?</p><p>She might have been tempted to look closer, but she reminded herself that despite the impressiveness of the place, she had still been taken there against her will.</p><p>By someone who had not only disabled a Breed female with his bare hands but had also knocked out Jordana and apparently spirited her far, far away from everything she knew in Boston.</p><p>Why? What the hell was going on?</p><p>She stood up and took a few hesitant, soundless steps. Peering out toward the larger, equally luxurious living area outside the bedroom, she searched for signs of her abductor.</p><p>She saw no one in that room or elsewhere in the sunny, beautifully appointed villa. Jordana crept closer to the open bedroom door, then into the living room, where the scents of the gardens and ocean beyond were stronger, more enticing.</p><p>French doors stood open onto a terrace patio perched on a high hillside overlooking a craggy, green mountain coastline. Early morning sun-dappled blue water stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Lush vegetation, much of it laden with exotic blooms and large yellow lemons, provided fragrant shade for the large terra cotta patio tiles and a charming little cafe table set with breakfast service for two\u2014complete with crisply pressed white linens and gleaming, polished silverware. Jordana eyed the delicious-looking pastries, fruits, and thin-shaved meats with a frown.</p><p>Was this some kind of joke?</p><p>Or had she been kidnapped by the most gentlemanly psychopath on the planet?</p><p>Jordana spotted him out on the terrace as she ventured a few more paces into the main room of the villa. Every bit as big and tall as she remembered, except now he wasn\u2019t garbed in black or hooded.</p><p>He stood at the railing overlooking the sea beyond, wearing a gauzy linen tunic and loose-fitting linen pants. His back to the villa, he held his arms spread wide, palms turned up. On one of his wrists, he wore a brown leather thong, from which a small silver emblem glinted under the rising sun.</p><p>As she watched, the man tipped his golden blond head back on his shoulders to put his face full in the morning light.</p><p>It was a worshipful pose, a peaceful pose.</p><p>Yet there could be no mistaking the immense power that radiated from every inch and muscle of his body.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>Obviously not Breed either. Not even a daywalker like Carys or her brother, Aric, would risk such intense UV exposure.</p><p>This man seemed to relish it. He seemed to need it.</p><p>Hopefully he was so deep in meditation he wouldn\u2019t notice she\u2019d escaped until she was long gone.</p><p>Jordana turned her attention away from him and took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d The golden man from the terrace now stood directly in front of her.</p><p>A startled cry caught in her throat. Jordana threw a wild glance over her shoulder to the balcony outside, just to confirm what she was seeing.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there anymore.</p><p>No, he\u2019d vanished from his position several dozen feet away and had materialized barely an inch from where she stood. Shoulder-length blond hair shot with burnished shades of copper haloed a face blessed with perfect angles, flawless bronzed skin, and arresting, tropical blue eyes.</p><p>So the psycho who kidnapped her was not only gentlemanly and an art connoisseur but gorgeous besides. That didn\u2019t make him any less of a threat.</p><p>He reached for her, and Jordana screamed in earnest now. Fear and fury swelled inside her like a rising fire until it exploded out of her on a sharp, terrified yell. At the same time, she gave her abductor\u2019s massive body a hard shove and tried to dodge left to get around him.</p><p>To her amazement, he stumbled backward half a pace before righting himself and catching her around her upper arms. He actually seemed pleased.</p><p>\u201cImpressive. Your powers are still young, of course, but they\u2019re already strong. They\u2019re manifesting quickly now.\u201d</p><p>Jordana\u2019s hands tingled with the pricks of a thousand tiny needles. She\u2019d felt the odd sensation before\u2014most recently while making love with Nathan, a memory, and a longing, that made her heart ache sharply in her breast.</p><p>Now she glanced down at her palms and was astonished to find them imbued with warm, glowing light. Faint, but unmistakable.</p><p>And not a little disturbing.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she gasped at her captor. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Who are you? What have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He let go of her and gave a mild shake of his head. \u201cI\u2019m scaring you. I\u2019m sorry, Jordana.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d Her panic climbed. \u201cWhere are we? What is this place? How the hell did you get me here? What did you do to my friend Carys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many questions,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable. Your friend is fine, I didn\u2019t harm her. I won\u2019t harm you either. I only wish to help. That\u2019s why your father called me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father?\u201d She hardly dared hope he was telling her the truth, but it was all she had. \u201cWhen did you talk to him? Did the Order let him go? I want to see him, right now. Please. You must take me to him.\u201d</p> <p>As her words spilled out of her, the golden man looked at her in sympathetic, gentle silence. \u201cI wish there had been an easier way to explain all of this to you. There wasn\u2019t time. If I hadn\u2019t taken you out of Boston, they would\u2019ve gotten to you first. They were already closing in on you, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Who was after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s enemies. The soldiers who once served under his command\u2014as I did, a very long time ago. I was your father\u2019s friend. My name is Ekizael.\u201d</p><p>Jordana shook her head. This guy may look like a fallen angel, but he was obviously very disturbed. \u201cLook, Eh-kee-zayel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZael,\u201d he said, offering her a courtly bow of his head.</p> <p>She stared at him. \u201cWhoever you are, you don\u2019t know my father. His name is Martin Gates. He\u2019s a businessman. A Darkhaven leader. He was never a soldier and he doesn\u2019t have any enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jordana,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the Breed male who raised you. Your true father was a royal guard. He was once the most decorated warrior in the queen\u2019s legion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe queen\u2019s legion? Oh, right, of course.\u201d She couldn\u2019t bite back the small, nearly hysterical laugh that bubbled up from her throat. \u201cAnd which one would that be\u2014the Queen of England or the Queen of Sheba?\u201d The golden man\u2014Zael, she mentally amended\u2014remained sober, utterly serious. \u201cHer name is Selene. She\u2019s been my people\u2019s queen for many thousands of years. Your people, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to scoff at this insane statement too, but as her captor spoke, his hands began to emit the same soft light that hers had just a moment ago.</p><p>Even more unsettling, in the center of his broad palms glowed a symbol she recognized all too well: the teardrop-and-crescent-moon mark she bore on the underside of her left wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou have the Breedmate mark,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. How can you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is our symbol, Jordana. The symbol of the Atlantean race. The one on your wrist was put there as a decoy. Your father hoped the tattoo would help you fit in among the Breed and the halfling daughters of our kind born outside our realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born with this mark,\u201d she argued. \u201cThe same as any other Breedmate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You, Jordana, are something different from them.\u201d Zael\u2019s deep voice was unnervingly rational as he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re no halfling, not even close. You are full immortal. A pureblood Atlantean.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her symbol with fresh eyes, realizing only now that it might not be a birthmark after all, but crimson ink embedded meticulously under her skin.</p><p>Confusion swirled inside her. She wanted to deny what she was seeing\u2014she wanted to deny everything she was hearing\u2014but the evidence was too compelling to dismiss.</p><p>She already lived in a world where vampires and humans coexisted. Why did it terrify her so deeply to think she might be something other too?</p><p>Because it would mean accepting the fact that her entire life had been a lie.</p><p>\u201cDid he know all of this? Martin Gates, I mean. Does he know?\u201d</p> <p>Zael gave a mild nod. \u201cHe agreed to raise you and keep you safe as his child, as a Breedmate. For your protection, you were never to be told that you were different. Cass trusted him with that secret implicitly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCass,\u201d Jordana whispered, her breath drying up in her lungs. \u201cCassian Gray.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as the realization sank in, a wave of shock washing over her. Then sorrow, when she recalled Cass\u2019s strange visit to the museum.</p><p>The enjoyable, far-too-brief time she\u2019d spent talking with him. And the unthinkable way he died, just a short while later.</p><p>\u201cHis true name was Cassianus,\u201d Zael said. \u201cHe adopted a simpler one\u2014an entirely new identity as well\u2014to help him blend in with the mortal world after he left the Atlantean realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where we are now?\u201d Her new reality settling over her, she glanced out at the breathtaking coastal paradise beyond the open French doors and couldn\u2019t help but wonder ... \u201cIs this Atlantis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Chuckling quietly, Zael lowered his head. \u201cAtlantis was destroyed long ago by our oldest enemies, the Ancient fathers of the Breed. There are some similarities between this place and Atlantis, but this is Amalfi, on the coast of Italy. This villa was a private sanctuary of Cass\u2019s for a long time, although it\u2019s been many years since he was last here.\u201d</p><p>Jordana could hardly speak. She glanced around at the sophisticated villa with its priceless antiques and masterpiece paintings. At least that part made sense now: Cass\u2019s unexpected, uncanny knowledge of art. He had apparently loved it as much as she did.</p><p>Cassian Gray was her father.</p><p>The news staggered her, perhaps even more so than any of Zael\u2019s other incredible revelations. To say nothing of the fact that she was hearing all of this not in the comfort of her home in Boston but evidently a continent away, and from the mouth of a man who\u2019d brought her there through means she still hadn\u2019t determined and was almost afraid to guess at.</p><p>Her head spun with a hundred questions\u2014so many, she wasn\u2019t sure where to start.</p><p>\u201cYou said Cass had enemies,\u201d she murmured. \u201cSoldiers from the queen\u2019s legion who are also after me. You mean Atlantean soldiers. That\u2019s who killed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zael\u2019s face was grim. \u201cTheir method left little doubt. They had been pursuing him for a long time on Selene\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jordana struggled to keep the memory of the savagery from forming in her mind. \u201cWhat did he do to her that she would hate him enough to want him killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor starters, he fell in love with a member of her court. It was forbidden, even for a legion soldier of Cassianus\u2019s renown. But Soraya loved him too,\u201d Zael explained. \u201cFor a while, they carried on in secret, meeting anywhere they could. They even risked time together outside the realm, coming here, to this villa.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take much for Jordana to imagine loving someone in defiance of what anyone else wished or expected. When it came to love, she\u2019d learned firsthand that the heart gave itself freely, openly, completely.</p><p>Sometimes foolishly.</p><p>She met Zael\u2019s solemn look and knew the story he was telling her would not end well for the forbidden lovers.</p><p>\u201cSo, Cassianus and Soraya ... they were my parents?\u201d At his grave nod, she had to ask the other question that sat like a jagged pill on her tongue. \u201cWhat happened to my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died,\u201d Zael said. \u201cSoraya had you in secret, here in this villa. Cass thought the three of you could be a family together, stay on the run, never go back to the realm. But Raya missed the Atlantean way of life. She missed her home. To please her, Cass returned with Raya and you. Selene was furious. She called for his immediate execution. Raya pleaded for mercy. Selene finally granted it, but at a price.\u201d</p><p>Jordana listened, rapt yet heartsick for what her parents had endured. \u201cWhat did the queen ask in exchange for Cass\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made Raya agree to take a mate of Selene\u2019s choosing and exile with you until you turned twenty-five and your powers came of age. Once that occurred, Raya would be free to return, and you were to take your place as a member of the royal court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Soraya didn\u2019t accept the queen\u2019s terms?\u201d Jordana guessed.</p><p>If she had, Jordana would have never been raised as Martin Gates\u2019s daughter.</p><p>She would have never met Nathan.</p><p>As much as it hurt to think she\u2019d meant nothing to him, the thought of having never known his touch, or his kiss, or the pleasure they shared, was too bleak to imagine.</p><p>Zael shook his head, his voice low. \u201cRaya could not promise to give herself to another man. She begged for a different punishment, but Selene would not be swayed. Finally, on the day Raya and you were to leave the court for your new home, she took a drastic, irrevocable step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jordana whispered, her heart in her throat.</p><p>\u201cRaya put you in the palace nursery. Then she went to her chambers, locked herself in, and set the place ablaze. By the time the fire was discovered, it was too late. Even an immortal could not heal from the wounds Raya inflicted on herself.\u201d</p><p>Jordana choked on a ragged breath. \u201cAnd Cassianus? What did he do?\u201d</p><p>Zael smiled sadly, proudly. \u201cHe did what any loving parent would do. Risked everything to take you away from there and ensure that you had a new life\u2014a better life. One where Selene\u2019s guards wouldn\u2019t find you. Cass wanted you to have a life of your own choosing.\u201d</p><p>Except the irony was, as good as her life had been living with Martin Gates as his child, it hadn\u2019t been authentic. She\u2019d lived under the cloak of secrets and half-truths, never really knowing who\u2014or what\u2014she was. She\u2019d never been given the chance to know the two people who brought her into the world and gave up everything, including their lives, because of her.</p><p>Two people she missed keenly now, despite having had them in her life so briefly.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she do it?\u201d Jordana murmured. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t the queen just let them be happy together? Why chase Cass down and kill him after all this time? Why keep her guards searching for me?\u201d</p><p>Zael\u2019s tropical blue eyes were steady on her. \u201cBecause Soraya was her only child.\u201d</p><p>Jordana went still. She shook her head slowly, at a complete and sudden loss for words.</p><p>When she couldn\u2019t speak, Zael did it for her. \u201cYou, Jordana, are Selene\u2019s granddaughter. You are her only living heir to the Atlantean throne.\u201d</p><p>25</p><p>IN THE HOUR FOLLOWING CARYS\u2019S ARRIVAL, THE BOSTON COMMAND center buzzed with sober conversation and urgent preparation for a do-or-die sweep of the city.</p><p>Gathered in the weapons room along with Nathan, Rafe and Eli and Jax rehashed the team\u2019s game plan for turning the city upside down in their search for the Atlantean bastard who had Jordana. In the corridor outside the war room, Sterling Chase and his mate, Tavia, were attempting to reassure a shattered, sobbing Martin Gates that the Order would do everything in its power to find Jordana quickly and bring her back, safe and sound.</p><p>Nathan had no words for anyone. He had no energy to expend on talking or hoping or wishing. He had no patience for consolation or promises that morning wouldn\u2019t be allowed to break without Jordana returned home.</p><p>All he had was his determination, his ruthless discipline.</p><p>With robotic efficiency, Nathan suited up in his patrol gear. In utter silence\u2014with deadly calm purpose\u2014he zipped and cinched, buckled and tied his black fatigues and combat boots, then strapped on his weapons belt and holsters for multiple firearms.</p><p>He would find Jordana.</p><p>There would be no failing that mission.</p><p>There would be no failing her, not ever again.</p><p>He had never been more committed to any goal in all his life. Jordana was all that mattered to him. If she were found harmed\u2014if the man who took her tonight inflicted even the smallest pain on her\u2014Nathan would eviscerate the son of a bitch.</p><p>Slowly.</p><p>He knew countless ways to kill, incrementally when necessary. If Jordana was hurt in any way, her abductor was going to suffer the full, merciless force of Nathan\u2019s wrath.</p><p>He readied the last of his weapons and threw a hard look on his team. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Leading the way, he stalked out to the corridor with Rafe, Jax, and Eli.</p><p>They were halfway up the winding hallway when Carys came rushing around a corner, her face stricken and grave. She clutched her comm unit in a white-knuckled grasp. \u201cNathan, wait. Something\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>The female\u2019s fearful voice just about stopped his heart. He was almost afraid to guess at this new, obviously bad news. \u201cJordana?\u201d</p><p>Carys shook her head. \u201cThere was an attack at La Notte a few minutes ago. Syn\u2019s been killed. Rune wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Normally, the death of a Breed cage fighter would be the last of the Order\u2019s concern. And neither Syn nor Rune had many friends among the warriors. But this was a night unlike any other, and a deadly attack on Cassian Gray\u2019s club within hours of Jordana having gone missing was far from coincidental.</p><p>Without slowing down, Nathan grabbed the comm unit and put it to his ear. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanna know.\u201d Rune\u2019s breath was tight, shallow. His deep, growling voice held an edge of wariness that Nathan had never heard before. \u201cWe just took a bad hit down here at the club. Couple of thugs tossed Cass\u2019s office. They fucking killed Syn, broke every bone in his body.\u201d</p><p>Like Rune, Syn was a proven champion in the cages. It would take a hell of an opponent to knock him down. \u201cYou see who did it?\u201d Almost too much to hope.</p><p>Rune grunted. \u201cYeah, I saw them. Heard a ruckus in the office above the arena, then I smelled blood. Lots of blood. Found three men tearing the place up. Syn was already in bad shape, no more fight left in him. I dropped one of the bastards, but the other two got away.\u201d Rune paused. \u201cThe one I killed? He didn\u2019t go down easy, man. Not until I took his fucking head from his shoulders. Then the whole damn place lit up with the glow he threw off as he died. Sure as hell wasn\u2019t human, but he wasn\u2019t Breed either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, Nathan thought, grave with understanding. They were Atlanteans.</p><p>\u201cAny idea what they were looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rune replied. \u201cWhen I found the fuckers hammering on Syn, they kept demanding that he tell them where Cass\u2019s daughter was.\u201d</p> <p>Nathan cursed and drew up short in the corridor.</p><p>\u201cSyn kept telling them Cass didn\u2019t have any family, but they wouldn\u2019t believe him.\u201d</p><p>Nathan stood there, frozen, his mind racing to process everything he was hearing. \u201cThis just happened, you say? These men\u2014they were there just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Rune said. \u201cThe corpse of the one I killed is still warm.\u201d</p><p>Rafe drew up next to Nathan, the blond warrior frowning in question. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain they were looking for Cass\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead certain.\u201d The fighter was quiet for a moment, menace radiating through the comm. \u201cCarys just told me what happened to her and Jordana a little while ago. Goddamn it, Nathan. I\u2019m sorry about Jordana. And I hate like hell that Syn is gone. But these fucks\u2014whoever, whatever, they are\u2014put their hands on my woman tonight. This shit just got personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Nathan replied grimly.</p><p>With a murmured end to the conversation, he handed the comm unit back to Carys. She pivoted away, speaking to her lover in hushed, private tones.</p><p>Outside the war room, Nathan and his team were joined by Sterling Chase and Tavia, their expressions indicating they knew the weight of the information he\u2019d just received.</p><p>Martin Gates drifted over too. \u201cWhat is it? Has there been news about Jordana?\u201d</p> <p>Nathan glanced grimly from his commander and teammates to Jordana\u2019s distraught father. \u201cThree men just broke into Cass\u2019s office at La Notte. They killed one of the fighters. Rune said they\u2019re looking for Jordana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtlanteans,\u201d Gates murmured woodenly.</p><p>Nathan gave a sober nod but turned a look on Chase and the other warriors. \u201cSo, if Cass\u2019s enemies don\u2019t already have Jordana ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who took her?\u201d Tavia asked.</p><p>Nathan glanced back at Gates. \u201cWas there anyone else Cass might have trusted to know about Jordana living in Boston? One of his own kind?\u201d</p><p>Martin Gates considered for a moment, then gave a shaky nod. \u201cYes, there is one other person who knew. Oh, my God. Dare I hope she\u2019s with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may be all we\u2019ve got,\u201d Chase replied.</p><p>Gates met Nathan\u2019s unblinking stare. \u201cIf she\u2019s been taken somewhere safe, I believe I know where you\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p> <p>Jordana wiped some of the steam from her shower off the large mirror in the villa\u2019s master bathroom suite. She stared at her reflection for a moment, trying to understand how the pale blue eyes and familiar face looking back at her could feel so much a stranger now.</p><p>It had been only a few hours since her conversation that morning with Zael. A few hours since everything she thought she knew about herself had been peeled away.</p><p>Now, with the sun soon to set outside the villa where she\u2019d been born, Jordana was looking at a new face. A new reality.</p><p>She was Atlantean.</p><p>Immortal.</p><p>The orphaned granddaughter of the race\u2019s vengeful queen.</p><p>It all felt so foreign to her, so incredible. And yet it also seemed as if the missing pieces of a puzzle had finally dropped into place. Her restlessness, her sense that she\u2019d been sleepwalking through her own existence, living someone else\u2019s vision for what her life was supposed to be.</p><p>Because she hadn\u2019t been living her own life. She\u2019d been living a fantasy conjured for her protection by parents she would never know and by a beloved adoptive father who\u2019d sacrificed the past twenty-five years to the promise he\u2019d made to keep her safe. To keep her hidden from enemies she\u2019d never even realized had existed.</p><p>Enemies who were seeking her out even now.</p><p>After the initial shock of it all had worn off a bit, Zael had done his best to explain to her about his people\u2014their people\u2014and about Cassianus and Soraya and the Atlantean realm. He\u2019d been patient and kind, forthcoming with everything she wanted to know. But she still had so many questions.</p><p>In particular, how long before she could get back home to Boston and resume her life.</p><p>Refreshed from sleep and a long shower, and dressed in comfortable, soft white linen palazzo pants and a sleeveless tank of the same fabric, Jordana braided her damp hair and let the long plait fall down the center of her back.</p><p>She heard Zael in the villa\u2019s kitchen, the aromas of roasting meat, wine and spices, and warm, baked breads wafting through the place. The dinner smelled wonderful, but her stomach seemed to have other ideas. It rolled and twisted, making each step a delicate, careful effort.</p><p>Her veins seemed charged with a low-level current. Her palms felt prickly and warm again, the way they sometimes had when she was making love with Nathan, only more intense now. More persistently heated and tingling.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Zael asked as she entered the open-concept gourmet kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThe rest and the shower were just what I needed, but now I\u2019m kind of woozy.\u201d Her knees started to buckle beneath her, as wobbly as a new fawn\u2019s.</p><p>In an instant, Zael came around and helped her to one of the tall counter stools at the center island. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>She gave a weak nod, then crossed her arms on the snowy marble countertop and laid her head down. No doubt she had to look more than a little green around the gills. \u201cSome immortal princess I make, huh?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s par for the course. We all go through this\u2014call them Atlantean growing pains. Your system will mature and stabilize after you turn twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s next week.\u201d Zael nodded and she took the glass of water he handed her. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me then?\u201d</p><p>She sat up and sipped the water while he went back to chopping and saut\u00e9ing a pan of fresh vegetables. \u201cYour body stops aging completely. You\u2019ll become stronger, your senses keener. You\u2019ll be able to tap into an energy that connects all of our people\u2014you\u2019ve already experienced that when I frightened you earlier and you used your power to push me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hands were glowing,\u201d Jordana said as she glanced down at her palms, which still tingled but held no light. \u201cYours glowed too, but I could also see the teardrop-and-crescent-moon symbol in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYour symbol will manifest eventually too. As a member of the royal bloodline, it will happen sooner for you than most. Others of our kind have to be much older before the symbol appears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a bulky shoulder. \u201cA hundred years, give or take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder than that,\u201d he replied, his mouth quirked in a grin.</p><p>She shook her head, unable to believe the youthful, golden man could be even a day out of his twenties. \u201cHow old can you\u2014or any of us\u2014get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtlanteans don\u2019t keep count of years the way humans do, or even the Breed. We can live for many millennia, and have. Selene herself is one of the longest lived of our kind. When we mature, we develop the ability to heal from within, and nothing but catastrophic injury can kill one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike beheading,\u201d Jordana murmured quietly. \u201cOr self-immolation.\u201d</p><p>Zael gave a sober nod.</p><p>\u201cWould he ever have told me? Would Cass ever have explained any of this to me\u2014who I was, who he was ... who my mother was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zael replied gently. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have. You have to understand, he did what he thought was right for you. He manufactured a completely new identity in Boston, an unsavory facade meant to keep him under Selene\u2019s radar. He was a soldier; he wasn\u2019t afraid of dark work. But he never would\u2019ve wanted that part of his life to brush up too closely against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying La Notte was just a front for him?\u201d</p><p>Zael inclined his head. \u201cA lucrative one, but yes. The club provided a deep cover for Cassianus in Boston. As for you, he thought you\u2019d have a better life outside the Atlantean realm, in this world. He thought you could blend in if you were brought up as a Breedmate. Cass felt you\u2019d be safest if he hid you in plain sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could my secret stay hidden from everyone? How could it stay hidden from me?\u201d She thought about the energy she felt coursing through her, building in her, even now. \u201cI would\u2019ve known I was different. I\u2019ve had a feeling all my life that something about me was different, that some piece of me was missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zael said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Cass wanted you blood-bonded to one of the Breed before the age of twenty-five. A bond would have eased the changes in you. It would\u2019ve explained your lack of aging. Most important, it would\u2019ve shielded you from Selene\u2019s legion by making your energy harder for our kind to detect.\u201d</p><p>Jordana considered the certainty she heard in the immortal\u2019s voice. \u201cYou say that as if it\u2019s proven fact. Has it been done before\u2014an Atlantean mating with one of the Breed?\u201d</p><p>Zael nodded. \u201cThere have been pairings between our races over time. But they\u2019re rare, and the blood-bonded couples living their secret are known only to a chosen, trusted few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why my father\u2014Martin Gates\u2014tried so desperately to match me up with someone.\u201d</p><p>Zael gave an affirmative dip on his head. \u201cHe and Cass had agreed that you would be blood-bonded before your twenty-fifth year.\u201d</p><p>She sat back in her seat on a long, heavy sigh. \u201cIt staggers me to think of all the promises made with me in mind, all the sacrifices. And I understand it was all done out of love\u2014the purest kind of love, that of parents wanting the best for a child.\u201d Jordana met Zael\u2019s gaze across the kitchen. \u201cBut when everyone was coming up with these promises, all these secret plans, there was one thing they all overlooked. It was my life they were manipulating, my future. It was my heart.\u201d</p><p>They would have locked her into a bond with someone she didn\u2019t desire and would never love.</p><p>Not the way she wanted Nathan.</p><p>Not the way she loved him.</p><p>There was a heartbroken, desperate part of her that hoped this was all just a dream and she might wake up and discover she was still in Boston. That none of this was real.</p><p>She closed her eyes, wishing that when she opened them she would find herself curled up next to Nathan in her bed.</p><p>If she sent up a silent, pleading prayer, could this all turn out to be just some cosmic mistake? Maybe the exhibit opening hadn\u2019t yet occurred, and she hadn\u2019t felt her whole world crumble as Nathan stoically, mercilessly led her father away like a criminal.</p><p>Maybe Nathan hadn\u2019t simply seduced her as a means of closing in on her father.</p><p>Maybe she had actually meant something more to him.</p><p>Maybe he really did want her, love her, even just a little.</p><p>And maybe the only dreaming or wishing she was doing was in trying to shape Nathan into someone he would never be.</p><p>He\u2019d warned her away from him, but fool that she was, she hadn\u2019t listened. He\u2019d been the wild, dangerous storm she feared\u2014the one she\u2019d leapt into from atop her high ledge, knowing full well she might get tossed onto the rocks below.</p><p>Now, with her heart lying in broken pieces on the ground, she could only blame herself for jumping off.</p><p>Zael was staring at her. Studying her in thoughtful silence. \u201cWho is he?\u201d She glanced down, shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it matters anymore. Not to him, anyway.\u201d But thinking about Nathan and the way things had ended renewed her concern for her father. \u201cI need to get back home now. It\u2019s very important. Last night the Order arrested my father, and I\u2014\u201d She paused to think, suddenly unsure. \u201cWas it last night? How long have we been gone? And exactly how did we get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took you from Boston last night, around nine in the evening,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone from there not quite fifteen hours now.\u201d As she worked to make sense of how that could possibly be, considering travel distance and time zone differences, Zael gently cleared his throat. \u201cAs for how we got here ...\u201d</p><p>He held up his wrist, the one with the leather thong and the silver emblem dangling from it. Jordana saw now that the emblem was in the shape of the Breedmate\u2014or, rather, the Atlantean\u2014symbol.</p><p>And the charm wasn\u2019t made of silver at all but an unusual crystal that somewhat resembled mercury glass.</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crystal this is made from is an energy source belonging to our people. It generates power, provides protection ... it\u2019s useful for many things, both good and bad. It also allows our kind to travel great distances, or small ones, in the blink of an eye.\u201d</p><p>Jordana gaped. \u201cAre you saying this bracelet brought us here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will take us anywhere, so long as the place can be imagined accurately in the traveler\u2019s mind.\u201d Zael\u2019s voice became more serious now. \u201cIt can take you to asylum, Jordana. Somewhere Selene and her soldiers will never find you. There are others living in exile from the realm, some for many hundreds of years. Cass wanted me to offer that choice to you, should the worst occur and the legion finally caught up to him. That\u2019s why he summoned me. He wanted me to give you the option to escape to a protected colony with those of your own kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave Boston?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou mean here and now. You mean forever.\u201d</p><p>He gave a grim nod. \u201cFor obvious reasons, you could tell no one about this. For the safety of all, no one in the colony is permitted to leave. No outsiders are allowed in, except in the most extreme of circumstances, like my mission to contact you. This would be a permanent decision. And one you don\u2019t have much time to make. With your powers manifesting already, every minute we spend here risks your being located by the queen\u2019s guards.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was tempting to think there was somewhere she could go. It was a relief to think there was a place for her to get away from the kind of enemies who had killed Cass and were now on the hunt for her.</p><p>A place where she could be with others of her kind\u2014her true kind. Somewhere she wouldn\u2019t have to hide who and what she was. Where her very existence wouldn\u2019t jeopardize the lives of the people who loved her and wanted to protect her.</p><p>Selfishly, there was a part of her that craved the asylum Zael described.</p> <p>But could she really go without even a word of good-bye?</p><p>Could she leave her father? Could she leave Carys or her other friends? Could she abandon the job she adored and the colleagues and community she\u2019d worked with for years?</p><p>And what about Nathan?

You\u2019re asking me to walk away from the only home I\u2019ve ever known. To never see the people I love most in this world ever again. Is my safety worth that? Is anything worth all of that?\u201d</p><p>Zael\u2019s handsome face was solemn, a dark, private pain swirling in the depths of his Caribbean blue eyes. \u201cI will need your answer soon. If we mean to leave before you\u2019re discovered, we must do it tonight. Make no mistake, Selene\u2019s soldiers will come for you here. It\u2019s not a question of if, Jordana, but when.\u201d</p><p>26</p><p>NATHAN SAT BEHIND A PANE OF UV-BLOCKING GLASS IN THE BACKSEAT of a dark sedan that idled in the dusk on a narrow street in the coastal village of Amalfi. The driver, Salvatore, was human, a discreet, proven ally, hired to meet Nathan\u2019s flight earlier that afternoon by the Order\u2019s district commander in Rome, Lazaro Archer.</p> <p>Nathan had been airborne from Boston within three hours of Jordana\u2019s disappearance. The fly time on the Order\u2019s private jet and the wait for sundown once he arrived in Italy had been maddening. Each second had crawled by in agonizing slowness. He wasn\u2019t sure how he would have endured any of it if Martin Gates hadn\u2019t been certain Jordana was in friendly hands, in a place that had once been a private sanctuary for Cass.</p><p>Knowing that Jordana was in any other man\u2019s hands, particularly those of an Atlantean, hadn\u2019t made the delay in reaching her any less torturous.</p><p>Now, finally, Nathan found himself looking up the steep, tree-choked hillside, to the secluded villa perched high above the serpentine little street.</p><p>He opened the door and got out. A quiet rap on the roof of the car sent Salvatore on his way back down the road. Nathan had no idea what he was walking into, and he and Lazaro Archer agreed that discreet or not, the farther they kept humans out of Order business, the better.</p><p>That went double when it came to Order business involving the race of immortals who were evidently hunting down and slaying their own kind while purportedly plotting war against the Breed and humans both.</p><p>A race of immortals that claimed Jordana as one of their own.</p><p>Part of him still couldn\u2019t reconcile the idea that she belonged to a different people, a different world. He\u2019d felt from the beginning that she deserved someone better, more worthy of her. That she was destined for greater things than he could ever hope to offer her. He just hadn\u2019t realized how true his sense would actually turn out to be.</p><p>Movement on the terrace patio high above him drew his attention up to the villa.</p> <p>As if conjured by his thoughts, Jordana appeared at the railing overlooking the hillside and coast below. Relief poured over him the instant he saw her.</p><p>She was safe.</p><p>Thank God, she was safe.</p><p>And she was more beautiful than ever, the sight of her so welcome he could hardly breathe for the way his heart was jackhammering in his chest.</p><p>Nathan stood motionless, arrested by the sight of her in the indigo wash of evening.</p><p>She looked different to him tonight. Changed, somehow. Stronger, more vibrant.</p><p>She wore a loose, white linen tank and gauzy pants, simple clothing that couldn\u2019t quite hide the enticing curves and lean, graceful lines of Jordana\u2019s body. Her long, platinum blond hair was gathered off her delicate face and braided in a thick rope that snaked down her spine.</p><p>Willowy and ethereal, she glowed as pale as moonlight and as breathtaking as a goddess.</p><p>Fitting, he thought, that she should look so enchanting, like a being from another realm.</p><p>As for Nathan, he had never felt more out of place than he did just then, staring up at her from the shadows in his warrior\u2019s gear, bristling with all the ugly, brutal weapons of his trade.</p><p>He\u2019d come to find her, to bring her home. He\u2019d come to tell her what she meant to him, to say the things he should have told her when he\u2019d had the chance\u2014before everything went so wrong last night.</p><p>He\u2019d come to rescue her on behalf of her father and the Order, but in his heart, he knew he\u2019d come here with the hope he\u2019d bring Jordana home as his mate.</p><p>Now he had to wonder if she wasn\u2019t already on the path that she truly belonged on.</p><p>Not certain how he would be received, or even if she would want to see him again, Nathan took a step out of the gloom on the street. He lifted his hand, about to call out to her and let her know he was there.</p><p>Before he could speak, a man walked up beside her on the terrace balcony. Nathan\u2019s chest went hot and tight at the tender smile and nod Jordana gave this stranger. Tall, golden-haired, too handsome to be merely mortal, the man wrapped a protective arm around Jordana\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Then her Atlantean guardian gently guided her away from the railing, and the two of them disappeared inside the villa.</p><p>Jordana rubbed a sudden chill from her bare arms as she reluctantly walked back inside the villa with Zael. She didn\u2019t want to leave the terrace, or the warm night air that had drawn her out to the railing while Zael was serving the dinner he\u2019d prepared.</p><p>She\u2019d gone outside for answers, for comfort.</p><p>For some much-needed space to think about the choice she\u2019d made a short while ago.</p><p>She would be leaving with Zael soon. Whether she was making the best decision, or one that she would eventually regret for the rest of her life\u2014forever, in that case\u2014Jordana couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Whatever she chose, Zael had made it clear there could be no reversing it. Once she left the villa with him, her course would be set and final.</p><p>\u201cWine or water with your coq au vin?\u201d he asked, waiting politely as she took her seat at the table. The meal smelled delicious, and looked even more incredible.</p><p>Not that she was hungry in the least.</p><p>\u201cWater, please.\u201d Her head was still a little woozy, and the electrical buzz that had been with her all day was only intensifying. She put her prickly hands on her lap under the table and tried to ignore the warm tingling of her palms. \u201cHow soon will we be going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re ready.\u201d Zael retrieved a bottle of San Pellegrino and poured some in her glass. He gave her a sober look that said she hadn\u2019t fooled him by trying to hide that the power within her was getting stronger by the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to change your mind. But we don\u2019t have long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m making the right choice?\u201d</p><p>Zael\u2019s expression was mild, deliberately neutral. \u201cOnly you can answer that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and took a sip of the sparkling water. Zael seated himself across from her at the dining table, then attacked his culinary masterpiece with abandon.</p><p>He seemed relaxed, confident, and unrushed, but Jordana hadn\u2019t missed the fact that at some point that day, he\u2019d acquired a slender, gleaming sword from somewhere in the villa.</p><p>The long blade leaned against the table at his right, easily within his reach.</p><p>It didn\u2019t look like any other kind of blade she\u2019d seen before. The steel was inscribed with some kind of ancient-looking lettering and symbols. And the pommel bore the symbol Jordana now recognized as the Atlantean mark.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really think you\u2019ll need that, do you?\u201d</p><p>Zael lifted one bulky shoulder as he shoveled another mouthful of food to his mouth. The corner of his lips quirked with unrepentant male pride. \u201cIf I do, don\u2019t worry. I know how to use it.\u201d</p><p>As he finished speaking, the joviality faded from his eyes. He dropped his fork, face turning lethal in an instant.</p><p>Jordana glanced behind her to the open French doors to the terrace. A man stood there, dark and grim in his black combat fatigues. Shock and disbelief\u2014along with a piercing, desperate hope\u2014sprang to life inside her.</p><p>She pivoted and started to rise. \u201cNathan?\u201d</p><p>She had barely gasped his name before Zael was in motion.</p><p>One second, he was seated across from her at the table; the next, gone and materialized again to stand in front of her like a full-body shield. He held his Atlantean sword in a defensive angle in front of them, poised to kill.</p><p>While Zael squared off at Nathan, Nathan stood unarmed, all of his weapons holstered and sheathed, his hands held loosely at his sides.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She put her palms briefly on the Atlantean male\u2019s shoulders, her eyes locked on Nathan in tentative, uneasy question. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Zael. Nathan is my ... he\u2019s with the Order.\u201d</p><p>The tension in Zael\u2019s big body relaxed only slightly. He didn\u2019t lower his blade, but he didn\u2019t move to attack either.</p><p>Nathan said nothing, his thundercloud eyes moving away from Jordana\u2019s protector to her, standing behind Zael. His gaze was unreadable in the shadows of the terrace patio. His face remained impassive, emotionless and schooled.</p><p>More than anything, Jordana wanted to move around Zael and rush into Nathan\u2019s arms.</p><p>Instead, she stayed the impulse, terrified of his rejection. And she was still too wounded by the way things had ended between them last night to risk another heartbreak.</p><p>In the heavy silence, Zael took a step away from Jordana. The look he turned on her said he understood that Nathan was the man she\u2019d been thinking of earlier today. The man she\u2019d been longing for when she spoke of the way few had considered how she wanted to live her life or where her heart might be the happiest.</p><p>Zael\u2019s wise, ageless gaze said he recognized that this was the man she loved.</p><p>He gave her a faint, almost reverent, bow of his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll want some privacy, no doubt. I\u2019ll be just in the other room, if there is anything you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jordana murmured. As relieved and hopeful as she was to see Nathan standing there, she was afraid of what she might hear. Afraid for what the Order might have done to her father.</p><p>Afraid for herself, and the heart that was beating so frantically in her breast, a heedless organ that wanted to forgive Nathan and believe she meant something to him simply because he was there.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t know why he had come, and she refused to be the trusting, naive fool after everything that had happened since she last saw him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Zael. I want you to stay,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnything the Order has to say to me can be said in front of you.\u201d</p><p>Nathan exhaled a short sigh, the first crack in his iron-clad composure. \u201cI guess I deserve that.\u201d</p><p>Jordana held tight to her resolve, but his low voice still had the power to make something inside her melt. He glanced at Zael briefly as the Atlantean relaxed his stance with his blade, then settled back on his heels to remain, at Jordana\u2019s request.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Nathan took a step toward her, emerging into the light of the villa\u2019s living room. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not by Zael.\u201d Sharp words, but she couldn\u2019t bite them back. She steeled herself as Nathan took another few steps inside. \u201cWhere\u2019s my father? What have you and the Order done to Martin Gates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the command center in Boston. He\u2019s worried about you, Jordana. The Order is very concerned for you as well. So is Carys.\u201d Nathan\u2019s cool gaze slid to Zael in unspoken warning. \u201cEveryone wants you returned home safe. I mean to ensure that happens. And make no mistake, I\u2019m not leaving without you.\u201d</p><p>She bristled at the idea that he expected to dictate any aspect of her life. Especially when he was doing it on behalf of a committee: her father, her friend, the Order.</p><p>Everyone except him.</p><p>She raised her chin, hoping he wouldn\u2019t see through her to the sting she was feeling all over again. \u201cAnd if I decide I don\u2019t want to go with you? What then? Do you mean to physically force me into custody, the way you did my father?\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Zael tensed with palpable menace. Nathan\u2019s brows furrowed as he looked at her and gave a slow shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He uttered the low, ripe curse. \u201cDo you think I would do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think, Nathan. Last night, I thought I knew you. Not the warrior or the Hunter\u2014I thought I knew you. I thought I could trust you. I thought that you and I\u2014\u201d She stopped herself before the confession\u2014the dashed hope\u2014could escape her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I thought last night. Today nothing is the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Today everything is different,\u201d Nathan agreed. \u201cLast night, we took Martin Gates into custody because we discovered he\u2019d secretly been in business for years with Cassian Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn business with him? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Notte belongs to Martin Gates, not Cass.\u201d</p><p>The news came as a surprise, but she was beyond the capacity to be shocked. A club like that, with its illegal sporting arena and gambling operation, to say nothing of the BDSM dens, would be the last kind of business her father would be involved in. Then again, if it had been a front for Cass, what was to say her father hadn\u2019t been secretly holding the club as some further means of protecting Cass and his secret? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe had to assume that as Cass\u2019s longtime business partner, Gates knew he wasn\u2019t human. We needed to know why they were keeping those kinds of secrets, Jordana. And more urgently, we needed to determine whether Martin Gates and Cass could also have ties to Opus Nostrum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s impossible.\u201d As incredible as it was to her to imagine Martin Gates having anything to do with Cass\u2019s notorious club, she refused to believe her father\u2014either of them, for any reason\u2014would ever be part of the terrorist group responsible for multiple assassinations and the recent attack on the global peace summit in D.C.</p><p>Nathan nodded. \u201cWe realized soon enough that wasn\u2019t the case. Martin Gates and Cassian Gray were keeping a very big secret, but it wasn\u2019t Opus Nostrum. It was you.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped closer, but she retreated a pace. \u201cHow long did you know the Order would be coming after my father? Did you know the whole time last night?\u201d Jordana\u2019s voice sounded broken, even to her own ears. \u201cWere you planning for his arrest even while you and I were alone together in my office? Did you use me, Nathan?\u201d</p><p>Now Zael growled, low under his breath.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s scowl deepened. \u201cDid I use you? Fuck no. Never, Jordana.\u201d He gave a sharp shake of his head. \u201cBut understand I also had to do my job.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed quietly, even while her heart caved to him a little more. \u201cAre you just doing your job now too? Is that why you\u2019re here\u2014because of what I am? Because of who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came because as soon as we figured out where you might be, nothing would\u2019ve kept me from finding you. Nothing.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her, moved forward despite the further warning that curled up from the back of Zael\u2019s throat. \u201cYou need to come back with me, Jordana. Yes, because of everything we know about you now. You need to come back to Boston, where it will be my job and the Order\u2019s to keep you safe from Cass\u2019s enemies. Or anyone else who might think he has a claim on you,\u201d he added, slanting a challenging look on Zael.</p><p>\u201cI have no claim,\u201d Zael said evenly. \u201cBut someone more powerful than any of us does. It was at her command that those soldiers tracked and killed my old friend Cassianus. And unless they\u2019re stopped\u2014or unless they lose the trail they\u2019re most certainly on now\u2014those same men will continue to look for Jordana by order of their queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir queen,\u201d Nathan murmured, clearly suspicious. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordana is her granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s answering curse was rough, disbelieving. But Zael continued, undaunted. \u201cThe soldiers were closing in on Jordana last night in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClosing in on her,\u201d Nathan said, then he seemed to understand. \u201cBecause her latent powers are maturing. Her Atlantean nature is leading them to her like some kind of beacon?\u201d</p> <p>Zael gave a grim nod. \u201cThey will track her to the ends of the earth unless steps are taken. They were in Boston since the night they located Cass. They would\u2019ve found Jordana. If I hadn\u2019t reached her first, they would\u2019ve already taken her back to the realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Christ.\u201d Nathan turned a stricken look on her. \u201cAnd I had left you alone. They might\u2019ve come for you, and I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Anger flared in her. \u201cIt\u2019s not your job to protect me, Nathan. Dammit, it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s job to protect me!\u201d</p><p>As her voice rose, the prickling in her hands intensified. The buzzing in her veins grew deeper, a pulsating thrum that filled her ears.</p><p>She swung a furious look between Nathan and Zael. \u201cI\u2019m not made of glass. I\u2019m not a child. I\u2019m a grown woman, and I\u2019m tired of being treated as if everyone else knows what\u2019s best for me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize how strong the sensation of heat and energy had gotten in her hands until she noticed both Zael and Nathan staring at her. Only then did she look down at her palms.</p><p>At the fiery glow that emanated from their centers.</p><p>And in the midst of that ember-bright light was the outline of a crescent moon and teardrop.</p> <p>The Atlantean mark.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell,\u201d Nathan gasped. His stormy eyes lifted to her gaze and he seemed speechless for a long moment, awestruck. \u201cMy God ... Jordana.\u201d</p><p>Zael\u2019s response was less amazed than it was grim. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d He cocked his head, then shot a grave look at Jordana. \u201cWe delayed too long. They\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>27</p><p>EVERY MUSCLE IN NATHAN\u2019S BODY SNAPPED TO ATTENTION ON Zael\u2019s warning.</p><p>There was no time to process the astonishing change he\u2019d seen in Jordana. No opportunity to assess the newly arrived danger, or to catalog the numerous vulnerabilities of their surroundings in preparation for the battle to come.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot let Jordana be taken.\u201d Zael looked to Nathan, gravity in his face and his words. As he spoke, Nathan noticed the leather thong looped around Zael\u2019s wrist. The silvery emblem that dangled from the cord was lit with unearthly fire. \u201cThis crystal can transport her far from the queen\u2019s reach, but I must take her now.\u201d</p><p>Nathan gave the Atlantean warrior a nod. He looked at Jordana, his heart choking as though it were caught in a vise. \u201cGo with him. I need to know you\u2019re somewhere safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Panic bled into her face, into the ice-blue eyes that had looked at him with so much pain and mistrust tonight. \u201cZael,\u201d she said, an urgency\u2014a clipped, regal demand\u2014in her voice. \u201cWhat about Nathan?\u201d</p><p>The Atlantean shook his head in faint denial. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jordana. The crystal will only work for our kind. And besides, he can\u2019t go where I must take you.\u201d</p><p>His sword in one hand, Zael reached out for her with the other, the crystal\u2019s light building.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not going anywhere. Don\u2019t touch me, Zael.\u201d Jordana snatched her hand away from him. She swung a tormented look on Nathan. \u201cHow could you think I would leave you behind only to save myself? Don\u2019t you realize what that would do to me?\u201d</p><p>Nathan cursed. If anything happened to her, it would be worse than any abuse he\u2019d ever suffered. He would never forgive himself. \u201cJordana, I don\u2019t matter. I want you to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Nathan, don\u2019t you realize that I love you?\u201d</p><p>She had no sooner said the words than the air stirred outside the open French doors to the terrace.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a pair of immense males materialized there. It was apparent they were soldiers. Obvious they had come for her, just as Zael said they would.</p><p>Each man held a long, gleaming blade much like the one Zael now raised in front of him, as he swiftly ushered Jordana behind him.</p><p>Nathan wasted no time waiting for the attack to come. He drew one of his guns and opened fire on the two Atlanteans.</p><p>The larger of the two, dark-haired and snarling, staggered back on his heels under the sudden barrage of bullets that ripped into his chest and skull. His companion, a copper-haired warrior with piercing, determined green eyes, took a couple of rounds in his torso before vanishing into thin air.</p><p>Nathan kept firing on the big male, blasting holes into the bastard until his tattered, unmoving weight tumbled right over the railing of the balcony.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s scream jerked Nathan\u2019s head around. The other soldier had reappeared farther inside the villa and was now bearing down on her and Zael.</p><p>Zael put his body between Jordana and their attacker, raising his blade as the other male\u2019s sword came slashing toward him. The Atlantean weapons clashed in a screech of metal and a brief shower of blue and green sparks. Zael went down on one knee, driven low by the sudden, wrenching thrust of his opponent\u2019s arm.</p><p>Nathan dropped his empty pistol. Using the speed of his Breed genetics, he flashed across the room and came up behind the copper-haired soldier. He grabbed the Atlantean\u2019s head in both his hands and gave a violent twist. Vertebrae popped like firecrackers. The soldier let go of his blade and slumped to the floor in a lifeless heap.</p><p>As the body fell away, Zael opened his mouth in a shout of warning.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Nathan felt a sharp length of ice impale his torso from behind.</p><p>The blade withdrew and he wheeled around on his heel, astonished to find the dark-haired Atlantean standing there. Blood was all over the soldier, but not a single bullet wound remained.</p><p>The immortal had come back from the gunfire and the fall. His gleaming sword was dripping, stained scarlet from the hole that now bled from Nathan\u2019s back and abdomen.</p><p>The wound was bad, but it wouldn\u2019t kill Nathan. It did, however, severely piss him off.</p><p>And before he could regroup and retaliate, Jordana\u2019s terrified cry rent the air.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. Nathan!\u201d She lunged from behind Zael.</p><p>The dark-haired Atlantean\u2019s hand shot out and grabbed hold of her, merciless, unrelenting. His long fingers wrapped tightly around her arm. Nathan saw that he wore a thong around his wrist similar to Zael\u2019s. The crystal emblem affixed to it now began to throw off powerful, fiery light.</p><p>He was going to take her away. Back to their realm. Back to their queen.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s wild, terrified gaze shot to Nathan.</p><p>No. He couldn\u2019t lose her.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, no!\u201d Nathan shouted.</p><p>He reached for her other hand and held on tight. He couldn\u2019t bear to let her go.</p><p>And at that same moment, in no time at all, he felt a heat begin to surge through Jordana\u2019s fingers. The energy was immense, awesome.</p><p>Not of this world.</p><p>\u201cRelease me,\u201d she growled at the soldier who captured her. The power within her expanded, growing swiftly. In a blinding flash, it erupted out of her as she roared the command again. \u201cRelease me!\u201d</p><p>The Atlantean guard flew off her as if torn away by an unseen force. Nathan too was staggered by the sudden blast of light and power that surged through Jordana\u2019s hands.</p><p>He let go, only because he noticed that the dark-haired male had dropped his sword in that moment. Nathan grabbed for it, at the same time Zael hurled himself at the soldier, tackling the guard while his reflexes were dazed from Jordana\u2019s defensive strike.</p><p>But now the second of the Atlantean soldiers had come back from his injuries.</p><p>Although Nathan had broken the male\u2019s neck, the copper-haired immortal shook it off with a menacing chuckle as he got to his feet. He swiveled his head, popping his spinal column back into alignment.</p><p>Nathan vaulted up from the floor, pivoting around at the same time. The dark-haired immortal\u2019s sword held in his hands, he swung it around as the second guard charged at him.</p><p>Steel met flesh and cleaved in deep, sweeping the immortal\u2019s head off in one sure, lethal blow.</p><p>Behind him, Zael\u2019s sword was also biting into muscle and bone, the head of the other Atlantean hitting the floor with a wet, final thud.</p><p>\u201cNathan!\u201d Jordana flew across the carnage toward him.</p><p>Her heart lodged in her throat, panic and relief swamping her at the same time, Jordana raced to Nathan\u2019s side and threw her arms around him.</p><p>He was wounded and bleeding, but still standing. He was alive.</p><p>He had saved her\u2014he\u2019d likely saved Zael as well\u2014and nothing could have kept Jordana from embracing Nathan and burying her face in the living, breathing warmth of him.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she murmured against his chest. She clung to him, needing to feel his body against hers, whole and hale. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so scared, Nathan. When that soldier ran his blade through you, I thought he\u2019d killed you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he soothed, his palm stroking her back as he dropped a kiss on top of her bent head. He held her close, his pulse drumming beneath her ear. So strong and steady, so comforting. \u201cI\u2019ll heal soon enough. I\u2019ve survived worse than this before.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin, both his fingers and his gaze tender on her. \u201cIt would\u2019ve taken a hell of a lot more than that blade to stop me. I wasn\u2019t about to let them have you. I don\u2019t give a fuck if the Atlantean queen and her entire army think they have any claim on you. They\u2019ll all have to come through me first.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head and kissed her. Not a tentative kiss but a fierce, possessive one.</p><p>Jordana melted into it, savoring the taste of him, the feel of him. The unearthly energy that had poured through her veins during the battle stirred again, but with a different power, as Nathan\u2019s mouth moved over hers in a deep, passionate joining.</p><p>Would she always respond so easily to his touch, his kiss?</p><p>Or now that her Atlantean genetics were awakening, becoming part of her, would she crave him with an even greater need?</p><p>She hoped she\u2019d have the chance to find that out.</p><p>She hoped she\u2019d have an entire future ahead of her with Nathan to find that out.</p><p>But right now, his injury needed tending, and across the room, Zael was standing over the corpses of the two Atlantean warriors.</p><p>Nathan broke contact on a low moan. As he raised his head to regard Zael, he brought Jordana under his arm in a protective stance. \u201cWill more soldiers come?\u201d</p><p>Zael gave a sober nod. \u201cOnce it\u2019s determined these men have failed and are lost to her, Selene will send out more. She\u2019ll keep sending out more. The queen does not accept defeat easily. She forgives even less.\u201d Zael\u2019s gaze slid to Jordana. \u201cThe best place to elude her is in the colony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr through a blood bond,\u201d Jordana pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIf you remain in the mortal world, that\u2019s all that would protect you. But only if Selene\u2019s legion doesn\u2019t find you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she has me.\u201d Nathan said it like a vow: firm, unwavering.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Zael acknowledged with a level glance, but his grave tone stopped short of encouragement. \u201cUnfortunately, nothing can be as certain as the asylum the colony can provide. It\u2019s hidden, known only by a small few outside the realm. I am one of only a handful trusted with its location, aside from the exiles who live there in seclusion under the colony\u2019s protection.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat kind of protection?\u201d Nathan asked.</p><p>Zael indicated the silvery crystal he wore on the leather thong at his wrist. \u201cThis is crafted from a larger source of energy belonging to our people. The colony has one, and so does Selene. At one time, very long ago, the realm had five of these crystals, much larger than this small, harvested piece. The crystals are sacred to the Atlantean people. They shielded us from the world outside and kept the realm safe from enemies who would want to destroy us.\u201d</p><p>Beside Jordana, Nathan studied Zael\u2019s bracelet with narrowed scrutiny. \u201cThat material\u2019s nothing found on this Earth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zael said. \u201cMy people, like the Ancients who fathered your kind, the Breed, were from somewhere else. The two races were at war, in fact. Even before fate brought them here.\u201d</p><p>Nathan swore under his breath. \u201cIs that why another of your kind, Reginald Crowe, recently boasted before he died that the Atlantean queen has been plotting a new war\u2014one against both mankind and the Breed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelene is a bitter queen.\u201d Zael grunted. \u201cWorse, she\u2019s a scorned woman. I can\u2019t say what she\u2019s plotting, but it\u2019s rare that she\u2019s not looking for reasons to fight or enemies to destroy. It wasn\u2019t always that way with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to make her that way?\u201d As much as Jordana feared the woman who had driven her mother to suicide and ordered her soldiers to hunt down and execute Jordana\u2019s father, she felt compelled to try to understand something about the queen if she could.</p><p>\u201cSelene changed after our first settlement was destroyed,\u201d Zael explained. \u201cTwo of the realm\u2019s crystals were stolen, and our enemies\u2014your Ancient forebears,\u201d he said to Nathan, \u201cused the crystals\u2019 power to annihilate us. Selene fled Atlantis with as many of our people as could escape the destruction of all we\u2019d built and the giant wave that swallowed up the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust like the myth,\u201d Jordana whispered. \u201cThat story has been in place for thousands of years.\u201d</p><p>Zael gave an acknowledging shrug. \u201cMore or less. And Selene\u2019s had little but mistrust or hatred for anyone since that day.\u201d</p><p>Nathan frowned. \u201cSo the colony has a crystal, and the queen has one also. Two were stolen before the attack by the Ancients. And the fifth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows for certain. It vanished about twenty-five years ago.\u201d Zael glanced at Jordana. \u201cThere were rumors Cassianus had taken it with him when he fled with you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t believe that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Zael\u2019s brows lifted in contemplation. \u201cCass would\u2019ve had the balls, that\u2019s a given. But to make off with an object with that magnitude of power? To keep it hidden all this time would\u2019ve been quite a feat. He\u2019d have had to shield it somehow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe way he wanted to shield my power with a blood bond,\u201d Jordana said. \u201cWould he have any reason to take something like that with him when he left the realm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who understood how valuable the crystal was would have reason to want it for himself.\u201d Zael thought for a moment, then chuckled softly as he looked at Jordana. \u201cOr for someone else, if he thought it might prove useful in some other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bargaining chip,\u201d Nathan suggested. \u201cLeverage against the one other person who wanted it the most. Wanted it maybe more than anything else.\u201d</p><p>Zael grunted. \u201cWell, even if Cass did take it, he can\u2019t tell anyone where to find it now. The missing crystal is most likely lost forever.\u201d</p><p>Regardless of whether Cassianus escaped with a valuable Atlantean treasure or not, and regardless of any motivation he may have had to do so, Jordana felt a wave of renewed sorrow for the father she never knew. She mourned her mother too, for the love she lost and the family she never had the opportunity to enjoy.</p><p>There was even a small part of Jordana that pitied her grandmother. After all, what kind of lasting emotional pain must it require to turn a woman into the kind of unfeeling, destructive monster Selene seemed to be?</p><p>Nathan looked to Zael in question. \u201cIf Cass worried so much about Jordana and her safety, why not take her to the colony as an infant and stay there with her? Why would he risk her future\u2014Jesus, why risk her life\u2014by leaving her to grow up among the Breed and mankind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if he brought her to the colony, Cass understood that like the others who live there, she\u2019d have to remain under its veil for her entire existence. He didn\u2019t want to make that choice for her. Exile to the colony was a last resort, only if the worst should happen and time was running out. Cass wanted to give his daughter the chance to find her own path.\u201d</p> <p>Nathan\u2019s dark gaze settled on Jordana. He\u2019d never seemed uncertain, not in all of the time she knew him. But now there was a hesitance in his eyes. A quiet dread in his voice. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t come here to find you tonight, what would you choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already had chosen,\u201d Zael interjected gently. \u201cJordana decided even before you arrived. We were preparing to leave around the same time you came in.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s head drew back slightly, doubt flickering across his typically cool, controlled features. \u201cI came that close to losing you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, emotion nearly choking her. \u201cZael was going to bring me back home to Boston. Everything that matters to me is there ... and right here in front of me.\u201d</p><p>His exhalation sounded heavy with relief. \u201cI came to find you because you\u2019re everything that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>On her tear-thickened, happy laugh, Nathan pulled her into his arms.</p><p>When he spoke next, his voice was reverent and solemn, his hands on her the tenderest they\u2019d ever been. \u201cI will protect you with my life, Jordana. Always. And I\u2019ll protect you with my blood bond, here and now, if it means men like the ones who came for you tonight will never find you again.\u201d</p><p>That he would make such a promise moved her deeply. She loved him for that alone.</p><p>God help her, she loved Nathan for that and a thousand other reasons.</p><p>Jordana could hardly summon her breath as he gently stroked her cheek, his stormy gaze flecked with a galaxy of amber stars.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m offering this out of duty or anything half as noble. You know I\u2019m a selfish bastard who demands things go his way. I don\u2019t settle for anything less than what I want. And what I want right now, forever, is you.\u201d His eyes glowed bright with tender emotion. He held her face in his hands, searching her gaze with an intensity that made her blood heat beneath her skin. \u201cI\u2019m offering my bond because I love you. Because I need you, Jordana, and I don\u2019t want to know what life without you will feel like ever again.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hard and deep, so passionately she lost herself to the overwhelming power of the moment, unaware that Zael was even still in the room until the Atlantean awkwardly cleared his throat.</p><p>Nathan released her, only to utter a growl and take her mouth again in another hungered, but brief, kiss. She was laughing as they separated and both turned to face Zael.</p><p>While they\u2019d been caught up in passion, he\u2019d collected the soldiers\u2019 remains and now belted their sheathed blades around his waist. \u201cI must go,\u201d he said. The crystal at his wrist was starting to glow. \u201cI\u2019ll take the dead with me and scatter them far enough away from here or Boston to throw anyone else off their trail. Whoever Selene sends next will have to start all over again. And if you\u2019re blood-bonded by then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be.\u201d The dark confidence in Nathan\u2019s voice sent a jolt of fire through Jordana\u2019s veins.</p><p>Zael smiled. He held out his hand to Jordana. In his palm was a leather thong like the one he wore. One of the dead guards was missing his. \u201cFor you, should you ever need it. If you\u2019re ever in trouble, it will take you anywhere you can picture in your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only me,\u201d she said, recalling that he\u2019d explained the crystal would only transport those of Atlantean blood. She glanced up at Nathan, before looking back to Zael and giving a shake of her head. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere I\u2019ll ever need to go if not with Nathan.\u201d</p><p>She reached for Zael\u2019s strong golden fingers and curled them around the gift she wouldn\u2019t accept. \u201cThank you for being a friend to my father Cassianus. And to me.\u201d</p><p>Zael bowed his head low, reverently. \u201cGodspeed and a very happy, long life to you, Princess Jordana.\u201d</p><p>Zael held out his hand to Nathan. The two immense males\u2014one golden and godlike, one dark and dangerous as night itself\u2014clasped each other\u2019s hands in a solid, if unspoken, gesture of friendship.</p><p>With that, Zael strode over to the fallen Atlanteans and knelt down beside the bodies. He took the wrist of each one in his hands as the crystal on his bracelet glowed brighter and brighter still.</p><p>Light exploded from it in all directions\u2014a lightning-quick blast of pure energy.</p><p>When it went out an instant later, Zael and Selene\u2019s dead guards were gone.</p><p>28</p><p>NATHAN HELD ON TO JORDANA AS THE VILLA WENT QUIET IN THE wake of Zael\u2019s departure, leaving the two of them alone with the weight of all they\u2019d just seen and done and heard.</p><p>The battle with the two immortal guards had been harrowing, hard won. Zael\u2019s many revelations before and after the fight had been astonishing, even mind-blowing.</p><p>But nothing had leveled Nathan so much as Jordana\u2019s declaration that she loved him.</p><p>That she would have given up a guaranteed asylum to return to Boston\u2014return to him\u2014even before he\u2019d come to find her was a sacrifice he could hardly fathom.</p><p>Then again, yes, he could.</p><p>Because as he held her under the circle of his arm in that moment, he knew with a certainty deep down into his marrow that there was nothing he wouldn\u2019t give up if it meant forever with Jordana.</p><p>When he might have held her against him even longer, content simply to feel her beside him, Jordana drew back. \u201cYour wound, Nathan.\u201d She glanced down at her hand, which had been resting against his abdomen. The palm was stained red. \u201cIt\u2019s still bleeding. Let me take care of you now.\u201d</p><p>The injury was already healing. He knew it would mend soon enough on its own, but he didn\u2019t resist as she took him by the hand and led him through the villa, into a lavish bathroom adjoining the large master bedroom suite.</p><p>\u201cSit there.\u201d She pointed to the white marble edge of a deep soaking tub. As he obeyed her soft command, she went about gathering a supply of clean washcloths and towels. When she returned, she set them down next to him, then carefully untucked his body-hugging black shirt from his pants. \u201cCan you lift your arms?\u201d</p><p>He did as she asked, realizing only now that this was the first time in his life that anyone had cared for him in such a way.</p><p>The only time he\u2019d ever permitted anyone to care for him like this.</p><p>Or wanted it so fervently.</p><p>A dark memory tried to push through his subconscious as Jordana gently drew his ruined shirt away from the sticky mess of his injury. Her hands were so tender, so light on him after she laid the shirt aside and knelt down to inspect the wound.</p><p>She ran water onto one of the washcloths from the tub faucet, then wiped away the worst of the blood with aching care. The cloth was cool against his torn flesh, a balm almost as soothing as her sweet attention.</p><p>Yet in the back of his mind, Nathan felt the bite of a lash. He heard the clamor of chains. Smelled the oily stench of blood-soaked metal and stone.</p><p>He had to battle every instinct he had not to shove her touch away.</p><p>Jordana must have sensed the tension in him. Glancing up now, her lovely face was pinched with concern. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word came out strangled, thick with restraint.</p><p>She went back to her careful ministrations, hesitantly now. She watched him too closely. She had to feel the rigidity of his muscles, the torment in all of his senses, as he struggled to hold back the ugliness of his past while she touched him so lovingly.</p><p>\u201cNathan, if you don\u2019t want me to touch you ... if you want me to stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck, no. I\u2019ll never want that.\u201d He reached out to caress her face, gutted that she would think he\u2019d reject any part of her now, after all they\u2019d been through together. He uttered a harsh, low curse, hating that his ugly past had invaded here. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just ...\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold her innocent gaze. He didn\u2019t want her to see through him to the Hunter he\u2019d never totally managed to leave behind.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to see the scars that had never fully healed, despite that his Breed genetics had hidden all outside traces of them.</p><p>Jordana reached up to grasp his fingers where they lay against her cheek. \u201cYou can tell me when you\u2019re ready ... or not at all. I\u2019ll love you either way.\u201d</p><p>Her promise was so sweet, so patient, any words he might have offered just then got strangled in his tight throat.</p><p>What would she say if she knew what his handlers had done to him, how they\u2019d eventually broken him?</p><p>What would she think if she knew what he\u2019d done to survive?</p><p>As she went back to tending him, the memories flooded in. He couldn\u2019t stop them.</p><p>And he knew that if he didn\u2019t spit them out, his past would always stand in the way of the future he hoped to have with Jordana.</p><p>\u201cIn the program, they had tests to cull the most viable Hunters from the rest,\u201d he murmured, his voice sounding wooden in the quiet of the bathroom. \u201cThey tested things like physical strength, linear and abstract thinking, problem solving. They tested endurance, and the ability to withstand pain. All kinds of pain.\u201d</p><p>Jordana\u2019s hands stilled. Slowly, she sat back on her heels in front of him, listening in utter silence, a quiet dread in her eyes. \u201cNathan ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kept going. He knew he had to push through before her sympathy froze him up. \u201cThe beatings were easy enough to handle. Even the torture. Eventually you find a place to park your mind and you can separate yourself from what\u2019s being done to you. That was the lesson our handlers were trying to demonstrate. Except, when nothing seems to break you, it creates a temptation in some people to find something that will. They get creative. They get fucking sadistic.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, staring at him as though bracing for a physical blow herself. \u201cOh, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey used clubs and chains,\u201d he recalled, still able to feel the crush of his flesh and bones when the strikes landed on him. \u201cWhen that didn\u2019t make me beg for mercy, they used blades, sunlight, sometimes they used fire. They could\u2019ve used any weapon on me and I would have endured it. It was only physical pain. My body healed as good as new every time, thanks to the Gen One DNA they bred into each of us.\u201d</p> <p>He exhaled a tense breath, recalling the countless hours and days he spent huddled and shivering on the floor of his cell, enduring the anguish of broken bones and savage injuries that would have killed a Breed with less hardy genetics.</p><p>But death hadn\u2019t been the goal of the Hunter program. Dragos had been trying to create perfect killing machines. Soulless weapons to command at his whim. He wanted only the strongest.</p><p>Only the merciless.</p><p>\u201cAfter some time, my handlers decided to test me in other ways. They started teaching me new lessons. Inflicting wounds that would leave scars on my mind, ones that no DNA could heal.\u201d</p><p>Jordana let out a soft, ragged sigh. \u201cNathan, don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to tell me any more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d He bit off the words. \u201cYou\u2019re the last person I want to tell any of this to, but you\u2019re also the only one ... ever. And you need to know, Jordana. Before you touch me and tell me you love me, before you let me promise you a future I\u2019m not even sure I can deliver, you need to understand who I am. You need to know all of it.\u201d</p><p>As he continued, she held his stare, her light blue eyes unwavering.</p><p>\u201cInstead of limiting the torture to me alone, one day they brought me into a cell with another Hunter. He was younger than me, and our handlers informed me this was his first training session. I could see he was afraid, even though he tried to hide it. I thought they would start abusing both of us. They spared him, only made him watch all the things they did to me. And their creativity that day was especially brutal.\u201d Nathan blew out a harsh breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize the other Hunter\u2019s lesson would come later. We both would learn something different that day.\u201d</p><p>Jordana reached out for his hand. It took all his will to accept the kindness, to wrap his fingers around hers even as he relived the horror of what was done to him that day in the cell and the even worse lesson that followed.</p><p>\u201cThey left me on the floor in a pool of my own blood and vomit. I didn\u2019t realize the other Hunter was still in the cell until sometime later, when I felt his hands under me, helping me up. He moved me out of the puddle of filth, then used his shirt to clean the worst of it off my face. Neither one of us realized that our handlers were watching the whole time. Waiting for just this kind of failure. Eager to make both of us pay for it.\u201d</p><p>Jordana drew in a breath, her fingers squeezing his tighter. \u201cOh, no ...\u201d</p> <p>It had been a long time since Nathan had thought about the young male whose compassion had cost him his life. He wasn\u2019t the last.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known what they would do. It was the same game my handlers played in the beginning. They\u2019d beat me, brutalize me, then come back around after a while to offer a hand up or some other small consideration. If I accepted, there was always more pain. And much worse than any that came before.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Jordana, saw moisture gathering in her eyes. \u201cAfter that incident, they brought more Hunters into the cell with me to observe my training. If my untrained comrades touched me afterward or showed me kindness or pity at any time, my handlers would torture and kill them. If I warned my comrades not to do those things, then my handlers made me mete out the torture and the killings instead.\u201d</p><p>Jordana covered her mouth with her free hand, mutely shaking her head. One of the tears that had been welling now spilled over her and rolled down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cFinally, all of the training stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cThey deemed me ready, and sent me to live with the Minion assigned to watch over me while I awaited my first kill order from Dragos.\u201d</p><p>Jordana exhaled softly, her brows lowered over her tender gaze. \u201cMy God, Nathan. How long did this training go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took me longer than some others to conform, to submit.\u201d He paused, considering. \u201cI guess I was about seven when I left the labs for good.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou were just a child\u2014a little boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never recall a time when I felt I was anything other than what they made me: a Hunter. A killer. A weapon at Dragos\u2019s disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never tried to escape?\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cThere was no escape. I had a collar that made any disobedience punishable by death. Every Hunter had one. The ultraviolet collars were locked onto us from the time we could walk. Venture too far, defy an order, attempt to escape ...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI saw more than one Hunter ash himself when his collar detonated. Some deliberately.\u201d</p><p>Understanding filled her horrified gaze. \u201cSo, if you refused to do anything your handlers demanded ...\u201d At his grave nod, Jordana briefly closed her eyes. \u201cThey trained you to fear tenderness. You learned to hate anyone\u2019s touch. They taught you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey taught me that control was the only way to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned to dominate every situation thrown at me. Or die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free now,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to let your past keep you in the prison they made for you, Nathan.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, but without waiting for his permission or approval, she leaned toward him and placed her mouth at the base of his throat, where the cold weight of the UV collar once chafed his skin. He braced himself as her warm lips closed on him.</p><p>Unrushed, impossibly sweet, she kissed a trail around either side of his neck. Tender empathy for what he\u2019d been through, or undeserving absolution for all he\u2019d done, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Nor did he know how he could ever be worthy of the affection\u2014the love\u2014Jordana gave him so openly. She had changed him. His old methods for coping, for surviving, were obliterated from the moment she first stepped into his life.</p><p>She\u2019d captivated him with a kiss.</p><p>She\u2019d challenged him, gentled him.</p><p>Now she owned him.</p><p>Nathan growled in pleasure as her mouth completed its slow circuit of his neck, her tongue following the lines of the dermaglyphs she found there. His blood was thrumming through his veins, breath coming harder as arousal ignited like a wildfire within him. He tilted his head back on a low, shuddering moan as her kiss traveled lower, down across his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cI wish I were a better man for you,\u201d he murmured, taking her face gently in his hands and tipping her gaze up to his. He was so hungry for her, his voice was gravel, thick with desire. And tight with love for this woman. \u201cI wish I could promise you a peaceful, normal life ... a tranquil future. I can\u2019t give you those things, Jordana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d She smiled and reached up to caress his face, her fingers tracing lightly over the furrow now creased in his brow. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want those things. I want you. I want the storm I see in your eyes when you look at me. I want the high cliff and the breathless leap into the dark, which is how I feel when I\u2019m with you. All I want is you, Nathan. I love you.\u201d</p><p>His heart swelled in his chest. She knew everything now, his ugliest sins and pitiful, ignoble past. And she still wanted him.</p><p>She still loved him.</p><p>Swamped with emotion and need, he took her mouth in a fierce claiming. His fangs surged out of his gums. Amber light exploded behind his eyelids as his irises transformed.</p><p>Jordana wrapped her arms around him as he drew her up onto his lap on the edge of the large tub, their mouths still joined and hungry for each other.</p><p>On a low moan, Nathan pulled his head back and looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She stroked his cheek, and he nuzzled deeper into her touch. She watched him, her smile softening. \u201cAnd you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Nathan nodded. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take me,\u201d she told him. \u201cThere\u2019s one more leap I\u2019m ready to make with you.\u201d</p><p>His veins responded before he could find his voice. Kicking as though lit with a jolt of electricity, his pulse hammered, more than eager to seal the bond that would make Jordana his woman forever.</p><p>His eternal mate.</p><p>With his eyes locked on hers, Nathan brought his wrist to his mouth and bit into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d he said, the word dry as sandpaper as he watched her lick her lips.</p><p>Jordana leaned forward and fastened her mouth over the punctures.</p><p>At first she was tentative, careful with her suckling. She moaned as the first swallow moved down her throat. Both her hands came up to hold on to his arm as she drew another, deeper pull from his vein.</p><p>Nathan was rock hard now, every muscle in his body rigid, all of his senses trained on the erotic suction of her mouth. He groaned a curse, his spine arching as if she were sucking his cock at the same time.</p><p>With his free hand, he petted her head as she drank more of him. His fevered gaze latched on to the pulse point throbbing frantically in the side of her delicate neck. He could hear her heart beating. Could practically feel the rapid tick of her carotid echoing in his own veins.</p><p>Jordana owned him, with or without the blood bond, but he couldn\u2019t wait another second to make her his completely.</p><p>He smoothed his palm over the graceful column of her neck. Jordana whimpered as he stroked her, then she angled her head to give him clearer access.</p><p>It was all the temptation he could take.</p><p>On a hungered snarl, Nathan lowered his mouth onto her pale skin. The points of his fangs sank in deep, then a rush of hot, intoxicating blood flowed over his tongue.</p><p>Ah, Christ.</p><p>She tasted like heaven. Citrus and elusive, exotic spices and purest, otherworldly light.</p><p>The first hot gush of her blood roared into him, nearly making his cock explode. Like liquid lightning, her blood coursed into his body, into his cells, into his soul.</p><p>He could feel her light envelop him, engulfing him from the inside. Heat flowed up the arteries in his neck, his limbs, every fiber of him infused, nourished\u2014completed\u2014by the heady power of Jordana\u2019s Atlantean blood.</p><p>Emotion erupted inside him, so intense it rocked him. It was overwhelming, a total flood of pleasure and sensation ... of naked, boundless love.</p><p>Jordana felt it too.</p><p>He knew, because their emotions were now twined together through their bond.</p><p>She drew away from his wrist on a sigh, her face aglow with desire and something so much deeper.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me.\u201d A soft but undeniable command. One he was desperate to obey. \u201cNow, Nathan. I need to feel you inside me now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if he answered or not. He wasn\u2019t even sure he was capable of speech, for the intensity of his feelings for this woman.</p><p>His woman.</p><p>His mate.</p><p>Pausing only long enough to seal their bite wounds with quick sweeps of his tongue, he lifted her up into his arms.</p><p>She was on fire as he brought her out to the waiting bed in the other room. Every cell inside her was enflamed, enlivened. Supercharged with light and unearthly energy.</p><p>But running undercurrent of all that was a raw, dark power that was Nathan.</p><p>She\u2019d felt his strength pour into her as she drank from him. The first taste had been a shock, a revelation. The second had been pure bliss. Heady, intoxicating.</p><p>And as she\u2019d taken more and more, Jordana understood that her bond to him would be an addiction unlike any other.</p><p>She would always crave him, even without the connection of his blood joined with hers. But now she hungered for him in a new, deeper way.</p><p>A wild, demanding way that knew no patience. No mercy.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tear her clothes off fast enough as he set her down on the bed. The linen tunic and loose pants were gone in an instant, cast aside on her throaty growl of need.</p><p>Jordana reached to unfasten Nathan\u2019s black fatigues and only then did she hesitate.</p><p>Because the blade wound that had pierced his torso was no longer bleeding. Not even a little.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNathan, look.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down, and as they both watched in astonishment, his skin knitted back together. In seconds, nothing of the injury remained.</p><p>He uttered a quiet laugh and when he looked back at her, there was wonder in his stormy, amber-soaked eyes.</p><p>And love.</p><p>So much love, it drowned her. Swept her into a tide of emotion so swift and strong, she could barely breathe.</p><p>She could feel Nathan\u2019s love for her in her veins, in her marrow. In every thrumming fiber of her being.</p><p>No more doubt, no more hiding for either of them. They were entwined as one now.</p><p>This would be their bond forever.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d he growled fiercely, as though he understood the depth of her feeling.</p><p>As though he felt it as surely, as completely, as she did.</p><p>He quickly stripped out of his pants and boots, then prowled back up to her on the bed. Heat rolled off his naked body as he took up a position between her spread thighs.</p><p>He kissed every inch of her, then tongued her sex until she was trembling and gasping beneath him. His eyes were blazing as he crawled back up to loom over her. His lips were slick with her hot juices, his fangs enormous behind the pleased, seductive curve of his smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jordana touched his face, his harsh, handsome face. She stroked his cheek and hard jaw, then gently traced her fingertips down his neck, where she\u2019d tried to kiss away the memory of his punishing Hunter\u2019s collar.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop her from touching him now. He didn\u2019t take his eyes off her, didn\u2019t flinch as she skimmed a tender caress over his strong shoulders and the bulky muscles of his arms.</p><p>Only when she reached lower, to where his thick cock jutted between them, velvety, warm, as firm as steel, did he close his eyes and emit a low hiss between his teeth and fangs. He groaned as she stroked his rigid shaft.</p> <p>He growled as she squeezed him, then uttered her name like a curse and a prayer as she opened her legs wider to him and guided him through the slick cleft of her body.</p><p>Then he devoured her mouth in a consuming kiss, nothing gentle in him now. Only raw desire, fueled by the intensity of their bond.</p><p>Wet heat boiled in her core. She was ready, so ready.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed against his mouth. \u201cTake me.\u201d</p><p>He sank in on a ragged snarl, plunging deep and hard and full. His hips bucked, thrusted, then kicked into a ravenous urgency that made her dizzy. He buried his head against her shoulder, driving into her with the sweetest frenzy, the hottest passion she would ever know. \u201cAh, Christ. Jordana, you feel too good. I can\u2019t be gentle. Jesus, fuck ... I can\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want gentle. Not right now.\u201d She wrapped her legs around him and dug her heels into his pumping ass as he rode her toward the crest of a shattering climax. \u201cOh, God, Nathan. Yes. Give me everything.\u201d</p><p>And so he did.</p><p>He gave her the storm and the cliff and the leap into a wild tempest. He gave her all of that and more, taking her senses to a height she never dreamed existed.</p><p>All she could do was hold on tight as he crashed into her, their gazes locked as passionately as their bodies.</p><p>It felt so right, the need they shared, the bond that joined them now, forever.</p><p>He shouted as he came, and Jordana followed him there at the same time, hurtling into a brilliant wave of release. She felt his pleasure, and knew he felt hers too. She shattered beneath the pleasing weight of him, all her nerve endings crackling with sensation, with pure pleasure, as her body slowly spiraled back down to earth.</p> <p>Panting, shivering with a thousand little aftershocks, she exhaled a shaky laugh. \u201cThat was, ah ... wow.\u201d She sifted her fingers through his short dark hair, his forehead resting on her shoulder. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s always going to be like this for us?\u201d</p><p>He grunted, his breath hot against the side of her neck. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Not the answer she expected. She was frowning when he lifted his head to look at her. But his dark, blue-green eyes didn\u2019t have a speck of doubt in them. They glittered with bright amber sparks. And deep inside her, his cock twitched, already hard again.</p><p>Nathan grinned, one black brow rising wickedly. \u201cI have a feeling it\u2019s only going to get better.\u201d</p><p>Then, with no more warning than that, he rolled over onto his back, bringing her with him so that she was seated astride him, their bodies still joined.</p><p>\u201cBut why wait to find out,\u201d he said, and dragged her down for another hot, claiming kiss.</p><p>29</p><p>THEY MADE LOVE FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS.</p> <p>He\u2019d been right; sex was only going to get better between them. Nathan had enjoyed watching Jordana\u2019s pleasure as she straddled his body and set the tempo for their next round.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen anything so erotic as her insatiable enthusiasm\u2014her relentless ferocity\u2014while she chased a second, and then, God help him, a third and fourth explosive climax.</p><p>No doubt about it, his lovely mate was extraordinary.</p><p>But then, he\u2019d known that all along.</p><p>And he knew it was going to take a lot longer than the years they would have together\u2014eternity, if he had anything to say about it\u2014before he would desire her any less than he did tonight.</p><p>It was desire that woke him from a brief, recharging doze. He wanted Jordana again, but when he moved his hand to find her, he felt nothing but cool, empty sheets.</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>He vaulted out of the bed, alarm shooting through him.</p><p>But only for an instant.</p><p>Then he felt her, safe and serene, in his blood.</p><p>Their bond reassured him. It led him out to the terrace, where he found Jordana, wrapped in a thin coverlet from the bed, standing beneath the moonlight.</p><p>She sensed him as well. Without turning around, she reached back to him, beckoning him out to join her. Nathan took her hand and walked up beside her. Then he gathered her into his arms and looked out with her at the dark, rippling water and shadowed cliffs below.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful here,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI can see why this place was special to him. It must have broken his heart when my mother decided she couldn\u2019t stay here with him. With us.\u201d</p><p>Nathan kissed the top of her head and nestled her closer. She was talking about her parents, Cass and Soraya. Jordana had told him about them while Nathan and she had lain in bed a short while ago. She told him everything Zael had shared with her, including the fact that Jordana had been born in this very villa.</p><p>And he knew about her mother\u2019s punishment for falling in love with a man deemed beneath her. He knew about the suicide that had robbed Cassian Gray\u2014Cassianus\u2014of the woman he loved and sent him on the run with an infant daughter he was desperate to hide.</p><p>A daughter who would never know him.</p><p>A young woman who wouldn\u2019t find out just how loved she\u2019d been by her father until it was too late to return that affection.</p><p>Nathan hugged her deeper into his arms. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll want to come back here sometime?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head where it rested against his bare chest. \u201cNo. This was his place, their place. It belongs to them, not me.\u201d Her face tilted up to meet his gaze. \u201cThe only home I need is in Boston. With you.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d already discussed living arrangements, and although Nathan\u2019s quarters at the command center were nothing close to Jordana\u2019s lavish penthouse, she conceded to living with him as part of the Order.</p><p>Nathan was prepared to go anywhere she wanted. There was a part of him that wanted nothing more than to take her as far away as possible from Boston and this villa\u2014all the places Selene\u2019s legion might begin to look for her again\u2014but she refused to run. She refused to cower or hide.</p><p>She was stronger than either of her parents; Nathan recognized that easily enough.</p><p>Jordana was gentle and sweet, innocent in many ways, but she was also fierce and courageous. If the Atlantean queen was a force to be reckoned with, she would find her granddaughter every bit her equal in terms of tenacity and the refusal to let anyone intimidate her.</p><p>It would likely surprise few to learn that royal blood, immortal blood, ran through Jordana\u2019s veins.</p><p>And now Nathan\u2019s blood ran through her too.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be more humbled by that fact. He had an entire future to make sure she never regretted giving herself to him as his mate.</p><p>A future he was eager to begin.</p><p>\u201cWe should go soon,\u201d he murmured against her brow. \u201cLazaro Archer can have the Order\u2019s private jet ready for us at any time. If I don\u2019t call him soon and make the arrangements, there\u2019s a very good chance I\u2019ll tie you to the bed and have my wicked way with you again.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, looking anything but worried. \u201cI like your wicked ways. And I also liked being on top. So maybe I\u2019ll be the one to tie you to the bed sometime.\u201d</p><p>His cock responded instantly, evidence she could see plainly enough, not to mention feel. As if to let him know she had him precisely where she wanted him, Jordana reached down and stroked his erect shaft.</p><p>On a groan, he caught her hand and linked his fingers through hers. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside before I spread you beneath me on the tiles out here.\u201d</p><p>He led her back into the villa, past the blood from the battle they\u2019d survived together and into the living area. Nathan hadn\u2019t realized until now how rich Cass\u2019s villa was with original art and other treasures.</p><p>And there was something else he hadn\u2019t noticed until now either.</p><p>A small, framed snapshot occupying a private place of honor on the far wall of the living area. It was a black-and-white photo of a young woman. A woman with long dark hair, dressed in a pale linen, ankle-length sheath. She stood on the same terrace Nathan and Jordana had just come in from, overlooking the same cliffside and coast, except she stood there under the full light of day, the sun glinting off the sheen of her hair.</p><p>Nathan frowned. \u201cIs that a picture of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d Jordana murmured at nearly the same moment, shock and wonder in her quiet reply. \u201cOh, my God. That has to be her.\u201d</p><p>She broke away from Nathan and crossed the room for a closer look. He followed, taking in the details of the candid shot, which had been captured from inside the villa by someone who clearly adored the subject.</p><p>The woman stood half turned near the railing, her delicate face dipped down toward her shoulder, wistful, smiling with a private joy. Nathan knew the elegant profile well enough: One glance in Jordana\u2019s direction would have confirmed the same high cheekbones, the small, straight nose and regal, if stubborn, chin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Soraya,\u201d Jordana whispered. She pointed to the photo, where it was just possible to see from the woman\u2019s angle the hint of a rounded belly. \u201cOh, Nathan. That\u2019s my mother and me.\u201d</p><p>Jordana carefully reached out to take the frame off its fixture on the wall. It stuck a bit, then sprang free on a soft click, followed by a mechanical whir from somewhere within the wall on which the photo had hung.</p><p>The tall millwork panel began to slide open, revealing an alcove hidden behind the false wall.</p><p>Nathan stepped back, taking Jordana with him by the arm. \u201cWhat the hell ...\u201d</p><p>He tried to sweep her behind him, but she stepped forward, unafraid. \u201cNothing in my father\u2019s house will hurt me,\u201d she reassured him.</p><p>Even so, as the panel slid all the way open, Nathan\u2019s muscles tensed for battle, his senses instantly on high alert. He realized right away his concerns were unfounded.</p><p>The panel hid another piece of Cass\u2019s art.</p><p>A sculpture, roughly a foot tall, depicting a handsome shepherd youth asleep beneath a crescent moon.</p><p>Nathan had seen this piece before.</p><p>It was on display in the exhibit Jordana had lovingly curated and unveiled to the public just the other night.</p><p>\u201cSleeping Endymion,\u201d Jordana whispered, astonished to find the sculpture here, in her father\u2019s Amalfi villa. \u201cHow can this be?\u201d</p><p>Nathan stood beside her as she gaped at the terra cotta work of art she knew so well.</p><p>Or, rather, thought she had.</p><p>Now she realized she\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>There were things she hadn\u2019t seen before. Not until this very moment.</p><p>\u201cWhen Cass came to the museum that afternoon, we talked about art. He knew so much. Seeing this place, I understand why now,\u201d she said, trying to put the puzzle together in her mind. \u201cHe asked me what my favorite piece was in the exhibit. He seemed so pleased when I told him it was this one.\u201d She shook her head as understanding dawned. \u201cNot this one precisely, but the one Cass donated to the museum anonymously twenty-some-odd years ago. It was him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? That this sculpture meant enough to Cass that he had a second one made for himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, incredulous as she inspected the piece more carefully. \u201cOh, no, Nathan. I think this may be the original. In fact, I\u2019m practically certain it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the real one?\u201d He glanced at her, scowling in question. \u201cThen the one in your exhibit at the museum ...\u201d</p><p>She nodded, completely confident that Cass had fooled them all. \u201cIt\u2019s a fake. The one in Boston is a very good, flawless reproduction. So good, it got past everyone. Even the curators and art historians who handled it before me.\u201d</p><p>Nathan peered at the sculpture more closely and blew out a sigh. \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t know. Why give the museum anything at all, if he was knowingly giving them a fake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not that important of a piece for any deliberate attempt to bait and switch. Unless\u2014\u201d She considered for a moment, then turned a look on Nathan. \u201cUnless Cass had something he wanted to hide. Maybe something else he took from the Atlantean realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething he felt would be safest hidden in plain sight,\u201d Nathan said, finishing her thought. He ran a hand over his head. \u201cHoly hell. You don\u2019t really think ...\u201d</p><p>Zael\u2019s recounting of the destruction of Atlantis came back to her in a rush.</p><p>She recalled his mention of the crystals that had once belonged to their people. The ones stolen by the enemy Ancients and used against the Atlanteans ...</p><p>And the one rumored to have vanished around the same time Cassianus whisked his infant daughter away to live as something she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>To masquerade unknowingly among the general public, protected by the simple fact that no one had any cause to suspect a thing.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Jordana murmured. \u201cI need to get back to Boston now. We need to know if my father has been hiding any other secrets all these years.\u201d</p><p>Nathan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll call Lazaro now.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Boston. Two days later.</p><p>Jordana\u2019s pleasured cry tore from her throat as she came, a sound that never failed to make Nathan grin with unrepentant male pride.</p><p>Hard as granite inside her tight, wet sheath, he was ready for the third climax certain to follow swiftly on the heels of this explosive second. He groaned as the tremors of her release rippled all along his cock, tempting him to spill. But he held steady for her. He knew what she liked, knew just how to please his insatiable, immortal mate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hands fisted where she\u2019d tied them to the headboard, muscles straining but making no effort to break loose of his bonds. He was learning to enjoy letting Jordana be in control.</p><p>Enjoy it, because eventually it would be his turn, and he loved dealing pleasure to her as mercilessly as she did to him.</p><p>She\u2019d already sucked him off once, so he was content to watch her ride him for now. Jordana rocked atop him, her breasts bouncing prettily, rosebud nipples still peaked and glistening from his kisses. She pinched them as she slid up and down his length with deliberate slowness, ruthlessly teasing him with all the fruits just outside his reach.</p> <p>\u201cYou feel so good, Nathan. I think I may never let you out of this bed.\u201d She leaned down over him then, bracing her forearms on either side of his head while she kissed him.</p><p>Her tongue slid past his teeth and fangs, deep into his mouth. Her naked body pressed all along his length made him mad with need. She squirmed and flexed the tiny muscles of her sex, milking his already engorged shaft in the best kind of agony.</p><p>Finally, he couldn\u2019t take another second more.</p><p>Ripping free of his silken restraints, he caught her in his arms and tumbled her around beneath him on the bed. He gave her a deep, hard pump of his hips, burying himself to the hilt. He picked up the tempo while increasing the depth of his thrusts, loving the way her body responded so readily to him.</p><p>He could feel her orgasm building along with his own. He felt her mounting pleasure in the heavy drum of her heartbeat and in the echoing throb of their bond. The first shudder overtook her, and she gripped his shoulders as a trembling sigh escaped her parted lips.</p> <p>She moaned and bit her bottom lip. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t play fair. You\u2019re going to make me come too fast.\u201d</p><p>Normally, he\u2019d be in no rush to finish making love with Jordana. But it was past sundown, and while the Order\u2019s patrols were called off for the night, the Boston command center was anticipating the arrival of important visitors any minute now.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll start earlier,\u201d he promised. \u201cThat way, I can make you scream all day.\u201d</p><p>She looped her arms around his neck as he pumped into her. \u201cWhy? Because it\u2019s my birthday tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I love you. Your birthday only comes once a year. We both know that\u2019s not nearly enough.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but it was swallowed up quickly by the gasp and rising cry that heralded her release. Nathan kept up his relentless rhythm, pushing her toward the brink, then toppling her over the edge with him as his own climax gripped him in a tight, pulsing fist.</p> <p>They were still flushed with passion twenty minutes later, after they\u2019d shared a quick shower and gotten dressed and ready to join everyone who had gathered in the war room that evening.</p><p>All of the North American\u2013based Order and their mates were there.</p><p>Sterling Chase and Tavia. Nathan\u2019s teammates, Rafe, Elijah, and Jax. Carys and Aric.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s mother, raven-haired, delicately beautiful Corinne, was there with her big, golden-eyed Gen One mate, Hunter, who headed up the New Orleans command. They had arrived from the D.C. headquarters with the Order\u2019s leader, Lucan Thorne, and his mate, Gabrielle, as well as Gideon and Savannah, and the New York chief, Tegan, who was there with his beloved Elise.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s recently mated friends Kellan and Mira had arrived with her adoptive parents, Nikolai and Renata, the longtime couple only weeks away from welcoming a new son, their first child together.</p><p>The rest of the stateside warriors and their mates\u2014Dante and Tess, Rio and Dylan, Kade and Alexandra, and Brock and Jenna\u2014had all assembled with the others for the express purpose of meeting Jordana.</p><p>And to see firsthand if her suspicions about her father\u2019s secrets were correct.</p><p>The object at the center of that question now sat on the war room conference table.</p> <p>As soon as Nathan and Jordana had returned to Boston, she\u2019d gone back to the museum to switch the pieces and bring Cass\u2019s remarkable fake to the Order.</p><p>More than one pair of eyes drifted to the innocuous-looking sculpted terra cotta as Nathan made the introductions among his family and extended kin of the Order and the extraordinary female who had become his mate.</p><p>His mother was visibly moved, tears glistening in her eyes, which were the same bluish green as Nathan\u2019s. She came toward him tentatively, conditioned by her son\u2019s damaged past to be careful when it came to affection and motherly warmth.</p><p>To see her caution now shamed Nathan. Truth to tell, it broke his heart a little.</p><p>So, when Corinne approached him, he moved first, bringing her petite frame into his arms.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she exclaimed, then instantly wrapped him in a sweet, loving hug. \u201cNathan, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>She was laughing through her tears as he released her and made her introduction to Jordana. The two women greeted each other warmly, and seeing them embrace was a balm Nathan hadn\u2019t realized he needed.</p><p>Nathan reached out to Hunter, clasping the former assassin\u2019s hand in a firm shake. \u201cI understand now,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be possible to feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>The massive warrior only nodded. No need for more words.</p><p>They\u2019d both come through the fire of a terrible upbringing in Dragos\u2019s labs.</p><p>Both men now stood in the light of a redeeming bond.</p><p>As Nathan and Hunter watched their mates get acquainted, Dante, one of the Order\u2019s former Boston members, who was now commander of the Seattle operation, strode over hand in hand with his Breedmate, Tess.</p><p>The pair had been talking with their son, Rafe, but now walked toward the sculpture sitting in the center of the conference table. Jordana and Corinne, Nathan and Hunter, all joined them near the piece.</p><p>Tess\u2019s smile was wistful as she looked at Sleeping Endymion, then back to her dark-haired warrior mate. \u201cTwenty years ago, we met in the art museum, in front of this very sculpture. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>Dante grunted, his mouth quirking with private humor. \u201cI remember it was the second time we met. The first time, I greeted you with my fangs in your throat and you, in turn, stuck a syringe full of animal tranquilizer in me. Well deserved, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Tess laughed. \u201cNot exactly a Hallmark moment, was it?\u201d</p><p>Dante shook his head. \u201cHearts and flowers were never my style. Fortunately, I have other gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. You definitely do,\u201d she said, wrapping her arms around him in obvious devotion.</p><p>As they all conversed and reminisced and more of the group gathered close, Gideon and his Breedmate, Savannah, came over to greet Jordana and Nathan.</p><p>The Order\u2019s resident genius had had the good sense to make gentle but strong Savannah his mate some fifty years ago. The mocha-skinned beauty\u2019s kindness and intellect were her abiding traits, but she also had an insatiable curiosity. One that was aided by the Breedmate\u2019s extrasensory talent of psychometry.</p><p>She studied the sculpture for a moment, then glanced at Jordana, a fervent, impatient eagerness in her soft brown eyes. \u201cWould it be all right ... may I touch it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jordana nodded. \u201cWe can do whatever we like with it. The sculpture\u2014and any secrets it might contain\u2014belongs to the Order now. You\u2019re all my family now. Whatever I have belongs to all of us.\u201d</p><p>And Jordana had a lot.</p><p>A vast wealth in priceless art, as it turned out. Soon after their return to Boston, Nathan and Jordana had gone to see Martin Gates. Jordana wanted the Breed male to know that she was grateful for the life he gave her as his daughter, and assured him that he would always be her family\u2014the father who raised her.</p><p>No more secrets. No more lies.</p><p>The only unknown that remained was the terra cotta piece on the table before them.</p><p>Savannah reached out cautiously, settling her hand lightly on the sculpture. No one spoke in the long moment that followed.</p><p>Then she shook her head and withdrew her touch. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s something standing in the way of my ability. Blocking it.\u201d</p><p>Lucan grunted, his dark brows knit in a heavy scowl. \u201cWe need to know what this sculpture means. Not only to the Order, but to the Atlanteans and the rest of the world.\u201d He turned his sober gray gaze on Jordana. \u201cIf this contains what you suspect, we need to understand its power and either harness it or, if necessary, take steps to destroy it.\u201d</p><p>Carys glanced at her best friend. \u201cDo you really think there\u2019s an Atlantean crystal in Endymion, Jordana?\u201d</p><p>Jordana looked up at Nathan before meeting the expectant eyes of everyone gathered in the war room. \u201cThere\u2019s one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>Lucan gave her a resolute nod, but Nathan noticed the Order\u2019s leader protectively pulled his Breedmate closer to him. The rest of the warriors did likewise with their women, everyone braced for whatever was about to occur.</p><p>Jordana lifted the sculpture in both hands.</p><p>With an indrawn breath and a confirming glance at Nathan, she released it.</p><p>The terra cotta hit the floor at her feet with a hard crash. It shattered into pieces.</p><p>In the center of the rubble lay a polished metal box about the size of her palm.</p><p>\u201cTitanium,\u201d Nikolai guessed, the blond warrior well versed in the material, having handcrafted custom bullets and blades out of the precious metal for the Order over the years.</p><p>Jordana bent down to pick up the box.</p><p>With an encouraging look from Nathan and the rest of the Order, she carefully unfastened the latch and opened the container.</p><p>A smooth, silvery crystal the size of a hen\u2019s egg rested inside.</p><p>It was remarkable, otherworldly. A thing of cosmic power and beauty.</p><p>Just like the woman holding it.</p><p>Jordana rose, looking up at Nathan and smiling. Wonder and amazement danced in her ice-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe crystal,\u201d she whispered, as everyone moved in closer to have a better look at this extraordinary treasure.</p><p>Jordana handed it off to Lucan, and Nathan took the opportunity to pull his mate into the shelter of his arms.</p><p>He kissed her, relished the feel of her body against him. Savored the feel of her heart beating in time with his.</p><p>And as he held her close, he understood with his whole heart\u2014with his entire being\u2014that whatever power the crystal might contain, with Jordana at his side, loving him as she did now, he already possessed the greatest treasure any world would ever know. </p> </body></html>"]
