To have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, from this day forward, until death do you part?\u201d</p><p>Dalton froze.</p><p>This was it. The minister\u2019s final words would pronounce them husband and wife and he would be tied to this woman permanently.</p> <p>Dalton McKay, husband.</p><p>Jesus. That sounded all wrong. Really fucking wrong.</p><p>It\u2019s just momentary cold feet. Breathe. It\u2019ll pass.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t.</p><p>Sweat beaded on his brow, dampening the collar of the white tuxedo shirt choking him like a noose.</p> <p>The flutter beneath his breastbone wasn\u2019t from nerves, but the gut instinct that\u2019d never failed to warn him to cut his losses in playing cards.</p><p>The stakes were much, much higher now.</p><p>When that debilitating panic set in, his brain split into two warring camps. One side screamed at him to just say I do and be done with it. The other side, the side breaking out in hives at the very idea of forever, yelled at him to flee.</p><p>Say I do.</p><p>Run the fuck away.</p><p>He had been gazing at Addie\u2019s face, but at some point...his unfocused gaze had landed on the Bible digging into his forearm like a painful burr.</p> <p>Dalton heard the whisper of fabric as members of the wedding party shifted nervously. The cloying scent of lilies caused his throat to swell, cutting off his air supply. The sunlight shining through the church\u2019s stained glass window threw fragmented strobe-light effects across the far wall.</p><p>And Addie\u2019s soft hand remained in his, awaiting the placement of the wedding band.</p><p>Wedding band. Married. To this woman. Forever.</p><p>Was he having a crazy booze dream after a night spent drinking too many Irish car bombs?</p><p>Or was he really standing before a minister, in front of a church packed with his and her family members, about to pledge his life and eternal love to Addie Voorhees? The town sweetheart whom everybody loved?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>No.</p><p>Dalton tried to track the source of that phantom voice. He lifted his head and looked across the altar.</p> <p>In that moment he knew; he fucking knew he couldn\u2019t do this. This was all wrong. This marriage wasn\u2019t meant to be.</p><p>Please God, forgive me, for what I\u2019m about to do.</p><p>His brother Tell cleared his throat behind him.</p><p>Addie squeezed his hand and whispered, \u201cDalton? Here\u2019s where you\u2019re supposed to say I do.\u201d</p><p>He finally met Addie\u2019s eyes. Loving brown eyes that would soon lose the look of adoration and fill with disbelief or hatred. Or both.</p><p>Dalton released her hand and whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Addie. But this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Dalton, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scaring myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so great, in so many ways, but I can\u2019t marry you. I just...can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Dalton gave in to his flight instinct, shouldering his brothers aside as he left the altar and slipped out the side door of the church.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Three years and four months later...</p><p>Bang bang bang. \u201cDalton! Come on man, open up. I know you\u2019re in there.\u201d</p><p>Dalton cracked one eyelid and cast a bleary eye at the alarm clock. Seven a.m. He yanked the quilt over his head and mumbled \u201cfuck off\u201d to Boden Hicks, the idiot beating on his door.</p><p>\u201cMcKay. I\u2019m not fucking around. This is an emergency.\u201d</p><p>That hauled Dalton\u2019s ass out of bed. He unlatched the old-fashioned bolt and opened the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s the emergency?\u201d</p><p>Boden hustled inside but a gust of snow followed before he slammed the heavy oak door shut. He stamped his feet. \u201cDamn snowstorm came from out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not have tricked me out of bed to complain about the goddamned weather.\u201d</p><p>Boden shuffled over to the woodstove to warm himself, but it\u2019d been a good ten hours since Dalton had loaded it up. \u201cIt\u2019s like a damn freezer in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I was sleeping. In my own bed, after roughing it on an elk hunt, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember. I\u2019m just glad the hunting party made it out before this storm hit.\u201d Boden unzipped his parka and pulled out Dalton\u2019s cell phone, still attached to the wall charger. \u201cNormally I could give a crap if you stay in bed a week after a hunt, but you left your phone charging at the lodge last night. The thing\u2019s been buzzing like crazy. When I unplugged it, I noticed you\u2019ve got twenty-seven missed calls. So it\u2019s gotta be something important.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s stomach knotted. Since he had little to no cell service in the mountains, he forgot he even had a cell phone most of the time. Few people had his number\u2014just his brothers, his mother, his cousin Sierra McKay, his accountant, his banker and his investment guys.</p><p>\u201cGimme that.\u201d Dalton scrolled through the missed calls. Twelve from Brandt, twelve from Tell, three from Sierra.</p><p>Had to be bad news if his family had reached out to him.</p><p>The family he hadn\u2019t seen in three years.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at Boden. \u201cNo clue. I haven\u2019t bothered to set up my voice mail on this phone so I\u2019ll have to call to find out.\u201d</p><p>Boden sighed. \u201cSpeaking of...I wanted to make sure your two-way is charged. Since you have an issue with technology that allows people to get in touch with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s charged. I laid in a store of food before the huntin\u2019 trip so I can ride out the storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re supposed to get a foot of snow today and maybe more tonight.\u201d Boden crouched in front of the woodstove and chucked kindling in the cold embers before setting the torch to the pile. \u201cMight be a couple days before you can get out, if you need to go home.\u201d</p><p>Home. It didn\u2019t have the same connotation it once did. When it was all he\u2019d known. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know what\u2019s goin\u2019 on as soon as I know.\u201d</p><p>Boden piled several small logs in the black box before he stood. \u201cYou worried?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged.</p><p>But Boden didn\u2019t buy his act; he never had, which was why they\u2019d become such good friends. \u201cYou want me to stick around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ll put on a pot of coffee before I call my brother.\u201d He smirked. \u201cGet on back to the lodge. Bree would jam my nuts in a vise if you got snowed in with me instead of with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour nuts ain\u2019t ever gonna be anywhere near my wife\u2019s hands, McKay.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI know your kink doesn\u2019t extend to sharing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Boden zipped up his parka and slipped on his gloves. \u201cYou need anything, buzz us. If we don\u2019t answer right away\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll assume you\u2019re tied up. Or rather, you\u2019re tying Bree up.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Boden left, Dalton started coffee. Then he stripped off his long johns and took a cold shower. That ensured he\u2019d be fully awake.</p><p>The main room of the three-room cabin had warmed up by the time he\u2019d dressed. After downing two cups of coffee, Dalton stood by the window in the kitchen and called Brandt.</p><p>His oldest brother answered on the fourth ring. \u201c\u2019Bout damn time, Dalton. Where the hell have you been that you can\u2019t return a phone call?\u201d</p><p>No doubt Brandt thought he was fucking off someplace. Little did he know how tiring it was leading a ten-day hunting party into the mountains. But Dalton no longer explained his life choices to anyone. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on? I had twenty-four missed calls in the last twelve hours.\u201d No one knew Sierra had his number. His brothers would be pissed if they knew Dalton kept in better contact with Sierra than with them.</p><p>\u201cDad had a stroke.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Finally Dalton asked, \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive, if that\u2019s what you mean. He\u2019s havin\u2019 difficulties talkin\u2019. They\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s permanent. They\u2019re not too sure of anything at this point. So we\u2014me\u2019n Tell\u2014are asking you to come home.\u201d</p><p>Dalton closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to play nursemaid to the man who\u2019d made his life hell. Especially not after the last conversation they\u2019d had, which was the biggest reason Dalton had left Sundance for good\u2014not that he\u2019d told his brothers or anyone else about what\u2019d gone down. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t? Or won\u2019t?\u201d Brandt demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, bro. Brandt put you on speaker phone,\u201d Tell said. \u201cLook, we need you to help us make some decisions about Dad\u2019s care.\u201d</p><p>Dalton let his forehead rest against the frosted windowpane.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen you in over three years. It sucks that something like this had to happen for you to even consider comin\u2019 home. But we do need you here.\u201d</p><p>He pictured his brothers, Tell leaning against the window in the cab of Brandt\u2019s truck, his restless fingers tapping on his leg. Brandt seated behind the steering wheel, his posture stiff, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>\u201cBrandt got a call from the hospital in Spearfish yesterday morning. They wouldn\u2019t let us see him until late afternoon. Soon as we had some information, we tried calling you.\u201d Tell paused. \u201cYou ain\u2019t gotten any better at returning calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did return it. Not fast enough for you?\u201d he asked sharply. Jesus. Within two minutes of talking to his brothers he\u2019d reverted to the defensive guy he\u2019d left behind. He exhaled slowly. \u201cSorry. Cell service here is spotty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t feel guilty they don\u2019t know. \u201cAlder, Montana. We\u2019re in the midst of a blizzard so it might be a couple days before I can make it out of the mountains.\u201d</p><p>Silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHas the doctor given you a time frame on how long he\u2019ll be in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cBut when Dad is discharged, it\u2019ll be to the rehab wing in a nursing home.\u201d</p><p>That oughta make Casper even more the patient from hell. \u201cSounds like it won\u2019t matter then if I\u2019m not there for a couple of days. I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Will you be staying with one of us?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ve got it covered. Thanks though.\u201d</p><p>Neither of his brothers asked where he\u2019d be bunking down, although he sensed they wanted to.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I guess we\u2019ll see you when we see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Later.\u201d Dalton hung up.</p> <p>He stared out the window for the longest time, even though he couldn\u2019t see shit through the swirling snow.</p><p>But this storm wasn\u2019t anything compared to the one he faced in Sundance.</p><p>The blizzard lasted two days. On the morning of the third day Dalton packed up his stuff, closed up his cabin and headed down the mountain.</p><p>Once he had a clear cell signal, he gave Brandt a heads up he was on his way. Brandt said they\u2019d moved Casper to the rehab wing and to meet them there.</p><p>Then he placed a call to Sierra.</p><p>She answered with, \u201cI swear every time I call you and I don\u2019t hear back I live in mortal fear that you\u2019ve disconnected from the world completely and you\u2019re out in the forest running naked with woodchucks and shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot hardly. I returned the calls in order of importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve talked to your brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m on my way to Wyoming right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey giving you grief about...well, everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey both knew it wouldn\u2019t take much for me to refuse to come back.\u201d He flipped on the defroster. \u201cHow\u2019d you find out about Casper\u2019s stroke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely. I knew your brothers would get a hold of you first, so my call isn\u2019t about your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you call?\u201d Dalton heard her take a deep breath and he went on full alert.</p><p>In a rush, Sierra said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to promise me that you won\u2019t get mad at me for what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo conversation ever ends well that starts that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I want you to remember I was only following your parameters. And I kinda hoped someone else would tell you about this, so I didn\u2019t have to. But then, you\u2019d have to actually talk to someone who lives there, and we both know that\u2019s a rarity, so I guess it falls to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been drinkin\u2019? \u2019Cause you ain\u2019t making a lick of sense. Quit dancing around the subject, college girl, and spill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory is back in Sundance and working for Wyoming Natural Resource Council.\u201d</p><p>Everything switched into slow motion. Dalton couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t think. He had to pull onto the shoulder so he didn\u2019t wreck his truck.</p><p>\u201cDalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said Rory is livin\u2019 in Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith her fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She, ah, broke off the engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months ago.\u201d</p><p>This was not happening. Sierra had not kept this information from him about Rory for half a goddamned year.</p><p>\u201cDalton. I know your head is about to explode\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Sierra, do you fucking think? Why are you just telling me this now?\u201d he roared. \u201cDo you have any fucking idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ve been holed up in the middle of freakin\u2019 nowhere moping because Rory got engaged to someone else? Why yes, I was completely aware of that little factoid, cuz.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cBesides, you were doing your lumberjack gig and completely off the grid when Rory ended the engagement. I\u2019ll remind you of your zero tolerance policy\u2014me not talking about Rory or sharing information about Rory\u2019s life was your edict, Dalton. I was just following your parameters. And now the parameters have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously not fucking amused. Will you just get to the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really have to point out that you and Rory will actually be in the same place for the first time in over three years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years? Try ten years since she\u2019s lived there. I\u2019da been in Sundance six months ago if I\u2019d known she was there without some other asshole\u2019s ring on her finger,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Take a step back, wolverine. I\u2019m telling you now because maybe you\u2019re smart enough to handle it the right way this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time?\u201d Dalton repeated sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t make this out to be my fault. I offered her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t snap at me or interrupt me again or I will hang up, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, keep talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory is my sister. You\u2019re my business partner and one of the few people I trust. I hate that I\u2019m pulled between you two. It\u2019s time you manned up, Dalton. And don\u2019t remind me that you did that once three years ago after you walked out on your own wedding. Even you can admit it was piss poor timing on your part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that bad timing didn\u2019t stop her from giving me an edict, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve told you ten thousand times, that wasn\u2019t an edict. Two years was a time line for Rory to finish grad school and a frame of reference for you to understand how important that was to her. You shouldn\u2019t have taken it as gospel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she shouldn\u2019t have given me false hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have turned tail and run again,\u201d Sierra retorted. \u201cEspecially after you gave her false hope that things might finally change between you two.\u201d</p><p>Like he needed that reminder. \u201cDoes she know about Casper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful. She\u2019s been out of town and she stays out of McKay gossip completely.\u201d</p><p>Then Rory wouldn\u2019t suspect Dalton was on his way back to Sundance. The element of surprise might work in his favor. \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to approach her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe bartends at the Twin Pines on the side. She\u2019s working tonight. Anything else I can do for you besides making your day with this news?\u201d Sierra asked sweetly.</p><p>Making his day? Hell, she\u2019d made his life, because now he had a shot at getting the life he wanted. \u201cWhere are the keys for the house in town?\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>Sierra heaved a put-upon sigh. \u201cThey\u2019re under the back deck on a key hook. But there are two conditions before I\u2019ll let you stay there. First, you don\u2019t tell anyone I own it. No one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. And FYI, that\u2019s why we have a silent partnership.\u201d He\u2019d supplied Sierra with some capital to start her own business last year and he also wanted it kept on the down low. \u201cWhat\u2019s the second condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a handyman to do some things. Okay, a lot of things. You\u2019re handy, you\u2019re there and voila\u2014you\u2019re selected. I\u2019ll FedEx my repair list today but anything else you see that needs fixed just go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it but I want to be reimbursed once a week for whatever I buy. You don\u2019t get to pull that sixty day wait for payment bull crap like you money people usually do.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s how we become money people. We hold on to money as long as possible. Be warned, some of what needs done will be major costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t a carpet installer,\u201d he warned. \u201cNor will I put in windows.\u201d</p><p>Sierra sighed again. \u201cYou are a handy handyman, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to trust me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be keeping tabs on you.\u201d Another pause. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your dad. If you need to talk about anything\u2014except for Rory\u2014call me.\u201d</p><p>By the time Dalton crossed into Crook County hours later, he had a plan in place.</p><p>Patience. Perseverance. He would not blow this chance.</p><p>Rory Wetzler was his. His. She always had been, she always would be.</p><p>And he\u2019d do whatever it took to prove it.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cRory, can I get two Bud Light drafts and a cherry Coke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing right up.\u201d She pulled the tap and dumped cherry juice over ice, aiming a stream of cola at the glass and swapping the full beer mug for an empty one. She lined the order on the bar top, then wandered to help a new customer.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she poured herself a Coke and leaned against the counter. Old man Duffy grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Duff. What\u2019s that look for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed you last week. Where were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a two-day conference in Rock Springs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. I thought you mighta bailed on us. Can\u2019t for the life of me understand why you\u2019re still slinging drinks at the Twin Pines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy job with the state is part-time. So while I\u2019m waiting for a fulltime position to open up or a decent job in my field to magically become available, I\u2019m working here to make ends meet.\u201d Rory chomped on a piece of ice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a waste. A gorgeous blonde amazon woman like you oughta be home every night, bein\u2019 spoiled rotten by a man who appreciates and worships you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNow there\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was fifty years younger...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take you up on it.\u201d And she would, no lie. Her love life\u2014for lack of a better term\u2014was a joke. She\u2019d had one date in the last six months since she\u2019d returned to Sundance. A pity date from the plumber who installed a new toilet at the Wyoming Natural Resources Council office where she worked.</p><p>She\u2019d jumped out of the dating pool for almost a year when she\u2019d been with Dillon. While she had no regrets about breaking off their engagement, she was lonely. She missed the companionship, even when that companionship was what had driven her away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rory kept telling herself that it was better to be dateless and alone than married to the wrong man.

Twenty-eight years old, with a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree, and she was still slinging drinks for tips. She was still living in the same small hometown in the same small cabin she\u2019d grown up in.</p><p>The more things changed the more they stayed the same.</p> <p>But she\u2019d had a full, exciting life in college, which made it worse, living in Dullsville, USA again. She\u2019d joined several exchange programs during grad school, which had added almost two years to the time it took to earn her degree. But it\u2019d been worth it, seeing the world outside of Wyoming. She\u2019d spent half a year in South America studying tropical land conservation practices. She\u2019d lived on a large cattle ranch on the big island of Hawaii. She\u2019d mapped wildlife habitats and migration patterns in Alaska and Canada.</p><p>After graduation she\u2019d interned for a year with the Wyoming State Parks Department. But the hiring freeze meant she didn\u2019t land a permanent job after the internship ended. Her relationship with Dillon, her boss in the WSPD office in Cheyenne, had hit the skids at the same time, so taking a part-time position with the WNRC in Moorcroft had been a no brainer. Her living expenses were next to nothing. Working part-time gave her time to apply for jobs all over the country, with every agency under the sun.</p><p>Pity she hadn\u2019t bothered sending off any applications in the past month\u2014she could only take so much rejection. Maybe that was another sign of depression? Or boredom? She knew it wasn\u2019t a sign of contentment.</p><p>At least her mom seemed happy to have her around, although she and her husband, Gavin, were joined at the hip and lips when they weren\u2019t traveling across the country. Most of her friends in the area were married or in a steady relationship. Even her stepsister Sierra was all grown up and living in Arizona while she attended ASU. Rory got a little misty-eyed thinking about when Sierra had shown up at the Twin Pines with her dad and Rory\u2019s mom on her twenty-first birthday so Rory could make her first legal drink. She missed that sweet little brat.</p><p>\u201cRory? You are a sight for my tired old eyes today.\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at a new customer and grinned. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Donald, my favorite bald man. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wind for one thing. Getting cold out there.\u201d He rubbed his hands together.</p><p>\u201cYou want the usual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m feeling daring tonight. How about you add an extra kick to my red beer? A couple slices of jalape\u00f1os, some of them peppers and a handful of olives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Just like that her mood brightened. Hard to pity yourself when faced with a cancer survivor who\u2019d been through chemotherapy hell. But Donald was always upbeat. Her favorite part of bartending was talking to customers. If she was totally honest, she hadn\u2019t taken the bartending gig because she needed money, but to stave off loneliness. Hard to believe she could be lonely in her hometown, but she did spend many of her nonworking hours by herself. At least slinging drinks gave her some social interactions.</p><p>Rory slid the drink in front of Donald. \u201cTaste it. If it\u2019s too spicy I\u2019ll dump it out and start fresh.\u201d</p> <p>He sipped. Smacked his lips and grinned. \u201cPerfect. Your talent is wasted here, Rory girl. You oughta be in New York City, making killer tips as head mixologist or whatever fancy name they\u2019re calling bartenders these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the compliment, but I\u2019m too much of a bumpkin to ever work with sophisticated clientele and booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re things going at the day job? You been out massaging black-footed ferrets\u2019 poor tired feet and polishing the horns on the horn-billed prairie grouse?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. Like most lifelong Ag men, Donald poked fun at state wildlife and conservation agencies\u2019 policies. But unlike other men she\u2019d run across, he meant it tongue-in-cheek. \u201cI can always hope that\u2019s on my to-do list at the office tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you catch one, let me know. My wife\u2019s got a killer recipe for poached grouse.\u201d</p><p>Rory groaned at his pun.</p><p>An hour later the crowd had dwindled. She asked Naomi, the manager, to watch the bar so she could take a break.</p><p>As she left the bathroom, a hulking guy barreled toward her. His hair was as unkempt as his scraggly beard. She flattened herself against the wall to let him pass, but he boxed her in. At six foot one, she was used to towering over most men. But this ZZ Top impersonator topped her by two inches.</p> <p>Then he was in her face.</p><p>\u201cLook, buddy, I don\u2019t know what you want, but I don\u2019t have any cash on me and if you don\u2019t back off, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory.\u201d</p><p>She froze. That deep voice. The way he said her name reminded her of... No. Couldn\u2019t be him. He\u2019d just up and disappeared from her life three years ago without a word and as far as she knew, no one knew where he\u2019d gone.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus. You\u2019re even prettier than I remembered.\u201d He ran his knuckles down her jawline.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Rory jerked her head away. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you think you are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t know who I am, do you?\u201d</p><p>She had a split second of recognition right before he said, \u201cIt\u2019s me. Dalton.\u201d</p><p>And then he kissed her.</p><p>When Dalton tried to deepen the kiss, Rory shifted. He automatically twisted his pelvis to protect his crotch\u2014the crazy woman had kneed him in the \u2019nads before\u2014so the swift punch to the gut caught him unprepared. He stumbled back a step and managed to duck when he saw Rory\u2019s fist headed for his head.</p><p>Out of reflex he grabbed both her wrists in one hand, trapping her hands between them as he pinned her against the wall. \u201cThe gut punch and haymaker might lead me to believe you\u2019re not as happy to see me as I am to see you.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s breathing was choppy. Her pulse jumped erratically beneath his fingers. And her eyes, those stunning green eyes stared back at him with suspicion and just a little hatred.</p><p>Great.</p><p>What did you expect? That she\u2019d fall into your arms?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stronger and quicker than you used to be,\u201d Rory said.</p><p>\u201cGot tired of getting my ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserved it most of the time.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna take another swing at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you try to kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be worth a black eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Now her eyes held panic. Awesome. \u201cRory\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton,\u201d she said sharply, cutting him off. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me go and come up to the bar and I\u2019ll make you a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t turn you into a pariah for associating with me, jungle girl.\u201d</p><p>Her lips formed a sneer. \u201cYou reminding me of the times when we were kids and I didn\u2019t hate you isn\u2019t helping your case, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it ain\u2019t hurting it, either.\u201d He released her.</p><p>\u201cDid you go to law school since I last saw you? Because that was a lawyer\u2019s tactic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I cornered you. I wanted to plead my case without interruptions. Or without anyone recognizing me.\u201d</p><p>Rory gave him the wide smile that made his heart skip a beat. \u201cI doubt your mother would recognize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll see if that holds true later this week.\u201d Dalton slumped against the wall next to her.</p><p>\u201cFYI, no one is gunning for you anymore about jilting Addie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that she married Truman. I\u2019m happy for them.\u201d</p><p>A few beats later, she said, \u201cEnough with the bullshit small talk and you trying to maul me, Grizzly Adams. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. Grizzly Adams. \u201cIn Sundance? Or at the Twin Pines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Sundance because Casper had a stroke.\u201d</p><p>The hard glint to her eyes softened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t talk. And without coming across like a dick, that ain\u2019t all bad. Weather was shitty in Montana and I just got here mid-afternoon. Saw Casper, took a rash of shit from my brothers and I figured what the hell. Why not add your scorn to the crap I\u2019ve dealt with today? Facing my demons and all that.\u201d</p><p>Rory cocked her head. \u201cI\u2019m a demon for you?\u201d</p><p>Dalton couldn\u2019t stop himself from touching her beautiful face. \u201cYou\u2019re my biggest demon. I wish things had happened differently. But at the time...I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. I had no idea you were livin\u2019 in Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra.\u201d</p><p>Rory muttered, \u201cI\u2019m gonna kick her ass. You\u2019re back in Sundance for...how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. So can we get together and talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what about,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAct like everything was just a misunderstanding and give me those goddamned puppy dog eyes, Dalton. You know what you did to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think it was easy for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Because you left the next day. The very next day, after you told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I at least deserve a chance to explain?\u201d</p><p>Rory laughed bitterly. \u201cFat chance, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Then he was done being a nice guy. Dalton blocked her body with his. \u201cYou\u2019ll give me a chance or I\u2019ll seize the chance when it arises and I won\u2019t give a damn about whether it\u2019s convenient for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike right now?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhen I\u2019m working?\u201d</p><p>His mouth brushed her ear. \u201cSo I\u2019d pick a time and pick a place for us to meet if I were you, or make no mistake, it will be on my terms.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPushy bastard. Fine. I\u2019ll meet you. Now get your scruff outta my face, Chewbacca. I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed and eased back. \u201cTell me where and tell me when we\u2019re meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work at the WNRC tomorrow. I\u2019m on call for the happy hour shift here tomorrow night. So how about if I call you?\u201d</p> <p>Nice try. \u201cSure. But since you don\u2019t have my number...\u201d Dalton grabbed her left arm and pressed her body against the wall. He removed the Sharpie from his pocket and quickly scrawled his digits down her forearm.</p><p>\u201cOmigod, you are such a pain in my ass,\u201d Rory snapped. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have just written it on a scrap of paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Keeping hold of her arm, and locking his gaze on hers, he kissed her wrist. \u201cBecause you\u2019d conveniently lose it. I want you seeing that number and thinkin\u2019 of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair is fair. Gimme that.\u201d She snatched the Sharpie, pushed up the sleeve of his thermal shirt and printed her digits much larger.</p><p>He bit back a laugh when she realized what she\u2019d done\u2014now even if she didn\u2019t call him, he could call her. \u201cThanks. But you forgot to kiss it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. And for the record? I hate the beard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted.\u201d</p><p>She turned and stormed off.</p><p>Dalton let her get to the end of the hallway before he said, \u201cRory.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy to see you again. And this time I\u2019m not goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Then he slipped out the side exit.</p><p>After Rory got home, she paced, a glass of bourbon in her hand.</p><p>I\u2019m really happy to see you again.</p><p>Hah. What was she supposed to do with that? Believe him?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Everything about this was so wrong and had the potential to fuck up her head again. Dalton being in Sundance, showing up at her job. Acting so un-Dalton-like, sweet and contrite.</p><p>Bull. He acted like that all the time when he wanted something from you, and it worked every time with you.</p><p>No. She wasn\u2019t falling for this again. She\u2019d been down this road with him before.</p> <p>Three times as a matter of fact.</p><p>Rory drained her drink and flopped in the big Papasan chair, pulling her knees up to her chest. She closed her eyes. Maybe she\u2019d drift off before the memories crushed her.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>For days after the unexpected and abrupt halt to the wedding, Rory had remained by Addie\u2019s side. Listening to her cry. Being the supportive best friend. Running interference with Addie\u2019s family members who were out for Dalton\u2019s head on a spike. Or a bloodletting. Or both.</p><p>But Rory hadn\u2019t chimed in about Dalton McKay\u2019s status as douchebag supreme. Yes, it hurt to see Addie\u2019s misery, but a part of her\u2014a very large part\u2014wasn\u2019t surprised. Rory had been a victim of Dalton\u2019s douchebag ways\u2014not that she\u2019d ever shared those moments with Addie. Some things were just too embarrassing to share with anyone.</p><p>So when Dalton had fled the ceremony, Rory had been relieved. He was intuitive enough to know the marriage wouldn\u2019t work, wouldn\u2019t last, and he\u2019d done the right thing in stopping it before it started. Maybe he could\u2019ve come to that determination before he was literally ready to say I do but she\u2019d secretly given him props for doing the right thing for once in his life.</p><p>After several of Addie\u2019s relatives bragged to her that they\u2019d dished out the beating Dalton deserved, and no one had seen the man since\u2014she\u2019d gone looking for him.</p><p>Maybe it was luck, maybe it was karma, maybe it was fate that Rory had found Dalton in the wooded area by the creek where they\u2019d played as kids.</p><p>Dalton had been shocked to see her. The way he\u2019d cringed against the rock, he\u2019d expected to feel her wrath too.</p><p>In that moment, the June day became so clear she could feel the cool breeze flowing from the river. She could smell the dank, half-decayed leaves on the sun-warmed dirt. She could see the dappled light streaming through the treetops.</p><p>She remembered the bruises, cuts and swelling on Dalton McKay\u2019s face.</p><p>He\u2019d looked at her and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m hoping you\u2019re unarmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Although I\u2019ll point out I could make a killing selling your location to the rest of Addie\u2019s relatives who haven\u2019t taken a shot at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be much of a contest. I\u2019d lie down like the dog I am and let them kick the crap outta me.\u201d</p><p>Rory sat next to him on the rock and tilted her face toward the cloudless, vibrant blue sky.</p><p>Neither said anything for a while.</p><p>Dalton spoke first. \u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d</p><p>Instinct. \u201cI figured since no one could find you it was worth checking here.\u201d</p><p>His gaze turned suspicious. \u201cHas my family been lookin\u2019 for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rory\u2019s eyes took in every bruise, scrape and bump on his face. \u201cI assume everyone you\u2019ve run across has been hard on you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton rubbed the bruise on his jaw. \u201cA couple of Addie\u2019s cousins caught me outside the convenience store in Moorcroft. Mean little fuckers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey responsible for the shiner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Two of her uncles and her aunt cornered me in Hulett. Got a knot on the side of my head where the woman hit me with a marble cheeseboard. Guess she decided not to take back the wedding gift she\u2019d bought us and repurposed it as a weapon instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not even funny.\u201d</p><p>Dalton sighed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Especially not when I consider the worst beating came from Truman. Guess Addie\u2019s tears turned him into a superhero revenge seeker for jilted brides. The asshole popped me in the mouth hard enough to loosen a tooth, kicked me in the ribs and punched me in the fucking kidney. I pissed blood for two goddamned days. Thing of it is...I deserved it.\u201d</p><p>Silence settled between them again.</p><p>Now when she finally had the chance to ask him the question that\u2019d kept her up at night for months, her lips seemed glued shut.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rory. I know you\u2019ve got something to say to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked him quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhy what? Why did I walk away from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why did you ask her to marry you in the first place?\u201d</p><p>He picked up a rock and chucked it into the water. \u201cWasn\u2019t that what I was supposed to do? Time to settle down, they said. Time to grow up, they said. So half of my family was lookin\u2019 at me like I was a defective human because no woman would stay with me longer than a couple of weeks. The other half of my family was lookin\u2019 at my single status as an affront to their family values. Like I was clinging too hard to the wild McKay reputations they\u2019d built over the years. Since they were all done with it, I should be too. Bear in mind many of them didn\u2019t get married and settle down until they were well into their thirties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere either of the McKay camps right?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not...some smooth operator like most of them.\u201d He shot her a sheepish look. \u201cAs you know firsthand. After Tell and Georgia got together, I was the odd man out everywhere. Spending time alone...never really been my thing. I always had my brothers or my cousins around. And without sounding like this is a fucking pity party, I may as well have been a ghost. So I spent a lot of time on the road, learning to be by myself, doin\u2019 what I wanted to do. Then last summer after you went to South America, Addie and I ended up shooting pool at the Golden Boot. Shocked the shit outta me that she didn\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Addie doesn\u2019t hate anyone.\u201d</p><p>He raised a dark eyebrow. \u201cI assumed you\u2019d told her about us?\u201d</p><p>Rory shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI never mentioned those, ah, incidents either when she and I started hanging out. She\u2019s a sweet woman, nice to the core, everyone in town loves her and after three months of dating, she told me that she loved me.\u201d</p><p>Rory clenched her jaw to keep it shut.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s pathetic? I was so desperate at that point in my life for someone to profess their love for me that I proposed to her. She said yes and I figured we\u2019d make a good life together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought I did, until...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil what?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth. Closed it. Picked up another rock and threw it.</p><p>Pushing was her way, but this time, she didn\u2019t push. Part of her was afraid to hear him voice her suspicions out loud.</p><p>\u201cSo we set the wedding date. Everyone was happy.\u201d</p><p>Were you happy?</p><p>\u201cAddie focused her worries on the flavor of the cake and the color and monogramming on the napkins. I kept a lid on my worries. I convinced myself it was nerves. All men get screwed up thinkin\u2019 about becoming a husband, and a provider, and only bein\u2019 with one woman for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t talk to your brothers, your cousins, your friends\u2014anybody\u2014about this since they\u2019d gone through it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Then he went quiet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all I get about how you decided to leave my best friend standing alone in front of a church full of people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t? You won\u2019t is more like it,\u201d she spat.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know why? I\u2019ll tell you. But you answer this first. How did you react when you found out Addie and I were getting married?\u201d</p><p>Sick to my stomach. Jealous. Mad. She tossed out a cool, \u201cI was all right with it.\u201d</p><p>Dalton met her gaze head on. \u201cBullshit. I\u2019m bein\u2019 honest with you, at least have the goddamn balls to be the same with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I was upset, okay? You and Addie aren\u2019t a good match. But how could I say that to her? How could I be negative, without giving our stupid past history as the reason for my negativity? Especially when she immediately asked me to be her maid of honor? I had to suck it up, McKay. Act like I was happy for her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Those blue eyes turned shrewd. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t happy.

You offered it to her so she took it.\u201d Immediately Rory regretted blurting that out. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry because it\u2019s true?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Rory exhaled. \u201cLook, you should\u2019ve been honest with her when you started having doubts.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. A little hysterically.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou insisted on this honesty thing, you damn well better stick to it.\u201d</p> <p>His blue eyes were fierce when he got in her face. \u201cI had worries, not doubts, certainly not flat-out what the fuck am I doin\u2019 thoughts prior to putting on my tuxedo last Saturday morning. I didn\u2019t feel that doubt, that absolute wrongness of standing in front of a minister, about to promise my devotion and my life to the wrong woman until...\u201d</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t back down and she wouldn\u2019t let him either. \u201cUntil...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I looked across the altar and saw you.\u201d</p><p>Every molecule of air left her body.</p><p>\u201cIn that moment I knew marrying her would be the biggest mistake of my life. Don\u2019t insult me and pretend you didn\u2019t feel it when I looked at you, Rory.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d felt it. Everything she\u2019d ever wanted from him had been right there in his eyes...as he was about to marry her best friend.</p> <p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve had several days to do nothin\u2019 but think about this fucking mess, I realized if you\u2019d been here instead of in South America, I never would\u2019ve proposed to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod. You are not seriously blaming this on me, Dalton McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying if you\u2019d been around I would\u2019ve been reminded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what? Of all the great times we\u2019ve had together in the last six years? Let\u2019s not forget all the shitty things that you\u2019ve done to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dalton grabbed her upper arms and yanked her closer. \u201cShitty things we\u2019ve done to each other. You\u2019re not completely blameless in this, Rory.\u201d</p><p>She hated the truth in that statement. He\u2019d acted; she\u2019d reacted. She closed her eyes. \u201cStop. Let go of me, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we keep doing this to each other? You should\u2019ve just married her and we\u2019d be done with this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, goddammit, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Rory lifted her chin and met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no idea on how to make this right. It\u2019s all too...raw right now.\u201d His eyes were filled with anguish. \u201cI won\u2019t compound the problem and ruin a friendship between you and Addie by asking you to be with me here. Even when that\u2019s what I want.\u201d He reached for her ponytail, sifting the long strands through his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be with you anyway. My life is in Laramie, not here. I\u2019ve got two years left before I get my master\u2019s degree. I\u2019ve busted my ass my entire academic life to get to this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be when I\u2019m done with school. But I know exactly where you\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure of that.\u201d</p><p>Now Rory knew he was bullshitting her. His McKay roots were sunk deep in ranching, his family and Wyoming. He\u2019d never leave.</p><p>Except...last time they\u2019d crossed paths, he\u2019d mentioned feeling untethered. She thought he\u2019d found an anchor in Addie. But now he made it sound like she\u2014Aurora Rose Wetzler\u2014was the missing piece in his life.</p><p>Don\u2019t get your hopes up.</p><p>Confused by his mixed signals and the stupid girlish hope that things would work out between them like they were supposed to, she scooted off the rock.</p><p>\u201cRory. Don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here with you, Dalton. I need...time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. When can we talk again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI leave for Laramie on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>She started up the path toward her house.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave things like this. Please.\u201d</p><p>When had Dalton McKay ever said please? She found herself stopping and facing him. \u201cWhen do you want to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome by my house tomorrow night. We\u2019ll figure it out this time. I swear.\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d showed up to find him gone. No note. No text. No nothing. Just...gone.</p><p>And he\u2019d stayed gone for over three years.</p><p>She\u2019d been right not to trust him, not to pin her hopes on that one perfect moment they\u2019d shared\u2014because maybe it hadn\u2019t been as perfect as she\u2019d remembered.</p><p>Question was: what did he want from her now?</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Dalton had agreed to meet his brothers at Brandt and Jessie\u2019s place. Things had been strained between them at the rehab hospital the previous afternoon. They hadn\u2019t recognized him at first, and then they\u2019d given him a rash of crap about turning into a Montana mountain man. There\u2019d been a thread of unease in all their conversations, so it\u2019d be interesting to see if they\u2019d hide their hostility when they weren\u2019t in public or whether they\u2019d toss it down like a gauntlet.</p><p>A few things had changed at Brandt and Jessie\u2019s house. A jungle gym, a tree house and a swing set were situated behind a new two car garage. A line of trees had been planted on the left side of the house. The expanded garden was enclosed by a five-foot-high fence. The improvements over the years allowed Dalton to forget he\u2019d been raised here. Much happier memories were being made in the house these days.</p><p>Tell\u2019s truck was parked next to Brandt\u2019s. An SUV, probably Georgia\u2019s, was lined up behind it.</p><p>For some reason Dalton\u2019s gut knotted climbing the steps.</p><p>Jessie opened the door and threw herself into his arms. \u201cDalton McKay, I was beginning to wonder if you\u2019d ever come home.\u201d She squeezed him tightly\u2014as if she really was happy to see him. When she pulled back, she hastily wiped her tears.</p><p>His stomach dropped. \u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe missed you, okay?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe all did. It\u2019s been harder on him than he\u2019ll ever admit. Yes, we have our own family now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t...\u201d She stopped. Inhaled. Smiled. \u201cSorry. Too soon for this.\u201d She reached up and ruffled his beard. \u201cBrandt warned me, but it in no way prepared me for how different you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrizzly Adams is one of the least offensive comparisons that\u2019ve been made,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cCome in. We\u2019re all bustin\u2019 our buttons for you to meet the newest McKays.\u201d</p><p>Dalton wiped off his boots and shrugged out of his Carhartt jacket. When he looked up, he saw Tell with a black-haired boy cocked on his hip.</p><p>\u201cJackson, that\u2019s your Uncle Dalton. You wanna go say hi?\u201d</p><p>Jackson yelled, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur two-year-old\u2019s favorite word,\u201d Georgia said behind him.</p><p>He turned and grinned at his pregnant sister-in-law. \u201cIs it my brother\u2019s goal to keep you knocked up?\u201d</p><p>Georgia hugged him. \u201cIt\u2019s a McKay plot, since Jess has another bun in the oven too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly sh...shoot.\u201d He glanced over at his brother and sis-in-law. \u201cCongrats.\u201d</p><p>Then two boys raced into the room and Jackson squealed to be let down. They skidded to a stop in front of Dalton. Hard to believe the last time he\u2019d seen Tucker the kid had just started walking. He\u2019d never met Wyatt, Brandt and Jessie\u2019s two-and-a-half-year-old son. Tucker looked like Brandt, dark-haired and stocky. Wyatt had lighter hair and Jessie\u2019s hazel eyes. They didn\u2019t look like brothers.</p><p>That thought sliced him to the bone because everyone used to say that about him and his brothers.</p><p>Not the time nor the place to think about this.</p><p>He crouched down. \u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p><p>Jackson joined his cousins in staring at Dalton.</p><p>\u201cWhy you got that long beard?\u201d Tucker asked. \u201cYou hidin\u2019 scars on your face or something?\u201d</p><p>Dalton tried not to laugh when he heard Jessie\u2019s sharp, \u201cTucker McKay, you will apologize to your uncle right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d But Tucker\u2019s narrowed gaze took in every inch of Dalton\u2019s face like he was checking for evidence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t s\u2019pose you remember me,\u201d Dalton asked. \u201cI used to babysit you sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Tucker shook his head.</p><p>\u201cUncle Dalton sent you the rhinoceros horn, the maracas and the stuffed toy elk,\u201d Jessie prompted.</p><p>\u201cReally? That was you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get all that stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPicked it up in my travels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Did you give Wyatt that stuffed grizzly bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir. And I gave you\u2014\u201d he poked Jackson in the belly, \u201c\u2014the stuffed buffalo.\u201d</p><p>Jackson blinked at him. Up close the kid was a perfect mix of Tell and Georgia. Black hair, icy blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you here?\u201d Tucker asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause Grandpa is in the hospital,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cAre you really my dad\u2019s brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really am. I\u2019m Uncle Tell\u2019s brother too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the one who died. That\u2019s Landon\u2019s dad, Luke.\u201d He frowned. \u201cHow come I don\u2019t remember you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been gone a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Did this kid ever stop asking questions? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you boys go play? You can grill Uncle Dalton later.\u201d</p><p>Tucker raced off, Wyatt and Jackson right behind him.</p><p>Dalton stood and looked at Brandt and Jessie. \u201cHow many questions do you answer a day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeems like a million. Let\u2019s sit in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>Jessie sliced up coffee cake and poured coffee. No one was talking so he looked around the room. How many meals had he eaten in here growing up? How many times had he tiptoed past Casper\u2019s captain\u2019s chair at the head of the table, hoping not to be noticed?</p><p>\u201cDalton?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at Jessie. \u201cThe place looks good. This house finally has a happy vibe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about Dad,\u201d Tell said, \u201cbut I wanna hear what you\u2019ve been up to and why the fuck we haven\u2019t seen you for over three years.\u201d</p> <p>Georgia whapped his biceps. \u201cThat is not a good way to start a conversation, Tell, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Tell was giving Dalton the steely-eyed stare that reminded him a little too much of Casper.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Georgia, but I\u2019m with Tell on this.\u201d Brandt pointed with his fork. \u201cYou\u2019re here, so start talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time we saw you in person was a week after you pulled your runaway groom routine,\u201d Tell reminded him.</p><p>\u201cBut the last time we actually saw your face was on TV a few months later when you were in the celebrity poker match with Chase,\u201d Brandt added.</p> <p>Dalton sipped his coffee. \u201cSo you, along with the rest of the country, watched me lose the million dollar pot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade me sick to my stomach just thinkin\u2019 about gambling with that much cash,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cThe buy-in was a hundred grand, right?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. Winner-takes-all tournament. Half the buy-in was my money. Chase\u2019s sponsors put the other half up. I\u2019m assuming everyone in the McKay family believed Chase lent me the money and I lost it?\u201d</p><p>His brothers and their wives looked at each other.</p><p>Just another reason he\u2019d gotten a cool reception from his uncles yesterday. \u201cDue to confidentiality contracts, Chase couldn\u2019t confirm or deny to anyone where the buy-in cash came from. My gag order expired two years after the event. So now I can tell you that I was paid to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That was all faked?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cNo, they\u2019re real poker games with real stakes. But world championship poker is big business, lots of fans, turning players into celebrities. The operators specialize in holding tournaments in small casinos. Which means advertising dollars pay for most the revenue. A regular Joe can see how the pros do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get roped in?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cChase had been asked to play a trio of celebrity couple tournaments and the sponsors were expecting Ava, but she had to back out because she was scouting movie locations. I\u2019d hung out with Chase at the poker tables in Vegas after the PBR World Finals. He\u2019d seen me play and knew I had the cash for buy-in, knew I was traveling around, so he asked me to fill in.\u201d Dalton grinned. \u201cWe thought it\u2019d be hilarious if I showed up in drag\u2014blond wig, evening dress, the whole nine yards\u2014trying to look like Ava, but Ava nixed that idea.\u201d</p><p>Georgia and Jessie laughed.</p><p>\u201cChase got knocked out early on. I kept playing the angle that I was his rube cousin from Wyoming. The crowds ate it up. Hell, I even had folks askin\u2019 for my autograph, which was weird. An hour before the final round started, the TV producers and sponsors called a meeting with me. Said they wanted me to throw the game because my opponent, JT Judson, was riding the comeback wave and it\u2019d make for better drama if he won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell them to stick it?\u201d Tell demanded.</p><p>\u201cNope. Luckily Chase was with me. He\u2019s used to dealing with them TV types. He said I\u2019d go all in if I got my seed money back and if they put me on the tour for at least a dozen stops. So basically I got to play in a million-dollar poker tournament for free. For the next eight months I ran the circuit. Then I\u2019d had enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Dalton nodded. \u201cI\u2019d had my fifteen minutes of fame and that was fourteen minutes too many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you grew the beard? So you weren\u2019t recognizable?\u201d Tell asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Off.\u201d</p><p>Tell laughed.</p><p>Brandt said, \u201cWhat did you do after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the I\u2019m fine texts once a month and the occasional package from some weird place overseas really doesn\u2019t tell us what you\u2019d been doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I had extra cash I made a list of all the places across the world I wanted to go and I went there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBro, ever since you were a little kid you never liked doin\u2019 stuff by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I never had to. I always had you guys or our McKay cousins.\u201d Or Rory. \u201cWhen I got older, I had girls\u2014\u201d he flashed Tell a sly grin, \u201c\u2014not as many girls as I\u2019d claimed.\u201d</p><p>Tell gave him an odd look\u2014as if surprised that Dalton had admitted that.</p><p>\u201cI met a few people in my travels, so I wasn\u2019t always alone, but the majority of the time, yeah, I was and I preferred it.\u201d</p><p>His brothers wouldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d chosen to redefine himself without his family\u2019s influence. It\u2019d been scary shit, being forced to do things on his own. No one telling him to feed cattle or move cattle or mow the hayfield. No one telling him to fix fence, or demanding explanations for how he conducted his social life. He\u2019d been one hundred percent in charge of every decision he made every day. It\u2019d been overwhelming at first, especially in countries where he didn\u2019t speak the language\u2014he\u2019d almost turned tail and run home. But he\u2019d stuck it out.</p><p>So he\u2019d learned a few things about himself: he was adaptable. He was a self-starter\u2014he could count the number of times he\u2019d lazed in bed on one hand. It\u2019d been easy to get up and start his day when he hadn\u2019t a clue what the day had in store for him.</p><p>\u201cDidja take pictures, play tourist, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I mostly wandered here and there. The reason I haven't tried to explain it to you guys before now is because I can\u2019t. Not over the phone, not in person. Alls I can say is I had to go and I don\u2019t regret a minute of bein\u2019 gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re livin\u2019 in Montana? What do you do up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen a logger in the summer. I\u2019ve been leading elk-hunting parties in the autumn during bow hunting season for the past two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you really have become some kind of Montana mountain man? Hunting, logging, and livin\u2019 off the land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say it like it\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d he answered Brandt a little testily.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t seem like your kinda thing. Your social life was almost as busy as Tell\u2019s. And now you\u2019re just happily holed up in the middle of nowhere Montana?\u201d</p><p>Tell leaned forward. \u201cYa ain\u2019t on the run \u2019cause you killed somebody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Enough with the questions about me. I\u2019m here to talk about Casper, remember? I understood about half of what the doctor said yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad refuses to speak. But he won\u2019t get better without therapy. So the doctor wonders if there\u2019s anyone Dad will listen to about resuming therapy,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the uncles?\u201d Dalton had seen them briefly yesterday.</p><p>\u201cHe fakes sleep whenever they show up. They\u2019d be the hardest ones for him to face with his stroke-altered speech issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the woman I saw darting in and out of the room a nurse or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That was Dad\u2019s girlfriend. Barbara Jean.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. \u201cGood one, Tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Barbara Jean and Dad have been together for over a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey met at church,\u201d Georgia said. \u201cShe\u2019s really sweet. She takes good care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper has a girlfriend,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIs she deaf so she doesn\u2019t care if he yells his head off at her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Dalton, that\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>He looked between his brothers. Then his brother\u2019s wives. \u201cAm I missing something? Or did I stumble into an alternate reality where Casper isn\u2019t a flaming asshole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what? He made some kind of amends with you guys, given how horrible he\u2019s always been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you oughta tell me what it is like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotten easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re havin\u2019 him over for supper kind of easy?\u201d</p><p>Brandt shook his head. \u201cHe asks to see the boys and we meet. During that time he doesn\u2019t give us ranch advice, or try to convince us to join his church. He ain\u2019t allowed to run down Mom, or say nasty shit to our wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the meetings last...under four minutes? Because that\u2019s about as long as he can go without bein\u2019 insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you wouldn\u2019t know, huh? Since you ain\u2019t been around him for three goddamned years?\u201d Tell shot back.</p><p>Thank God for that. Dalton changed the subject. \u201cCan he stay in the rehab wing indefinitely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s a week by week thing and we\u2019re back to it bein\u2019 dependent on how his therapy is goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for them to keep him if he isn\u2019t making progress,\u201d Tell said. \u201cSo they\u2019ll turn him out and make it someone else\u2019s problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning our problem,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Dalton\u2019s gaze winged between his brothers. \u201cAre you actually considering moving him into one of your houses?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Uncomfortable silence.</p><p>How in the hell could either of them even consider that?</p><p>\u201cBrandt. Do you need me to remind you that after Luke died he kicked Jessie out? Off the ranch? Out of our lives? He didn\u2019t give a shit if she was homeless. What goes around comes around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d</p><p>Dalton looked at Tell. \u201cYou\u2019re willing to have that man in your house, around your kids day after day even knowing what he\u2019s capable of? For who knows how fuckin\u2019 long because we all know the man is too goddamned mean to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton. That\u2019s not helping,\u201d Jessie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWell, it needed to be said because it doesn\u2019t seem like any of you are lookin\u2019 at this from any angle besides guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. How would you handle it?\u201d Tell asked.</p> <p>Their skeptical looks didn\u2019t deter him. \u201cCasper still gets financial compensation from the ranch although he\u2019s retired. If he gets kicked outta the rehab place then he\u2019ll need to be set up in a long-term care facility where he\u2019s not paying for expensive therapy he has no intention of doin\u2019. The place might eat up every bit of his ranch income and anything he might\u2019ve saved up, but it\u2019s the most logical choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally the voice of reason,\u201d Georgia said and reached over to squeeze Dalton\u2019s hand.</p><p>Jessie nodded. \u201cIt\u2019d be a different situation if Casper was a guy everyone loved. Heck, I\u2019d be fine havin\u2019 him live with us. But he\u2019s not that man. And he\u2019s not gonna change now. Like Dalton said, I suspect Casper will act a whole lot worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can suck it up and start doin\u2019 rehab, or he can live in a nursing home.\u201d Dalton looked between his brothers. \u201cSo which one of you is gonna tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you pushing this all off on us?\u201d Tell demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the youngest and he\u2019d discount anything I said.\u201d His phone vibrated. The caller ID read Rory. \u201cSorry, I hafta take this call.\u201d He excused himself from the table.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Rory swore she wasn\u2019t going to call Dalton. That\u2019d teach Mr. I-Can-Kiss-You-Anytime-I-Want a lesson.</p><p>So why was her phone in her hand?</p><p>Because you\u2019re a freakin\u2019 marshmallow when it comes to Dalton McKay.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t. Not anymore. But after the flashback, she\u2019d wondered where he\u2019d been the past three years. The jerk owed her an explanation. So she\u2019d hear his excuses and move on.</p><p>She hit dial before another voice popped into her head with advice.</p><p>He answered with, \u201cI knew you\u2019d call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s the reason I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t hang up on me. Just a sec.\u201d</p><p>Rory heard muffled voices in the background.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Brandt\u2019s. And you timed this call perfectly because things had started to get a little heated. Anyway, are you working at the Twin Pines tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see you?\u201d</p><p>She fiddled with the straw in her to-go cup. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner. Conversation. Friends catching up.\u201d He paused. \u201cDon\u2019t deny there\u2019s unfinished business between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But I\u2019d really like to keep the Sundance and McKay gossip mongers out of our...unfinished business or whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019ll cook for you. I\u2019m renting a house on Royal Street. It\u2019s baby blue with red shutters. Can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you staying with your brothers or in your old trailer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave the trailer up when I left. I\u2019ve been on my own too long to try and follow someone else\u2019s rules. So do you wanna come over right after work? Or do you need to go home first?\u201d</p><p>Wearing her less-than-flattering work uniform would reiterate the friendship line. But part of her wanted to saunter in wearing a sexy outfit, even when that\u2019d give Dalton the wrong idea.</p><p>\u201cRory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, yeah, I\u2019ll need to go home, change and let the dog out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have Jingle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. She\u2019s getting up there in years though. Anything you want me to bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust yourself. I\u2019m really looking forward to spending time with you, Rory.\u201d</p><p>When she almost admitted she felt the same, the angry girl who\u2019d been taken for granted and taken for a ride by this man reared her ugly head and barked out: don\u2019t fall for this because it\u2019s an act; always has been, always will be.</p><p>So she said, \u201cSee you later,\u201d and hung up.</p><p>The rest of the workday dragged ass. Rory wondered if she\u2019d ever get out into the field and utilize what she\u2019d learned earning her degrees. Given she hated this job, it\u2019d be easy to spiral into the my-degrees-are-worthless-what-the-fuck-was-I-thinking school of thought.</p><p>After she got home, she poured herself a drink. Standing in front of her tiny closet, she pondered clothing choices. A dress? Trying too hard. Jeans, hiking boots and a flannel shirt? Not trying at all. Rory slipped on her favorite khaki pants, a soft-hued angora sweater in heather brown, and drove into town.</p><p>She parked behind his pickup at the seen-better-days house and entered the yard through a chain link fence. She held her hand up to knock only to have the door opened immediately.</p><p>Dalton grinned so widely his beard moved. \u201cHey, gorgeous. Come in.\u201d</p><p>Rory started to take her coat off, and Dalton was right there, helping her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. The kitchen is this way.\u201d</p><p>The living area didn\u2019t have a stick of furniture. At least the eat-in dining room had a table and chairs.</p><p>\u201cAfter I invited you I realized I hadn\u2019t been to the store. Since I spent most of the day at the rehab place in Spearfish, I picked up pizza, fried chicken and hot wings.\u201d He headed to the fridge. \u201cWant a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019ve never been a beer drinker. Sorry, but alls I\u2019ve got is Coke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoke is fine. But the food\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dalton got right in her face. \u201cPlease tell me you haven\u2019t turned vegetarian in the last three years?\u201d</p><p>Tempting to lie to test his reaction, but she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not a vegetarian. I tried it for six months but couldn\u2019t stand a life without bacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no kinda life. Let\u2019s get this stuff moved to the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be easier to dish up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d Dalton didn\u2019t back off. He remained in that too-close-for-comfort zone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about you a lot over the years. More than was healthy, that\u2019s for damn sure. But those snapshots of you in my head didn\u2019t do you justice. Here I am, standing in front of you. And honest to God, you are so beautiful I can\u2019t think straight.\u201d</p><p>Her stupid belly swooped. \u201cStill the same bullshit charmer, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ma\u2019am. I\u2019ve told you that you\u2019re beautiful before this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe you then, either.\u201d</p><p>Dalton followed her, step for step as she tried to retreat. \u201cDon\u2019t run from me, Rory. It\u2019s long past time we both stopped running.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were the bottomless blue that pulled at her like an ocean current.</p><p>He\u2019ll suck you in, spin you around and spit you out.</p><p>That broke whatever weird hold Dalton had on her. She reached up and tugged hard on his beard. \u201cBack off, Jeremiah Johnson.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cFor now. But first, this.\u201d He pressed his lips to hers in a gentle kiss that should\u2019ve been chaste\u2014but wasn\u2019t. Not at all. He murmured, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>This was the Dalton she remembered prior to the night everything had changed between them. As much as that comforted her\u2014because she hadn\u2019t seen this side of him in a long time\u2014it also scared her; she\u2019d never been able to resist this Dalton.</p><p>He backed off. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re starved after workin\u2019 all day. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of food here.\u201d She dished up KFC mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, green beans and macaroni salad.</p><p>Dalton poured her a Coke. \u201cIt\u2019ll tide me over for a couple of days. Livin\u2019 where I do, there\u2019s no fast food. I don\u2019t miss it, except for fried chicken. The frozen kind from the store never tastes as good.\u201d</p><p>Rory added a slice of pizza to her plate and a breadstick. \u201cWhen I went to college I lived on the fast food I\u2019d been denied in my youth. I packed on the freshman fifteen in no time. I lost it all after I returned to healthy eating.\u201d Why had she blathered that? And why was she acting nervous and jittery like this was a first date?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to indulge sometimes.\u201d Dalton sat across from her, his plate piled high.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on with your dad?\u201d</p><p>He gave her the basic rundown, finishing with, \u201cFreaked me out to see him like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how long you\u2019re staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are things I\u2019ve been putting off that I\u2019ll deal with while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t an answer. \u201cHow\u2019d you end up living in Montana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I returned to the States after my European jaunt, I intended to settle wherever...\u201d He paused and looked away. \u201cThose plans fell through, so I spent the summer workin\u2019 as a logger. Then a buddy who owns a hunting lodge in Alder needed a guide for elk season. I stayed on through the winter and did odd jobs to earn my keep. Went back to logging in the spring and throughout the summer. Then autumn rolled around again and I was back on guide duty.\u201d</p><p>They ate in silence for a while. But she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how things had played out between them. The lies. The lust. The moment when all of that had come to a head and altered their friendship beyond repair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRory?\u201d</p><p>Startled, she glanced up at Dalton. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He gestured with his spork. \u201cYou\u2019re pulverizing them poor green beans.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced down to see a smashed pile of green goo on her plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinkin\u2019 about that put you in a murderous mood?\u201d</p><p>Do you really want to talk about this?</p><p>Yes. They\u2019d avoided this subject for far too long.</p><p>Rory pinned him with a hard stare. \u201cI was thinking about the summer after my senior year. Specifically that night you sweet-talked me into the cab of your pickup. The night you punched my V-card?\u201d</p> <p>Dalton choked on his beer.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even call me the next day. Then I left for college two weeks later. Is that night ringing any bells for you? Or as a McKay male have you popped so many cherries that you don\u2019t even fucking remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember.\u201d He took another long swallow of beer. \u201cI was an ass, okay? I was also twenty, with big plans to get laid at every opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just another opportunity to get your rocks off?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI was a horny twenty-year-old,\u201d he repeated. \u201cGetting my fair share of ass is all I cared about. Do I wish I could erase the shitty things I\u2019ve done? Especially to you? Absolutely. You want me to apologize? Fine. I\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve called you. But if I had, I probably would\u2019ve asked if you wanted to hook up again and fucked you against the pickup, just to mix it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not an apology, Dalton McKay.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton stared at her thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re not lookin\u2019 for an apology from me. Maybe you oughta forgive yourself for bein\u2019 a starry-eyed eighteen-year-old girl who let a punk-ass cowboy you trusted sweet-talk you out of your virginity.\u201d</p><p>Had that really been her issue? Was it still her issue?</p><p>\u201cIf I could go back and do it over, I\u2019d give you more than some fevered groping in the cab of a truck.\u201d</p><p>He traced her hairline from her forehead to her ear.</p><p>Hey, when had he moved so close? And why wasn\u2019t she pulling away?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d romance you underneath the starry sky. I\u2019d take my time with every inch of you and try not to set the world speed record for how fast I could get off. You deserved better and I knew it. I knew how lucky I was to even get with you.\u201d</p> <p>His smoky eyes and deep rumbling voice hypnotized her. She found herself leaning closer. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had this way of scaring most of the boys off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cI knew you. I\u2019d seen your sweet side beneath that in-your-face persona you\u2019d adopted the year you grew from a shrimp into a pinup dream.\u201d</p><p>Rory bit back a groan. In ten months she\u2019d shot up eight inches, a complete transformation from a waifish girl into a clumsy amazon. She\u2019d gone on the offensive to stave off anyone verbally attacking her and calling her a freak.</p><p>\u201cYour height, your brain, your body\u2014\u201d big shocker that Dalton didn\u2019t offer her a lascivious grin, \u201c\u2014were intimidating, even for me, and we were friends. I dreaded the day when you finally realized how gorgeous you were. So you were taking off for college and I wanted a piece of you for myself\u2014a piece that no other guy would ever have.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always been calculating; she hadn\u2019t expected him to admit it. She didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><p>\u201cBut I promise you that\u2019s not me anymore.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cSo you\u2019ve changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all the ways I needed to. Getting away from here was the smartest thing I ever did. I got a chance to see the world outside of Crook County and the McKay ranch. I got to see who I was outside of bein\u2019 part of the McKay family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>Dalton took her hand. \u201cBecause in order for you to trust me I have to prove to you I\u2019ve changed. And I intend to do whatever it takes to do that.\u201d</p><p>Keep it light. \u201cWhatever. I don\u2019t suppose you bought dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I did. Two of those fancy pudding cups from KFC with the whipped cream and chocolate shavings on the top.\u201d</p><p>Rory smiled. \u201cI remember how jealous we were of the kids who got pudding cups in their lunches because we never did. Now I can buy them anytime I want and I never do.\u201d</p><p>Dalton said, \u201cI buy \u2019em. Or I did when I lived here.\u201d</p><p>The way he kept saying that made her think he wouldn\u2019t be here permanently.</p><p>Rory cracked the foil on her cup and scooped out a tiny bite. And another.</p><p>\u201cYou still eat pudding like it\u2019s a rare delicacy. It\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>She stuck out her tongue. \u201cHow\u2019d you end up renting this house on such short notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the owner. She\u2019s been meaning to install updates before she decides to rent or sell. Since I\u2019m not doin\u2019 anything else, we\u2019re swapping rent for my handyman skills.\u201d</p><p>Rory wanted to ask who owned the house. If the woman was a former lover he\u2019d kept in touch with.</p><p>Dalton kept talking. \u201cBut she\u2019s getting the better end of the deal. A FedEx package was on the steps when I got here with a list of changes five pages long. I also have a packet of paint chips color-coordinated to each room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe easier to show you.\u201d She followed him out of the kitchen. He led her past the empty living room and cut down a hallway with five closed doors. He paused outside the last one. \u201cToo bad you don\u2019t have sunglasses on \u2019cause you\u2019ll need them.</p><p>He opened the door and Rory winced.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit that\u2019s hideous.\u201d The room was neon yellow. Not a pretty yellow, but a cross between yellow and green so it looked like someone had pissed all over the walls. \u201cHow many coats will it take to cover this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout ten thousand.\u201d He flattened his palm against the wall. \u201cFortunately I\u2019m texturing this room first, so that\u2019ll cut some of the glare.\u201d</p><p>Since she was by nature such a helpful person, it was on the tip of her tongue to offer to help him paint.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small house so it\u2019ll be a short tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place isn\u2019t as small as my cabin. Sometimes it makes me claustrophobic.\u201d</p><p>Dalton turned around so fast she ran into him. \u201cYour cabin is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat in that I don\u2019t have to pay rent, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a hair from her cheek. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd living there makes it seem like I never left here.\u201d Somehow the man had backed her against the wall. \u201cDalton, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have chocolate pudding on your lip and I\u2019m gonna lick it off. And then I\u2019m gonna kiss you. Really kiss you like I\u2019ve been dyin\u2019 to since you showed up today.\u201d</p><p>Since when did he... Oh God. A warm, wet tongue slid across her lower lip. He tugged her bottom lip between his teeth and sucked. He slowly released it and crushed his lips to hers.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s mouth demanded. Controlled. Teased. He clasped her hands in his, letting the kiss ebb and then building it back up. No body parts were touching beyond the clasp of their hands and their locked mouths.</p><p>Rory never remembered him kissing her like this\u2014with such single-minded absorption.</p><p>That\u2019s because he\u2019s had lots and lots of practice.</p><p>He ended the kiss before she pulled away. He murmured, \u201cI had to do that out here. Because if I did it in my bedroom we might never come out.\u201d He placed a kiss below her ear.</p><p>She ignored how her body tingled just from his soft mouth on her skin. Annoyed, she gave him a tiny head-butt. \u201cWishful thinking, McKay.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Smug man. \u201cAnd I hate the beard anyway.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and opened the door.</p><p>Rory looked at the sleeping bag on the floor, then at him and poked him in the chest. \u201cI\u2019m beyond the age that doing it in a sleeping bag holds any appeal for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Two sleeping bags hooked together out in the middle of nowhere, beneath a big starry sky, will always hold appeal for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d She poked him again. \u201cIt\u2019s this damn beard that\u2019s turned you into a mountain man, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cI\u2019ve changed. But with you, proof is in the pudding\u2014ha ha\u2014so that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore pudding?\u201d</p><p>Dalton looked at her\u2014more like he looked through her. His blue eyes held something warm and dark that she\u2019d never seen and her belly cartwheeled.</p><p>That\u2019s when she knew he\u2019d honed that boyish charm into a sharper instrument. A much more dangerous tool.</p><p>Then the look vanished and he smiled. \u201cMaybe we oughta go finish our pudding.\u201d</p><p>They returned to the kitchen. Dalton\u2019s eyes were glued to her mouth as she licked every bite of chocolate from her spork.</p><p>\u201cBesides handyman stuff, what are you doing to fill your days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put in an appearance at the rehab hospital. Then at some point this week I gotta get furniture for this place and a TV. I need something else to fill the void while I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d</p><p>Fill the void? Was that why he was being so cute and flirty with her? Because she was the void he intended to fill...in more ways than one?</p><p>Enough. You got what you needed, he explained why he left so walk away. Now.</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck with that.\u201d She tossed her empty pudding cup on her paper plate and stood to gather the trash.</p><p>\u201cRory. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready? Stay.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cWhy? So you can fill a void? I\u2019m just another way to kill time while you\u2019re stuck here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton took the garbage from her and flung it on the counter. Then he grabbed her upper arms. \u201cSpend every waking hour that you\u2019re not workin\u2019 with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. That\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut off her retort with a steamy kiss that made her wonder why she didn\u2019t mouth off to him all the time.</p> <p>After he thoroughly scrambled her brain, Dalton rested his forehead to hers. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve said yes, then I wouldn\u2019t need to buy a damn TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going to drive me crazy with this need to prove you\u2019ve changed, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething worth doin\u2019 is worth doin\u2019 well. And make no mistake, I\u2019m doin\u2019 it right with you this time.\u201d He touched her face with the back of his hand. \u201cQuestion is: will you let me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo flip,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou scared it might work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo confident,\u201d she shot back. \u201cYou scared you can\u2019t convince me?\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Rory held up her hands. \u201cEnough for one night. Please. I need to go home.\u201d</p><p>Dalton helped her with her coat.</p><p>When she spun around to say something, he put his finger across her lips.</p><p>\u201cGive me a chance. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>Day two in the rehab hospital sucked ass.</p><p>Dalton didn\u2019t know why he and his brothers were sitting in an overheated bedroom with a bitter man who didn\u2019t want them there. The one time when he\u2019d made eye contact with Casper, he\u2019d seen that mean gleam\u2014as if the asshole was remembering the last conversation they\u2019d had three years ago that\u2019d resulted in Dalton leaving.</p><p>The TV blared behind him as Casper flipped between twenty-four hour news channels. At least the noise cut the tension in the room.</p><p>How long did they have to stay?</p><p>The respiratory therapist came in and Casper made that frantic motion that he wanted them out.</p><p>The three of them wound up in the reception area. Listening to the constant ding ding that indicated a resident needed assistance. The phone at the receptionist\u2019s desk rang constantly. A couple of people in wheelchairs parked outside the reception area stared at them with vacant eyes. One guy waited by the door, intent on making a break for it.</p><p>The sights, sounds and smells overwhelmed him, but didn\u2019t seem to bother his brothers at all.</p> <p>Tell flipped through a newspaper. He read interesting tidbits out loud. Then he said, \u201cWhoa, check this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cRemember last year when the legislature revised that law about elk farms?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cElk farms aren\u2019t allowed in Wyoming,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but they passed a bill that allowed for privatization of a few elk farms on a trial basis. That last brucellosis outbreak with the Yellowstone herd fucked up the brucellosis-free status for cattleman too. Which pissed off the Wyoming Stockgrowers Association. They demanded policy changes with the state\u2019s wildlife management plan, but I know this ain\u2019t what they had in mind. There\u2019d been talk of privatization, but no one really believed it\u2019d happen. No one wanted it to happen, but now it has happened. They\u2019re takin\u2019 applications. Only four permits will be issued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat areas are included on the list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere in Wyoming with the exception of the two areas where the state is already feeding wildlife\u2014in Yellowstone and the Tetons.\u201d</p><p>Years ago when he and Tell had discussed putting in a livestock feedlot adjacent to the land Gavin Daniels owned, Dalton had researched the wildlife end of it as an alternative, mostly thinking they could get into the buffalo business if the feedlot idea didn\u2019t pan out.</p><p>When the feedlot hadn\u2019t looked feasible, he\u2019d gone so far as to check out privatized wildlife farms in Colorado and South Dakota to check the topography and containment and find out what type of acreage was needed for how many head.</p><p>Dalton hadn\u2019t bothered checking the regulations for elk farms because they weren\u2019t allowed in Wyoming. But now...this changed everything.</p><p>He needed something to do and a way to prove to Rory he intended to stick around. The section of land he owned might be a perfect fit for the program. Chances were slim his brothers had done improvements. After he checked the regulations and determined whether his land fit the criteria, he\u2019d send in an application. No one would have to know until the applicant\u2019s names were made public. Then he could offer Rory proof that he\u2019d applied right away so she knew he was serious about staying in Sundance since she\u2019d chosen to settle back here. He\u2019d deal with any fallout with his family after the fact.</p><p>\u201cDalton? You okay?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>He glanced up. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing an evil smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m planning ways to escape this hell.\u201d He rested his elbows on his knees. \u201cHow long we stayin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You got someplace else to be?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>Anyplace besides here. \u201cCasper don\u2019t want us around. And I\u2019ve grown past sticking around someplace where I\u2019m not wanted.\u201d</p><p>Tell and Brandt exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really need us to point out how selfish and unsupportive that statement is?\u201d Tell asked and tossed the newspaper on the table.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t dispute the truth of it. Look, maybe you guys have had reconciliation time with him. I haven\u2019t. I haven\u2019t seen the man in three years and I sure as fuck didn\u2019t miss him.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cWhy\u2019re you bein\u2019 so hostile about this?\u201d</p><p>Two fucking days back here and Dalton was slipping into old patterns. Be enough to make him roar with outrage if he hadn\u2019t gotten a handle on that former tendency too. \u201cI\u2019m not hostile. I\u2019d like to know why it was so all-fired important for me to be here when it\u2019s obvious he doesn\u2019t want me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wondering why he don\u2019t want you here?\u201d</p><p>No. I already know.</p><p>Brandt blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cLook, he\u2019s mentioned over the years he don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that you just up and left your ranch responsibilities to us.\u201d</p><p>Dalton shoved his anger down, way down deep. After the mean bastard had all but chased him out of town, he had the fucking balls to talk smack about him to Brandt and Tell?</p><p>You\u2019re surprised? He always tried to get you and your brothers to turn on each other.</p><p>Pointless. All of it. And he wouldn\u2019t get sucked into an unproductive fight with his brothers because Casper had orchestrated it. He stood and gathered up the newspaper. \u201cYou\u2019re right. My hostility, veiled as it may be, is causing problems. So I\u2019ll go. I wouldn\u2019t want to impede Casper\u2019s recovery process.\u201d</p><p>Maybe a small part of him was disappointed when his brothers didn\u2019t try and stop him from leaving.</p><p>Tell stared at the door that\u2019d banged shut after Dalton\u2019s abrupt departure. \u201cWhat the fuck is goin\u2019 on with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cI hate this.\u201d Tell forced himself to flex his fingers, which had balled into fists. \u201cWhy won\u2019t he talk to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d Brandt got up and started pacing. \u201cI never understood why he took off like he did after the thing with Addie. Something else happened. Something he didn\u2019t tell us then and he ain\u2019t tellin\u2019 us now.\u201d</p><p>Tell agreed. He\u2019d gone over that last conversation between Dalton, Brandt and himself a million times. Still made his chest tighten when he remembered how fast it\u2019d happened and everything in their lives had changed.</p><p>He and Brandt had shown up at their little brother\u2019s trailer five days after the wedding fiasco at Dalton\u2019s request. He\u2019d taken his lumps for being a runaway groom and the three of them exchanging the good-natured barbs they always did. Then he\u2019d tossed them the keys to his trailer and announced, \u201cThanks for coming by. Just a heads up that I\u2019m leavin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Brandt had demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fit this place anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. It\u2019s just a kneejerk reaction,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cI assure you it\u2019s not.\u201d Dalton pointed to his pickup. \u201cI\u2019m packed.\u201d He pointed to the house. \u201cIt\u2019s cleared out. Propane is shut off. They\u2019re coming to cut the electricity Monday. The water is turned off. I wanted to say goodbye before I take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d</p><p>Tell had watched as Dalton\u2019s gaze swept the land he\u2019d worked on, cursed at and been part of his entire life. \u201cAnywhere but here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to do nothin\u2019 rash because of the Addie situation,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cIt will blow over. We\u2019ll help you figure something out that makes more sense than you running off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I appreciate the offer but my mind is made up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that? You didn\u2019t come to us about any of this?\u201d Tell demanded. \u201cYou just handled it on your own, like you do everything else? Fuck that, Dalton. You don\u2019t get to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell, that ain\u2019t helpin\u2019,\u201d Brandt warned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. This has been building for a while and we all know it. I thought if you settled down with Addie, things would go back to normal between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal...how?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a smart ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m dead-ass serious,\u201d Dalton said, trying to keep his tone even. \u201cThings haven\u2019t been normal around here since Mom and Casper split up and he got hit by the Jesus stick. We lost our family unit\u2014shitty as it was. We\u2019ve lost out on land. We\u2019ve bought land. We\u2019ve made plans to do something different in agriculture to expand our income base beyond what we\u2019re makin\u2019 as part of the McKay ranch. But I realized it\u2019s all talk.\u201d Dalton held up his hand when Tell started to protest. \u201cNot laying blame. Just stating facts. The feedlot ain\u2019t gonna happen. We\u2019ve got extra acreage but we\u2019re not running more cattle. Haying it does save us feed costs, but I didn\u2019t charm Charlene Fox to become a damn hay farmer.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd I get it, all right? You guys have wives and families of your own and you\u2019re settled in. Those plans don\u2019t mean as much to you now as they used to. But I sure as hell can\u2019t implement any of those plans on my own, so I\u2019m gonna take my cue from you two, let it go and move on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo we didn\u2019t do things your way, on your time frame, so you\u2019re showing us how pissed off you are by leavin\u2019 town? That\u2019s pretty freakin\u2019 childish, bro,\u201d Tell said. \u201cPlus, you are part of this ranch. It is your job to hay. Just because you ain\u2019t happy with the work we\u2019re doin\u2019, or the way we\u2019re doin\u2019 it, don\u2019t mean there ain\u2019t work to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy job, huh? When was the last time I helped either of you with chores?\u201d Dalton asked, looking between them. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you? I do. It\u2019s been over a month. Five weeks and four days. The fact that neither of you noticed I wasn\u2019t around at all during that time just proves you don\u2019t need me around.\u201d</p><p>Dumbfounded, Tell said, \u201cDalton, that ain\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me finish. Jessie helps out. Georgia helps out. Not because they have to; because they want to. That\u2019s what both of you wanted in a wife\u2014a partner who understands ranch life and is a daily part of it. Problem is, there\u2019s nothin\u2019 left for me to do.\u201d Dalton\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cI\u2019m already known as the youngest McKay. I\u2019m already known as the last single McKay. I sure as fuck won\u2019t be known as the worthless McKay. Which is why I\u2019m leavin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell?\u201d Brandt prompted.</p><p>Jerked out of the memory, he opened his eyes and looked at his older brother. \u201cSorry. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to figure out a way to get Dalton to talk to us,\u201d Brandt said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s on us as much as it\u2019s on him that this has gone on so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Got any ideas on how to get him to open up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. He\u2019s changed. So I don\u2019t think the usual insult him until he fights back way we used to deal with him will work.\u201d</p><p>Tell couldn\u2019t even laugh at that. This situation with Dalton was no laughing matter.</p><p>Brandt sighed. \u201cDalton is right about one thing. Sitting here is a waste of time. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s office phone buzzed right before lunch. She checked the line and saw the call was coming from Director Tibke\u2019s office. \u201cThis is Rory Wetzler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory? Could I see you in my office, please?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach did a slow, sick roll. She\u2019d never been called into Director Tibke\u2019s office before. Had she done something wrong? Was she about to get fired?</p> <p>Relax. Alice in HR does the hiring and firing.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean Alice couldn\u2019t be lying in wait in Director Tibke\u2019s office.</p><p>Answer the man. \u201cYes, Director Tibke. Right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Rory hung up and somehow stopped herself from hyperventilating. She focused on the projects she\u2019d accomplished, her interpersonal relationships with other agents. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d had negative evaluations, either from her boss or any of the constituents she\u2019d helped.</p><p>They had to be letting her go.</p><p>And her ambivalent feeling about that scared her. She didn\u2019t love this job\u2014okay, she sort of hated it, but that didn\u2019t change the fact she needed it.</p> <p>Rory checked her appearance in the bathroom. She\u2019d made extra effort today on the off chance she\u2019d see Dalton. Sort of pathetic that she dolled herself for a man but not for her job.</p><p>Stop finding negativity in everything. You are a professional.</p><p>Not much of a pep talk, but she\u2019d take it.</p><p>She paused outside of Director Tibke\u2019s door and inhaled a deep breath before she knocked.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Whew. No sign of Alice inside the room. \u201cYou asked to see me, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. Thanks for making time for me. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Rory wondered if the visitor\u2019s chairs facing the desk were purposely uncomfortable so employees squirmed.</p><p>Director Tibke was in his early sixties and had been at the helm of this office since its inception in the 1990s. He\u2019d dealt with a myriad of ecological issues that affected the Wyoming environment\u2014coal mining, methane gas extraction, toxic waste cleanup \u201csuper sites\u201d from WWII ammo and chemical dumps. Not to mention dealing with national wildlife endangerment groups who affected state policy as much as the Wyoming Stockgrower\u2019s Association that strong-armed the state on Ag management policies. Rory respected Director Tibke because he\u2019d always done what was best for the environment\u2014no matter which group disapproved.</p><p>\u201cRory. Relax. You\u2019re making me nervous in my own office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo put your mind at ease, I\u2019m not about to fire you, lay you off or reprimand you.\u201d He sighed. \u201cBut after you hear what I\u2019ve got to say, you might wish I\u2019d fired you.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right to the point. Last year the legislature approved a measure that will allow limited private elk farms to operate in our state. It isn\u2019t really a pilot program, but rather a test program on whether a permanent change in governing laws might be applicable. As you know, this has been a hot topic in all the affected state agencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I studied both sides of the issue extensively since my master\u2019s thesis dealt with wildlife survival rates in natural habitats versus supplemental assistance either from private citizens or government agencies.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that, which is why you\u2019ve been selected for this special project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jesus. Had that high-pitched squeal of glee really come from her?</p><p>\u201cLet me explain before you get too excited. The state has already decided on the criteria and I\u2019ll be the first to admit that criteria is very loose, which leaves us in a helluva position in choosing qualified recipients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically any landowner in our district can apply.\u201d</p><p>Rory frowned. \u201cBut since we\u2019re in the middle of cattle country, and most ranchers are dead set against any type of elk farm abutting their grazing land, wouldn\u2019t that mean we\u2019ll have fewer applicants because they\u2019ll want the test program to fail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d thought of that angle. But the truth is they\u2019ll probably all apply for the permit to have some measure of control about the placement of the elk farms. If they\u2019re awarded the permit, then they can sabotage it at will and the program will be deemed a failure, thereby getting the Wyoming Stockgrowers Association exactly what they want: no change in the status quo as far as wildlife management policies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe application process is that lenient?\u201d</p><p>The director laughed. \u201cOf course, because the state requires a nonrefundable application fee. They want the money and they don\u2019t have to do much work beyond kicking the applications to the WNRC. We\u2019re tasked with choosing the recipients of the temporary permits. We\u2014meaning you. This is your project if you choose to accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermission to speak honestly, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Rory weighed her words before she spoke. \u201cCan I ask if you chose me to run this special project because I\u2019m part-time and you suspect I won\u2019t complain about the extra hours without the extra financial compensation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery astute. I\u2019ll admit I like coming in right at my budget every year, so that would\u2019ve been my second consideration in assigning you. But the WNRC has been allocated money specifically for this project. As special project manager, you\u2019d be upgraded to a fulltime employee for the three-month duration. At a pay rate higher than your current pay level.\u201d</p><p>That was very good news, but Rory focused on what he hadn\u2019t said. \u201cAdditional income is always welcome. If my part-time status is your second consideration in assigning me, what is your first consideration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a horse in this race.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cHalf the people who work in this office are dependent upon ranching in some way for their livelihood. You don\u2019t have that conflict, and more importantly, neither does anyone in your immediate family. You\u2019ve lived here your whole life and have a better insight about which ranching families would be feeding you a line of bullshit as far as the genuineness of their application.\u201d</p><p>Very true. During her high school years she\u2019d earned a reputation for her environmentalist bent. It\u2019d been exaggerated; she\u2019d been called everything from a tree-hugger to a PETA-loving tool. All because she\u2019d tried to raise awareness that everyone involved in agriculture had a responsibility to keep a balance between long-term and short-term land sustainability. She believed in it so strongly she\u2019d made it the focus of her college studies.</p><p>\u201cRory?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cSorry. Just trying to process this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine it\u2019s a surprise. The other reason I\u2019m asking you to fill this position is I read your thesis. You\u2019ve delved into environmental impact studies and shown you\u2019re impartial. I need someone running this project who doesn\u2019t have an axe to grind with the ranchers but won\u2019t choose the recipient because their ideologies are the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you say? Are you willing to take on this project?\u201d</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes, sir. It would be an honor.\u201d</p><p>He thrust his hand across the desk and grinned. \u201cThis is great. You are perfect for this job. Just a quick reminder that you\u2019re not allowed to speak specifics about this special project to anyone outside the office\u2014without my prior approval, at least until the permit application deadline has passed. So, if you have any questions just ask, as I will be your direct supervisor.\u201d</p><p>No more answering to Horrific Hannah? Sweet. \u201cWhen do I start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday. You\u2019ll need a couple days to read over the information.\u201d He hefted two six-inch binders onto his desk.</p><p>\u201cAll of that?\u201d</p><p>He shoved the binders across the desk. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here six months. Reading between the lines in governmental doublespeak is second nature to you now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His phone rang and she slipped out.</p><p>Might make her a dork, but she did a little happy dance in her office. A fulltime position. She could quit working at the Twin Pines. After all the years she\u2019d bartended in college and grad school, she\u2019d now have her weekends free.</p><p>She probably wouldn\u2019t know what to do with herself.</p> <p>Now you at least have the option of spending time with Dalton.</p><p>Dalton.</p><p>She\u2019d managed to shove last night\u2019s conversation to the back burner. Okay, after she\u2019d stayed up half the night replaying it in her head.</p><p>What was his end game? What did he have to prove? And was he proving it to her? Or to himself?</p><p>But the part of her that\u2019d always been crazy about him wanted to believe he\u2019d pined for her these past few years. Okay, he hadn\u2019t exactly said he\u2019d pined. But he had said he\u2019d thought about her a lot.</p> <p>Why had he been so vague about the business he needed to tie up while he was here? Did he consider her unfinished business he needed to handle?</p><p>God. Why was she obsessing over this stuff like a teenage girl when she had work to do?</p><p>Rory turned one more happy circle before she settled behind her desk.</p><p>Yes, it was a good day.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>On his way back to Sundance, Dalton\u2019s mom called. \u201cHey, Ma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDalton! I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re finally in our neck of the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d hoped to spend it with Rory, but then he remembered she worked at the Twin Pines after her regular job. \u201cNothing. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome spend the night with me. I\u2019ll whip up a batch of chicken and dumplings. And I\u2019ll make your favorite sour cream strudel cake.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYou win. I\u2019ll swing by my place and pack a bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you, son. I really missed you. Drive safe.\u201d</p><p>He texted Rory his plans to visit his mom; wouldn\u2019t want her to think he was out catting around the night after he swore he\u2019d prove to her he\u2019d changed.</p> <p>Dalton pulled up to his mom\u2019s condo a little after five. He\u2019d barely gotten out of his truck when she threw herself at him. He hugged her back just as strongly.</p><p>When she released him, she scrutinized his beard and whapped him on the chest. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t known your truck I would\u2019ve believed some thug from a motorcycle gang was in my driveway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been watching too many episodes of Sons of Anarchy.\u201d He held her at arm\u2019s length. Her hair was styled short, in a trendy cut, blond and brown mixed in with the gray. With no Casper stress in her life, a good portion of her worry lines were gone. She looked a decade younger now than she had a decade ago. Dalton kissed her cheek and caught a whiff of the perfume she wore on special occasions. Made him feel guilty his visit was considered a special occasion. \u201cYou look great. I might not\u2019ve recognized you either.\u201d</p><p>She looped her arm through his. \u201cCome inside. I\u2019ve got beer or coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be great.\u201d He shot her a grin. \u201cTo go with the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is for dessert,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cMy new motto is dessert first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing I already cut you a slice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>While his mother futzed around in the kitchen, he wandered through the living room of her condo. He\u2019d never thought much about decorating styles growing up\u2014the stuff in their house was just the stuff that\u2019d always been there.</p><p>Her furniture\u2014a couch, loveseat and recliner in vivid red\u2014reflected the bold changes in her life. The end tables were simple and clutter-free except for the photos of her sons as boys, as teens and as young men. Now pictures of her grandsons were interspersed with those snapshots. Pictures of Brandt and Jessie. Tell and Georgia. He squinted at the last one on the shelf. How had she gotten a picture of him at the world poker tournament? And a rare one of him smiling during a poker game?</p><p>\u201cI got that by watching the video of you online and freezing it. I made a print off the computer. I didn\u2019t have any recent pics of you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton faced her. \u201cAre you gonna chew me out for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She placed her hand on his biceps and squeezed. \u201cYou needed to go, Dalton. I\u2019m glad you did. And we don\u2019t have to talk about this two minutes after you\u2019ve walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDump your bag in the spare bedroom. You get to bunk in the room with the toys I keep around for my grandsons. Then wash up and come to the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>He took his time checking out the remaining pictures in the hallway, surprised to see his parents\u2019 wedding photo in the mix. Why would she keep that? But as he looked around, he didn\u2019t see another picture of Casper McKay anywhere. Dalton wandered to the kitchen. \u201cSmells good in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of went overboard. Get tired of cooking for one so be warned. I hope you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the last time I talked to you, you were getting ready to lead your last hunting party of the season. How\u2019d that go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Hunters are always happy when they get an elk. All three guys did. They were lucky they got to see the rugged beauty of Montana and not the rugged weather.\u201d</p><p>His mother poured him a cup of coffee and sat across from him. \u201cI promise I will get up there sometime.\u201d She shot him a look. \u201cUnless you\u2019re moving back to Sundance permanently?\u201d</p><p>He hedged. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t let Brandt and Tell know we\u2019d kept in contact the last three years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If they suspected I knew where you were they never pushed me to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that you did keep in touch with me, Dalton. You\u2019re a grown man, but I still worry. I\u2019m thrilled you got out of Wyoming and saw the world. Even if you\u2019re still trying to find your place in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever encourage Luke or Brandt or Tell to take off?\u201d</p><p>She wiped her mouth with a napkin. \u201cLuke? No. Brandt? No. Wait, I take that back. Maybe after Luke started stepping out on Jessie. Brandt wanted to be anywhere besides on the ranch where he had to watch his brother act like a fool and destroy the woman Brandt loved. But Brandt was loyal to both of them even when it ripped him apart. And Tell? If you remember, I did push him to go out on the road rodeoin\u2019 that one summer. But he had it in his head he\u2019d never be good enough to make a living on the rodeo circuit, so he came back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper tellin\u2019 him he sucked all the time might\u2019ve played a part in that,\u201d Dalton said dryly.</p><p>\u201cNot that I disagree, but bein\u2019 the cousin of Chase McKay had a lot more to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Dalton cut a dumpling in half and popped it in his mouth. The taste took him back to his teen years. Mealtimes were some of his favorite memories growing up. His brothers laughing and teasing each other. Casper had behaved for the most part, rarely picking fights with his sons at the dinner table, lest his wife stop cooking. She\u2019d insisted they\u2019d enjoy at least one civilized meal each day.</p><p>\u201cDalton, sweetheart, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at her and smiled. \u201cYeah. Just thinkin\u2019. This food takes me back. To, you know, growing up.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all bad, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo son, it wasn\u2019t. When you boys were little, for a few years, it was decent. I\u2019d hoped Casper...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cLike so many things with him, it didn\u2019t stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stick around?\u201d Dalton couldn\u2019t think of any woman who\u2019d put up with what Joan McKay had.</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought I loved him. I wanted to believe that Casper was capable of being a good father. I thought if I didn\u2019t micromanage every second he spent with you boys, he\u2019d grow into his role in your lives.\u201d She reached for his hand. \u201cIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, besides burying Luke, letting you boys work with him every day.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cLook how that turned out with you. I had no idea what he was doing and you paid the price for my trust and hope. I\u2019ve gone over this dozens of times with my counselor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still seeing a counselor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped for a while. Then Tell and I had that big blowup and I realized not all the changes I\u2019d made in my life since the divorce were good. I\u2019m more...settled when I have an unbiased person to unload on.\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cWhich still makes me wonder if you resent me.\u201d</p><p>Dalton wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. Wasn\u2019t sure if he should answer.</p><p>His mother retreated. \u201cYou know what? Scratch that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no way you could\u2019ve protected us from him twenty-four/seven\u2014especially not in the family ranch environment. Luke told me he\u2019d figured out when he was fourteen that if he didn\u2019t learn how to do everything on the ranch and teach us how to do it, there wouldn\u2019t be anything for us to inherit. He also explained that Casper failing on his section of land didn\u2019t reflect poorly on him, but all the McKays. That\u2019s what Casper wanted\u2014to be a burden to his brothers so they couldn\u2019t ignore him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that guy, Mom. An expert at verbal abuse and manipulation. Takin\u2019 out his bitterness on everyone around him. He showed us that ugly side and it wasn\u2019t like you were safe from his mean mouth. I\u2019d resent you if you\u2019d hid in the house so we bore the brunt of whatever fucking anger was eating him, rather than you. But you\u2019ve never been that type of mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you understanding that.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cI did leave Casper once.\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling formed in the pit of his stomach. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell was just out of diapers. I don\u2019t remember what Casper had done, wasn\u2019t anything like he did in later years, but I\u2019d had enough. I left for five days, maybe a week.\u201d A faraway look entered her eyes. Then she caught herself. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to ruin your appetite with this conversation. Eat up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t. He wanted to know where she\u2019d gone and what she\u2019d done when she\u2019d walked out. Who she was with. But the words stuck in his throat.</p><p>\u201cSo Casper is in a rehab unit?\u201d</p><p>Dalton nodded. He\u2019d wondered if she\u2019d ask. \u201cHe can\u2019t speak and refuses to work with the speech therapist. Which is why I don\u2019t understand...never mind. My opinion won\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt does matter. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are Brandt and Tell wasting time with him when it\u2019s obvious he don\u2019t want them there? They got pissed off at me today, like I was some callous\u2014hell, they even called me selfish\u2014asshole for not wantin\u2019 to sit in his room for hours on end watching him glare at the TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re there out of guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? It ain\u2019t like he\u2019s gonna have a change of heart and become a completely different person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been known to happen with strokes. There\u2019s part of your brothers that have always held hope for reconciliation.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton raised his eyebrows. \u201cMeaning that Casper will wake up one day and have such remorse that he\u2019ll try to make things right with his sons?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ll never admit it out loud, but there\u2019s still that boyish hope.\u201d Her gaze encompassed his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that same hope. And before you get defensive, the way you feel doesn\u2019t make you callous. It makes you a realist. You\u2019re different from your brothers, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of his tongue to ask how different.</p><p>\u201cI know Casper has given you years of grief about that. Calling you...well, I won\u2019t repeat it. Takes a stronger man to walk away from constant conflict. You did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to some, that makes me a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze snapped back to hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a coward, for staying as long as I did after you boys were out of the house. I shoulda left him after you turned eighteen and moved out. I shoulda left him after Luke died when it became apparent we wouldn\u2019t grieve our son together. The only reason I found the guts to do it at all was because of Brandt and Jessie. They deserved the happiness and love they found in each other.\u201d She looked away. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m a big part of your dad\u2019s bitterness. I felt staying with him was my penance for the way I trapped him into a marriage he didn\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d never talked about how or when his parents had met. \u201cHave you talked to your counselor about how you\u2019re still takin\u2019 the blame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, I willingly admit my part. Not all, but I\u2019m not blameless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got your own life now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are times I miss the ranch.\u201d She took a sip of water. \u201cDid you miss it when you were traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people more than the place. Did I miss the work? No. Not because I\u2019m lazy, but even the work dynamic changed when Jess and Georgia became involved. I did my own thing. Still got grief for it. Probably always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how long will you be in Sundance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo set time frame. A couple of things came up I need to handle. Truth is, I wasn\u2019t looking forward to spending the entire winter in Montana. I hate the feeling of bein\u2019 stuck. When it snows two feet at a time in the mountains, it\u2019s unavoidable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould Rory Wetzler bein\u2019 back in the area have anything to do with that decision?\u201d</p><p>Dalton pushed his plate away. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna get outta you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much to tell.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you haven\u2019t lost the McKay charm in your world travels.\u201d</p><p>His grin vanished. But his mother didn\u2019t notice; she\u2019d started picking up plates.</p><p>\u201cSo what would you like to do tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m good hanging out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about going out? To a honky-tonk just up the road. Do a little dancin\u2019. There\u2019s a great band playing this week. You up for that?\u201d</p><p>Dalton kept his shock in check. His mom wanted to go out dancing? Didn\u2019t seem like her thing. Then again, she had a different life now and this was his chance to see her in action. Since he intended on taking Rory dancing soon, it\u2019d do him good to brush up on his two-step skills. \u201cI could be. Is your boyfriend gonna be there? \u2019Cause I don\u2019t want you to ditch me in some strange bar so you two can suck face in the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton Patrick McKay! I would never do such a thing!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cKiddin\u2019, Ma. But I will need your help with something before I leave in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Two knocks sounded on Rory\u2019s office door.</p><p>She highlighted the section of proposed state regulations\u2014easy to get lost in repetitive government double-speak\u2014and said, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Glennis, the receptionist, poked her head in. \u201cRory? There\u2019s a man out front who\u2019d like to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just send him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ah...I wasn\u2019t sure...\u201d Glennis\u2019s cheeks grew flushed.</p><p>Why was the receptionist blushing? Then Rory knew.</p><p>Dalton.</p><p>\u201cThe man in question looks like Charles Manson? Don\u2019t let the crazy beard fool you. He\u2019s harmless.\u201d</p><p>Glennis appeared startled. \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t have a beard. And he insisted you come out to the reception area.\u201d</p><p>Not Dalton after all. Not an unusual request, either. Some men she dealt with believed their questions about certain programs would be less official if they weren\u2019t asked in her office. Made no sense, but mindsets around here were off center anyway.</p><p>Rory pushed back from her desk. \u201cThanks, Glennis. I\u2019ll handle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind handling him,\u201d Glennis muttered.</p><p>She headed down the hallway, her brain still mired in processing the morning\u2019s paperwork. She glanced at the man standing in front of the windows with his broad back to her. Not that she minded; his rear view was excellent. Dark Cinch jeans\u2014which she preferred to Wranglers\u2014a black wool vest worn over a crisp white shirt and a black hat.</p><p>\u201cSir? You wished to see me?\u201d</p><p>He turned around and Rory froze. Good thing she\u2019d locked her knees or she might\u2019ve ended up falling to them.</p><p>It was Dalton. Without a beard.</p><p>Holy, holy, holy crap.</p><p>She\u2019d always considered him a level beyond cute in that baby-faced way, with his dimpled smile, big blue eyes and full lips. This Dalton...goddamn. He defined hot and rugged man\u2014all man.</p><p>\u201cRory?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She managed to eke out, \u201cYou got rid of the beard.\u201d</p><p>Dalton rubbed his fingertips over his face. \u201cYeah, well, it feels weird.\u201d He laughed self-consciously. \u201cProbably looks weird too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. It looks...\u201d Fucking fantastic.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you just blurt out what a hottie he is?</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, waiting for her to finish.</p><p>Flustered, she dropped her gaze and noticed he held flowers. She met his eyes again. \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He took a step closer. \u201cTo prove to you that I\u2019ve changed.\u201d His mouth brushed her ear. \u201cSo prepare yourself, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m gonna romance the hell out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHere, there and everywhere,\u201d he murmured in that deliciously deep voice.</p><p>\u201cRory?\u201d Glennis said somewhere behind her. \u201cI\u2019ve got an extra vase for those flowers if you need one.\u201d</p><p>Rory had to stop herself from jumping away from Dalton like a guilty teen. \u201cThat would be great, Glennis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanna take Mr...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKay,\u201d Rory inserted.</p><p>\u201cMr. McKay to your office, I\u2019ll bring the vase to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Her gaze hooked Dalton\u2019s. \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me.\u201d She turned down the hallway. A few of her female coworkers poked their heads out as they passed by. Word spread fast in this office.</p><p>Dalton probably did that whole cowboy hat tip-nod thing that made women swoon.</p><p>I\u2019ve changed.</p><p>Yeah, right. Rory whipped around to try and catch him in his charm-the-pants-off-every-woman-within-range act, but Dalton\u2019s gaze was firmly on her ass. Nowhere else.</p><p>That shouldn\u2019t have made her feel better, but it did.</p><p>Those big blue eyes met hers. \u201cYou caught me lookin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>No apology. No surprise. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t keep your eyes off this sexy uniform?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not clothes that make a woman sexy, Rory.\u201d</p><p>She spun back around and cut through the copy center to reach her office. She\u2019d intended to sit behind her desk, putting some space between them, but Glennis followed them in.</p><p>Talk about speedy.</p><p>Glennis set a vase already half-filled with water on the desk and handily plucked the flowers from Dalton.</p><p>Rory gave her an arch look at her uber-efficiency.</p><p>\u201cI saw him with those and figured someone in this office was getting flowers. It\u2019s my job to be prepared.\u201d She left and shut the door.</p><p>She started to open the door, but Dalton intercepted her. \u201cLeave it closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to talk to you in private.\u201d</p><p>Before she could ask what he wanted to discuss, the ooh pretty! side of her brain focused on the hunky man flesh within touching distance. Almost without thinking, she placed her hands on his face. His skin was so warm and smooth. And he smelled amazing.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, McKay. You should\u2019ve kept this good-looking mug of yours covered up under that ugly fur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I shaved it because you said you didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d shaved it off for her? Her fingers traced the edge of his strong jaw. His cheekbones. The dimple in his right cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton made a growling noise and Rory found herself pressed against the door by two hundred pounds of cowboy. \u201cDeal is, you touch me, I get to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. I didn\u2019t agree to that deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unspoken.\u201d Dalton angled his head and placed a kiss on the side of her neck.</p> <p>She should\u2019ve demanded he stop after that first soft kiss. Or the second, placed on her neck below the first. She really shouldn\u2019t have let him string hot kisses down one side of her throat and up the other side. She probably should\u2019ve moved away instead of leaning closer when he started rubbing his smooth face against hers.</p><p>But it felt so good.</p><p>\u201cRory,\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cHave me for lunch.\u201d</p><p>That snapped her out of it. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave lunch with me.\u201d</p> <p>Jesus. This man muddled her brain to the point he could make her hear things she wanted to hear. \u201cDalton. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo short of notice, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>Dalton eased back but his hands remained braced beside her head on the door. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going way too fast for me. You show up at the Twin Pines and bully-kiss me into giving you my phone number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBully-kiss? Never heard that one before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe night before last when we had supper at your place you used that bully-kiss tactic on me then too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use the bully-kiss tactic yesterday,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOnly because you went to visit your mom and we didn\u2019t see each other,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t used the bully-kiss tactic today.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cNot yet anyway.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes searched his. \u201cI\u2019m serious. You just blow into town after three years and I\u2019m supposed to take it on faith that you want to be with me? Especially after we hadn\u2019t been on the best terms for several years before that? It\u2019s only been three days.\u201d</p><p>A fierce look entered his eyes. \u201cIf I\u2019d known you were back after breaking your engagement I\u2019d been here six months ago.\u201d</p><p>Rory stilled. Dalton hadn\u2019t brought up her broken engagement the other night so she wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d known about it. \u201cHow\u2019d you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you kicked that douche-fucker\u2014who wasn\u2019t good enough to date you, let alone marry you\u2014to the curb? Sierra told me four hours after I left Montana. And I let her have it for keeping such a big fucking secret from me.\u201d</p> <p>Rory ducked under his arm and put distance between them. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were so tight with Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep in touch with her because she\u2019s the only McKay who never knew me during my growing up years, so she doesn\u2019t hold a fixed opinion about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could keep in touch with her, but not me?\u201d Crap. Why had she said that? \u201cDid Sierra blab all about me?\u201d</p><p>Dalton crowded her again. \u201cOnly if I asked. So I knew about your engagement. You were seriously gonna marry a guy named Dillon Doland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe goes by Dil. Besides, it\u2019s not the person\u2019s name you fall in love with, but the person.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her upper arms and pulled her closer. \u201cWere you in love with him?\u201d</p><p>Given the jealous fire flashing in Dalton\u2019s eyes, she was surprised how easily she manipulated the truth. \u201cWe had a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid. You. Love. Him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit Rory, I can\u2019t stand the thought...\u201d Then Dalton\u2019s hands slid up, framing her face as his mouth took possession of hers.</p><p>The kiss started out red-hot and spiraled higher from there. Every slide of his tongue against hers, every tiny suck, every nibble, every time he pulled back he made a low groan and dove into the kiss again. He read her reactions and adjusted accordingly with the perfect combination of passion and temptation. Making her crave more body-to-body contact, more...everything.</p><p>He slowed the kiss and backed off. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to do that here, but I just wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>She rested her backside against the desk because her legs were jelly. \u201cYou wanted me to know that you intend to romance the hell out of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what then?\u201d</p><p>Before he could respond, the door swung open and Hannah walked right in.</p><p>Rory was relieved Hannah hadn\u2019t showed up two minutes earlier and caught her and Dalton in a hardcore lip lock.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello,\u201d Hannah said to Dalton\u2019s chest, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had a visitor, Rory.\u201d</p><p>Like hell you didn\u2019t.</p><p>Dalton said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave and let you get back to work.\u201d</p><p>The hungry way Hannah was eyeing Dalton annoyed the piss out of her. Rory set her hand on Dalton\u2019s arm. \u201cWe\u2019re still on for lunch, right?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cOf course. Is the Mexican joint still in business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll meet you there in...fifteen minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d He gave Hannah the cowboy nod before he walked out.</p><p>And lecherous Hannah cranked her head around\u2014much like that chick in The Exorcist\u2014to watch his backside as he ambled out.</p><p>\u201cWas there something you needed, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust checking to see if you ordered additional office supplies for your new temporary position.\u201d</p><p>Right. Hannah just wanted to let Rory know she could barge in any time she liked\u2014regardless if she technically wasn\u2019t Rory\u2019s boss for the next few months. \u201cNo. I\u2019m covered.\u201d</p><p>After Hannah exited the office, Rory spent five minutes brightening her makeup before she drove the mile into town.</p><p>Dalton stood when he saw her and kissed her cheek. But he frowned when Rory sat across from him and not next to him.</p><p>\u201cDid you get in trouble with your boss lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s just a snoopy bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much. I didn\u2019t order you a margarita because I wasn\u2019t sure if you could have a drink at lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter not. Hannah will probably do a breath check on me when I get back.\u201d She scrolled down the menu choices. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to answer to her for the next three months while I\u2019m in charge of a special project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the project?\u201d</p><p>Rory looked up at him and grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a fulltime project, that\u2019s what matters at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this project a stepping stone to getting a fulltime position at the WNRC?\u201d</p><p>God she hoped not. If anything it\u2019d add interest to her resume so she could escape this job from hell. She hedged. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I gave notice at the Twin Pines. I have to work Saturday night but after that I\u2019m done. One job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you know what to do with yourself with only one job?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily I\u2019ve got some great ideas on how to keep you entertained.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll just bet you do. As Rory was about to point out that she wasn\u2019t a source of entertainment while he killed time in Sundance, the waitress came by.</p><p>Rory ordered a pulled pork burrito and Dalton ordered a salad with spicy grilled chicken. \u201cA salad in a Mexican restaurant? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to eating this much. Between the junk food feast the other night and my mom cooking a triple helping of my favorite meal, which included cake, I\u2019ve gotta watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look more...buff since I saw you last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogging will bulk you up in a helluva hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally good. She dragged me to a hole-in-the-wall bar last night, where apparently she\u2019s a regular. I got a huge kick outta seeing that side of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom is different since she and Gavin hooked up. Not in a bad way. She\u2019s got that best friend, confidant, lover thing with Gavin. I\u2019m happy for her because she deserves it.\u201d</p><p>Dalton took her hand. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. Although there is the teeniest part of me that is jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you decided to settle for Dildo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDildo?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cDillon Doland, your ex-fianc\u00e9. Dildo for short, from here on out.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. Hard. \u201cI forgot how funny you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget how beautiful you are when you laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d His thumb swept over her knuckles as his gaze roamed her face. \u201cTell you when Sierra told me you planned to marry someone else that I drowned my sorrows in a fifth of scotch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. For three nights in a row. You might find this hard to believe, but my fightin\u2019 days ended after I left Wyoming. So it\u2019d been a while since I\u2019d picked a fight. But I found the biggest, meanest logger in the bar. You know how the rest of this goes\u2014he beat the fuck outta me.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s gut clenched. Not only at the mental image of him being bruised and bloody, but that he\u2019d actually told her the engagement caused him to snap.</p><p>Don\u2019t fall for it. He\u2019s playing you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get why you\u2019re telling me this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know that the supposed fast pace between us and the way I feel about you...ain\u2019t something that just happened in the last three days.\u201d</p><p>Talk about being steamrolled. Before she could ask how he felt about her, the waitress delivered chips and salsa.</p><p>\u201cGot plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed when she fidgeted. \u201cWith who?\u201d</p><p>Rory glanced down.</p><p>Strong fingers lifted her chin. \u201cWith who?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cA couple of girls I met at the community center. We\u2019re all single so we call it our Friday night date.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton continued to stare at her. \u201cThen you\u2019ll just have to invite me as your date next Friday night. Because, sweetheart, you\u2019re no longer single.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He angled forward and flashed his teeth. \u201cI want to make it very clear to everyone that you and I are together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not ready for that?\u201d Rory demanded.</p><p>\u201cThen get ready. I\u2019ve waited long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFYI: I don\u2019t like the pushy bastard McKay side of you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton got nose to nose with her. \u201cFYI: Tough shit. I\u2019m not hiding our relationship from anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a relationship. One lunch date, one dinner date and a bunch of stolen kisses do not a relationship make, Dalton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. Rory, will you go steady with me?\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cNot funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a set number of dates in mind before we can call this what it really is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat this is, is you having delusions about what we\u2014\u201d</p><p>His very loud, very male growl of displeasure stopped the flow of bullshit from her brain to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend this is one-sided.\u201d</p> <p>She said nothing.</p><p>Which seemed to further annoy him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me in your life at all, say the word. I\u2019ll walk away right now and you won\u2019t see me again.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened. Closed. She tried to open it again but she\u2019d contracted a case of lockjaw in the past five seconds. She couldn\u2019t force the denial out of her tightly closed lips.</p><p>That\u2019s because you can\u2019t deny it.</p><p>Christ. She had to be the most masochistic woman on the planet, jumping in the mosh pit with Dalton McKay again.</p><p>But Dalton didn\u2019t gloat. He seemed relieved. \u201cAnswer the question. How many dates?\u201d</p><p>Somehow, Rory tossed out, \u201cFive dates. Real dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat constitutes a real date?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe usual. We meet. We talk.\u201d Too easy. Add another stipulation. \u201cAnd we kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll agree with that definition.\u201d</p><p>Wait a second. Why was he being so agreeable? And why did she feel she\u2019d stumbled into another trap?</p><p>\u201cOur first date was down by the creek the time you asked if we could touch tongues because you didn\u2019t get how French kissing could be fun and not gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was not a date! We were ten and twelve years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m following your criteria.\u201d His voice dropped to a husky murmur. \u201cAnd we kissed that day, jungle girl. I still remember the taste of your lip gloss. Something sweet and fruity. The flavor was sugar...something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugarplum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tastes are a little more refined than a ten-year-old girl\u2019s these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity. Our second date was the night I so charmingly rid you of that pesky virginity. I kissed you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur third date was the night in Laramie when I drove you home from the bar and we ended up in bed. I kissed you then too.\u201d His gaze dipped to her chest. \u201cMore than just your mouth, if I recall.\u201d</p><p>Her face heated from his purely sexual look. \u201cIf I recall, I was drunk, so it shouldn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sobered up damn fast after you threw up all the alcohol. You knew exactly what you were doin\u2019 when you invited me into your bed.\u201d</p><p>Why didn\u2019t he have selective memory like most men?</p><p>\u201cThen the night I caught up with you at the Twin Pines? Date four.\u201d</p><p>Rory shook her head. \u201cNo way. That one is reaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the second time we were together in Laramie?\u201d</p><p>She remained stoic. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about that time, Mr. How-fast-can-I-put-my-pants-on-and-run-out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot fast enough if I recall correctly. Didn\u2019t you kick me in the balls?\u201d</p><p>Rory smirked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll disqualify that one. How about two nights ago when you came to my place? That was very date-like and we kissed. So by my count? We\u2019ve reached that magical dating number today. Right now as a matter of fact.\u201d He smiled with utter confidence and charm. \u201cFace it, sugarplum. We are officially in a relationship. Feel free to tell your girlfriends you\u2019ll have a plus one next Friday night for date night.\u201d</p><p>The food arrived, cutting off her retort.</p><p>While she shoved bites of burrito in her mouth, Dalton kept sneaking looks at her and smiling, a little too...pleased with himself.</p><p>She set her fork on her plate. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna make me ask about that smirk, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s not a smirk; it\u2019s a smile. This is what I look like when I\u2019m happy.\u201d He picked up her hand and kissed her knuckles. \u201cYou have no idea how happy I am.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how sweet.</p><p>Are you out of your fucking mind? He\u2019s not sweet. This man has an agenda, he\u2019s working an angle. And you\u2019re falling for it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>You. Me. This. But mostly me because I cannot believe I\u2019m getting sucked in by you again. \u201cI, ah, think I ate too fast.\u201d</p><p>His eyes showed concern. \u201cDo you have antacids? If not I\u2019ve probably got some in my truck.\u201d</p><p>See? Sweet. Genuinely sweet. Like the time when you were kids and you jabbed a piece of wood in the bottom of your foot and he carried you to the cabin.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten that. What other good things had she forgotten about Dalton McKay? A lot.</p><p>What\u2019s goin\u2019 on between us ain\u2019t really so sudden.</p><p>That freaked her the fuck out. She stood abruptly. \u201cThanks for lunch, I gotta go or I\u2019m gonna be late getting back to work.\u201d</p><p>That marked the first time she ran away from Dalton McKay.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>For the past two days, Rory\u2019s concerns, accusations, whatever they were, kept popping up while Dalton was alone working on the house. He admitted they had a tumultuous past, but it hadn\u2019t started out that way.</p><p>Dalton remembered the first time he\u2019d met Rory when he\u2019d been nine years old. Most kids didn\u2019t recall specific days from their childhood with such clarity, but meeting her had been a life-changing event for him.</p><p>Had he ever told her that?</p><p>Probably not. And if he told her that now she wouldn\u2019t believe him. The woman was so damn suspicious of him. Not that he blamed her, given their history.</p><p>That afternoon he\u2019d raced away from home as fast as his legs could carry him to the secret spot he\u2019d discovered\u2014a mini oasis compared to the dry, flat land around his house. The creek zigzagged, leaving one section accessible through the fence line. He\u2019d been warned to stay out of the area, but the sound of water soothed him. The icy coldness of it numbed the pain from the strap marks on his backside. He could lie on the flat rock beside the creek and gaze at the sky, lazing in the sun like an old barn cat. Lazing in a way that\u2019d get him whupped again at home. He\u2019d hidden himself away there more than a dozen times, always alone.</p><p>Until that day.</p><p>A shout of, \u201cHey!\u201d had jolted him out of the peaceful place.</p><p>Dalton had turned around so fast he\u2019d tumbled off the rock. He\u2019d been on his hands and knees, when a pair of red cowboy boots had stopped right in front of him. He looked up into the scowling face of a pigtailed blonde.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing on my rock?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Before he could answer, she hit him with another accusation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be on our land.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d picked himself up off the dirt and loomed over her. \u201cYeah, what are you gonna do about it, short stuff? Tattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I know you. You\u2019re in first grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going into second grade,\u201d she corrected him.</p><p>He eyed her suspiciously. \u201cIf this is your land, how come you don\u2019t ride the bus with me\u2019n my brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my mom works in town and she picks me up after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t got a dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did he die or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just me\u2019n my mom.\u201d She scowled. \u201cHow\u2019d you sneak in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t sneak. I walked.\u201d He pointed. \u201cFrom that way.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth formed an \u201cO\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of them.\u201d</p><p>Even at age nine Dalton hadn\u2019t needed an explanation on what she\u2019d meant. But he\u2019d immediately shot back, \u201cAnd you\u2019re one of them hippies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d Then the blonde sprite had charged him, knocking him on his butt in the dirt. He\u2019d cried out, not only because a girl had tackled him\u2014a girl!\u2014but by pouncing on him, he\u2019d hit the ground hard.</p><p>\u201cYou take that back,\u201d she\u2019d shouted in his face.</p><p>She\u2019d sat on him and kept his arms pinned down. Man, she was really strong. \u201cLemme go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, you\u2019re not a hippie.\u201d</p><p>Not three seconds later she\u2019d grinned at him and let him go before she stood.</p><p>Indignant, Dalton heaved himself to his feet. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really tryin\u2019, you know. I could\u2019ve gotten away from you at any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I ain\u2019t supposed to hit girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora Rose Wetzler. But everyone calls me Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora Rose? Ain\u2019t that the name of one of them Disney princesses?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cNo. The princess in Sleeping Beauty was named Briar Rose when she was in hiding with the fairies. I\u2019m Aurora Rose. Not the same at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHuh. I\u2019m Dalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKay,\u201d she finished with him. \u201cYou\u2019re in third grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoin\u2019 into fourth grade,\u201d he corrected.</p> <p>Rory walked around him and scrambled on top of the rock. \u201cThis is my rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet I can knock you off and make it my rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you ain\u2019t supposed to hit girls, remember?\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019d put him in a dilemma. He\u2019d scrambled onto the rock beside her. \u201cNot the same thing. It\u2019s like a contest. Or a game. Like playing king of the mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a stupid game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could play something else.\u201d Might be fun to play with a girl for a change. He used to play with his cousin Keely but she bossed him around as much as his brothers did. Not that his brothers wanted to play anymore. And since he was older than Rory, he\u2019d get to be in charge. \u201cWe could play pirates! The rock could be our ship.\u201d Dalton struck a pose. \u201cI could be the pirate king. You could be the princess I rescued from another ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Rory said. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be some dumb princess. I wanna be the pirate king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a girl, you can\u2019t be a king,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be the queen of the jungle.\u201d She\u2019d pushed him off the rock.</p> <p>Rather than getting mad, he laughed at her audacity.</p><p>Surprised by his laughter, she laughed. And they\u2019d become fast friends. Secret friends, running through the woods, splashing in the creek, making forts. The friendship parameters had changed during their teen years, but they\u2019d been a constant in each other\u2019s lives.</p><p>Dalton needed to remind her there was more than just bad history between them.</p><p>So on a whim Sunday morning he\u2019d texted Rory, telling her he\u2019d swing by her place at noon. But Rory\u2019s dog, Jingle, was a lot happier to see him than Rory was\u2014and Jingle growled at him.</p><p>Only not as much as Rory did. \u201cYou cannot just show up at my house whenever you feel like it, Dalton McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI texted you.\u201d</p><p>Arms crossed over her chest, she blocked the entrance to her cabin. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask if you could come over. You just said you were coming over. Big difference.\u201d</p><p>Man, her hackles were up as much as Jingle\u2019s\u2014not that he\u2019d voice that comparison. \u201cSo you\u2019re not interested in the glazed donuts and raspberry-filled bismarcks I brought?\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze moved to the grocery bag dangling from his fingertips. \u201cThat is cheating. Plying me with my favorite donuts so I forgive your breach of etiquette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go ahead and add this onto my list of broken rules.\u201d He pressed his mouth to hers, intending to share a sweet kiss. But the instant her lips parted, he couldn\u2019t help but sneak his tongue inside for a tiny taste of her, which wasn\u2019t enough. So by the time he forced himself to back off, his cock was as hard as his breathing.</p><p>Good thing he wore a long coat.</p><p>\u201cNot fair,\u201d she murmured against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI warned you I ain\u2019t gonna play fair.\u201d He kissed her temple. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for two days. Which is two days too long. So you gonna let me in? Or will I be sharing these donuts with Jingle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Dalton kicked off his boots and headed for the small kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSit and I\u2019ll get plates. Would you like coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Neither spoke until they were both settled at the table with food and drink. \u201cHow late did you work last night?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>\u201cTill it closed at two. The bar side was hopping so I helped out.\u201d She ran a hand over the top of her head. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m a mess. I slept in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look a mess to me. You look perfectly beautiful, as always.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s green eyes turned shrewd. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m some stunner today. No makeup, my hair pulled into a ponytail and I\u2019m wearing sweats.\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cI stick by what I said. Ain\u2019t the clothes that make a woman sexy.\u201d</p><p>Not sure what to say, Rory focused on demolishing her donut. \u201cSo why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bully-kiss you, \u2019cause I know you missed it.\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d see what your plans were for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. Laundry. Catching up on some reading for work. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need furniture. You\u2019ve got great taste so I\u2019d like your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re falling down in the charming and cajoling department. Try again.\u201d</p><p>Fishing for compliments? He could oblige her. \u201cRory, my stunningly gorgeous, sinfully sexy, surprisingly sweet, whip-smart and all-around perfect dream woman. If you don\u2019t help me choose decent furnishings, I\u2019ll buy mismatched bean bag chairs and TV trays and call it good.\u201d Dalton leaned forward, the picture of earnestness. \u201cPlease, goddess of all that requires a shrewd eye and a deft hand, save me from myself.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s much better. We going into Rapid City?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d start in Spearfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You interested in antiques? Secondhand stores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo and no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat narrows your shopping choices in Spearfish.\u201d</p><p>Jingle put her paws on Dalton\u2019s knee and he ruffled the dog\u2019s ears. \u201cThen let\u2019s head into Rapid. I don\u2019t want anything that has to be special ordered. The furniture has to be in stock so they can deliver it next week. I\u2019m sick of sitting on the damn floor and sleeping on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Rory drained her coffee and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll go get ready.\u201d</p><p>Dalton was pleasantly surprised when Rory walked out of her bedroom about five minutes later. In his past experience with women, \u201cgetting ready\u201d took anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour. \u201cThat was fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to fuss when you\u2019ve already seen me au natural.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her against his body. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you au natural for a long damn time and I\u2019m makin\u2019 it a priority to change that.\u201d</p><p>Rory twined her arms around his neck. \u201cI half-expected your reason for showing up today was to convince me to take a tumble or ten with you, since I actually have a bed we could tumble into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempting.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cMake no mistake that I want you like fucking crazy, but I won\u2019t rush it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I said I wanted you to drag me to my bed and ravish me right now...?\u201d</p><p>Dalton clamped his hands on her ass and started pushing her toward the bedroom.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cJust checking.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always hated shopping until he\u2019d gone with Rory.</p><p>She refused to let him settle for bachelor-bland furnishings. But the couch, loveseat and recliner she picked were comfortable and not too girly. He chose a king-sized mattress and she convinced him he needed a nightstand and a chest of drawers.</p><p>However, she wasn\u2019t invested in his home entertainment choices at the electronics store. Dalton picked the most basic setup, including a dish for satellite TV and the internet, a DVR and a DVD player and it still set him back more than he expected.</p><p>On the way back to Wyoming, he joked, \u201cI intended to take you someplace nice for helping me out today, but I\u2019m thinking DQ is the extent of my budget.\u201d Might make him pathetic, but he was testing the waters\u2014see if Rory had an issue being seen in public with him in Sundance. \u201cI\u2019m sure Dewey\u2019s has a decent Sunday special. If you\u2019re all right eating there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish was nearly empty. The hostess seated them in the back row of booths.</p><p>Rory ordered hot tea. Dalton ordered iced tea. They both chose the same open-faced hot turkey sandwich and a dinner salad.</p><p>\u201cSee? We have things in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood? That\u2019s hardly an endorsement for our compatibility.\u201d</p><p>Their easy companionship from the day had vanished.</p><p>\u201cDalton, I need to ask you something.\u201d When she struggled to speak he knew he wouldn\u2019t like her question. \u201cWhy do you think a relationship will work between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just will.\u201d</p><p>The waitress dropped off their salads.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you supposedly so crazy about me?\u201d</p><p>It appeared Rory wasn\u2019t letting him off the hook. \u201cYou\u2019re talkin\u2019 like this is something that just came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it did just come up when you returned to Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the fact I\u2019ve known you since you were a bratty, pig-tailed six-year-old doesn\u2019t hold any weight with you?\u201d</p><p>Rory stabbed her salad. \u201cI\u2019m no more the bratty six-year-old than I am the virginal eighteen-year-old, or the big-mouthed twenty-two-year-old that you used to know. You\u2019re trying to convince me that you\u2019ve changed?\u201d She looked at him. \u201cSo have I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? Maybe that\u2019s what you oughta be proving to me. Not that you\u2019ve changed, but in the few times we\u2019ve seen each other you\u2019ve noticed the changes in me.\u201d</p><p>Dalton gestured for her to bring-it-on while he forked a chunk of iceberg lettuce into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cName three things about me that are different from three years ago. And any cosmetic changes aren\u2019t an acceptable answer,\u201d she warned.</p><p>Dalton sipped his tea. \u201cIf I do this are you willing to do the same for me? And admit I\u2019ve changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But only if I agree your three guesses are accurate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna be guessing, \u2019cause sugarplum, I know that\u2019s what scares you.\u201d He paused with his fork midair. \u201cThere\u2019s a melancholy in you that\u2019s never been visible before. Maybe it\u2019s always been there and you\u2019ve been good at hiding it, but now I see it.\u201d He said, \u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d before he shoveled in a bite of cucumber. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter than I expected.\u201d She sliced a cherry tomato in half. \u201cAre you waiting for an explanation for my supposed melancholy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. The more time we spend together, the better my chance to figure it out myself. Besides, I\u2019ve got two chances left to wow you with my insight into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as quick to anger as you used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Funny how she\u2019d snapped that question at him. \u201cYou only punched me once when I ambushed you at the Twin Pines.\u201d He smirked. \u201cBefore? You\u2019d\u2019ve gotten at least another shot in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count because I was shocked to see you and off my game.\u201d</p><p>Dalton lifted an eyebrow.</p> <p>Rory fidgeted. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I have mellowed some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot you down cold, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get cocky, McKay. You still have one answer to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou marked an occasion in your life with a tattoo.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. But I suspected.\u201d Dalton leaned forward. \u201cWhat is it? A heart? A flower? A butterfly? An Asian symbol?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you. And since that is a cosmetic change, it doesn\u2019t count. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed you stopped biting your nails.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she automatically curled her fingers into her palms. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had ripped cuticles and short nails. Now you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The waitress delivered their main course and conversation ceased. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable silence, just contemplative.</p><p>They must\u2019ve been hungry because the food disappeared fast.</p><p>\u201cNow before you start in on the changes in me, I want you to tell me three things about you that I don\u2019t know. Big. Small. Funny.\u201d He flashed her a grin. \u201cSexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can do sexy.\u201d She lowered her voice to a throaty purr. \u201cI like to wear matching lingerie. Doesn\u2019t have to be the high-end stuff, but my bra and my panties have to match.\u201d She took a quick look around the restaurant before she started to undo the buttons on her blouse. \u201cToday I wanted to feel feminine so I chose this red number.\u201d Watching his avid eyes, she let her finger trace the satin piping of the bra cup across the mound of her breast.</p><p>Dalton made a low sound in the back of his throat.</p> <p>\u201cIn spite of the pretty packaging, this one offers a lot of support. Which makes the girls beg to be noticed.\u201d Rory kept gliding her finger up and down over the swell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m likin\u2019 this bolder side of you, Rory.\u201d He gazed into her eyes. \u201cIs it just a tease or is it real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if I sat beside you and ran my tongue along that line? Would you push me away? Or would you arch your back and offer me more?\u201d Dalton leaned forward. \u201cWould you let me slip my hand into your pants so I could see for myself that your panties matched your bra?\u201d</p><p>Flustered, Rory buttoned up her blouse. \u201cI\u2019ll save you the trouble. It\u2019s a red thong.\u201d</p><p>Not so bold after all, are you, sweetheart? But you wanna be and I can work with that.</p><p>They stared at each other, both of them breathing hard. There\u2019d never been this intensity between them before. Not even the times they\u2019d been naked together.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinkin\u2019 about, jungle girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderwear,\u201d she blurted. \u201cWhether you wear boxers or briefs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoxers. Tell me something else about you I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cI teach a yoga class at the community center on Monday nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoga, huh? Did you learn that from your mom?\u201d</p><p>Rory rolled her eyes. \u201cShe can\u2019t stand still long enough. I enrolled in a class in college, loved it and I\u2019ve been doing it ever since. Got my teacher\u2019s certificate just for fun. There weren\u2019t any classes available here so I started one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo technically you\u2019re not down to one job if you\u2019re still teaching yoga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaching yoga isn\u2019t a job. It saves my sanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone can come to your class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cNever tried it. Might be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChallenging,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>He shoved his plate aside. \u201cTell me something you haven\u2019t told anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we still playing twenty questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou claimed we don\u2019t know each other. I\u2019m aiming to learn everything I can about you. So quit stalling. Answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days I feel like a prisoner to my college degrees and wish I would\u2019ve done another field of study.\u201d She froze. \u201cShit. Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to say that. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Dalton picked up her hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize or pretend with me. I won\u2019t tell anyone what we\u2019ve talked about.\u201d</p><p>Her defiant gaze burned into him. \u201cLike you kept the secret about my mom\u2019s financial troubles when she ran the B&amp;B? Oh, right, you went running to Tell with that information as soon as possible. And you also told your cousin Ben. So I\u2019d really rather you forgot what I just said because I don\u2019t need my boss getting wind of my feelings because of your loose lips.\u201d</p><p>Dalton had clenched his teeth so hard the muscle on the left side of his jaw rippled.</p><p>He collected himself and while he did that, he ran the ragged edge of his thumb over her knuckles in a soothing manner. Was he calming her down? Or himself?</p><p>Keep focused. She\u2019s baiting you to see if you lose your cool like you used to.</p><p>\u201cHow about I ignore that outburst and tell you three differences about me. I can claim I\u2019ve changed until I\u2019m blue in the face and you still won\u2019t believe me, which is why I\u2019m gonna prove it.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, I don\u2019t blab all to my family. I hadn\u2019t done that for a while even before I left here. And yes, that is one claim I can prove. My brothers didn\u2019t know I\u2019d been livin\u2019 in Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you mad at them or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just liked havin\u2019 my own thing, my own space. Far as they knew I was a wanderer. Second\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a deliberate thinker,\u201d Rory interjected. \u201cYou used to say the first thing that popped into your head. Now you factor other things into your response instead of just blurting out whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Dalton grinned. Then he kissed her hand. \u201cYou noticed. Awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take you to change that about yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill an ongoing process. I got tired of bein\u2019 known as a loudmouth. It\u2019s amazing how much more I\u2019ve learned when I shut my mouth and listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLastly...\u201d Rory tapped her fingers on the table and studied his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be surrounded by people. You\u2019re not afraid to be by yourself. You can\u2019t deny that you never liked your own company. I always knew when your brothers or cousins didn\u2019t want to hang out with you because you came looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re right about me learning to like bein\u2019 by myself and letting go of the circus of fools that surrounded me all the time, you\u2019re wrong about the last thing. You never were my last choice, Rory. Then or now.\u201d</p><p>That flustered her.</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cWould either of you care for dessert?\u201d the waitress asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPumpkin cheesecake, apple strudel pie, lemon honey cake, peanut butter pie, chocolate caramel brownie. Or we\u2019ve got ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s eyes took on a devious gleam. \u201cSugar pie, honey bun, doll face, knowing my tastes so well, which dessert would you pick for me?\u201d</p><p>A challenge. \u201cDepends on if you\u2019re planning on sharing or if this is just strictly your treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sharing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there pops out the mine demand of an only child. So I\u2019ll say...the peanut butter pie.\u201d</p><p>Her look of surprise was classic.</p><p>Dalton smiled at the waitress. \u201cBut go ahead and bring us two forks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWas it just a lucky guess?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of my hand.\u201d</p><p>That demand only made him slide his lips farther up to nibble on the soft inner flesh of her forearm.</p><p>\u201cYou are trying to fluster me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d But she didn\u2019t remove her hand from his. \u201cSo I believe it was my turn to tell you three things about me that you don\u2019t know. Big. Small. Funny.\u201d He sank his teeth into the base of her thumb. \u201cSexy.\u201d</p><p>Rory made a soft noise.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a small thing. I keep a hundred dollar bill in my truck and another one folded up in my wallet. I\u2019ve never used them but they\u2019re there if I need them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that because you didn\u2019t have enough money for something at one time and it embarrassed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t trace it to a specific incident, but probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d She pulled their joined hands closer and rubbed her lips across his knuckles. The entire side of his body broke out in goose bumps. \u201cTell me something sexy, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sexy we talkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs explicit as you wanna get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in Amsterdam, I hired a lesbian prostitute. For twenty-four hours she taught me everything about sexually satisfying a woman. And I mean everything.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Her mouth opened and closed. Then she said, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>She dropped his hand. \u201cThat was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rory. Admit it\u2019s a little funny.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lips quirked. \u201cOkay. It was a tiny bit funny.\u201d</p><p>The waitress dropped off the pie.</p><p>Rory immediately snatched both forks. \u201cFor that lesbian hooker story, you lost pie. If you behave yourself, I might give you a little taste.\u201d She sliced off a forkful and popped it in her mouth. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p> <p>He growled, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna torture me. Makin\u2019 sex noises while you\u2019re eating that pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex noises?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cSex noises like you\u2019ll make when my mouth is buried in your pussy. When I\u2019m licking up every bit of your sweet cream and then when I go back for another bite. And another because I\u2019m positive I won\u2019t be able to get enough of the slice of heaven between your thighs.\u201d</p><p>Rory sliced off a huge piece of pie and held it up to his lips. \u201cI\u2019m gonna love hearing that deep growly voice whispering sexy things in my ear when you\u2019re making me moan those sex noises. But for now, how about if we stop teasing each other because it\u2019s bound to get us into all sorts of trouble in a public place.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. That was Rory\u2019s way of telling him he\u2019d passed her I\u2019ve changed test. \u201cI agree.\u201d He let her feed him the pie.</p> <p>\u201cSo were you really in Amsterdam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Wasn\u2019t my favorite place, but I had a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was your favorite place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLloret de Mar in Spain.\u201d Dalton started talking about his travels. Then Rory told him about her experiences overseas and they completely lost track of time.</p><p>The waitress pointed out the lights were off in Dewey\u2019s, and she showed them the door.</p><p>\u201cFirst time we\u2019ve closed down a restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFar more fun than closing down a bar.\u201d He took her hand as they walked to his truck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely have a clear memory of tonight.\u201d</p><p>At her house he left his truck running so he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to stay, but he walked her to the gate. \u201cThank you for today. For all your help and hanging out. I had a great time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Do you, ah, want to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dalton twisted a strand of her hair around his finger. \u201cMore than anything. But I\u2019m gonna turn around, get in my truck and go home instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to hers. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p> <p>Another kiss. \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>The sweet kisses ended and he damn near inhaled her.</p><p>Jingle raced out the doggie door and barked at them.</p><p>Dalton broke the kiss. \u201cHelluva guard dog, Rory.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you this week.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Rory couldn\u2019t believe it when Dalton waltzed into her yoga class at the community center.</p><p>She just about swallowed her tongue seeing him in a black tank top and baggy athletic shorts, his feet bare, his hair just a little too shaggy, dark stubble on his face, those damn dimples and a gleam in his ridiculously blue eyes. The man looked like a rogue pirate. A hot pirate, with thickly muscled arms and a broad chest. When he stretched his arms above his head and his shirt rode up, she noticed that sexy cut of muscle on either side of his hips. She envisioned herself dropping to her knees and following that deep line with her tongue.</p><p>And yep, she caught a glimpse of his abs. Whoa. Did he have a six-pack, an eight-pack, or my god...was that a twelve-pack of abs?</p><p>No. Fucking. Way. Now she really wanted a closer look.</p><p>The other ladies in the class were taking a serious gander at the delicious Dalton. It\u2019d be all over town tomorrow that a macho McKay male had attended a women\u2019s yoga class. Then again, a McKay being surrounded by swooning women wasn\u2019t exactly news.</p><p>That thought annoyed her. Rory marched up to him and completely invaded his space. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakin\u2019 your advice. You said if I wanted to get to know you, I\u2019d show interest in what matters to you. So I\u2019m here ready to be bent to your will, Teach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what goes on in a yoga class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. That\u2019s why I\u2019m counting on you to show me all your moves.\u201d Dalton\u2019s gaze dropped to her mouth. \u201cWith your lips this close I\u2019m tempted to give you one of them bully-kisses you\u2019re so fond of.\u201d</p><p>Rory took a step back. \u201cNot happening. There are yoga mats in the corner. Grab one so we can get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and walked to the front of the gym. When she faced the group, Dalton flashed her a very male grin. Then she watched as Lou-Ann handed him her pink yoga mat and trotted to the back of the room to get another one for herself.</p><p>Unreal.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, everyone. Since we have a new member in our midst tonight, I feel it\u2019s important to go over the rules. First rule. No talking. This isn\u2019t a social activity. Second rule. If your muscles become fatigued during a pose, drop into downward-facing dog or child\u2019s pose. Please don\u2019t pack up your belongings and interrupt class by leaving. Third rule. Remember to breathe.\u201d Rory smiled at the sixteen regular class attendees. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>Tempting not to explain any of the warm-up exercises, or demonstrate the resting poses, but her class motto had always been \u201call who enter are welcome\u201d.</p><p>Including the man who\u2019s only here so he can get into your yoga pants?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Maybe she ought to modify that motto on the flyer.</p><p>Rory sat cross-legged at the top of her mat, hands resting palms up on her thighs. She demonstrated the uji breathing technique before she segued into basic stretches.</p><p>Then they were on their feet performing sun salutations. Four sets of each series got the blood pumping and the sweat rolling. She talked them through standard standing poses. While she started the second set, her advanced students worked through backbends.</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019ll move to basic triangle and work on all triangle poses before we switch to hip openers.\u201d Rory shot a look at Dalton.</p><p>His face was bright red. Sweat coated his arms and damp rings darkened his tank top. He looked like he was in pain. But he also wore the determined look she recognized.</p><p>So she hid her smirk and kept going.</p><p>During the last round, she wandered through the class, making adjustments to individuals\u2019 postures.</p><p>Dalton struggled\u2014like so many did in the beginning\u2014with the basic downward-facing dog pose.</p><p>She stopped in front of him.</p><p>He immediately dropped to his knees, breath choppy. He sent her a questioning look from beneath those thick black eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cWatch how I get into proper position.\u201d Rory placed her palms flat on the floor and hiked her hips up, while rolling her shoulders down and back as she dropped her heels to the floor. She spoke in a low tone. \u201cNow breathe in for three counts and exhale for three counts.\u201d As soon as she finished, she said, \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>His upper body strength was impressive but he had little flexibility in those massive shoulders.</p><p>\u201cElongating the spine is key to flexibility in yoga. Since you can\u2019t get your heels on the mat it\u2019s all right to keep your knees bent. Drop your head between your arms. No, not that far. Ears by your biceps. That\u2019s it. Now stay like that. I\u2019ll adjust your hips.\u201d Rory widened her stance, setting her feet beside Dalton\u2019s hands. She flattened her palms on his lower back and pushed.</p><p>Dalton grunted.</p><p>\u201cFeel the difference in that stretch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d His arms shook and stopped supporting his body, so when he dropped to his knees, Rory\u2019s hands slid over his butt.</p><p>His perfectly round cowboy butt. She wanted to dig her fingernails into that hard, tight flesh. When he flexed his butt cheeks like he\u2019d read her intentions, her hands fell away.</p><p>Dalton lifted his head and her crotch was in his face. Right at his mouth level. So close she could feel his rapid exhalations between her thighs. So close it would only take a slight tilt of her pelvis...</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>The hunger in his sizzling blue gaze had her retreating.</p><p>Rory strolled to her spot, trying not to imagine the rough stubble on Dalton\u2019s face abrading the inside of her thighs. Or how she\u2019d direct that smirking mouth exactly where she wanted it and put that sassy tongue of his to good use.</p><p>Her gaze met Dalton\u2019s and he licked his lips. Had the man been reading her mind?</p><p>Probably. Because face it, Rory, you\u2019re pretty damn transparent.</p><p>She shook herself out of it and worked through the final stretching exercises before instructing her students to grab their straps for cool down.</p><p>Normally savasana was her favorite part of class. Stretched out on her mat, eyes closed, remaining motionless as her mind drifted into blissful nothingness after a hard yoga workout.</p><p>But tonight, her thoughts were focused on a hunky man five mats away. A man who\u2019d taken her suggestion about getting to know her seriously. A man it was getting harder and harder to shake off. She wrestled with the truth that she didn\u2019t want to shake him off. She liked his attention.</p><p>People around her began to get restless\u2014her sign savasana was over. She coaxed everyone out of the relaxation state and finished the practice in lotus position with Namaste.</p><p>The yoga group didn\u2019t stick around to chitchat after class. Vanessa pointed to Dalton, waggled her eyebrows and mimed call me before she scooted out the door.</p><p>Leaving Rory and Dalton alone.</p><p>She wandered over. He remained in savasana on his mat. \u201cDalton? You all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou wrecked me. I can\u2019t move. I think all the muscles in my body have seized up and you\u2019ll need to take me to the ER.\u201d He groaned again.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re admitting yoga is hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes.\u201d Dalton cracked an eye open. \u201cWasn\u2019t there supposed to be chanting? Sitting around doin\u2019 deep thinkin\u2019 about life and shit?\u201d</p><p>Rory laughed. \u201cIn some yoga disciplines there\u2019s meditation and chanting. Not in this one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a pretty fit guy.

I\u2019ll just sleep here tonight. Or I\u2019ll be dead come morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDramatic much? Since you\u2019re the last one here, by default you\u2019re selected to help me put away the equipment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Give me a day or two to get back to normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I die...dyin\u2019 was worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeeing your ass in yoga pants? Definitely worth havin\u2019 this post-yoga paralysis.\u201d</p><p>Rory leaned over and thumped him on the chest. She shrieked when Dalton\u2019s hands circled her biceps and he tugged her to the mat, rolling to pin her body beneath his.</p><p>\u201cOmigod, you pervert. Get off me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSay please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so gonna kick your ass, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it, but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve got you locked down, yogi.\u201d</p> <p>She studied him. God. She could get lost in the masculine planes and angles of his face. The man was just too damn good-looking. Her gaze dropped to his full lips. Lips that could be hard and yet soft. Lips that could coax and tease. Full lips that showcased his panty-dropping smile. Lips that were curled into a very cocky smirk. \u201cWere you faking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. My body aches like a motherfucker right now.\u201d He bent to nuzzle her neck. \u201cI wanna taste you, Aurora. Lick the salt off your skin.\u201d</p><p>Why was this turning her on?</p><p>Then Dalton\u2019s tongue snaked out and swept down the side of her throat. His deep, male groan vibrated right down the center of her. \u201cI\u2019m dying to learn every inch of you with my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s body arched when his lips connected with the skin below her ear.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cWant you, need you, have to have you. Goddamn, woman, the way you respond to me is such a fucking turn-on.\u201d</p><p>Somehow her brain came back online. \u201cI figured you were turned on with the way your cock is digging into my belly.\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed her temple. \u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea of where I could put my cock so it\u2019d be out of the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019d still be in my way and hard for me to talk since I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d like to shove it in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. But that\u2019s not my first choice of where I\u2019d like to put it.\u201d His lips moved down the side of her face, his teeth nipping at her jawline. Her chin. He eased back and looked into her eyes, their mouths a breath apart. \u201cYou gonna let me kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You\u2019re asking? That\u2019s a first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that right there, smart ass, is why I don\u2019t ask.\u201d Dalton pinned her arms above her head and captured her lips.</p><p>No sweet start to this kiss. His mouth assaulted hers with pure hunger. A wet, hot clash of tongues, of gliding lips and shared breath.</p><p>So much passion. The kiss would\u2019ve knocked her to her knees if she hadn\u2019t already been lying down. Her body reacted to this man\u2014a blood-pumping, dizzy, wet-between-her-thighs reaction. Just when she\u2019d begun to wonder why they hadn\u2019t stripped, why his mouth wasn\u2019t on her nipples as his cock rammed into her, Dalton ripped his mouth from hers.</p><p>He buried his face in her neck and a full body shudder rolled through him. Then he sighed\u2014his breath a hot wash on her damp skin. \u201cI want you like fuckin\u2019 air, Aurora, but not here. Not like this.\u201d He placed a soft kiss below her ear and pushed upright.</p><p>That show of control was not how the old Dalton would\u2019ve acted. He would\u2019ve sweet-talked her into believing no one would catch them fucking around.</p><p>Proof right there that he had changed.</p><p>Sad to think she hadn\u2019t changed when it came to him. With his hard body on hers and those intense kisses clouding her brain, she would\u2019ve gladly ditched her clothes and fucked him right there on the pink yoga mat.</p><p>Show some restraint.</p><p>Problem was, she didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>But somehow she did. She rolled to her feet. \u201cYou are dangerous, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Why do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re sore, you will help me return the equipment to storage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>After she\u2019d shoved everything in the closet and locked it, she slipped on her jacket and gloves. \u201cSo you think you\u2019ll become a regular at yoga class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see if I\u2019m alive tomorrow.\u201d He buttoned up his black duster. \u201cSpeaking of tomorrow...what are we doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Rory eyed his ensemble. Black gunslinger duster, neon orange hat with fuzzy earflaps. His bare calves stuck out from beneath the duster and he wore white athletic shoes and black socks. He was a prime example of what not to wear\u2014so why was she thinking that he looked so damn cute?</p><p>Because you\u2019re a fucking sap and this man can\u2019t wait to tap you.</p><p>\u201cSince when do we spend every evening together?\u201d</p><p>Dalton leaned over and kissed her nose. \u201cSince you\u2019n me are a couple.\u201d</p><p>Her argument dried on her tongue when she realized he\u2019d said that almost with...pride. \u201cThat may be problematic tomorrow night since I\u2019m having supper with Addie and Truman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll come along. I need to clear the air with them anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t think it might, oh, bother my best friend that I\u2019m coupling with the guy who dumped her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you and me ain\u2019t even started coupling yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. But you have my promise I wouldn\u2019t hurt Addie again for the world. She never has to know the real reason that I walked out on her was because of you.\u201d He stroked her cheek with a gloved finger. \u201cNo one besides us ever needs to know that, Aurora.\u201d</p><p>Such a sweet man.</p><p>Stop that. Right now. He is not sweet. He\u2019s a manipulative heartbreaker.</p><p>Despite the warnings, she found herself saying, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Addie tonight.\u201d Rory poked him in the chest. \u201cBut if she or Truman don\u2019t want you there, you don\u2019t get to whine about it.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cWhen the fuck do I ever whine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to do a lot of shit that I don\u2019t do anymore. Proving to you I\u2019ve changed, remember?\u201d He poked her chest right back. \u201cIf Addie and Truman won\u2019t welcome me into their home I\u2019ll suck it up and act like a big boy. I\u2019ll probably write a poem about hurt feelings, broken friendships and the rocky path to true love.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cA poem? Really?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cFuck no. But I did have you worried there for a sec, huh?\u201d</p><p>She whapped him on the arm and exited the building.</p><p>No surprise that Dalton walked her to her Jeep. No surprise, either, that he laid a big, wet steamy kiss on her before whispering good-night.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a good night. Rory tossed and turned in her bed because she couldn\u2019t get the man out of her mind. This thing with Dalton was driving her batshit crazy.</p><p>She mentally corrected the word thing and inserted his preferred term: relationship.</p><p>Goddammit. How had the man invaded her life and her thoughts so completely that her word choices weren\u2019t even her own? The fact she then heard his confident little male chuckle in her head was just another example of why she was so completely screwed up by all of this. In her book, and in her experiences with one Dalton McKay, screwed up equaled screwed over.</p><p>Now the man was acting like he was in love with her, for Christsake.</p><p>In love.</p><p>With her.</p><p>As if he\u2019d always been in love with her.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>He\u2019d been in lust with her, but that wasn\u2019t exactly news since the man-whore had been in lust with any number of women over the years.</p><p>She\u2019d replayed their conversations from the past week on the drive home. More questions bounced around in her brain than answers.</p><p>If it\u2019d been a one-time thing between her and Dalton\u2014like the night she\u2019d given him her virginity\u2014she could blame him. But she\u2019d slept with him two other times.</p><p>The night she\u2019d spilled her guts to him about her mom\u2019s financial woes. They\u2019d both been slightly drunk and had no business climbing between the sheets, but they had. From what she remembered...the sex hadn\u2019t been that good, just sloppy, quick and regrettable.</p><p>And yes, Dalton had been gone when she\u2019d woken up hung-over as hell the next morning. And yes, he\u2019d used the information she\u2019d shared in a drunken rant to try and screw over her mom. Typical fucking McKay. So it\u2019d been a double betrayal.</p><p>But had Rory learned her lesson?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>When Dalton had shown up out of the blue at her place in Laramie two years later, a dejected man, admitting he\u2019d been second-guessing everything about himself and his life, she\u2019d taken him in. She\u2019d listened to him. Offered him reassurance. She\u2019d shoved aside the bad parts of their shared past and reminded him he\u2019d always been able to confide in her.</p><p>But Dalton hadn\u2019t wanted his old friend Rory. He\u2019d wanted the woman, not the girl.</p><p>And she\u2019d been so mesmerized by his intensity and by his desire for her that she\u2019d been powerless to resist when he kissed her like her mouth existed strictly for his pleasure. When he\u2019d touched her body as if it was solely his to worship. When he\u2019d whispered such sweet and hot promises she\u2019d wanted so desperately to believe.</p><p>The sex that night? Whoo-boy. Dalton had seemed equally blown away that it\u2019d taken them two times to get it right. She\u2019d naively hoped they\u2019d started a new chapter in their lives.</p><p>But Dalton had reverted to his love-her-and-leave-her persona, except that time, she\u2019d caught him trying to sneak out in the middle of the night.</p><p>Infuriated, Rory had knocked him on his ass as he\u2019d been putting on his jeans. Then she\u2019d morphed into crazy\u2014shouting threats at him, while he was prone on the floor covering his junk with one hand and his head with the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not her finest hour.</p><p>Especially not when she\u2019d locked herself in the bathroom because she couldn\u2019t stand to see him walk out on her again. After her crying fit, she\u2019d stared at her red-rimmed eyes and blotchy face in the mirror, then she\u2019d scrutinized the suck marks on her neck and repeated, \u201cNever again, Douchebag McKay,\u201d until her hatred overtook her hurt.</p><p>So things had turned ugly between them every time they\u2019d crossed paths after that incident. Dalton had too much McKay pride to apologize for who he was and Rory had too much anger to let it slide.</p> <p>Once Sierra had stepped in, keeping Rory from taking a swing at Dalton\u2019s pretty face\u2014even when he\u2019d sworn he\u2019d only been trying to apologize.</p><p>But she had no choice except to be civil when Addie and Dalton became engaged. For all intents and purposes the groom and the maid of honor had avoided each other\u2014not that anyone noticed.</p><p>So Dalton\u2019s confession of why he\u2019d ditched Addie at the altar had knocked her sideways. Even when that time, she knew he hadn\u2019t been feeding her a line. Remembering the look in his eyes at that moment still gave her chills.</p><p>Now here he was acting like nothing had changed. Like he\u2019d just been waiting for her to get her shit together.</p><p>Wrong.</p> <p>Dalton had run out on her too many times for her to take his insistence he\u2019d changed at face value. He\u2019d leave when it suited him\u2014like he always did, regardless of who it hurt.</p><p>But this time it could be different\u2014because she was different. Rory wasn\u2019t some starry-eyed eighteen-year-old with visions of forever. She had goals and dreams and no man would ever get in the way of them again. Living in Sundance, working at the WNRC wasn\u2019t anything more than a temporary pit stop on her way to something better.</p><p>So Dalton wanted her\u2014no surprise. She wasn\u2019t immune to Dalton\u2019s charms\u2014a fact he was perfectly aware of. As much as he\u2019d use it to his advantage, she\u2019d use it to hers too. Let him try and convince her he\u2019d changed. Let him prove to her sex between them would be off the charts fantastic.</p><p>After all the shit he\u2019d put her through over the years, she deserved every bit of his sexual attention and expertise. She had no delusions about what she wanted from him; hot sex, companionship on her terms that didn\u2019t interfere with her career goals. She could reap all the benefits and take none of the risks.</p><p>Because she\u2019d be the one walking away from him this time with her heart and her pride intact.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>Stay cool.</p><p>Dalton tried to pretend he was calm about seeing Addie as he parked in front of the house she shared with Truman.</p><p>After all, three years had passed since he\u2019d left her and left town. She\u2019d married one of his best buddies and according to Rory, was perfectly happy with her life. He knew she\u2019d never forget what he\u2019d done, but had she forgiven him?</p><p>He\u2019d opted to show up early to clear the air. He rang the doorbell. Dang. Should he have brought flowers?</p><p>Too late now, he thought as the door opened. \u201cHey, Addie.\u201d</p><p>Addie squinted through the screen. \u201cDalton? What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? Supper isn\u2019t for another hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured maybe you and me oughta talk beforehand.\u201d</p><p>It appeared she might slam the door in his face, but she grudgingly said, \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He stepped inside. As in most ranch houses, the door opened into the living room. He paused and wiped his boots.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the kitchen putting everything together for tonight,\u201d she tossed over her shoulder and disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Once he\u2019d settled at the kitchen table, he got his first solid look at Addie. She didn\u2019t look much different except for her pregnancy. He smiled. \u201cSmells wonderful in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 fancy, I assure you. I\u2019m too tired lately to do more than throw food together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look great, Addie. When\u2019s the baby due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo months. We\u2019re having a little boy.\u201d She rubbed her belly, as so many pregnant women did. \u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA glass of water would be great.\u201d</p><p>Addie filled a glass and sat across from him.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He wet his dry throat.</p><p>An uncomfortable pause lingered.</p><p>There was no way to ease into this, so he jumped in. \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry for the crap you had to deal with after I didn\u2019t go through with the wedding.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms over her chest, her brown eyes unreadable. \u201cI had no choice but to deal with it since you skipped town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkipped town, chased out of town...big difference. Although I was a brawler back then, my body couldn\u2019t take any more punishment from people who beat the shit outta me on your behalf.\u201d</p><p>Her face paled. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family, your coworkers, your current husband,\u201d he said dryly, \u201call took turns whaling on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton. Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a suspicious look. \u201cNo one bragged about it? No one told you they had your back and they\u2019d taken care of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! My god. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit I didn\u2019t fight back because I probably deserved it. Except for the scuffle with Truman. I hobbled around for two days after he finished with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you left Sundance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially. I knew it\u2019d be a while before I wasn\u2019t the object of scorn. But there was other stuff goin\u2019 on that pushed me that direction.\u201d He slid his glass back and forth on the quilted placemat. \u201cThere was a lot of stuff that we never discussed, Addie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that now. At the time, I didn\u2019t wanna sweat those small details. I thought we\u2019d deal with them after the wedding. For about two months after you left, my mind kept going back to those months we were engaged. Trying to find warning signs I missed.\u201d</p><p>Dalton met her gaze. \u201cWhat did you think you missed? Because I had every intention of marrying you that day. Up until the...\u201d Moment I looked across the altar and really saw Rory.</p><p>\u201cMoment you realized you were about to say vows that were a lie,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe signs were there. You had no interest in wedding planning\u2014I chalked it up to being a guy thing. You hadn\u2019t moved a single item from your trailer into my house. In fact, you never brought up the difficulties of living in town when all your family members live and work on the ranch.\u201d</p><p>His brothers hadn\u2019t brought it up either, another reminder how out of touch they\u2019d all been.</p><p>\u201cWhy were we both eager to pledge ourselves to each other?\u201d Addie shifted in her seat. \u201cWhen I think back to our engagement? I didn\u2019t know you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a moment of doubt at our rehearsal dinner when the minister started askin\u2019 me that list of your favorites. I got one right, your favorite movie, only because we spent a lot of time watching TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was equally shocked when I got so many of your favorites wrong.\u201d</p><p>Dalton would never admit Addie had gotten most of his favorite things right, but because he\u2019d sucked at naming her favorites, he\u2019d lied just so she looked as clueless as him.</p><p>You were some prize.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we had any excuses not to know each other better. We dated for three months and were engaged for six.\u201d She fiddled with the ruffled placement edging. \u201cWhat I can\u2019t figure out? Why did you propose to me in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you said you loved me.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were sincere. You were too good for me, Addie.\u201d That had appealed to him. Marrying Addie might make him a better man. He\u2019d known for months prior to their engagement things in his life needed to change. He believed Addie was the catalyst. And she had been\u2014just not in the way either of them expected.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you suggested we wait until our wedding night to have sex?\u201d</p><p>Dalton blushed. \u201cMost likely. Although I\u2019d convinced myself that\u2019s what you wanted. In hindsight, I attributed a lot of feelings and ideas to you that weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cA little secret between you and me? I didn\u2019t tell Truman that you and I never had sex. In fact...\u201d She laughed. \u201cExactly the opposite. I told him you were an animal in bed and no man could ever compare.\u201d</p><p>Now his jaw nearly hit the table. \u201cAddie! Why in the hell would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You owed me that lie, given your reputation as a McKay stud that I didn\u2019t get to experience.\u201d She smirked. \u201cBesides, Truman got it in his head that he needed to be a lover to me that\u2019d make me forget all others and whoo-ee. It\u2019s worked. I\u2019m always walking around with a big ol\u2019 smile on my face.\u201d She shook her finger at him. \u201cSo don\u2019t you ruin my sweet gig and offer some kind of confession to my husband tonight, got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat said, I cursed your name for months after you left, Dalton McKay. But as time marched on, I realized you were right to call off the wedding. I wish you\u2019d done it before the ceremony. Getting left at the altar ranks as one of the worst things that\u2019s happened to me, yet it also led to the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d She smiled. \u201cTruman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re so happy, Addie. I really am. Although, I gotta admit I never would\u2019ve put you and Truman together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no McKay bad boy, that\u2019s for sure. Then again, neither were you when we were together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that why you agreed to date me? Because I was the last supposedly wild McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was part of it. I wasn\u2019t the type guys panted over. Not like Rory.\u201d</p><p>Like Dalton needed the reminder that guys had lusted after Rory. She\u2019d been sort of sweetly clueless about it. Or hostile about it, depending on the day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was fun being the one who hooked the last McKay man. Might sound stupid, but people around here looked at me differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they look at you differently after I bailed?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNot with pity, if that\u2019s what you mean. More like the, we all should\u2019ve known he wouldn\u2019t follow through with it kind of looks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Jesus. I can\u2019t seem to say that enough.\u201d</p><p>Addie patted his arm. \u201cI\u2019m over it. I won\u2019t ever forget it, but the fact I\u2019m fine with you in my kitchen talking about it says a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I feel entitled to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>His stomach tightened, but he said, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on between you and Rory?\u201d</p><p>Should he toss off a breezy, I\u2019m trying to convince her that I\u2019m a great guy, a changed guy and she oughta spend the rest of her life with me? Nah. Addie would see it as him being flip, and he wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cWe\u2019re spending time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re in town visiting your father? Or are you back for good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a few factors that\u2019ll determine where I end up, so it\u2019s a day by day thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as long as you don\u2019t mind bein\u2019 the rebound guy.\u201d</p><p>Dalton frowned.</p> <p>\u201cYou knew she was engaged, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cRory\u2019s been hiding here since she broke it off with him. She won\u2019t talk about what happened, but I suspect she was pretty broken up about it since she hasn\u2019t dated at all.\u201d Addie pushed up from the table and offered him a sad smile. \u201cUntil you. But face it, Dalton, she knows you\u2019re not the settling-down type. Which is why this will be fun for both of you for the short term. Just don\u2019t expect too much from her.\u201d</p><p>Addie was wrong about him. She was wrong about Rory, too. Wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cI need to do a few things so why don\u2019t you head into the living room. Truman will be home soon. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got things to say to him too.\u201d</p><p>Dalton stood. \u201cI hope we can talk with our mouths instead of our fists this time.\u201d He wandered through the room, looking at pictures and knickknacks. Wondering why he didn\u2019t see a TV. He\u2019d bent down to check out the sheet music on the piano when the front door opened.</p><p>Truman stared at him for a second from the entryway before he removed his outerwear. Then he said, \u201cMcKay. Want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGotta check on my wife and then I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Emphasis on my wife. \u201cThe beer\u2019s in the den. Room at the end of the hallway. Can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>It was a guys\u2019 room\u2014no windows, no frilly curtains or throw pillows. Just a big-ass TV, and reclining furniture.</p><p>Truman arrived and reached into the bar fridge, handing Dalton a can of Coors Light. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d never been awkward between them. They\u2019d been friends since sixth grade. Since Truman\u2019s brother Thurman and Tell were best pals, they\u2019d pulled pranks on their older brothers. They\u2019d double dated. They\u2019d gone to strip clubs and concerts and rodeos together. They\u2019d gone fishing and hunting and talked about cars, girls, sex, guns and sex nonstop.</p><p>And right now, Dalton couldn\u2019t think of a damn thing to say. A younger version of him wouldn\u2019t have been comfortable with the silence. He would\u2019ve blurted out something inappropriate to break the ice. He sipped his beer and waited.</p><p>\u201cI heard about your dad. How\u2019s he doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper is Casper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThurman said that Tell wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long you here for?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m at the wait-and-see point for a lot of things.\u201d He took another drink. \u201cAddie looks good. Congrats on...everything.\u201d</p><p>Truman sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I probably shouldn\u2019t have beaten the crap outta you that day. But Jesus, Dalton. I had no idea what the fuck was wrong with you and why you\u2019d do that to Addie. Just walk away from her. Seein\u2019 her cry...I wanted to put the hurt on anyone who made her cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly put the hurt on me that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. You deserved it. At the time. Now I can\u2019t thank you enough for walking away. \u2019Cause Addie is it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that way about her when me\u2019n Addie were engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was jealous as hell. I knew you didn\u2019t appreciate what you had in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t deserve her. I think I knew that all along.\u201d</p><p>Truman smiled. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna argue with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as long as you ain\u2019t here to try and get back whatcha lost.\u201d</p><p>I am, but Addie isn\u2019t what I lost. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. So tell me what you\u2019ve been up to the last few years.\u201d</p><p>Dalton hit the high points and the low points, but he steered the conversation back to Truman. And he seemed eager to prove he could more than take care of Addie and they were blissfully happy.</p><p>They\u2019d just cracked open their second beer when the den door opened. Addie stood in the doorway, but Dalton barely spared her a glance. His focus was entirely on the blonde bombshell behind her.</p><p>\u201cRory is here so if you guys wanna come into the kitchen, we can eat.\u201d</p><p>Truman hopped up. \u201cI\u2019ll help you set the table.\u201d</p><p>The instant Addie and Truman were out of view Dalton yanked Rory into the room, pressed her against the wall and kissed the holy hell out of her. His hand wrapped in the golden silk of her hair. His mouth on hers, owning hers. When he ended the kiss, Rory\u2019s eyes were glazed with lust. Her mouth so full and ripe he had to kiss her again.</p><p>This time she twisted her head away. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you too, but will you please quit mauling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I knew you\u2019d be pissy if I didn\u2019t give you at least one of them bully-kisses when I first saw you. And for the rest of the night, I gotta act like this is casual between us.\u201d</p><p>Those green eyes blinked at him slowly. \u201cIt is casual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck it is. And the fuck I\u2019m your rebound guy from Dildo either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebound guy? That\u2019s what Addie said you were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He paused. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t deny it. She suddenly became very interested in the carpet.</p><p>His stomach roiled. \u201cRory?\u201d</p><p>Addie yelled, \u201cCome and get it!\u201d before Rory had a chance to respond.</p><p>During dinner Dalton had fun reminiscing with Truman and hearing some of the things Addie and Rory had done over the years.</p><p>They left after dessert\u2014the separate cars thing sucked, but Rory didn\u2019t balk when Dalton suggested he stop by her place for a little while.</p><p>Her dog Jingle met him at the gate. \u201cHey there. Remember me?\u201d</p><p>Jingle sniffed and licked. Then her tail started to wag. \u201cYou\u2019re a good guard dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks she\u2019s a guard dog but she\u2019s scared of squirrels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve all got fears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d</p><p>Especially me, especially when it comes to you.</p><p>Seemed more of a rhetorical question as Rory held the door open for him.</p><p>Dalton stole a kiss as he brushed past her. He took a look around her place as he shed his outerwear. Such a contrast between Rory\u2019s home and Addie\u2019s. Nothing matched in Rory\u2019s space. The furniture, the pictures hanging on the wall, even the objects decorating the room were colorful, funky and decidedly bohemian. He loved this place that was so perfectly Rory.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it, but I gotta drive home, so I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down. Take a load off.\u201d</p><p>He waited to see where she sat and then parked himself right next to her.</p><p>\u201cSo it seemed like you and Addie were all right,\u201d Rory said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for her and Truman too. He apologized for beating me, but swore he\u2019d do it again if I got it in my head to try and win Addie back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous. You\u2019d never do that. And Addie is madly in love with Truman, so she wouldn\u2019t throw him over for you anyway.\u201d She sighed. \u201cGuys. It\u2019s three things with you. My dick is bigger than yours, I make more money than you and I can beat the fuck outta you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d He stretched his arm across the back of the couch so he could toy with her hair. \u201cAdd in I can outdrink you, outdrive you and whip your ass at cards and that\u2019s the brain of a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot the \u2018and I can fuck any woman I see\u2019 too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. That falls into fantasy territory for most guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not for you, or any of the McKays,\u201d she retorted. \u201cAlls you gotta do is crook your little finger and women drop to their knees in front of you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton tugged her closer by her hair. \u201cAlls you gotta do is say the word, sugarplum, and I\u2019ll be on my knees before you.\u201d</p><p>That shocked her.</p><p>Good.</p><p>She squirmed away. \u201cSo was it weird? Seeing Addie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. But to be honest, when I saw her, I felt nothing except an almost giddy sense of relief.\u201d Instead of meeting Rory\u2019s eyes, he focused on a metal candleholder on the table across the room. \u201cI walked into that house and thought, this would\u2019ve been my life if I\u2019d married her. Sensible couches, floral curtains, shelves of knickknacks. An ordered life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I would\u2019ve suffocated. I\u2019m relieved she found a man like Truman who thrives on it.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s fingers touched his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t tell her that you dodged a bullet by not marrying her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have some tact,\u201d he said testily. \u201cA lot more than I used to have.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh yeah? Prove it.\u201d</p><p>He locked his gaze to hers. \u201cFor instance, I\u2019m imagining all the ways and all the places I want to put my mouth on you.\u201d</p><p>Heat flared in her eyes before she banked it. \u201cWhat does that have to do with tact?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping the explicit details to myself. Isn\u2019t that the definition of tact? Stating the truth in an inoffensive manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving tact means you shouldn\u2019t have said that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d He twined a hank of her hair around his finger and stared at her. \u201cGuess I don\u2019t have as much tact as I thought. Because I\u2019d like nothin\u2019 better than to strip off your jeans and spend an entire day with my face between your thighs. Maybe saying that makes me tacky, but I won\u2019t lie or pretend that I haven\u2019t been thinking about it nonstop.\u201d He changed the subject. \u201cHow\u2019s the special project goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo early to tell only two days into it. I\u2019m still setting up databases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like that part of the job?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of it whether or not I like it, so it\u2019s easier to suck it up and just do it rather than complain. I knew what I\u2019d signed on for when I went to work for a governmental entity. But if I\u2019d known my freshman year in college what I know now? I would\u2019ve chosen a different field of study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you choose Ag management?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had visions of saving the herds of wild horses. Creating sustainable wildlife habitats. Protecting species from extinction. But with the emphasis on Ag in my degree, I\u2019m dealing with an entirely different area. I should\u2019ve gone into wildlife biology with a minor in Ag management.\u201d She sighed. \u201cGetting a master\u2019s degree was a no brainer when UWYO offered to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>He continued to play with her hair. \u201cFrom the time we were kids I always thought you\u2019d be a crusader for a cause. But something more rebellious and outside the norm. Becoming a pirate to stop whaling and the clubbing of baby seals.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cLike fighting against man\u2019s need to conquer the animal kingdom by destroying habitats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou disappointed in my more practical choice of being a nine to five government lackey with health benefits and a dental plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life, jungle girl.\u201d Dalton leaned over and kissed her.</p><p>Rory shifted to sit on his lap; her hands cradled his head as she took control of the kiss. Sweetly seductive, a little hungry, a little fierce, completely captivating.</p><p>It took every bit of restraint to act passive when he had visions of kicking the coffee table over, pinning her to the carpet and fucking her until she came at least twice.</p><p>Her lips skated across his cheek with butterfly kisses that caused the left side of his body to tingle. \u201cShow me, with your hands,\u201d she whispered huskily. \u201cWhere you want to put your mouth on me.\u201d</p><p>Dalton pushed her shoulders back so he could touch her. He followed her jawbone from below her ear to the tip of her chin, then down the long line of her neck to the start of her cleavage. The V-neck sweater, the same earthy tone as her eyes, hugged her curves but also emphasized the flat plane of her belly. His finger traced the edge of the sweater, from collarbone to collarbone, stopping to linger at the midpoint.</p><p>Rory\u2019s breath hitched when his hands closed over her tits.</p><p>He bent his head and kissed the hollow of her throat. \u201cIn my version of playing show me, you\u2019re nekkid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoor baby. Work with what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can do.\u201d He slid his hands down. Palming her ribcage. He stroked the section of skin between her hipbones. The fact he was touching her over her clothes didn\u2019t seem to matter; Rory became really squirmy.</p><p>Instead of sliding his fingers between her thighs, he placed his hands on her lower back, letting his thumbs follow her spine up to her nape. \u201cI\u2019d spend a lot of time on this side. My lips learning every muscle and curve.\u201d He drew a line from the outside of her wrists to the cups of her shoulders.</p><p>Then his palms drifted down to her ass. He squeezed a butt cheek in each hand. \u201cDon\u2019t get me started on how long I\u2019d spend worshiping this ass. Bet these soft, sweet cheeks would love to feel the rasp of razor stubble against them.\u201d</p><p>She groaned and let her head fall back in surrender.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a pair of legs that goes on forever, so I\u2019d give them their proper due.\u201d Dalton watched her face as his hands slid up from her knees. Resting the heels of his hands on her inner thighs, his thumbs stroked her pussy. \u201cBut this spot right here? I\u2019d save for last. I\u2019d spread you wide and kiss every inch. Then I\u2019d let my tongue come out and play. Maybe my teeth.\u201d He knew he hit the right spot beneath the fly of her jeans when she gasped. He pressed his thumb in and rubbed side to side. \u201cI\u2019ve all sorts of plans for you, Aurora. But not until you give me the green light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...it\u2019s bright fucking green right now.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. He leaned forward and kissed her as he removed his hands from temptation. \u201cWe\u2019ll test that response another time, when my hands aren\u2019t on you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I want you, I\u2019m dyin\u2019 for you to be honest, but you\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>He brushed his thumb over her bottom lip. \u201cReady for me. For how I\u2019ll be when you\u2019re completely mine.\u201d</p><p>A strange look came into her eyes and vanished. \u201cDalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora.\u201d He kissed her and lightly tapped her ass. \u201cI need to git.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t budge, he rolled to his feet, his hands on her ass, lifting her with him.</p><p>Rory shrieked. \u201cWhat are you doing? I\u2019m too damn heavy for you to cart around like a log, McKay.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her protests and carried her to the front door. His lips moved to tease his favorite spot at the base of her throat before he set her down. As Dalton slipped on his jacket, he asked, \u201cWill I see you before Friday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious about crashing my girls\u2019 night out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. They can have you for a while. Then you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Rory traced the edge of his jaw. \u201cThere\u2019s some caveman showing, McKay.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI ignored my natural instinct to drag you into the bedroom by your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have resisted much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting very close to the limit of my control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She smooched his mouth. His dimples. The tip of his chin. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive safe. I\u2019ll text you or call you tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Halfway back to Sundance, Dalton saw a pickup parked on the shoulder with the hood up. He automatically pulled in behind it and got out.</p><p>The windows on the inside of the pickup were all fogged up. Maybe that\u2019s why the driver hadn\u2019t known Dalton had stopped to help. He rapped on the window.</p><p>A girl shrieked and a deeper voiced shushed her.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>The door opened. No interior light came on. \u201cYou okay in there? Havin\u2019 car trouble?\u201d</p><p>A lanky dark-haired teenage boy jumped out. \u201cYes, sir, the battery...\u201d The kid stopped speaking. \u201cDalton?\u201d</p><p>He peered at the kid\u2019s face. Blue eyes, dark hair, rugged, yet boyish looks. No doubt. This kid was the spitting image of his father. \u201cJesus. Kyler, is that you? All grown up and shit?\u201d</p><p>Kyler threw a look over his shoulder and slammed the pickup door. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>When his eyes narrowed, he looked so much like Cord that Dalton had to laugh. \u201cFancy running into you out here. What\u2019re you doin\u2019 at ten on a school night?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe Ky was old enough to drive.</p><p>\u201cI was takin\u2019 Jocelyn home and the battery, ah, just died.\u201d</p><p>Dalton lifted a brow. \u201cThe truck just crapped out in the middle of the road while you were driving it? \u2019Cause that sounds more serious than just a battery issue.\u201d He paused. \u201cIs your dad on his way to get you?\u201d</p><p>Pure panic spread across Ky\u2019s face and he shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t called him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. No bullshit. Why haven\u2019t you called him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I told him I was at Ryland\u2019s house studying and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were out here sucking face with Jocelyn instead? And you got so involved with sucking face that you forgot you\u2019d what? Turned the radio on for a little mood music and drained the battery?\u201d</p><p>Kyler hung his head. \u201cYeah. Dumb, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Dalton had done the same thing once and still remembered the nasty shit Casper had said to him for months afterward. He doubted Cord would do that to his son, but Dalton wanted to save the kid from punishment and embarrassment. \u201cWhat did you plan to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for Ryland to call me back. He was looking for his dad\u2019s jumper cables so he could drive out here and give me a jump. If that didn\u2019t happen, then I was gonna call my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be more pissed that you lied than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I never do this, I swear.\u201d He looked over his shoulder again. \u201cBut it\u2019s Jocelyn Mears,\u201d he said her name reverently. \u201cShe\u2019s like the hottest girl in the senior class and when she said we oughta do something tonight...dude. It\u2019s my chance with her so I had to take it.\u201d</p><p>Dalton sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna call my dad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Kyler\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a jump and send you on your merry way, but there are a couple of conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName \u2019em. I swear I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, no more lyin\u2019 to your folks about this kind of stuff. You wanna spend time with a girl, talk to your dad and tell him it\u2019s important. Tell him it\u2019s Jocelyn Mears. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll understand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kyler looked as if he didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cSecond, I could use a gopher on the house I\u2019m fixing up. I\u2019d expect you to help me out after school, let\u2019s say once a week.\u201d</p><p>He nodded vigorously. \u201cSure, no problem. I can do that.\u201d</p> <p>The driver\u2019s side door opened and a girl jumped out. \u201cKy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Jocelyn was a very pretty girl\u2014dark hair, dark eyes, a dark hickey on the side of her neck.</p><p>Kyler said, \u201cThis is my cousin Dalton. He\u2019s gonna give us a jump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d She rubbed her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold in there.\u201d</p><p>Kyler immediately took off his jacket. \u201cHere. This\u2019ll keep you warm.\u201d</p> <p>Smooth, kid, real smooth.</p><p>Jocelyn offered Kyler a dazzling smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d Then she crawled back in the cab.</p><p>Yeah. Dalton had been thrown for a loop by a smile like that a time or ten in his life. Poor Kyler hadn\u2019t stood a chance.</p><p>He clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get that beast running so your girlfriend doesn\u2019t freeze and your dad doesn\u2019t send your Uncle Cam out lookin\u2019 for ya.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Friday night in the Golden Boot with Rory wasn\u2019t going as well as Dalton had hoped.</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sitting here alone together for ten minutes and no one has wandered up to chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean to ask us questions that ain\u2019t none of their business?\u201d Dalton countered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sundance, Dalton. You gotta expect we\u2019re being gawked at and gossiped about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can leave and go someplace else if you\u2019d rather.\u201d</p><p>Rory shook her head.</p><p>The stiff way she held herself and the way her eyes darted around the room gave him the impression she didn\u2019t want to be here at all.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to chase your friends off.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cYes you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas it that obvious I wanted you all to myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to me. And it was sort of pissing me off, the way Vanessa drooled over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrooled,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are looking particularly drool-worthy tonight, McKay. Nothing sexier than a cowboy in a crisp white shirt, a black hat and a pair of Cinch jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much had you been drinkin\u2019 before I got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly enough after the week I had at work.\u201d She drained her drink.</p><p>\u201cSpecial project turning out to be not so special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrustrating. It\u2019d be easier if all the paperwork came directly to me, but of course it\u2019s gotta be officially stamped in Cheyenne and then forwarded to me so I can log it in which is a gigantic pain in my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what you and your friends discuss on Friday nights? Your crappy work week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re usually trolling for...\u201d Her mouth snapped shut. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Dalton swigged his beer, trying really hard not to scour the bar and check out his competition.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been doing the last couple days?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI worked on the house. They delivered the furniture on Thursday. Planned to do a couple other things but the week got away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how that goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Ordering bar food is a habit since I\u2019ve worked in so many bars over the years.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThere goes my chance to wine and dine you on our date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect that from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you deserve it. And I want to give it to you. How about if we dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He slid out of the booth and took her hand.</p><p>She led them to the middle of the dance floor. \u201cNone of that fancy two-stepping stuff or western swing you cowboys are fond of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll just sway together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a little while. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery okay.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak through three songs, just moved together in near perfect synch. Their physical closeness and the lack of conversation attuned his senses just to her. The gradual softening of her body against his. The increased tempo of her heart. The quicker intake of her breath.</p><p>He brushed his lips over her ear. \u201cI like havin\u2019 you in my arms. Have I mentioned I love that you\u2019re tall?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do. We\u2019re a perfect fit. In every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re really thinking,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 the scent of you so close to me is driving me insane.\u201d Dalton ran his nose along her neck. \u201cSweet and musky. And goddamn do I want the scent of you all over me.\u201d He wondered if she\u2019d stiffen after that confession, but she melted into him.</p><p>\u201cDalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody calls me that but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call you that all the time, if you\u2019d prefer.\u201d</p><p>The soft warmth of her breath on his neck sent a tingle down the right side of his body. \u201cI like that you call me that when we\u2019re alone and you\u2019re being romantic.\u201d</p><p>Although the band picked up the pace with a faster song, they continued dancing slow.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cWill you come home with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>Rory tensed but didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>So he continued dancing with her, like it wasn\u2019t killing him to have her curvy body plastered to his. His cock behaved as long as he didn\u2019t bury his face in her sweet smelling hair, or fill his lungs with the addicting scent of her skin.</p><p>When the song ended, he released her hand and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m ready for a drink, how about you?\u201d</p><p>Rory blinked those beautiful green eyes, confused he wasn\u2019t pressing her on tonight\u2019s sleeping arrangements. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Dalton led her off the dance floor to their booth. He slid across from her rather than next to her.</p><p>Since it wasn\u2019t busy, Cindy, the waitress who\u2019d worked there since Dalton could remember, stopped by immediately. \u201cAnother round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll switch to Coors Light. Rory, you want another whiskey sour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tell Lettie to make a tall half 7UP, half sour mix with a splash of orange juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done drinking for tonight?\u201d</p><p>Rory lifted a shoulder. \u201cWasn\u2019t feeling it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I need a clear head before I decide whether or not to go home with you.\u201d She closed her eyes briefly and inhaled a deep breath. \u201cBetween you and the booze...\u201d</p><p>He fought a frown. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing close to you packs a powerful punch, Dalton. The way you move, the way your deep voice seems to burrow into me and sets off these little electric charges under my skin.\u201d</p><p>Now Dalton fought a huge-ass grin. \u201cI\u2019m liking the direction this is goin\u2019, sugarplum.\u201d</p><p>She slapped her hand on the table, startling him. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sexy way you tease me. Sometimes it\u2019s blatant; sometimes it\u2019s sweet. You keep me off balance.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand, bringing it up to kiss her knuckles. \u201cWhat would tip you the right way into spending the night in my bed?\u201d</p><p>Rory laughed. \u201cSee? There it is again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet I\u2019m not hearing an answer from you.\u201d He kissed the inside of her wrist and lightly nipped the base of her thumb. \u201cYou really haven\u2019t made up your mind yet? After the time we\u2019ve spent together?\u201d He placed a kiss in the center of her palm. \u201cOr maybe I should point out all the time we\u2019ve spent apart. You haven\u2019t imagined how it would be between us now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d she said a little too quickly, which seemed to annoy her.</p><p>Cindy dropped off their drinks. \u201cSorry to bug you, Dalton, but there\u2019s a woman at the bar who says she knows you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she a relative of mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s a blonde with big...\u201d She paused and amended, \u201cShe\u2019s blonde.\u201d</p><p>Dalton never looked away from Rory. \u201cWhat\u2019s she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo buy you a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Rory let go of his hand to pick up her drink. \u201cAren\u2019t you the least bit curious about who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even to look over there and see if you recognize her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Now that\u2019s settled, can I please have your hand back?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have two hands. I\u2019d like to hold one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like touching you, Rory. Even if it\u2019s just holding hands.\u201d</p><p>Rory exhaled a put-upon sigh that was totally bogus before she slid her arm across the table. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen happy since the moment this date started.\u201d Dalton threaded their fingers together. \u201cHow\u2019s your virgin drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I noticed you haven\u2019t touched your beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorta sorry I ordered it, if you wanna know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll share mine.\u201d She nudged it to the center of the table.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He slid the straw between his lips and sucked. \u201cNot bad. So what\u2019s your favorite drink to make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartinis. There are so many variations with all the different flavors of vodka. There\u2019s this bar in Ft. Collins that has one hundred and seventy-five flavors of infused vodka. I had an amazing Skittles martini with such cool presentation\u2014a rainbow-colored sugared rim, a swizzle stick speared with candy and bright blue liquid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it taste?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike candy. I could\u2019ve gotten totally shitfaced on them.\u201d</p><p>Dalton grinned. \u201cI felt the same way the first time I tried expensive scotch. I wanted to steal the whole damn bottle and drink it down. But I figured it wouldn\u2019t taste so good coming back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you had to deal with that issue with me that night in Laramie.\u201d</p><p>He stroked the back of her hand with his thumb. \u201cOver and done with. Goin\u2019 forward, not back, remember?\u201d</p> <p>Rory brought their joined hands to her face and rubbed his wrist against her cheek. Then she dragged an openmouthed kiss up his forearm. \u201cFunny you should mention wanting to hold my hand. Seems I have a thing for your hands too. So big. So strong. I\u2019d like to feel these rough-skinned hands all over me.\u201d</p><p>Outwardly he went still. Inwardly he was so revved up he had to speak slowly so his voice didn\u2019t waver. \u201cWhat are you sayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019ll spend the night with you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton immediately dug out his wallet and threw a twenty on the table. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t even touched your beer.\u201d</p> <p>He wrapped his hand around the back of her neck and brought her close enough to kiss. \u201cI\u2019d rather be touching you. We\u2019re leavin\u2019. Now.\u201d</p><p>Somehow he managed a leisurely pace out of the bar when his legs wanted to sprint.</p><p>He stopped beside his truck.</p><p>\u201cDalton. Wait.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the sinking feeling in his gut and faced her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met here, remember?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d forgotten that. \u201cDo you want to leave your car here or drive it to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive it. I\u2019ll follow you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton crowded her against the door. With his hands curled around her face, he could stroke her stubborn jawline. \u201cI want you. I\u2019ve wanted you for years, especially after the number of ways I\u2019ve always fucked things up over the years...\u201d He inhaled a silent breath as his eyes searched hers. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 home. You know where I live. Show up or don\u2019t. But I ain\u2019t gonna pressure you.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s hands inched up his chest. \u201cWanna know a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d intended to decline the invite into your bed.\u201d</p><p>That sucked. \u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor once your actions spoke louder than words.\u201d</p> <p>He waited. It fucking killed him, but he waited for her explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhen that mystery blonde wanted your attention, you didn\u2019t give it to her. Your eyes never wandered that direction. Not even one time. You didn\u2019t make a charming excuse about needing to use the bathroom just so you could see who the heck she was. The Dalton I used to know? He would\u2019ve drained his beer within two minutes and said, \u2018Hang tight a minute, sweet thang, I need another beer. I\u2019ll go up and get it.\u2019 Then you would\u2019ve left.\u201d</p><p>His face flushed. \u201cDo you know how much I hate that I used to be that guy?\u201d</p><p>Rory mimicked his pose, placing her hands on his cheeks. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t that guy. You stayed one hundred percent focused on me. Like I was the only thing that mattered to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the only person that matters to me,\u201d he corrected softly. Then he kissed her\u2014going beyond the lazy seductive kisses, straight to the I-wanna-fuck-you-right-here-right-now passion that\u2019d been waiting to erupt.</p><p>She clung to him, returning the passion without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI gotta stop while I still can,\u201d he murmured against her lips after he found the strength to stop devouring her mouth. Dalton eased back to look at her. Eyes glazed with passion. Mouth damp from his. Breathing choppy. She seemed a little out of it. \u201cRory, you okay to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll walk you to your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton. This is Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care. Bad shit can happen here too.\u201d He pushed away from her and reached for her hand. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>Rory took a couple of steps and stopped. She looked at him with a hint of frustration. \u201cThat kiss flustered me to the point I don\u2019t remember where the hell I parked, McKay.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd no, that comment doesn\u2019t entitle you to a cocky little smirk.\u201d</p><p>No, but he\u2019d definitely give her one when she was writhing beneath him later.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know what that gleam in your eyes is about either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably best.\u201d</p><p>Dalton beat her to his house\u2014but not by much. Not by enough so he had time to do what he needed.</p><p>As soon as she entered the house, he kissed her. Then he towed her to the dining room. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on this, so can you give me some time? Say ten minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to do what? Wax your balls?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI spent my monthly manscaping allotment on getting my back waxed. So, sorry, you\u2019ll have to put up with my hairy balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d hear you say.\u201d She touched his face. She did that a lot, which he hoped meant she liked his face.</p><p>He pecked her on the lips. \u201cYou want something to drink? Soda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pour myself a soda while you\u2019re...jacking off so you last longer or whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>The flip, semi-mean comment meant Rory was nervous.</p><p>That made two of them.</p><p>Dalton really hoped she wouldn\u2019t laugh when she saw what he\u2019d worked up. He headed to the bedroom and shut the door behind him.</p><p>He finished in eight minutes and allowed himself a minute to breathe. He kicked off his boots, ditched his socks and whipped off his shirt.</p><p>Rory stood in front of the living room window. Those rhinestone-encrusted jeans immediately drew his gaze to her ass. He couldn\u2019t wait to have it in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize that growling sound you just made isn\u2019t helping ease my state of mind?\u201d</p><p>Dalton glanced up to see her looking over her shoulder at him. He moved toward her. \u201cWhere\u2019s your mind right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocused on what\u2019s behind door number one.\u201d</p><p>He set his hands on her shoulders. \u201cSo come take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost left,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>His hands gripped her shoulders as if that\u2019d keep her from fleeing. \u201cWhy would you have left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is weird. I thought you\u2019d meet me at the door, blow my mind with another kiss. Then clothes would fly, we\u2019d go at it right on your couch in a fit of passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been like that between us before. I didn\u2019t want that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want what? Passion?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the section of skin below her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re testy, sugarplum. If you\u2019ve changed your mind, say so.\u201d</p><p>Rory whirled around to face him. \u201cWhy did you need time to prepare? I wondered if you were just sitting in there, seeing how long it\u2019d take me to bust in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I said no games, Rory, I meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dalton got right in her face. \u201cStop. Talkin\u2019.\u201d He shook his head when she opened her mouth to protest. He kissed her forehead. \u201cTrust me. Now close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she complied he pressed a gentle kiss on each eyelid.</p><p>Then he caught her peeking as he kissed her mouth. The little sneak. So he spun her, herding her back toward the bedroom, putting an end to her peeking.</p><p>Once they were through the doorway, he said, \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>She spun so fast she almost lost her balance.</p><p>Dalton stayed behind her and let her look her fill.</p><p>He\u2019d transformed his plain bedroom into a romantic space. Clean white cotton sheets on the bed. A dozen red candles scattered about, filling the room with a subtle scent and a soft light. He\u2019d draped a bronze neckerchief over the bedside lamp, creating a golden glow.</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Did she think it was tacky? Too bachelor pad? Too over the top? Was she holding back her laughter? That would be the worst\u2014hearing her make fun of his attempt to recreate a first time for them.</p><p>\u201cRory?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wrapped her arms around herself. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His first response was to answer, how would I know why you\u2019re quiet? But as he took a second to find the right words, she blurted, \u201cWhy did you go to all this trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make up for the fact I took your virginity in the front seat of my pickup with little care and thought besides getting myself off.\u201d He ran his fingers down her hair. \u201cThis is how it should\u2019ve been for you. I tried to make this special tonight in a way I was too stupid to do the first time. Or the other times.\u201d</p><p>Rory turned and twined herself around him. \u201cYou are such an idiot, Dalton McKay. You didn\u2019t have to do this. I was a sure thing tonight.\u201d</p><p>Dalton trapped her face in his hands, forcing her to look at him. \u201cThe only sure thing is that I\u2019ve screwed it up every single time I\u2019ve been nekkid\u2014or partially nekkid\u2014with you. Hell, that first time I don\u2019t think I even took my jeans off all the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. I had the imprint from your belt buckle on my left calf from where you\u2019d pressed my leg into the back of the seat.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and rested his forehead to hers, not even sure what to say.</p><p>\u201cSo are we gonna stand here all night? Or are you gonna give me a peek at your hairy balls on that big bed as we\u2019re surrounded by candlelight?\u201d</p><p>Was it any wonder he was so crazy about this woman? \u201cMaybe later. Right now, I want you to let me undress you.\u201d</p><p>Rory retreated to squint at him. \u201cWhat do you mean let you undress me? Why don\u2019t we just rip our clothes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that, right there, is what I meant.\u201d He drew a line from the tip of her chin to the start of her cleavage. \u201cMy pace tonight, jungle girl. And I\u2019ll warn you upfront. That pace is gonna be slow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She seemed torn for a minute before she smirked. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll see how long you\u2019ll keep that slow mindset, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live for a challenge.\u201d Dalton jerked her against his body and kissed her.</p><p>Her mouth opened fully but he denied her the immediate tangling of tongues in a hot soul kiss. Not for any reason besides he intended to take his time with her tonight\u2014even kissing her. He rubbed his lips against hers as their breath mingled. He tracked the soft inside of her upper and lower lip with the inner rim of his, trying to memorize the shape of her mouth.</p> <p>The strands of her hair slipped through his fingers like silk. He wanted to feel her hair trailing over every inch of his body. His cock pulsed behind his zipper, totally onboard with the idea.</p><p>Rory\u2019s head fell back when he moved his lips to plant soft kisses down her throat. He paused briefly at the base to feel the rapid beat of her pulse.</p><p>When his mouth connected with the fabric of her shirt, it needed to go. Dalton released her hair, smoothing his hands up her sides and over the curve of her breasts, to the top of her blouse. Snap buttons, thank god. After he popped the first one, he placed a kiss on each new bit of exposed flesh as he undressed her. He pushed the shirt down her arms, letting it flutter to the floor.</p><p>She wore a girlie yellow bra covered in pink and turquoise polka dots. Lace edged the cups, highlighting her cleavage.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d he murmured, bending down to run his tongue along the lace.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like it if you\u2019d tear it off. Preferably with your teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Dalton dipped his tongue inside the cup.</p><p>Rory tried to pull him closer, her hands gripping his hair, mashing his face into her almost bare chest.</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cHuh-uh. Hands by your sides.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pace,\u201d he reminded her, pulling her arms down. \u201cAnd believe it or not, I can go slower.\u201d</p><p>Dalton captured her snappish response with his mouth and set his hands on her waist. For being so tall, there wasn\u2019t a bulky thing about her. Rory\u2019s torso was long and lean, flaring into curvy hips and thighs. His fingertips traced the skin above the waistband of her low-cut jeans.</p><p>She kissed him harder, her eagerness obvious.</p><p>He unhooked the button on her jeans and lowered the zipper. He moved his mouth to her ear. \u201cLose the jeans, Aurora.\u201d</p><p>A delicate shiver rolled through her and she shimmied the denim down her legs.</p><p>\u201cI can get it from here.\u201d Dropping to his knees, he kissed her belly as his fingers tugged the denim to her feet.</p><p>She kicked them away impatiently.</p> <p>Dalton stroked the outside of her legs from her anklebone to the lacy edge of her panties. He tipped his head back to look at her. \u201cDamn, woman, you\u2019ve got a set of legs on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of why I\u2019m so tall,\u201d she deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed.\u201d</p><p>He saw the wheels spinning, taking in the inequality situation. Him in jeans, her in a bra and panties.</p><p>But whatever had caused that frown line disappeared. She grinned and threw herself back on the bed. Then she spread her legs and crooked her finger at him. \u201cCome and get me, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Rory could get used to seeing that lustful glimmer in Dalton\u2019s eyes.</p><p>But she\u2019d really, really like to get his pants off.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust soaking in the moment. Convincing myself that you\u2019re really here and this isn\u2019t another damn dream.\u201d</p><p>Would he be soft and sweet and loving tonight? Instead of showing that dangerous edge she\u2019d seen in him?</p><p>Then he crawled across the mattress toward her\u2014all sinuous movement and animal hunger. Definitely dangerous.</p><p>Rory reached for the button on his jeans only to have him circle her wrists and pin her arms above her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you realize how serious I am about taking this slow,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you realize how serious I am about us getting naked first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna counter everything I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to compromise on the pace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Dalton lowered into a pushup position and slowly rolled his hips. The jean material rubbed the inside of her thighs as he dragged the hard bulge beneath his zipper across the rise of her mound. Over and over. With perfect precision.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d released her wrists until she arched up, wanting skin-on-skin contact.</p><p>He placed a kiss on the top of each breast. As his mouth followed the edge of her bra, Rory clamped her legs around his hips and propelled her body forward, forcing him to roll to his knees.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Neat trick.\u201d Dalton grabbed her ass and hoisted her more securely onto his lap. \u201cAll right. Since it\u2019s obvious you ain\u2019t gonna do it entirely my way, lose the bra so I can put my mouth on you.\u201d</p><p>Rory ditched her bra in two seconds flat.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on my shoulders and press your tits together so I can get to both those sweet nipples.\u201d</p><p>The instant she moved, his lips encircled one rigid tip. He suckled forcefully, then softly, switching back and forth between her nipples. He tortured her with his sinfully talented mouth. Scoring her delicate skin with his teeth. Rubbing his cheek and his chin across the tips of her breasts, nuzzling and then returning to tiny licks.</p><p>Dalton sucked and tongued her nipples until they were wet and tight. His hot, ragged breath on her damp skin had her vibrating from head to toe. Wanting more. Wanting everything.</p><p>He nibbled on her throat as his hands slid up to the middle of her back. He slowly angled forward, returning her to the mattress with him on top.</p><p>A subtle scent of apples and cinnamon wafted over them as the heater kicked on, stirring the candle-scented air. Rory turned her head until her face connected with his warm neck. She breathed him in, needing something familiar in this unfamiliar situation in which she had no control.</p><p>Dalton was in charge. And he intended to prove it.</p><p>His lips traveled from her temple down to the edge of her jaw and to the tip of her chin. Nipping kisses followed the arch of her throat back to her breasts.</p><p>This time he ignored her nipples.</p><p>His soft mouth on just the outside curve of her breast drove her out of her mind. The butterfly light touches of his fingertips were beyond a fleeting tease, but a sensual stroke that electrified her as if he\u2019d run his fingers across the nerve endings on the inside of her body.</p><p>Energy crackled between them. He didn\u2019t tell her how beautiful she was. Or how much he wanted her. His hands on her and his mouth on her conveyed far more heat and need than any words ever could. Dalton\u2019s silence was more arousing than a play by play.</p><p>Finally those deft fingers slipped beneath the lace waistband of her panties and he tugged them off. When she grabbed his forearm, he brought that arm above her head and commanded, \u201cLeave. It. There.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words were cut off by the brutal possession of his mouth.</p><p>Dalton curled his big hand over her mound. His middle finger stroked the outer rim of flesh beside her clitoris. Almost touching it, but not quite. Teasing it until she swore her clit swelled just to reach that stroking finger. Then he\u2019d sweep his finger across that hot spot a few times and return to teasing.</p><p>\u201cDalton. Please.\u201d</p><p>Maybe please was the magic word because he pushed back and shucked his jeans. Then his boxers. Picking up the new box of condoms on the dresser, he opened it, pulling out a strip of six. Ripping off one, he tossed the rest on the dresser, tore open the packet and suited up. His palms slid up her legs, over hipbones, ribcage and breasts.</p><p>Her breath caught at the sexy, slinky way he\u2019d covered her body, letting the heat and the roughness of his skin skim hers.</p><p>Planting his hands by her head, he stared into her eyes.</p><p>So fiercely male. Yet in the glow of the flickering candles, so utterly sensual.</p><p>Rory reached between them and circled her hand around his cock. She rubbed the head through the slickness at her opening. \u201cYou make me wet. Your hands on me and the way you kiss me gets me so hot and ready\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora. Stop.\u201d</p><p>Gave her the good kind of chills when he said her name in that deep raspy murmur.</p><p>He kissed the slope of her shoulder. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d get the chance to be with you like this again.\u201d He continued to drag openmouthed kisses across the same section of skin. The eroticism of it had her head spinning. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to take it slow. Savor it. Savor every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>In the past she would\u2019ve discounted his flattery. But cocky Dalton McKay almost sounded...humbled. Since she didn\u2019t know what to say, she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Dalton pushed up and moved, gently rolling her onto her stomach. He kissed her spine above the dimples of her ass. \u201cI found your tattoo.\u201d He dragged his lips across it. \u201cA rose. I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><p>His heated breath and soft lips sent chills dancing across her body.</p><p>\u201cI want you like this.\u201d His muscular body covered hers. His hard chest on her back, his hips digging into her ass, his legs outside of hers. His mouth\u2014that warm, hungry mouth\u2014worked the back of her neck until she writhed beneath him.</p><p>He threaded his fingers through hers and slipped their joined hands between her thighs. \u201cTouch yourself, baby.\u201d</p><p>Rory blushed. She\u2019d never masturbated in front of anyone.</p><p>Sensing her tension, he angled his hand to stroke her slit. \u201cCan you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll...try.\u201d</p><p>Rough-skinned hands landed on her shoulders and slid down her back to her waist. Then he hiked her hips up and spread her knees apart with his. \u201cI don\u2019t see your hand moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I...I\u2019ve never...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have some fun getting you over that bit of shyness.\u201d His fingers followed the cleft of her butt down to where her fingers rested. \u201cWet, but not wet enough. Push up onto all fours.\u201d Dalton scooted back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The next thing she knew, his head was between her legs and his mouth was on her pussy. \u201cOmigod.\u201d</p><p>He licked and ate at her until she became slick and shaky. Then he moved back over her and his voice was in her ear. \u201cNext time I put my mouth on your pussy I\u2019m gonna be there a while.\u201d He gently pushed her shoulders to the mattress. His fingers gripped her hips and he slowly fed his cock into her.</p><p>Dalton stayed buried in her for several long breaths. Building the anticipation, making Rory wetter, hotter, crazy to have his hard flesh pounding into her.</p><p>She could feel his body shaking. Feel the burning heat where they were joined. Hear the breath sawing in and out of his lungs at the same ragged tempo as her own.</p><p>What was he waiting for?</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself,\u201d he demanded gruffly.</p><p>Oh. That\u2019s what he was waiting for.</p><p>Rory shifted her balance, slipping her right hand beneath her. She followed her slit from the top down her swollen folds to where Dalton\u2019s cock filled her. She traced around his girth, teasing the small strip of his shaft that wasn\u2019t stuffed inside her.</p><p>He hissed in a breath.</p><p>Then she fondled his balls. They weren\u2019t drawn up tight, but hung low.</p><p>Dalton didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t start fucking her like a madman. He waited for her to touch herself. And she knew he wouldn\u2019t move until she did what he asked.</p><p>The instant her finger swirled around her clit he pulled out oh-so-slowly. A brief pause and then all that thick hardness glided back in to the hilt.</p><p>She fingered her clit in the way that would get her off quickly. No reason to drag it out. She expected that Dalton would pick up the pace once her body was stretched and ready. So the sooner she came the sooner she\u2019d get that body-pounding fury. But he didn\u2019t waver in the slow and steady. Slow and steady.</p><p>And she sort of wanted to scream at him to hurry the fuck up.</p><p>Then he rammed in deep and stayed there. He leaned across her body and whispered, \u201cProblem?\u201d directly in her ear.</p><p>God. That voice. The heat and weight of his body. The scent of his skin. The man could screw up her senses just by existing.</p><p>\u201cAurora?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you going so slow?\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled the side of her neck. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 hot watching my cock driving in and out of you. Seeing it covered in your sweet juices, knowing what I\u2019m doin\u2019 to you is makin\u2019 you hot. Makin\u2019 you wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s you and me together like this? Baby, you come first. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I make myself come?\u201d</p> <p>His mouth brushed her ear. \u201cThen I\u2019ll fuck you like a goddamned jackhammer until you come again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so bossy. Lucky for you I like this sexual beast side of you.\u201d</p><p>His growl reverberated from her ear straight to her clit.</p><p>\u201cStay like this. With your body on mine and your mouth doing\u2014\u201d she wailed when his teeth nipped the arc of her shoulder, \u201c\u2014that. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself.\u201d</p><p>With her body caged beneath his, impaled by his, her pleasure points throbbed from the wicked things that mouth of his was doing and the rapid stroking of her finger on her clit. Didn\u2019t take much for Rory to come. She gasped as the pulses started, scrambling her brain, leaving her breathless.</p><p>Then Dalton was making good on his promise to fuck her with hard, grinding thrusts. His hips hammering. His cock relentless. A hot steel rod as he drove them both to the edge of oblivion.</p><p>He grunted and his body tightened above hers.</p><p>Rory felt his cock jerking inside her. She bore down on it, milking him so strongly that another orgasm rolled through her.</p><p>Dalton stopped moving. He pressed a lingering kiss to the back of her head. Then he pulled out before he turned her over.</p><p>Their eyes met. He said, \u201cFuck, woman, you own me,\u201d and kissed her. And kept kissing her. And touching her.</p><p>Lost in the sensual haze, Rory buried her face in his neck and sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou tired?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. You wore me out.\u201d</p><p>He seemed content with that. He continued to mess with her hair. Brushing it from her face. Running his fingers through the long strands. Wrapping it around his palm. While his mouth teased her skin and the heat from his body warmed her.</p><p>\u201cEvery part of you is so perfect.\u201d He nuzzled the back of her head. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI can\u2019t get enough of you. And jungle girl, I need to know if that\u2019s gonna be a problem for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve started this\u2014\u201d his warm breath floated across her nape,\u201c\u2014there\u2019s no goin\u2019 back. I won\u2019t be able to keep my hands off you, now that you\u2019re finally mine.\u201d</p><p>Mine? \u201cDalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie. I was obsessed with you before this. And now...\u201d He placed a soft kiss below her ear. \u201cI want you again. And again. And again. Maybe you should rest while you can.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. But part of her knew Dalton wasn\u2019t joking.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Dalton awoke to feel Rory\u2019s instep sliding up and down the inside of his calf. Her skin was so smooth. His was so rough. She must\u2019ve liked the sensation because she kept doing it.</p><p>No sunshine peeked through the blinds. The world beyond this bed would be cold and bleak. Filled with that colorless wintery gray light.</p><p>But in here...he had the warmth of Rory\u2019s body against his. He saw the creamy color of her flesh against the white sheets. Her silken hair teased his skin. Her scent both stirred and soothed him.</p><p>Yes, in this bed, he had everything he\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>So he\u2019d be happy to lie here with her all day.</p><p>Rory raised her arm above her head and arched her body into a long stretch. \u201cI like this snuggly side of you, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. It\u2019s unexpected.\u201d Her fingernails dug into the back of his neck. \u201cBut I really liked the fuck-me-until-I-screamed side of you too.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled her backside into his groin. \u201cIs that for me, or just morning wood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. A challenge. Let\u2019s see if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d Rory rolled her hips and ground her ass into his cock. All the while running her foot up and down his leg and keeping her hand on the back of his neck.</p><p>Goddamn she was sexy as fuck first thing in the morning.</p><p>\u201cAurora,\u201d he murmured beside her ear. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna start this day out with a bang, you\u2019d better stop givin\u2019 me a horizontal lap dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLap dance?\u201d She let loose an evil little chuckle. \u201cAnother time. But I do want you to bang me like a drum, McKay. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBend forward for a sec.\u201d</p><p>Dalton reached behind him until his fingers connected with the strip of condoms on the nightstand. He tore one off and managed to roll it on with one hand.</p><p>She started to back into him.</p><p>He stilled her movement. His mouth connected with the sweep of her neck. \u201cI fucking love your nails digging into me. Stay like that and grab the headboard with your other hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your way of warning me to hold on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my way of telling you to do what I ask.\u201d He slipped his left arm under her as she reached up.</p><p>Spooned against him, with both her arms above her head, Rory was completely accessible to whatever he wanted to do to her. He ran the tips of his fingers from the inside of her elbow down to the outside of her knee.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>He kept the caresses lazy, but thorough. He loved the softness of her body and how, as he heated her up, that supple skin released its own sweet musk. On the next pass he tasted the long line of her neck from behind her ear to the ball of her shoulder.</p><p>Rory angled her head, giving him complete access.</p><p>That tiny sign of surrender made him growl with pure male satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting so patient and then you make that noise...\u201d She shivered. \u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Dalton cupped her breast with his other hand and gently rolled her nipple the same time his mouth found her ear. His lips followed the outline to the lobe where his teeth took over.</p><p>\u201cHow can you do so many things at once?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u201cFeels like you have two sets of hands on me... Oh, yeah, I like that.\u201d</p><p>He blew in her ear again. The next pass he pinched her nipple hard the same time he sucked on her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cDalton!\u201d</p><p>Not a protest. More like a plea.</p><p>\u201cHow hard would you come if I pinched your clit like that?\u201d</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never tried it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d was all he said as he returned his focus back to her. Completely on her. Stroking her belly. Her collarbones. The impressive valley of her cleavage.</p><p>Rory writhed with every caress.</p><p>By the time Dalton finally slid his hand down her belly to toy with her clit, she was panting. Thrashing. Begging.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I have been touchin\u2019 you. That\u2019s what I want you to understand.\u201d He nuzzled her cheek. \u201cIt won\u2019t ever just be insert dick into hole between you and me. I\u2019ve waited too goddamned long for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d think you\u2019d be more eager to fuck me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI have more patience than you know. Goading me won\u2019t test it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will test it?\u201d Rory turned her head and pressed her mouth to his jaw, running her tongue across the stubble. \u201cYour cock in my mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugarplum, I\u2019m so lookin\u2019 forward to you takin\u2019 that test.\u201d He snared her mouth in a brutal kiss even as his hands remained gentle.</p><p>Then he lifted her leg up and over his, prodding her pussy with the head of his cock. But he didn\u2019t push it in. His middle finger dipped into the wetness and he stroked her clit. He broke the kiss to say, \u201cCome for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGotta do that faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Like this.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s nails bit into the back of his neck. \u201cFaster. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet it pull you in.\u201d His mouth drifted from one spot on her body to the next. \u201cDon\u2019t force it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to force it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus on how good it feels. How wet you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me wet. Never feels this good when I touch myself.\u201d</p><p>Dalton started pinching the fleshy folds of skin surrounding her clit. Then he\u2019d rub. Grind his finger down and return to that subtle rubbing. The next pinch was a little more forceful. Lasted a little longer.</p> <p>Rory moaned louder, bumping her pelvis into his hand. She turned her head until their lips met in an openmouthed kiss.</p><p>He rubbed the slippery skin together. Then in the moment when her body went rigid, he pinched her clit hard.</p><p>She started coming immediately. He had to break the kiss and watch her because she was so fucking hot when she came.</p><p>Stroking that pouting piece of flesh in time to the pulses caused her to shudder. He continued to slide his thumb back and forth to keep her primed.</p><p>Then Dalton impaled her with one deep stroke.</p><p>Rory\u2019s cunt clamped down on his shaft, threatening to pull him under and turn him into a two-pump chump. But he held on, held off, not pushing in fully on every snap of his hips.</p> <p>\u201cDalton,\u201d she panted against his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back with me. I came first.\u201d She rubbed her lips in the morning stubble on his cheeks. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her leg higher and pounded into her wet heat. Over and over until that moment when he needed more. That extra something...</p><p>Rory\u2019s fingers dug into his neck as she pulled his head down. She whispered, \u201cNow come for me,\u201d in his ear and tightened her pussy around his shaft.</p><p>That was it. Dalton came so fucking hard he saw stars. He came so fucking hard he might\u2019ve shouted. He came so fucking hard he might\u2019ve sworn his love for her. But then again...he might\u2019ve come in silence; he couldn\u2019t hear shit over the roaring in his ears and the blood pounding in his head.</p><p>Soft fingers sifted through his hair. He opened his eyes.</p><p>His beautiful Aurora was smiling at him. A little shyly, yet with that smug female tilt to her lips.</p><p>He pecked her on the mouth. \u201cDamn good way to start the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton kissed her again, this time on her knee before he lowered it to the bed. \u201cBe right back.\u201d He headed to the bathroom and ditched the condom. When he returned to the bedroom Rory was getting dressed. \u201cAre we doin\u2019 something today? Or are you goin\u2019 home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go check on my dog. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably oughta start painting the yellow submarine room.\u201d</p><p>She fastened her bra. \u201cDo you want help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019d help me? On your day off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like more fun than sitting on the couch studying government regulations for hours on end, wondering what the cool kids are doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know since you were one of the cool kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what universe? I was considered the prickly kid because of my shyness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never shy with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you always got me, McKay. I never had to pretend with you.\u201d A strange look entered her eyes, as if she was embarrassed she\u2019d admitted that.</p><p>\u201cYou always got me too, Aurora.\u201d He tucked a hank of hair behind her ear. \u201cSo yes, I\u2019d love to spend the day with you. Even watching paint dry would be fun with you.\u201d</p><p>She smooched his mouth. \u201cI swear, you say the most romantic things even when you\u2019re not trying to be romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do have one favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne night in the sack and he\u2019s already asking me for favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family is havin\u2019 a thing tonight and I\u2019d like you to go with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike all the McKays? Or just your branch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my branch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is a good idea? Me crashing a family dinner?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the back of her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s the best idea ever. I know what you\u2019re thinkin\u2019. But I\u2019m not bringing you along because I didn\u2019t want to go by myself. We are a couple. And next weekend, if you want, we can do the family thing with your mom and Gavin.\u201d</p><p>After all the remarks she\u2019d made to her mom about the McKays\u2014okay, one McKay in particular\u2014how many times would her mother do the I-told-you-so dance if she said...guess who\u2019s coming to dinner?</p><p>About ten thousand.</p><p>\u201cBesides, you\u2019ve known my family forever,\u201d Dalton pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you forever. I\u2019ve met your brothers. You talked about them. But that doesn\u2019t mean I know them. Or their wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie and Georgia are sweet. You\u2019ll get along with them just fine.\u201d</p><p>Why did men always say that? Since it was rarely the case?</p><p>Dalton turned on a rutted gravel road. Several ranch buildings came into view including an old wooden barn and a newer pole barn. The house looked different than she remembered.</p><p>\u201cDo you know I was never in your house when we were kids?\u201d</p><p>He turned off the ignition. \u201cI never brought any of my friends home. Not that I was embarrassed by the house, but the thought of how Casper might act to my friends in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a helluva lot nicer now that Brandt and Jessie live here. Casper wouldn\u2019t spend the money to fix the place up.\u201d</p><p>Rory squinted at the license plate of the car in front of them. \u201cIs your mother here too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. She probably brought Landon. I haven\u2019t seen him since he was the ring bearer.\u201d</p><p>As they walked up to the front door, Rory shivered.</p><p>Of course, Dalton caught it. He moved in front of her. His warm, callused hands cupped her face. \u201cHey. If you\u2019re not all right with this we just stop in for fifteen minutes and say we have other plans. That ain\u2019t a lie. I do have big plans for you tonight, Aurora.\u201d</p><p>He snared her mouth in a kiss. A perfect kiss.</p><p>A squeaking hinge sounded behind them.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Making out on the steps? Get in here.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s lips curved, ending the kiss. He faced Brandt. \u201cYou remember Rory.\u201d</p><p>Brandt rolled his eyes. \u201cOf course I remember her. Glad you could join us. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She tried to tug free of Dalton\u2019s hand but he held on firmly as he led her inside.</p><p>They were immediately surrounded by kids and adults.</p><p>Rory considered crawling into the coat closet until a small boy jumped out of it with a loud, \u201cRowr!\u201d She screamed. Which caused the boys to laugh as they raced away.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Jessie said. \u201cScaring the bejeezus out of everyone is Tucker\u2019s latest thing. We hope he outgrows it. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy then Wyatt will\u2019ve learned to do it,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cDalton McKay, bite your tongue,\u201d Jessie warned.</p><p>He merely grinned.</p><p>Tell exited the kitchen, in conversation with his mother. His gaze moved between Dalton and Rory. \u201cNice to see you, Rory. Glad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Georgia?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s feelin\u2019 queasy so she laid down. I need to check on her.\u201d</p><p>Joan McKay threw her arms around Dalton. \u201cHello, son.\u201d</p><p>Dalton stepped back and grabbed Rory\u2019s hand. \u201cYou remember Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Then Joan hugged her. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton told me all about you. He was\u2014is\u2014thrilled you\u2019re living around here again.\u201d</p><p>Rather than demand to know what else Mr. Thrilled had said, Rory nodded.</p><p>They stared at each other. Awkward.</p><p>Then Joan smiled. \u201cLandon, come and say hi to your Uncle Dalton and his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>A lanky, dark-haired boy of about eight stood beside Joan.</p><p>\u201cWow, kid. You\u2019re like twice the size you were last time I saw you,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>He smiled shyly.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I used to go to your house when I was little. We\u2019d build stuff with Legos. We\u2019d dig outside in the dirt and you let me play in the mud. You had a cool dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilo. He liked you too, except for the time you smacked him with a Tonka truck. Took quite a few dog treats for him to trust you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a dog now. His name is Dixon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m currently without a dog, but Rory, here, has an awesome dog named Jingle.\u201d</p><p>Landon stared at her. Then his eyes\u2014the same beautiful McKay blue as Dalton\u2019s\u2014lit up. \u201cHey! I remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were at Uncle Dalton\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood memory, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was scared to walk down the aisle. You told me to pretend people were staring because they were trying to figure out my secret super power and to be very serious so as to not give it away.\u201d</p><p>Rory grinned. \u201cIt worked. You made it down the aisle without a hitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly what happened to Dalton. Ironic, huh?\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d Dalton put his hand on Tell\u2019s chest and shoved him.</p><p>Tell shoved him back.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Joan said. \u201cNo fighting in the house.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour as they chatted in the living room, Rory tried to discreetly watch the interactions between Dalton and his brothers. It looked seamless. Like he\u2019d just slipped back into the family dynamic, but the set of Dalton\u2019s shoulders gave away his tension. Besides that, there seemed to be affection between them, although as grown men they showed it by ragging on each other endlessly.</p><p>The kids ran in and out, which drove Rory crazy, but everyone took it in stride. She realized her life growing up an only child and her life now as a single woman with unmarried, childless friends didn\u2019t allow for much experience with kids, let alone rambunctious boys. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessie and Joan headed to the kitchen to get supper ready and Rory followed them.</p><p>\u201cRory, dear, you don\u2019t have to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my way around the kitchen better than I can sort through talk about cows, ranching and other McKay family members.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate the help.\u201d Jessie handed her a stack of plates and a basket of silverware from the dishwasher. \u201cHere you go. The placemats are on the sideboard.\u201d</p><p>Rory had just put the last fork in place when a little person wearing a helmet smacked into the back of her legs. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson McKay,\u201d a female voice said sharply. \u201cYou apologize to Rory right now.\u201d</p><p>A muffled, \u201cSorry,\u201d came from inside the helmet. Then he ran off.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Georgia said. \u201cTerrible twos are not a myth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d Rory asked.</p><p>\u201cSome. I get woozy at night for some reason instead of in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s gaze briefly dropped to Georgia\u2019s belly. \u201cWhen are you due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout four months, so I\u2019ve got a ways to go. How are you? I was surprised to hear you were back here, working for...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Wyoming Natural Resources Coalition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that going?\u201d</p> <p>Sucks ass most days wasn\u2019t a proper dinner party response. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s gotta be happy you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. Although she\u2019s not around as much as she used to be. She\u2019s traveling with Gavin, which I\u2019m happy to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you hear from Sierra a lot more than we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I did before she turned twenty-one,\u201d Rory said dryly. \u201cBut we keep in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was such a great cheerleader. I wish she would\u2019ve cheered on the college level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Sierra is out to make her mark in the business world. Like father like daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt. Do you remember her BFF Marin?\u201d</p> <p>Rory nodded. \u201cI always liked Marin. What\u2019s she up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter high school Marin got her CNA and kept working at the nursing home in Hulett. She saw the residents having problems with sore spots from their wheelchair armrests so she started making covers for them. Her demand got so high, from other nursing homes that she couldn\u2019t keep up with the orders. Sierra told Marin to quit her job and turn her sideline into a business.\u201d Georgia looked over her shoulder then back at Rory. \u201cThis isn\u2019t common knowledge, but Sierra became Marin\u2019s business partner. She fronted the money for more sewing machines, material, supplies and another fulltime employee. Within a year Marin had four employees and office space in Hulett. Now\u2019s she\u2019s got a catalog and gets orders from all over the world.\u201d</p><p>Seemed like her little sister had been keeping some pretty big secrets from her. \u201cSierra told you about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I did some marketing for their company. I\u2019m so proud of both those girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Although I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected you didn\u2019t. Sierra\u2019s got a lot going on, most of it on the down low. But she did mention to me at the last McKay gathering that she\u2019d just bought a few rental properties here and there. Probably to prove something to her dad, the real estate mogul, but I don\u2019t know why she\u2019d need to. She\u2019s definitely a chip off the old block.\u201d</p><p>It bothered her that Sierra had kept her in the dark about so many things in her life. Then again, Rory had been moping for the past few months and wasn\u2019t much fun to talk to anyway. She smiled at Georgia. \u201cIs it possible to have step-sibling rivalry at my age? That girl is making me feel like a slacker.\u201d</p><p>Georgia laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re Rielle\u2019s kid. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve never been a slacker a day in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupper\u2019s on,\u201d Joan trilled.</p><p>The guys wandered in from the living room.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s hands landed on her shoulders. He whispered, \u201cDoin\u2019 all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing great.\u201d She turned and kissed his cheek, but the sneaky man turned it into a real kiss.</p><p>Landon said, \u201cEww, gross Uncle Dalton. We\u2019re just about to eat!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at Rory before he looked at his mother. \u201cWhere do you want us to sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? At the kids\u2019 table in the kitchen,\u201d Brandt said and ducked when Dalton tried to swat him on the back of the head.</p><p>\u201cI oughta make you sit at the kids\u2019 table, Brandt, since half of the kids are yours,\u201d his mother pointed out.</p><p>Brandt put his hand on Jessie\u2019s stomach and kissed her cheek. \u201cSoon to be more than half.\u201d</p><p>Holy crap. Jessie was pregnant too? Rory had considered ditching the condoms with Dalton since she was on the pill, but seeing these virile McKay males? Now she had half a mind to demand that Dalton double bag his dick\u2014just to be safe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the end,\u201d Dalton said, leading her to the chairs and pulling one out for her.</p><p>Jessie and Georgia exchanged an amused look.</p><p>Settled in, Rory tried to catch all the byplays between Dalton and his brothers, but she kept getting distracted. Dalton\u2019s hand on her thigh might\u2019ve been part of it.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you guys do today?\u201d Joan asked. \u201cAnything fun?\u201d</p><p>Well, it was fun when your son fucked me senseless first thing this morning. Then it was really fun after we finished painting and he fucked me in the shower.</p><p>Rory was saved from answering when Dalton launched into a lengthy explanation of how much prep work each room entailed.</p><p>When she looked up, Jessie\u2019s lips quirked in a knowing smile.</p><p>After supper Dalton asked, \u201cJess, is it okay if I give Rory a quick tour of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeware of opening the door to the laundry room. The pile of dirty clothes might cause an avalanche and bury you alive.\u201d</p><p>Dalton held her hand and towed her behind him. \u201cAfter Casper gave Brandt and Jessie this place, they gutted part of it and added on. They took Mom\u2019s suggestions since she\u2019d spent years in a small kitchen with a large family.\u201d They cut down a short hallway. \u201cThe back half of the kitchen, the laundry room, another main floor bathroom, the master bedroom and bath is all new.\u201d</p><p>She poked her head into the bedroom. \u201cNice. It\u2019s cool they have their own adult space. I loved that about my mom\u2019s house too. The little pockets of privacy.\u201d</p><p>He brought her back through the living room where Joan, Jessie and Georgia were in a hushed discussion that ended the instant they saw Dalton and Rory.</p><p>Another weird thing that Dalton didn\u2019t notice, or if he did, he didn\u2019t comment on.</p><p>They paused in the doorway that bisected the hallway.</p><p>Rory looked at the doors. \u201cWhich room was yours growing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? It doesn\u2019t look the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably a lot cleaner,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cDoubtful. The place where I used to lay my head is now Brandt\u2019s office. He used to be such a slob.\u201d Dalton opened the door in the middle of the hallway. \u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><p>Rory shouldered past him and entered the room. \u201cThis is twice as big as my tiny bedroom growing up in the cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell and I shared this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have bunk beds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like, sharing a room?\u201d</p><p>Dalton walked past her, toward the window. \u201cI didn\u2019t know different. I was the kid who never wanted to be by himself. I hated it when Tell got his own place. Probably why I moved out as soon as I could.\u201d</p><p>Rory slid her hands up his back as he stared out the window, lost in a memory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad this room isn\u2019t the same,\u201d he said after a bit. \u201cIt\u2019s like that part of my life never existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you never snuck girls in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Fantasized about it.\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cWent through a whole bunch of tissues during those wet-dream type of fantasies.\u201d</p><p>She kissed the base of his neck. \u201cWould you\u2019ve told me to get lost if I\u2019d knocked on your window when I was sixteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no. I would\u2019ve tempted Casper\u2019s wrath and let you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then we would\u2019ve...what? Rolled around on top of the covers?\u201d</p><p>Then Dalton spun around and pushed her against the door. \u201cOh yeah. I would\u2019ve dry humped you at least twice.\u201d</p><p>Rory rested her wrists on his shoulders. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven my lack of sex ed at age eighteen? I would\u2019ve wowed you with some sloppy kisses, groped your tits and tried to shove my hand down your pants.\u201d He paused. \u201cOh right. That sounds exactly like what happened between us in the truck. So sugarplum, you\u2019ve already had the underwhelming teenage Dalton McKay experience\u2014why would you ever wanna repeat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit I much prefer the recent Dalton McKay experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d He bent his head to kiss her neck. \u201cWhich one in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to choose because there are so many. But looking back to last night and how you teased me when you still had your jeans on, there was something very sexy about getting off\u2014or almost getting off\u2014when you\u2019re clothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted,\u201d he murmured against her throat. \u201cTo get you off with hardly putting my hands on you. But someone\u2014\u201d he bit her earlobe, \u201c\u2014was impatient.\u201d</p><p>Her body tingled from that quick love bite. \u201cSo do it now,\u201d she said. \u201cPretend I climbed through your bedroom window and you\u2019re trying to convince me to roll around in the sheets with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your sense of adventure, McKay? Someone could bust in on us at any time, just like in your misspent youth when you were constantly spanking the monkey all by your lonesome.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton snorted. \u201cYou are such a damn romantic. Not. Fine. I\u2019ll get you off, but I draw the line at coming in my jeans at my age.\u201d He slipped a hard thigh between her legs and pulled her forward for a better angle as he moved against her. \u201cBeen there, done that too many times.\u201d</p><p>Him grinding that rigid quad against her clit didn\u2019t suck. Rory slid her body up and down his leg; the friction from the fabric made her pussy hot and wet. So when Dalton planted kisses across her collarbones and his tongue traced the upper swell of her breast, she was surprised at how close she was to blowing.</p><p>Two knocks on the door caused her to jump.</p><p>\u201cDalton? We wondered if you got lost,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>He froze. Then he lifted his head and quickly said, \u201cWe weren\u2019t doin\u2019 nothin\u2019 in here, just ah...talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty acting much, McKay?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he hissed in her ear.</p><p>Tell said, \u201cThought you oughta know Mom\u2019s dishing up dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Dalton covered Rory\u2019s mouth with his and kissed her hungrily. Between kisses he murmured, \u201cWant you. So fucking much. Seems like days since I\u2019ve touched you and I know it\u2019s only been hours. When I get you home...get you alone...it\u2019s gonna be fast, too damn fast but I won\u2019t be able to help myself.\u201d</p><p>Rory rested her cheek against his neck, holding onto him, wondering if he realized he was the one shaking. In that moment she knew why he\u2019d insisted on going slow last night. To prove to himself\u2014not to her\u2014that he could. \u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding when you warned me you\u2019d be fixated on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn you,\u201d he corrected. His mouth\u2014his hands never stopped moving on her. \u201cDoes that worry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that we\u2019ll run out of condoms. But I am on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora, please don\u2019t be flip. This kept me up last night.\u201d</p><p>That set off her warning bells. Her plan to enjoy the perks of Dalton McKay\u2019s sexpertise, while keeping some distance and perspective, was failing miserably, given the fact she\u2019d barely left his side in the last twenty-four hours and she\u2019d dined with his family. She needed to set boundaries from the start and this was the perfect opportunity to do it. \u201cReally? I slept like the dead.\u201d She disentangled herself from him and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to catch up on sleep tonight since I won\u2019t be there to distract you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? Aren\u2019t you spending the night with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She playfully pecked him on the lips. \u201cOh, don\u2019t pout, McKay. I brought work home that I have to finish before Monday so I swear I won\u2019t be having fun without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Not a question. Rather than bristle at his assumption, or knuckle under because she really did like spending time with him, she poked him on the chest. \u201cOnly if I get my work done. Now let\u2019s go get some dessert so I can go home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Sunday night...</p><p>\u201cOh my fucking god,\u201d she roared and came so hard her entire body bucked, vibrating like she was hooked up to a defibrillator.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s fingers tightened on her hips and he held on, never missing a stroke.</p> <p>Her pussy throbbed from Dalton\u2019s cock plunging in and out of her like a battering ram. From her second orgasm in fifteen minutes.</p><p>The man was a sexual beast.</p><p>A half-shouted grunt echoed and then Dalton said, \u201cFuck,\u201d as his cock pumped inside her spasming channel.</p><p>She didn\u2019t rock back into him, but remained still, squeezing her inner muscles around that gloriously thick shaft.</p><p>\u201cGod I love fucking you,\u201d he growled against the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cDalton. We\u2019ve got to... Omigod, stop doing that thing with your hips right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d He chuckled in her ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. We ah...need to...\u201d What the hell word was she looking for? She couldn\u2019t think her brain was so scrambled. Oh right. \u201cWe need to talk. We can\u2019t keep going at it like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d His hot breath drifted over her shoulder and she suppressed a shiver. \u201cThere\u2019s no goin\u2019 back. I will be all up in you\u2014\u201d Dalton\u2019s soft lips left a trail of kisses down her spine, \u201c\u2014all the time.\u201d He eased out of her body and pulled her upright. \u201cAt least once a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...yeah. But...\u201d Oh, hello, fingers on my nipples, I missed you in the last twenty minutes while you were on my hips. When he put his hands on her like that, softly, sweetly, reverently...her mind became mush. Gluttonous mush that couldn\u2019t think beyond more.</p><p>\u201cYou were sayin\u2019?\u201d he murmured in that deep voice that dripped of sexually satisfied male.</p><p>\u201cOh. This is the third time today we\u2019ve had rock-my-body, blow-my-hair-back sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Since you didn\u2019t mention scream-inducing sex, means I haven\u2019t been up to snuff the other two times, so sugarplum, I fully plan on goin\u2019 for four.\u201d</p><p>Monday evening...</p><p>\u201cSeriously. We need to talk. We can\u2019t...\u201d Keep doing this, her brain supplied lamely before it purred and went back into hibernation.</p><p>Rory\u2019s eyes rolled back in her head when Dalton switched to those butterfly licks with his tongue.</p><p>He lifted his head long enough to say, \u201cI can\u2019t talk with my mouth full,\u201d and buried his face between her thighs again.</p><p>Between his fingers and his skillful mouth, Rory didn\u2019t stand a chance at holding back. The orgasm blasted through her like a grenade. No build up. Just BOOM.</p><p>Then Dalton was sliding into her. His teeth at her throat. His fingers twisted in her hair. \u201cPut your hands on me, Aurora.\u201d</p><p>And she lost herself in him. In them. This was more than sex. This was Dalton imprinting her body with his. So she\u2019d have no memory of any other man before him and want no other man after him.</p><p>She\u2019d take advantage of his sexual obsession with her because she knew it wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>Wednesday morning...</p><p>A warm mouth enclosed her nipple. Rough-tipped fingers skated across her belly, between her hipbones and back up to pluck at her other nipple.</p><p>In the pitch black of her bedroom, Rory had no idea what time it was. She stretched her arms above her head and turned to look at the clock.</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands there,\u201d he rasped in that deep morning voice.</p><p>\u201cMmm-kay. But I did have pajamas on last night. What happened to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were in my way this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means, just strip me when it suits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did. And you, nekkid, warm and soft beneath me suits me just fine.\u201d Dalton\u2019s mouth reversed course, down the plane of her abdomen. \u201cSpread your thighs and give me room.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she stretched her legs out, Dalton settled in the space she\u2019d created. He opened the flesh hiding her clit with his thumbs and fastened his mouth to her sex. No teasing, just gentle coaxing as he kissed her soft tissues. He focused his flicking tongue and suction without pause until the first spasm pulsed against his lips.</p><p>She felt him swallow the juices pouring from her. Felt the male pride that he\u2019d gotten her so wet that her essence coated his face. Then she felt the heat of his need blast over her like a shock wave.</p><p>His hands gripped her ass and he rolled to his knees, placing the backs of her legs against his chest. He leaned forward and slid into her pussy. His strokes began slowly but didn\u2019t stay that way for long.</p><p>Rory\u2019s arms were above her head and she braced herself. Dalton bent so far forward, getting so deep inside her that her hips were parallel to her shoulders. Keeping one arm strapped against her legs, he grabbed the headboard and hammered his cock into her. His eyes closed, his face tight, fucking her like a man possessed. The headboard slammed into the wall as he slammed into her.</p><p>Unbelievably hot, how strongly she affected this strong man.</p><p>He came in near silence.</p><p>But afterward, when he held her, the words came. Sweet words sometimes. Raunchy words others. Words that were a near confession and scared her as much as thrilled her.</p><p>Like now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, jungle girl,\u201d he whispered against her throat. \u201cOnly mine. I\u2019m never walking away from you again.\u201d He sealed his mouth to hers, preventing a response.</p><p>But Rory didn\u2019t know what to say anyway. The more she held back, the more determined he became to hold onto her.</p><p>Dalton gradually broke the kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s early yet and I just...needed you.\u201d</p><p>Not wanted. Needed. She\u2019d begun to understand the differences in those two words.</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep. I\u2019ll make coffee and let Jingle out.\u201d</p><p>After he left Rory\u2019s place on Wednesday morning, Dalton eyed the No Hunting signs hanging from the barbed wire fence on either side of the gate as he fiddled with the lock. Despite the rust and grime from constant Wyoming wind, the paddle lock opened easily. He unwound the four feet of chain and tossed it in the back of his truck.</p><p>After he pulled through, he pushed the gate shut. An open gate was an open invitation. Especially if the gate had remained closed the last three years. He needed time to sketch out his plans and he wasn\u2019t in the mood to explain them to his brothers or anyone else who might happen by.</p><p>In his truck he spread out the oversized copy of the land plat. Four years ago they\u2019d bought two parcels of land totaling five hundred acres from neighbors whose marriage had hit the skids. Initially he and his brothers had intended to use the acres closest to the McKay ranch to run more cattle. Since a house and barn had been included with the property, Tell and Georgia had asked if they could move into it.</p><p>At the time, Dalton hadn\u2019t minded living in a trailer. But it had bugged him that he\u2019d fronted every penny for the land purchase and it was just expected that all five hundred acres would be absorbed into the McKay ranching operation. He wouldn\u2019t have anything to show for all the money he\u2019d put into it except joint ownership\u2014split three ways. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So Dalton had consulted his cousin Gavin\u2014beings he was a real estate guru\u2014and Gavin suggested Dalton not give the entire section in a gesture of family largess, but personally retain a portion of the acreage, specifically the acreage that bordered Gavin\u2019s land.</p><p>Dalton had agreed even though it dragged out the official paperwork an additional two months. By then, he\u2019d started dating Addie and his brothers assumed that he\u2019d build a house on that section for his wife-to-be. Strange to think he hadn\u2019t even considered that option.</p><p>Once Brandt and Tell had taken possession of three hundred acres with creek access, they didn\u2019t ask what Dalton intended to do with his section, since it was less conducive to running cattle. And during the years Dalton was gone, they\u2019d never asked permission to do anything with the land\u2014neither had Gavin.</p> <p>And now Dalton knew exactly what he\u2019d do with it.</p><p>Two hundred acres wasn\u2019t much, but in this situation it\u2019d be ideal because the elk herd could easily be contained by a combination of fencing and natural barriers. Much as ranchers lamented the lack of water in high plains desert, this was one instance where the lack of water would be a benefit. Hauling water meant he controlled placement of the tanks. It also meant animals wouldn\u2019t wander off in search of water because they\u2019d know exactly where to find it.</p><p>Putting his truck in drive, he followed the tire tracks downhill, stopping every once in a while to mark off where the sections of fence would need to be higher.</p><p>The topography was a mix of rolling hills and deep crevasses. He\u2019d have to get out at some point and study the raised ridge. But for now he stopped to add notes to his crude drawings and returned to inching across the landscape.</p><p>After traveling the last three years and living in the mountains for over a year of that, he\u2019d forgotten the sparsity of the area. Several clumps of trees grew at the lowest points of the draws, providing more diversity in vegetation than he\u2019d remembered. Also a point in his favor for an elk habitat.</p> <p>Dalton spent hours traversing the land, checking the condition of the fences and possible problem access points. When he finished he understood how labor-intensive this project would be\u2014work he\u2019d be one hundred percent responsible for. But what else was he supposed to do with his time? Hang out in the hospital? No way. Or tag along opening fences for his brothers as they did chores? No way on that, either. He didn\u2019t have a burning desire to raise elk, but he did have a burning desire to convince Rory they were meant to be. That meant living here.</p><p>He flipped through the pages of regulations. No new surprises\u2014he\u2019d studied up on other states rules. There wasn\u2019t a huge difference between Montana stipulations and the proposed regulations in Wyoming.</p><p>As he headed back, he tried to take in anything he might\u2019ve missed on the first pass. At the gate he installed the new paddle lock with the heavier, shorter chain and locked it up.</p><p>On the drive back into Sundance, his thoughts strayed to Rory. Sweet, sexy, funny insatiable Rory. They\u2019d burned the sheets up and then some the last five days. As much as he loved that her desire, need, passion and obsession almost matched his, he realized he needed to slow things down. He had to show her this relationship was so much more than just hot sex.</p><p>Which reminded him that first lunch date he\u2019d sworn to romance the hell out of her. And what had he done besides the candlelit seduction?</p><p>Not. A. Damn. Thing.</p> <p>He needed to rectify that.</p><p>But how?</p><p>Then the perfect idea occurred to him.</p><p>She\u2019ll think it\u2019s lame. How can you even consider that romantic?</p><p>Better to try and fail than not try at all.</p><p>Dalton made a mental note for the additional items he\u2019d need from the hardware store.</p><p>Four sharp knocks sounded on Dalton\u2019s door at three fifteen.</p><p>At least the kid was prompt. Dalton yelled, \u201cCome in,\u201d and pulled his box cutter out of the yellow and brown linoleum before he rolled to his feet.</p> <p>Kyler stood by the front door, ill at ease and Dalton couldn\u2019t fault him. Even before Dalton had left town, he and Cord\u2019s oldest kid hadn\u2019t spent time together besides attending McKay family gatherings. The odd thing? The age gap between him and Kyler was the same age gap between him and Cord.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kyler, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d He looked around, hands jammed in the pockets of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked. My mom gets done around six so I gotta be at her massage studio then so she can give me a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll leave it up to you if you want me to drop you off or if you wanna walk. We\u2019re workin\u2019 in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I take my boots off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless they\u2019re covered in cow shit.\u201d</p><p>Kyler ditched his coat. \u201cWearing shit covered boots to school\u2014not cool.\u201d</p><p>Dalton returned to the kitchen. \u201cWhen I went to school some guys wore their barn boots to class, tryin\u2019 to prove they were real cowboys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill got a few of them guys. It\u2019s worse when ranch kids try to be gangsta. Give me a freakin\u2019 break. Nothin\u2019 gangsta about livin\u2019 in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a soda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If it\u2019s no trouble.\u201d</p><p>So polite. But he didn\u2019t expect less from Cord\u2019s kid. Dalton passed him a can of Coke and cracked one open for himself. \u201cSo, I have to ask what you told your dad about why you\u2019re helping me out.\u201d</p><p>Kyler grinned. \u201cA version of the truth. You gave my truck a jump and when I asked how I could repay you, you mentioned needin\u2019 a little help over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, Mom and Dad bust me every freakin\u2019 time I lie so it\u2019s not worth it. Most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this girl?\u201d</p><p>He grinned again. \u201cShe is so totally worth a lie or two thousand.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. \u201cI remember them days. Hell, I remember them girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t think my dad remembers what high school is like. He\u2019s got all these crap rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d guess the crap rules are in place for you because Cord remembers exactly how he was in high school,\u201d Dalton said dryly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Hayden thinks too. I swear my dad and Uncle Kane are way stricter than Uncle Cam is...and he\u2019s a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine it doesn\u2019t do you any good to complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMouthing off just gets my phone and my truck keys taken away so I\u2019ve learned to have all the arguments in my head. That way, I always win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might\u2019ve saved myself a lot of grief if I\u2019d adopted that attitude at your age.\u201d Except Casper saw silence as an admission of guilt. He saw arguing as defending guilt. Dalton had been screwed either way. He noticed Kyler staring at him, waiting for further instructions. \u201cWe\u2019re stripping linoleum today. Don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get to the point where we can move the appliances. I\u2019ll warn ya it\u2019s tedious stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDang. I was hopin\u2019 we\u2019d be bustin\u2019 cabinets with a sledgehammer or something.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen flooring had three layers of linoleum. The second layer had been glued on the first layer, which meant the flooring had to be removed in small sections, a layer at a time. Dalton showed Kyler how he wanted it done, handed him a box cutter and let him be.</p><p>After half an hour or so of zero conversation, Kyler sighed.</p><p>\u201cBored already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But don\u2019t you listen to music while you\u2019re workin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda quiet in here. Music makes the time go faster.\u201d He shot Dalton a grin. \u201cMight make us work faster.\u201d</p><p>Dalton pointed to the living room. \u201cSound system has an iPod dock. Or if you flip on the TV there are satellite music channels in the seven hundreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my iPod.\u201d He pushed to his feet. \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna screw something up so maybe you\u2019d better show me how to run the system.\u201d</p><p>Dalton needed to replace his blade anyway. He gave Kyler a basic rundown of the system, suspecting he was way more tech savvy than him. He watched Kyler dinking with buttons on the remote. Damn kid looked so much like Cord it was spooky. Even his mannerisms were the same.</p><p>No one had ever said that about you and Casper.</p><p>\u201cDone. Now we can crank some tunes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask that you don\u2019t play any of that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRap?\u201d Kyler supplied.</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t mind rap. I\u2019m not crazy about that hipster, emo, boy-band crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>Kyler left the tunes at a reasonable decibel. The music made him work faster and apparently loosened his vocal cords because he started asking questions. Lots of questions.</p><p>Thing was, Dalton had spent so much time by himself in the last few years, he welcomed interest in where he\u2019d been and what he\u2019d done. Even his brothers hadn\u2019t taken much interest.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Brandt or Tell since he\u2019d stopped going to visit Casper every day, but he did talk to them. Dalton explained his absence from the daily hospital duty as he\u2019d run into serious snags with the house remodel\u2014not a total lie. But it was obvious they considered it bullshit. Neither of them had bothered to show up and offer a hand to fix those snags.</p><p>Might\u2019ve been nice to have the company and the help, but Dalton reminded himself he didn\u2019t need it.</p><p>\u201cGot big plans for the weekend?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>\u201cFootball game Friday night. We\u2019re playing Gillette. They\u2019ve got a bunch of big guys so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll end up on my ass a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat position do you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuarterback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d echoed from the front entry.</p><p>Rory.</p><p>Dalton stood and hoped it didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d leapt to his feet. \u201cIn here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard music. Thought maybe you were having a party.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYep. With strippers and everything. Except we\u2019re the strippers.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cLinoleum strippers.\u201d</p><p>Kyler snorted.</p><p>Rory smiled at him, then at Kyler. \u201cHey, Kyler. How\u2019d you get roped into helping with this?\u201d</p> <p>Kyler gave Dalton an odd look.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just call it McKay community service,\u201d Dalton said with a straight face.</p><p>The kid snorted again.</p><p>Dalton reached out to run his hand down Rory\u2019s hair, but he caught a glimpse of his dirty fingers and dropped his hand by his side. \u201cKyler was telling me he\u2019s got a football game this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the people in the office talking about it,\u201d Rory said. \u201cIt\u2019s the big district playoff game. You ready to take the team to victory, superstar quarterback?\u201d</p> <p>Kyler blushed. \u201cIf we win, it\u2019ll be a team effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so modest.\u201d Rory draped her arm over Dalton\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat Kyler hasn\u2019t mentioned? He\u2019s been the starting quarterback since his freshman year and he\u2019s taken the Sundance football team to the state finals the last two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made it to the finals but we haven\u2019t won,\u201d Kyler pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also been named to the all-state team. The western U.S. all-conference team and he\u2019s in the top one hundred on the national who\u2019s who list of high school athletes. College scouts are sniffing around too.\u201d</p><p>Kyler blushed even harder and stood. \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra. I talked to her last night. I\u2019m pretty sure she was doing herkeys while she was bragging on your athletic prowess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSierra exaggerates. Anyway, it\u2019s just high school football. Not like I\u2019m a professional athlete like Chase. Or a professional poker player like Dalton, which is way cooler and takes a whole lotta skill and strategy.\u201d</p><p>Dalton tugged on Rory\u2019s hair. \u201cSee? Kyler knows Texas Hold\u2019em requires skill more than luck.\u201d</p><p>Rory rolled her eyes.</p><p>Kyler looked appalled. \u201cDude. Seriously? She thinks it\u2019s a game of...luck?\u201d He said luck as if it were a dirty word.</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to explain it but she won\u2019t change her mind. Anyway, good luck with your football game this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He skirted the breakfast bar and snagged his iPod. \u201cI\u2019d probably better get walkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Kyler slipped on his coat. \u201cSince we didn\u2019t have football practice today I need some cardio. I\u2019ll get plenty of lifting exercise when I start chores.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton moved in front of Kyler as he shouldered his backpack. He dug thirty bucks from his front pocket and held it out. \u201cI appreciate your help today, Kyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t expect free labor. Now you\u2019ve got a little extra to take your girl out and show her off.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOr to put in a new battery in that truck of yours so you don\u2019t get busted again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dalton.\u201d He folded the bills and tucked them in his pocket. \u201cYou want me here next Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t interfere with football practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d He leaned in and said, \u201cMaybe you oughta follow your own advice. Take Rory out and show her off, \u2019cause man, she is totally hot. You are so lucky to get with her.\u201d Kyler stepped aside, gifting Rory with a smile to rival the devil\u2019s. \u201cSee ya, Rory.\u201d He slipped out the door.</p><p>Rory sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s the first in another generation of devastatingly handsome and charming McKay males.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid. Sounds like Cord\u2019s got a tight leash on him. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens when Kyler breaks that leash, \u2019cause we all do at some point.\u201d Dalton turned around and Rory was right there. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey yourself, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d He kissed her sweetly, lazily, letting the simple pleasure of kissing her whenever the hell he wanted wash through him. He ended the kiss with soft brushes of his lips over hers.</p><p>\u201cI liked that. Do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a sec.\u201d He gazed into her beautiful eyes. \u201cI need to clean myself up. Then what would you like to do tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to take me to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides that.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s eyes turned thoughtful. \u201cI don\u2019t know. What is there to do? Since I\u2019ve been back in Sundance I either worked at the Twin Pines or I stayed home. I\u2019m not in the mood to hang out in a bar, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you be doing if you were in Montana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m bored I head out and shoot practice rounds. Not much else to do in the woods except improve my marksmanship.\u201d When she didn\u2019t respond, he said, \u201cSugarplum, why you lookin\u2019 at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just weird. I know you\u2019ve hunted since you were a boy and you must be a good to be a professional guide. But in all the years I\u2019ve known you, when we played Tarzan and Jane, pirates, and pioneers, we never played cowboys and Indians, or Bonnie and Clyde; I\u2019ve never seen you holding a weapon\u2014for real or pretend.\u201d</p><p>Dalton bristled. \u201cIt bothers you that I\u2019ve held a gun and a bow and killed animals with these hands?\u201d</p><p>Rory lifted his hands and traced the outside of his fingers. \u201cNo. I love your hands. I love your hands on me. You\u2019re so gentle, tender and thorough. You\u2019re also rough and exacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. My poorly made point is that there are things we don\u2019t know about each other. Like how we spend our free time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we past the testing phase? Where we each have to list our likes and dislikes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing my point, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing mine, Rory. I want to fuck you twenty-four/seven. And we pretty much have been doin\u2019 that since Friday night. But that\u2019s not enough for either of us. We need to make sure we like each other out of bed, too. Which is why we\u2019re gonna do something else tonight besides fuck each other\u2019s brains out.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cWho are you again?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed her pouting mouth. \u201cWon\u2019t take me long to clean up. You wanna head home, deal with your dog and I\u2019ll show up at your place in an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Except for the waiting an hour part. Because I\u2019m not waiting for what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora,\u201d she corrected as she herded him against the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s what you call me when we\u2019re getting busy, remember?\u201d Her mouth started a southerly path from behind his ear as she unbuttoned his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not getting busy, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. And if I really think about your we\u2019re not having sex tonight edict, I might get pissed off. I have a say in when we have sex too, don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>He liked this aggressive side of her and she did have a point. \u201cI need a shower. Been sweating outside and inside all day and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She licked his neck from the hollow of his throat to the bottom edge of his jaw and back down. \u201cI like how your skin tastes.\u201d She dragged her fingers down his torso to the waistband of his jeans. \u201cHow your body feels beneath my hands.\u201d</p><p>By the time she palmed his cock through the denim he was completely erect. \u201cWhy\u2019re you doin\u2019 this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember on Monday night when I showed up here after my yoga class? You saw me in yoga pants and couldn\u2019t keep your greedy hands off me?\u201d She rubbed her lips over the stubble on his jaw line.</p><p>\u201cAh. Yeah.\u201d Her lips were so soft on his face but her hand stroked his cock firmly through his jeans.</p><p>\u201cSame thing hit me when I saw you in this sexy flannel shirt, looking all manly, holding tools and shit. I just wanna take a big bite outta you, Dalton McKay. So you\u2019re gonna let me.\u201d</p><p>And he was done for. Done for.</p><p>Rory had unbuckled his belt and undone his zipper before his brain and mouth connected. Then she was on her knees yanking down his jeans and boxers. That warm, wet mouth enveloped his cock and his brain ceased functioning entirely.</p><p>She did twisty things with her tongue that...damn. She did that sucking thing with her cheeks...Christ. Then she tried to deep throat him and he shouted, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Fuck me.\u201d She brought his shaft into her mouth again and released him. \u201cFuck my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to fuck your sweet pussy in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck my sweet pussy right here against the wall. Ditch the boots and jeans.\u201d She stood. Shucking off her pants and underwear, she watched him to make sure he did the same.</p><p>As soon as his legs were free, Rory\u2019s mouth was on his. She spun until her back was against the wall. She wrapped her arm around his neck and her leg around his hip.</p><p>He marveled at the strength in her thigh muscles for about three seconds. Then her hand gripped the base of his cock and she\u2014holy shit\u2014pulled him forward with it. Yeah. She was not messing around. Dalton knew she wasn\u2019t messing around when the head of his cock brushed the wetness of her pussy. She wanted this. She was ready for this.</p><p>Who was he to deny her?</p><p>He bent his knees and filled her in one thrust.</p><p>Her head fell back. \u201cLike that again.\u201d</p><p>So he did it again. And again. And again.</p><p>No kissing, no touching. Just raw fucking.</p><p>Rory\u2019s hand landed on his butt in almost a slap and she urged his pelvis closer. \u201cGrind on me. Yes. More. Feels so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels so what?\u201d he managed.</p><p>\u201cHot. I\u2019m there already.\u201d Her nails dug into his ass. Into his neck. When her cunt pulsed around his shaft buried inside her, he had to grit his teeth to keep still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When her grip loosened, he shuttled his cock in and out of her slick channel until that moment when pleasure blindsided him and he erupted. Wave after wave of heat shot out of his cock and he freakin\u2019 loved the slick feeling it added to her pussy since they\u2019d stopped using condoms.</p><p>Once he could breathe, he kissed her neck. \u201cAurora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name. I love the way you say it after you come. It\u2019s so sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. Then she rubbed her bare leg up and down his. \u201cNow what did you say you wanted to do tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I remember.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Friday night after work Rory slid into the booth, grateful Mandie and Vanessa had ordered her a martini. She drained it in two big gulps and waved to the cocktail waitress for another round. \u201cAh. That\u2019s what I needed.\u201d</p><p>Mandie and Vanessa exchanged a look. \u201cWhat is up with you? You\u2019re like thirty minutes late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went over to Dalton\u2019s to change out of my uniform. Any time he sees me half-naked, he seizes the chance to get me completely naked and well, it\u2019s not like I resisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just had sex,\u201d Mandie stated.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how was it?\u201d Vanessa prompted.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put it this way, I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m only thirty minutes late. The man is a sex fiend. He\u2019s relentless.\u201d She grinned. \u201cIt is so very good to be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so freakin\u2019 jealous I could spit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t spit when you were getting it on all the time with Thomas,\u201d Rory reminded Mandie.</p><p>\u201cAll the time,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cHe never lasted long enough to make me thirty minutes late for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you broke up with him?\u201d</p><p>Mandie shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand his family. I didn\u2019t see it going anywhere because of that.\u201d</p><p>The waitress brought a fresh round.</p> <p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t have to worry about Dalton\u2019s family because I\u2019m just in it for the sex.\u201d</p><p>Even Vanessa looked skeptical. \u201cJust sex? Nothing else? You\u2019re sure it\u2019s not becoming something more?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cDid he really last thirty minutes?\u201d Mandie asked.</p><p>Why was her friend focused on that? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t exactly looking at my watch while he was rocking my world. But probably. He does have incredible staying power. And recovery time.\u201d She smirked. \u201cAnd tenacity.\u201d And a possessive streak. He\u2019d fucked her almost as a way to mark her before she went to a bar on a Friday night. Reminding her she\u2019d never get it as good anywhere else as she was already getting with him. All. The. Freakin\u2019. Time.</p><p>\u201cHow many times did you...?\u201d</p><p>Rory sipped her drink with one hand and lifted two fingers in the air.</p><p>\u201cTwice? You had two orgasms...in thirty minutes?\u201d</p><p>Mandie groaned. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, we just started sleeping together. It\u2019ll probably burn out.\u201d Rory ignored her libido when it piped up and bet her willpower fifty bucks it\u2019d never happen.</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you had sex this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Friday?\u201d Rory thought about it and tossed out a random number. \u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>Her friends\u2019 mouths nearly hit the table.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen?\u201d Vanessa repeated. \u201cAfter as long as you\u2019ve gone without, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not sore.\u201d</p><p>She was a little tender. But that disappeared when Dalton put his hands on her. Or his mouth on her. Or when he looked at her with that...gleam that made her go all hot and tingly and absolutely sopping wet.</p><p>\u201cWell, even if she is sore she can\u2019t tell him she\u2019s sore,\u201d Mandie said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Vanessa demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause if she complains her lady part is chafed he\u2019ll just want anal instead,\u201d Mandie stated.</p><p>Rory choked on her drink.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if part of the reason you\u2019re not sore after having sex seventeen freakin\u2019 times in a week is because you were taking it up the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Mandie. What. The. Hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No butt sex for you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna want it. Soon probably.\u201d Mandie\u2019s voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cMy advice? Lots of lube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe we\u2019re having this conversation.\u201d She really couldn\u2019t. She and her mom had never discussed sex beyond the you\u2019re going on the pill conversation when Rory had left for college. She\u2019d never wanted to hear about Addie and Dalton doing the nasty. Ditto for Addie and Truman. All the women in her office were much older and married. So she\u2019d never swapped sex stories, tips, dos and don\u2019ts, how tos with girlfriends until she\u2019d started hanging out with these two. And up until last week, she\u2019d had nothing to share. Her sex life with Dillon had been pathetic with a capital P. So she couldn\u2019t wait to share the juicy tidbits.</p><p>Dalton is a little touchy about his previous reputation as a horndog manwhore. He wouldn\u2019t like you blabbing to your friends about his studly moves in the sack.</p><p>The booze kicked in and the he-done-me-wrong girl inside her shouted tough shit. But when Rory opened her mouth to tell all about the size and shape and amazing tricks performed by Dalton\u2019s wonder dick...nothing came out.</p><p>Because you know it\u2019s wrong.</p><p>Tempting to drown her stupid conscience in half a dozen martinis and see if it still functioned properly.</p><p>\u201cYou got really quiet and then you looked like you were about to share something juicy,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just wondered how Mandie knows so much about anal sex.\u201d</p><p>Mandie drained her martini and signaled for another. \u201cI think Rory\u2019s right. We oughta talk about something else.</p><p>After Rory returned to Dalton\u2019s house from the bar, he dragged her back to bed and thoroughly fucked her in that slow and sweet way she craved because he did it so well.</p><p>So she was naked, sprawled on her stomach, the sheet twisted around her feet, basking in the afterglow. Happier than she could remember being in a long time.</p><p>Is that all it takes to make you happy? Sexual attention from a man who\u2019d keep you tied to his bed all day and night until he gets tired of you?</p><p>Whoa. Where had that come from?</p><p>Dalton trailed his fingers up and down her spine. Then he\u2019d randomly kiss spots on her body. The ball of her shoulder was the winner of that soft kiss. \u201cI love bein\u2019 with you like this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Naked, spent and sweaty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not just that.\u201d He brushed her hair away from her neck. \u201cIn our own little world.\u201d</p><p>Ooh. That was a sweet, melt-her-heart thing to say.</p><p>Sex-drunk and a little martini-drunk, you\u2019d melt if he recited an ode to the pockmarks on your ass.</p><p>True.</p><p>\u201cThat was a heavy sigh. Something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Yes. I\u2019m pretty sure I left my backbone at home next to Jingle\u2019s rawhide treats. \u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t sound very convincing, sugarplum. I don\u2019t want to pester you to talk to me, but I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPester,\u201d she said with a snort. \u201cNice way of saying you\u2019ll be a pushy bastard until I crack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo save me the trouble and tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we cool it on the sex for the rest of the night?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened with concern. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I am a little sore from excessive use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I can\u2019t get enough of you. But I will back off.\u201d Dalton kissed her shoulder again. \u201cSo, you had a good time with your friends tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. They gave me shit for being late. And because of that our conversation turned to sex.\u201d She groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a clich\u00e9, three single women in a bar, sipping martinis, dissing on sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you give as a reason for bein\u2019 late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re an insatiable stud. Then Mandie went off on this tangent about anal sex. She pretty much guaranteed that if we were having sex this much you\u2019d want that soon.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s fingers stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond right away. \u201cRory, I don\u2019t want you talkin\u2019 about our sex life to your friends.\u201d</p><p>She rolled away from him and pulled the sheet to her chest. \u201cExcuse me. I thought I was doing you a favor by letting it slip that Dalton McKay is still a legendary cocksman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not who I am or ever wanna be again. I only give a damn about bein\u2019 a legendary cocksman in your eyes and in our bed. What happens between us is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial?\u201d she said a little snottily.</p><p>\u201cYes. It is. It\u2019s intimacy on a level I\u2019ve never had and I don\u2019t think you have either. So I don\u2019t want to share what\u2019s special between us with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Rather than agreeing\u2014Rory turned combative. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t want you sharing the snatch-and-run job you did with my virginity with anyone else either, but that didn\u2019t seem to stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...we\u2019re back to this. Fuckin\u2019 awesome.\u201d Dalton scooted to the edge of the bed. He yanked on his flannel pajama bottoms and a hoodie. Then he left the room without another word.</p><p>Way to go.</p><p>The thing that sucked? She knew tossing that in his face wasn\u2019t the real problem. The real problem was after totaling up the number of sexcapades for the last week, she realized she had been at Dalton\u2019s beck and call\u2014and she\u2019d sworn she wouldn\u2019t be. She had several job listings she should\u2019ve applied for that she\u2019d blown off to blow him. Her mom had returned from her latest trip and had asked several times when they could get together, but Dalton had Rory on her back too many times to even call her mother back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Face it. Your inability to say no is not Dalton\u2019s problem; it\u2019s yours. And the only person who can fix that is you.</p><p>Lying in his bed, staring at the ceiling she understood his comment about their intimacy being special wasn\u2019t a bullshit line. Things were different this time around, maybe not in a good way because it seemed to be all-consuming for both of them.</p><p>That scared her. Mostly because it wasn\u2019t scaring him.</p> <p>But that didn\u2019t alter the fact she needed to apologize. She hated that by reverting to the old Rory who lashed out, she\u2019d forced him to walk away. They\u2019d both grown past that behavior and this time it was up to her to prove it.</p><p>She slipped on his robe and wandered into the living room.</p><p>No TV. No music. Dalton wasn\u2019t staring aimlessly out the window like he sometimes did. He hadn\u2019t broken out the whiskey. In fact, she didn\u2019t see him at all.</p><p>Had he left like he\u2019d done so many times before?</p><p>Then she heard scrape scrape scrape. She peered over the edge of the kitchen counter. Dalton was on his hands and knees scraping something from the floor. She stared at him a while without speaking because she was enjoying the view.</p> <p>Get your eyes off his ass.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cDalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a childish thing to do, throwing our past history in your face. I don\u2019t even know if you did tell locker room stories back then. But it doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cSo from here on out I won\u2019t brag about how awesome you are in bed to anyone. I\u2019ll just walk around with a smug smile on my face all the time because I get to experience that awesomeness firsthand. You can call me the Mona Rory. No one will know what my secret smile means.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Then he stood and turned toward her. \u201cI appreciate the apology and I\u2019m sorry if it seems like I overreacted. What\u2019s between us is special. I don\u2019t ever want to lose sight of that or take it for granted, Rory.\u201d</p><p>When Dalton didn\u2019t come forward and hug her after that sweet confession, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna kiss and make up or anything?\u201d</p><p>A dangerous look flared in his eyes. \u201cSure we can. As long as I get to pick where to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Her sex pulsed twice\u2014the equivalent of yelling pick me, pick me!</p><p>Her cunt was such an attention whore sometimes.</p><p>She started to retreat. \u201cI thought you agreed to take a break from bom chicka wah wah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. But since your poor pussy is sore and that is my fault, I oughta kiss it all better.\u201d He stalked her. \u201cBesides didn\u2019t you call yourself the Moanin\u2019 Rory? I\u2019ll make that happen and then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mona Rory. A joke. From the Mona Lisa. Get it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. But you\u2019re gonna get it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora. Come here.\u201d His tone went from sexy and playful to sexy and demanding.</p><p>Shit. She never ever ever thought she\u2019d be the woman who\u2019d go all weak-kneed when a guy ordered her around. She never ever ever thought she\u2019d be more focused on the inflections in his voice than the words.</p><p>\u201cYou should see your eyes. They\u2019re as dark as emeralds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat definitive tone of yours is a major fucking turn-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean every word I say to you.\u201d Then Dalton was on his knees, urging her to lean against the counter, untying her robe, spreading her thighs apart.</p><p>Settling his mouth on her pussy, he undid her completely with sweetness. Gifting her with soft licks and gentle sucks. Using tenderness to soothe her tender tissues. Yet each pass of his mouth on her flesh made her hot, made her wet, made her dizzy, made her even more crazy for him.</p><p>The orgasm spun Rory completely out of orbit. Dalton\u2019s tongue didn\u2019t go wild when she started to come. He kept the easy cadence, alternating soft sucks of his lips with slow, long licks, drawing out the throbbing until her knees gave out.</p><p>Then he scooped her into his arms and carried her to the couch.</p><p>No man had ever just handled her like that. Whenever Dalton picked her up, like she was a normal sized girl and not a gigantic freak, she felt petite. Coddled. Protected. Something she\u2019d never known she\u2019d wanted. And he gave it to her without asking.</p><p>\u201cHow about if we take a break and watch some TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She curled into him. After thirty minutes of mind-numbing poker, Rory began to drift off. Half-sleepily she said, \u201cYou never answered my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnal sex.\u201d</p><p>His body stilled. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you expecting it from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to sex I don\u2019t expect anything from you except honesty. If you don\u2019t like something we do, tell me. I can tell if you\u2019re into what we\u2019re doin\u2019 when I hear that sexy moan of yours.\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cYou worried I\u2019m gonna bend you over and ram my dick up your ass without warning?\u201d</p><p>Rory blushed. Then felt stupid for it. She was twenty-eight years old. This man was her lover. It was natural to discuss all sides of sex. \u201cNo. Well, maybe. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo guy you\u2019ve been with has tried to sweet-talk you into giving him a sample of this sweet ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. And I\u2019ve never been the adventurous type who\u2019d just announce to a lover, hey you know what would mix it up tonight? If we tried anal. I\u2019ll grab the lube and a corncob for a practice run.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. \u201cWell, don\u2019t kid yourself that you\u2019re not sexually adventurous if you\u2019re willing to stick a corncob up your butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea where that came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about let\u2019s not dig too deeply into that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat said, any time you want to try a little back door lovin\u2019, I\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had experience with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with you and that\u2019s all that matters to me. If you\u2019re asking if I can make it good for you?\u201d His mouth brushed her ear and he breathed, \u201cOh yeah, baby, I can make it great for you.\u201d</p><p>During a commercial break, Dalton said, \u201cWe probably better come up with something we can do together besides sex. Like a hobby.</p><p>Rory gasped dramatically. \u201cSo riding the hobbyhorse isn\u2019t a real hobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShocking, I know,\u201d he said dryly. Then he pressed a kiss to her temple. \u201cStay with me tonight. I won\u2019t try and have my wicked way with you. I just sleep better when you\u2019re in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Say no. Retain your head, girl. Retain some control.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dalton studied her patiently.</p><p>She could\u2019ve said she needed to spend time with her mom, which wasn\u2019t a lie. By not giving him a concrete reason for saying no, she reiterated her position\u2014their lives weren\u2019t completely intertwined.</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue; he couldn\u2019t when he\u2019d told her he no longer offered justifications for his decisions to anyone, but she sensed his disappointment. And her supposed victory felt a little hollow.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Dalton had made progress updating the kitchen. He\u2019d removed the melamine countertops and ordered marble laminate countertops that\u2019d be delivered next week. He\u2019d installed a deeper stainless steel sink. He\u2019d painted the walls a khaki green, weird for a kitchen in his opinion, but it was what Sierra wanted. Good thing she\u2019d color coordinated everything because he sure wouldn\u2019t have picked half the oddball colors.</p><p>He\u2019d cracked a beer and was about to hang the refaced cabinet doors when someone knocked at his door.</p><p>His heart skipped a beat. His cock stirred\u2014it had a mind of its own when it came to Rory\u2014his brain roared MINE, and his body set out to prove it.</p><p>He opened the door with, \u201cBaby, I\u2019ve told you that you don\u2019t have knock.\u201d Except it wasn\u2019t Rory on the threshold but his cousin Ben. \u201cHey, Ben. Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as long as you promise to never ever call me baby again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d He stepped back to let him in. \u201cAm I on the family\u2019s shit list and they sent the peacemaker to talk some sense into me?\u201d</p><p>Ben shook his head and handed Dalton a paper bag that held a six-pack. He hung his black Carhartt on the coat tree Rory had bought for him earlier this week. \u201cAre you telling me none of our other cousins have been over to see you?\u201d</p><p>Dalton moved into the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re the first.\u201d He opened the bag and fished out two bottles of Moose Drool beer. \u201cYou joining me for a cold one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He took the beer from Dalton but his gaze was taking in the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some major renovation goin\u2019 on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too much actually. Person that owns this house is trading rent for my fixer-upper skills. She buys the materials and I follow the unending lists of what I need to do. Keeping me busy so far.\u201d Dalton pulled out a chair and sat.</p><p>Ben followed suit. \u201cLooks good. You gonna be here long enough to do the whole house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were so handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cLike most things I\u2019ve had to learn on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is it a new skill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of it. But I gutted the trailer after I moved into it years ago. Learned more from screwing up than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya.\u201d Ben frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t remember if I\u2019ve ever been inside your old trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. Didn\u2019t have drop by visits from anyone back then either.\u201d</p><p>Ben leaned back in his chair. \u201cFill me in on what\u2019s been goin\u2019 on in Dalton\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat friend of yours, Boden? I kept in touch with him during my travels. When they lost their hunting guide last year before the opening of hunting season, I stepped in. Been in Montana ever since.\u201d Moping, as Sierra had pointed out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhoa. How\u2019d you and Boden get to be friends?\u201d</p><p>Dalton looked Ben in the eye. \u201cAt the Rawhide Club.\u201d</p><p>That shocked his cousin. \u201cWait. Are you a member?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuest.\u201d Dalton\u2019s face heated as it did every time he thought about how he\u2019d reacted after seeing something he hadn\u2019t understood. \u201cLook, Ben, that\u2019s the most humiliating thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2014calling your brothers and staging an intervention about your sex life. Not even walkin\u2019 out on my own wedding holds a candle to that boneheaded moment in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta know that\u2019s been over and done with for a long time.\u201d He sipped his beer. \u201cSo the club must\u2019ve made an impression on you if you\u2019re still goin\u2019 there...six years later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe place\u2014the whole situation opened my eyes. So a few months after you resigned from the club, I went in and ended up talkin\u2019 to Layla.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 about you or Ainsley. That wasn\u2019t why I went in. I wanted to understand more about that lifestyle choice \u2019cause it was pretty fucking obvious I didn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd? What\u2019d you learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything I learned different strokes for different folks.\u201d</p><p>Ben choked on his beer and Dalton laughed.</p><p>\u201cGot ya there, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually I learned there ain\u2019t no one-size-fits-all sexual playbook. I stopped in and I took in scenes, figuring I\u2019d try them out in the privacy of my own bed. I assumed once I had the right sex moves down I wouldn\u2019t have to try so hard with women. I\u2019d be a killer lay.\u201d Dalton shook his head. \u201cJesus. This is really embarrassing to admit, so just tell me to shut the fuck up and we can go back to kitchen remodeling.\u201d</p> <p>Ben shook his head. \u201cKeep talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Dalton chugged most of his beer. \u201cWithout goin\u2019 into specifics, I\u2019ve been in some pretty fucked up situations with women over the years. I never quite...got it. Hell, I even hooked up with a lesbian for a while so she could teach me about women. Didn\u2019t work. I think she knew less about what women wanted than I did.\u201d</p><p>Ben chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not qualifying this, but I never participated in any activities at the Rawhide. Not out of fear, or worry about bein\u2019 judged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why abstain? It is a sex club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when it came to sex I\u2019d always acted first and didn\u2019t consider the results of my actions until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you come to that realization?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Tell and Georgia got married in Vegas. Hot women were coming on to me only because they thought I had money. When I got back home, I realized women were coming on to me because my last name was McKay. Or some women were avoiding me because of my shitty reputation as a wannabe player.\u201d He felt like such a fucking pussy talking about this shit with his cousin Bennett, legendary Dominant.</p> <p>Ben leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m not judging you. Anything you tell me stays between us, okay? And it seems to me you need someone to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Now that Rory was in the picture, he didn\u2019t want to screw this up with her. \u201cSo I needed to rethink my entire approach to women, to sex, and what I wanted out of it. That\u2019s why I went to the club a couple years later again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what did you learn about yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more tolerant than I believed I could be. Watchin\u2019 some of those scenes just reinforced my stance that I\u2019ll never use a flogger on a woman, or a whip, or a strap.\u201d A shudder of revulsion rolled through him, though he tried like hell to repress it. \u201cI doubt I\u2019d even be interested in playful spanking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cJust not my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t all of it, Dalton.\u201d Then he pulled out the Dom voice. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>First time he\u2019d heard that tone from Bennett. He sighed. \u201cIf I tell you, you gotta understand I\u2019m not lookin\u2019 for pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve got me concerned.\u201d</p><p>Where in the hell did he even start this? Better to just barf it out upfront. \u201cCasper...used to beat me with a strap. Started when I was seven and ended after I got bigger than him. He did it in private and embarrassment kept me from telling anyone. Every time Casper lit into me with that leather, he recounted all the things wrong with me and what I\u2019d done wrong, so it was physical and verbal abuse.\u201d</p><p>Ben stayed quiet for several moments. \u201cChrist, Dalton, is that why you freaked out when you saw me usin\u2019 the whip on a member in the club?\u201d</p><p>Dalton couldn\u2019t meet Ben\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah. The only experience I had with any type of beating was forced, so I didn\u2019t understand why someone would want to get whipped. Nor did I understand that not all people who wield the whip are sadistic bastards. I associated any hitting with shame and the strong preying on the weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need another goddamned beer,\u201d Ben said and took out two bottles, passing one to Dalton.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if Uncle Charlie had used the \u2018spare the strap, spoil the child\u2019 philosophy on you or your brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But I can see why you\u2019d think my former whip expertise stemmed from dealing with childhood trauma.\u201d He pointed his beer bottle at Dalton. \u201cKinda like you used to act out by getting into all them dust ups with any guy who looked at you crossways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a fucked up need to prove I could defend myself\u2014probably why I instigated half of the fights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only time I remember my dad raising his hand to one of us was when Chase was five. He ran out in front of the tractor when Dad was picking up hay bales. Dad jumped outta the cab so fast, grabbed Chase by one arm and spanked the living crap out of him. Me\u2019n Quinn were shocked. Then Dad knelt in the dirt and got right in Chase\u2019s face. Talked to him, hugged the shit out of him and made him sit in the cab with him for the rest of the day. Which was the worst sort of punishment for Chase.\u201d Ben paused. \u201cYour brothers didn\u2019t know when it was goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>Dalton picked at the label of his beer bottle. \u201cOne night after too many shots of Jagermeister I told Tell about Casper\u2019s random whippings when I was a kid. Shocked him because Casper used to smack me in front of them sometimes and Tell thought that\u2019s all there was to it. Sounds fun, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even remotely.\u201d Ben seemed to chug half his beer. \u201cYour mom wasn\u2019t aware of what was goin\u2019 on in her own house?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Ben. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go on in the house and it never happened when she was home. My fuckin\u2019 big-mouthed brother Tell spilled his guts about it to her after I told him.\u201d He drained his beer and twisted the cap on a new one. \u201cThe next day she tracked me down and...\u201d That was one of the worst days of Dalton\u2019s life. Seeing his mother crumble. It\u2019d crushed him knowing she\u2019d carry guilt that wasn\u2019t her burden to bear. Especially seeing her broken after witnessing her transformation into a stronger, independent woman after she\u2019d left Casper. Which was why Dalton wouldn\u2019t tell her about his conversation with Casper three years ago. It would shatter her all over again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame you for not bein\u2019 the forgive and forget type when it comes to him. Do your brothers expect that from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re havin\u2019 a hard time forgiving me for bein\u2019 almost completely out of touch for three years. Now that I\u2019m here...I don\u2019t wanna sit in Casper\u2019s room for hours on end while he glares at me and refuses doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad said the same thing after he visited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Casper wonders why he doesn\u2019t have hardly any visitors.\u201d He swigged his beer. \u201cI assumed the cousins are still pissed off at me because they think I took off three years ago and left my brothers holding the bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoldin\u2019 the bag.\u201d Ben snorted. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for anyone besides me\u2019n Quinn, but we never saw it that way. No one blinked when Chase took off for different pastures. Or when Carter did. Or when Cam did. Brandt and Tell ain\u2019t been suffering from work overload bein\u2019s that Jessie and Georgia are sharing part of their daily work.\u201d</p><p>Dalton sighed. \u201cHow\u2019d we get on this subject anyway? I thought we were talkin\u2019 about my life in Montana. You and Ainsley ever been up to Boden\u2019s hunting lodge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He\u2019s invited us to visit but it\u2019s never fit into our schedule. Boden\u2019s not a cattle man so he doesn\u2019t understand calving.\u201d He stood. \u201cLook, I\u2019m glad you told me about this stuff even though it burns my ass that you went through it alone, say nothin\u2019 of when you were a little kid. Obviously in your time away you found a way to deal with it, or heal from it or whatever.\u201d Ben\u2019s eyes were somber. Conflicted. \u201cLemme know if you wanna talk. Or if you need an extra hand with the handyman stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He slipped on his coat. \u201cOh, heads up in two weeks we\u2019re playing poker at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas Hold\u2019em?\u201d</p><p>Ben snorted. \u201cRegular poker. Not that made-for-TV game that relies on luck, not card skill.\u201d</p><p>If Dalton had a buck for every time he\u2019d heard that. Wait. He did\u2014from playing Texas Hold\u2019em with guys who had that same attitude. He took their money and smiled. \u201cWho\u2019s we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the cousins. Been a while and I figured we could gauge if your public tournament loss changed the way you play.\u201d</p><p>It had changed him. Not only in the way he played cards, but how he could strip everything down to the basics. Cut and run if he needed to, or bluff his way into a better position if need be. \u201cI\u2019m in. But I don\u2019t wanna hear any bitching when I clean all you guys out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair! You\u2019re cheating.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow is it cheating, Rory?\u201d</p><p>She swung the Wii remote and smacked the onscreen tennis ball, sending it way out of bounds. Her avatar hung her head in shame when the scorekeeper announced Dalton\u2019s doubles team had won the match. She looked over at the man.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAnother game? Or you wanna play something else? We haven\u2019t tried out that fantasy quest one yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me think about it.\u201d Rory flopped on the couch. She never dreamed that playing virtual tennis would make her physically tired. She\u2019d worked up a sweat. But so had Dalton so she didn\u2019t feel like an out of shape couch potato.</p><p>She\u2019d been very resistant when Dalton had bought the Wii. Growing up, she\u2019d never played video games. She\u2019d secretly scoffed at those who did, thinking they oughta get a life. But Dalton had insisted she try a couple of the programs before passing judgment. And yeah, she\u2019d gone into it expecting she\u2019d hate it. But she hadn\u2019t. Not at all. The games were fun, a great way to blow off steam, get her body moving and spend time with Dalton doing something new and different\u2014besides checking off sexual positions in the Kama Sutra.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t gloated and said I-told-you-so. He\u2019d just reminded her they used to play games and make believe as kids. Then he\u2019d picked up an extra unit for her place so they each had one.</p><p>So maybe Rory had been secretly practicing so she didn\u2019t get trounced every time, at every game.</p><p>Dalton had mad gaming skills, but not because he was one of those single men addicted to a virtual life. In college she\u2019d dated a few guys who\u2019d rather play online than play with her. Having a Wii hadn\u2019t cooled Dalton\u2019s libido at all\u2014the man admitted he was addicted to her and proved it at least once a day. Had he ever proved it this morning before she\u2019d gone to work. Just thinking about the heat and the intensity sent blood rushing to her face.</p> <p>\u201cI recognize that look,\u201d he said, sitting beside her.</p><p>Rory reached up and brushed the damp hair from his forehead. \u201cThe look where I\u2019m thinking back to how you rocked my world in the predawn hours and started my day with a bang?\u201d Her fingertips followed the contours of his sigh-worthy face. His smooth face. She loved the little things he did for her\u2014like shaving later in the day so she didn\u2019t end up with beard burn when he kissed her, wherever he kissed her, because his mouth was on her a lot.</p><p>\u201cBeen reliving that a time or two hundred all day myself.\u201d Then he plucked her up and settled her across his lap, wrapping his arms around her. \u201cSo did whacking a tennis ball relieve your stress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of it.\u201d She\u2019d had a horrible day. Hannah had been a nightmare, barging in her office at least a dozen times, demanding explanations on reports Rory had filed months ago. Stupid, busywork questions that Hannah could\u2019ve found the answers to herself if she\u2019d bothered to look.</p><p>Even though Rory understood the disruptions were Hannah\u2019s bitchy reminders that she still retained dominion, it was annoying. Rory\u2019s tongue should\u2019ve been bruised from biting it so many times. Plus, Hannah\u2019s continual interruptions had put Rory further behind on her current project\u2014which Hannah also knew. After having autonomy with this project, Rory realized it\u2019d be hell working with Hannah again.</p><p>Hopefully she\u2019d get a callback from one of the other places she\u2019d applied the past few weeks. Problem was, even if she got offered her dream job, she couldn\u2019t accept it until she finished this special project.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful quiet, sugarplum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost in bad workday thoughts. Thank you for coming over to try and chase them away.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cNowhere I\u2019d rather be than with you. If you\u2019re still needing a distraction, I have an idea on how to force them ugly work thoughts right outta your pretty head.\u201d</p><p>Rory straddled Dalton\u2019s thighs, tucking her knees by his hips as she faced him. \u201cForce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoax,\u201d he corrected, placing a kiss on the center of her chest. \u201cDamn. You always smell good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m sweaty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my sodium intake is dangerously low today.\u201d He parted his lips and dragged his mouth across her collarbone. \u201cYou taste good too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep that up, McKay, and you know what\u2019ll happen next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019ll be even sweatier wearing a big ol\u2019 smile.\u201d</p><p>Rory tipped his head back and ran her fingers though his hair. \u201cAnything interesting happen in your world today? Did HGTV stop by and offer you a home improvement show?\u201d</p><p>Dalton snorted. \u201cNo, but my cousin Ben did drop in.\u201d</p><p>Not that she\u2019d ever say anything to him, but it bothered her that few of Dalton\u2019s McKay relatives had stopped by to see him. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo say hello and invite me to a family poker game a week from next Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes. Gonna school them.\u201d He twisted a piece of her hair around his index finger. \u201cSo you know how we\u2019ve been all social and stuff lately? I was lookin\u2019 in the paper to see what\u2019s goin\u2019 on this weekend and I saw that next weekend there\u2019s a poker tournament in Deadwood. Thought it might be fun if we rented a room Friday and Saturday night. I haven\u2019t played in a while so I figured I could brush up on my skills and we could make a weekend of it. Eat out. Hang out. Have lots of wild, kinky, loud hotel room sex.\u201d</p><p>Rory grinned. \u201cI\u2019m in as long as you\u2019re not expecting me to enter the tournament.\u201d</p><p>Dalton actually looked horrified at that prospect. \u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. So if I\u2019m arm candy for a high roller, should I plan on wearing my skankiest outfits? Wouldn\u2019t it be fun if people thought I was a hooker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Rory. That\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is.\u201d She shifted her hips side to side across his groin. \u201cWe could even play the gambler and the whore.\u201d She rubbed her tits under his chin. \u201cAfter all, it is Deadwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make reservations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Kyler there when Ben stopped by?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cHe called to let me know he couldn\u2019t help out today. He has a big history project due. But he did say to pass along his thanks that we went to his game last weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was really sweet that you wanted to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. You\u2019re such a sweet, thoughtful man.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks reddened. \u201cStop. You\u2019re about to get a demonstration of my not-so-sweet side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game.\u201d Rory teased his lips with hers. \u201cWant me to get out the handcuffs, blindfold and anal lube?\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou bought anal lube?\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cNope. Just wanted to see your reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re not gonna get the reaction you\u2019d hoped for, jungle girl.\u201d Dalton pinned her to the couch and started tickling her.</p><p>\u201cDalton!\u201d</p><p>He teased her and tickled her until she was laughing and yelling at him to stop. Just when she caught her breath, he\u2019d start in again. The crazy man used to tickle her all the time when they were kids so he knew her most ticklish spots.</p><p>Jingle started barking and Rory seized Dalton\u2019s distraction to squirm away from him. \u201cI swear I\u2019m gonna pay you back for this when you least expect it.\u201d</p><p>But Dalton wasn\u2019t looking at her. Rory turned and saw her mother standing by the front door. She scooted upright and straightened her clothes. \u201cMom? What are you doing here?\u201d What was up with people just barging into her private space without knocking today?</p><p>Her mom eyed Dalton before meeting Rory\u2019s gaze. \u201cSorry I just walked in. I didn\u2019t know you had company.\u201d</p><p>Bull. Dalton\u2019s truck was parked right outside.</p><p>Dalton said, \u201cHey Mrs. D.,\u201d and put his arm around Rory.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen or heard from you for a couple of days so I wanted to make sure you were all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, besides my shitty workday. I ended up working late tonight and Dalton was sweet enough to bring me supper.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and kissed her forehead. \u201cI like takin\u2019 care of you.\u201d</p><p>Man. Could he act any more proprietary?</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d Her mother pointed to the revamped doggie door. \u201cIs that your doing too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t it awesome?\u201d Rory answered. \u201cCold air poured in and Jingle had problems with it closing around her. Dalton fixed it for me, which was such a great surprise.\u201d Rory didn\u2019t tell her mom she nearly burst into tears after seeing Dalton\u2019s handiwork. He knew how much her dog meant to her and he couldn\u2019t have picked a more romantic gesture.</p><p>Her mom said, \u201cThat was really nice of you, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t a big thing. Just swapping out the seal and tweaking it here and there.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I won\u2019t keep you. I brought you a loaf of pumpkin bread since it\u2019s your favorite.\u201d</p><p>Rory stood and walked over to her mom, giving her a hug. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ve been bragging to Dalton how delicious your pumpkin bread is, so I might not get to eat the whole loaf myself this time.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI can always make more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, before I forget, can you keep an eye on Jingle next weekend? Dalton is taking me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided,\u201d Dalton inserted. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a romantic surprise for her.\u201d</p><p>Why had he said that?</p><p>\u201cSounds fun. Have a good night.\u201d Then her mom left.</p><p>After she left, Dalton said, \u201cGood thing I hadn\u2019t gone with my first idea and stripped your pants off to tickle you with my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Rory set the bread on the counter. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell her we\u2019re going to Deadwood?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton turned her to face him. \u201cBecause tellin\u2019 your mama that I\u2019m takin\u2019 you to Deadwood, when she knows I\u2019ve been a professional gambler doesn\u2019t sound near as romantic as it\u2019s gonna be.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cIt\u2019s late and I woke you up pretty early this morning, so I should go.\u201d</p><p>She cut the loaf of bread in half and handed it to him. \u201cHere. For breakfast tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sharing your precious pumpkin bread with me?\u201d He kissed her and grinned. \u201cI think you\u2019re beginning to like me a little.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe just a little.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWas that hard to admit?\u201d</p><p>She gave a mock shudder. \u201cExcruciating.\u201d</p><p>Dalton wasn\u2019t looking forward to his old friend Reggie\u2019s bachelor party. Maybe it made him pussy whipped, but he\u2019d much rather be with Rory.</p><p>In the last week he and Rory had found common interests besides their sexual compatibility. They challenged each other at Wii games ranging from marksmanship to body balance to bowling. They\u2019d also done more normal dating things\u2014although they were well beyond mere dating in Dalton\u2019s mind. They\u2019d sampled a few local restaurants. They\u2019d gone grocery shopping, which they quickly learned they both hated. One night they\u2019d gone out to listen to a band at the Twin Pines. They\u2019d danced, had a few drinks and had run into a million people they both knew. No one seemed surprised he and Rory were together. His old pals were more surprised they hadn\u2019t seen him out and about in the month he\u2019d been back.</p> <p>After living in the Montana wilderness, where he\u2019d purposely isolated himself, he realized he couldn\u2019t do that all the time in his hometown. Now that they\u2019d seen him out with Rory, his former drinking buddies had been pestering him to hang out. Dalton knew he\u2019d come across as a self-righteous reformed dick if he told them his barhopping, strip-club-visiting days were behind him. So he\u2019d said yes when Reggie had asked him to stop by his bachelor party.</p><p>He plastered on a smile as he entered the private back room at the Golden Boot. He\u2019d stay for an hour\u2014max. Congratulate his buddy on his upcoming wedding, offer to buy him a shot and then bail.</p><p>He\u2019d crashed bachelor and bachelorette parties over the years in this room. Odd to think the last one he\u2019d attended here had been his own. Talk about tame. No strippers. No porn. No open bar. Dalton didn\u2019t recall much from that night\u2014not because he\u2019d drank to excess. He\u2019d ended up sitting in the corner with Leif West\u2014who\u2019d tagged along to the party as Chet and Remy\u2019s guest\u2014discussing Las Vegas gaming. Since Leif lived in Vegas, he had a completely different take on gambling, which Dalton had found fascinating.</p><p>So the big whoop-de-do for the last single McKay had fizzled out by eleven p.m.</p><p>\u201cDalton! Over here.\u201d</p><p>He turned to see Lee Anderson waving at him. As he crossed the room, he accepted a drink from the tiniest cocktail waitress he\u2019d ever seen. She was the size of a twelve-year-old girl\u2014the top of her head barely reached his sternum\u2014and he wondered how in the hell she didn\u2019t tip over with her massive tits weighting her top half. Since she was scantily dressed in sparkly green, she reminded him of a slutty leprechaun. He heard his name again and looked up. When he looked down to excuse himself, she\u2019d vanished.</p> <p>Lee clapped him on the back. \u201cGlad you could make it. Me\u2019n Tick and Busby were beginning to think you didn\u2019t want nothin\u2019 to do with us no more, bein\u2019s you\u2019ve been back in town for a while and we haven\u2019t heard from you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton knocked back a swallow of booze. \u201cAw, I didn\u2019t know you missed me so much. Didn\u2019t mean to butt hurt your poor wittle feewings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d Lee grinned. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy to see you ain\u2019t changed a whole lot in the past few years.\u201d</p><p>And there it was. The reason he hadn\u2019t wanted to come. That whole you-haven\u2019t-changed-a-bit bullshit. \u201cWhere is Busby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. So whatcha been up to? We heard you were living on the streets in Vegas after you lost that poker game on TV,\u201d Tick said.</p><p>Dalton rolled his eyes. \u201cWho\u2019d you hear that from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remember now. But you ain\u2019t been back forever. You know how them rumors go if you ain\u2019t around to set \u2019em straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set the record straight now.\u201d He gave the bare bones version of his life. A few more guys from their graduating class joined their group, ragging on Dalton for missing their ten-year reunion. Busby showed up with two more \u201cfriends\u201d both sporting tits the size of basketballs, collagen lips and vacant eyes. The room was getting crowded, yet Dalton\u2019s glass never dipped below the half-full mark.</p> <p>The groom arrived and after being subjected to a speech about the horrors of marriage, he was dragged front and center for wedding night tips by Busby\u2019s friends.</p><p>All eyes were on the makeshift stage. As soon as the strippers had finished torturing Reggie, other guys pulled out their wallets to get in on the action.</p><p>Dalton didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Truman slipped in beside him and rested his elbows on the table. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not in line for a lap dance, McKay. Strippers used to be your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey used to be your thing too, Truman. So why aren\u2019t you in line?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot my thing anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot mine either.\u201d Dalton sipped his drink. \u201cYou think any of these married guys will tell their wives they paid a strange chick with monster tits to grind on them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. We both know they\u2019re gonna go home and swear up and down there weren\u2019t strippers at this bachelor party.\u201d Truman shot him a sideways glance. \u201cThe only bachelor party that I\u2019ve ever been to that didn\u2019t have strippers? Yours. And who\u2019d believe that of stripper-loving Dalton McKay?\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. \u201cPoint taken. So did you have strippers at your bachelor party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t have a party. Didn\u2019t do any of the normal wedding stuff with Addie after you...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cWe opted for small.\u201d</p><p>The cocktail waitress, aka\u2014the backup stripper, stood in front of Dalton and rested her enormous rack on the bar. Yeah, he looked\u2014hard to miss those gigantic blobs of flesh when they were right in his fucking face.</p><p>She cooed, \u201cWhy the frown? You want a lap dance but don\u2019t wanna wait in line?\u201d She smiled and dragged a long red fingernail across her cleavage. \u201cHow about if I put a smile on that handsome face of yours, slick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Dalton asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cTwenty for a five-minute dance. Forty if you want me to face you and let you touch these.\u201d She cupped her breasts.</p><p>\u201cPass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d she purred. \u201cWhat these hips can do puts these girls\u2019 lame moves to shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass,\u201d he said again.</p><p>She might\u2019ve muttered cheap bastard under her breath as she stomped away.</p><p>Truman laughed. \u201cWell, you may not want them, but the strippers are still flocking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlocking,\u201d he repeated with a laugh. \u201cMore like fleecing. Nothin\u2019 more attractive than a drunk man with an open wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCynical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to think of it as mature.\u201d</p><p>Dalton had fun providing running commentary to Truman as they watched the strippers working the room. At one point they were laughing so hard a couple guys still in line gave them dirty looks.</p><p>After about an hour, Truman picked up his glass. \u201cHow can this be magically full again?\u201d</p><p>Dalton squinted at the table in front of them after he saw a flash of green. Had that leprechaun chick been sneaking under the table and filling their glasses?</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is in this drink?\u201d Truman asked. \u201cI swear I\u2019ve had one and it feel like five. Shit. I\u2019m buzzed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Truman shoved the glass away. \u201cMan. I gotta eat something and sober up. I\u2019d never hear the end of it if I had to call my pregnant wife to haul my drunken ass home after a bachelor party.\u201d He clapped Dalton on the shoulder. \u201cGreat seein\u2019 you, McKay. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re sticking around.\u201d</p><p>What? Wait. When had he said that?</p><p>Maybe he was drunker than he thought.</p><p>Used to be Dalton loved the happy buzz he got after several drinks. The happy place where he knew the people around him were his true friends. The happy place where he knew the women were laughing at his jokes because he was one damn funny man. The happy place where he knew he\u2019d found his place.</p><p>But Dalton wasn\u2019t feeling any of that now.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t who he was anymore.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t wait to get the hell out of here.</p><p>Dalton ducked out of the backroom and into the hallway. He had to close one eye because everything was so blurry. He slumped against the wall.</p><p>Fuck being drunk. He hated this. No fucking wonder he never did this stupid shit anymore.</p><p>He patted his pocket and found his cell phone. By holding his phone right up to his face he could sort of read the names. Selecting the one he wanted, he poked the Call button. \u201cHey. Sorry to do this to you but I\u2019m at the Golden Boot and I\u2019m really drunk and I need a ride so can you come and get me right now please? Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and stumbled outside to wait for his ride.</p><p>The caller ID on Rory\u2019s phone read Sierra. \u2019Bout damn time that little shit called her. Rory answered with, \u201cLemme guess; boy troubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Sierra said by way of greeting. \u201cI don\u2019t only call you when I\u2019ve got guy problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not. Anyway, it\u2019s not my guy that\u2019s giving me problems. It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got a phone call from Dalton. A very drunk Dalton. He\u2019s at the Golden Boot and needs a ride home.\u201d</p><p>Rory frowned. \u201cWhy would he call you in Arizona to give him a ride home in Wyoming?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.

So please don\u2019t ream him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Unless he\u2019s the drunken, belligerent Dalton I used to wanna punch in the face.

In fact, that was a great idea.</p><p>\u201cI was kidding.\u201d A pause. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not seriously thinking of doing that, Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He did it to me.\u201d Twice. \u201cSee if he likes being used for sex and then discarded?\u201d she volleyed back.</p> <p>\u201cSista, please. Even back then it was more than sex between you and Dalton and you know it.\u201d Sierra paused. \u201cI think you both might\u2019ve forgotten that there\u2019s always been more between you two. Anyway, you aren\u2019t a mean girl, a vindictive woman or a badass seeker of revenge.\u201d</p><p>Her inner bad girl flipped Sierra off with both fingers and cranked up the Joan Jett tunes.</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t a doormat either.\u201d Sierra belted out the first three lines of I Will Survive and laughed hysterically.</p><p>\u201cThanks for nothing, little sis. Your pep talk sucked as much as your singing. And you still owe me a phone call where I can properly grill you for hours on boys, boozing and the rumors about the mysterious businesses you\u2019re involved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamned gossipy McKay family,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll call you next week. Later.\u201d She hung up.</p><p>Rory had no idea what shape she\u2019d find Dalton in when she reached the Golden Boot twenty minutes later. The parking lot was nearly full, forcing her to park at the far end of the lot.</p><p>The cold night air sliced through her as she walked around the corner to the front entrance. There he was, leaning against the building with his coat pulled up around his ears.</p><p>Dalton looked up at her approach. His smile...damn that smile of his. Even his drunken, lopsided grin was a sight to behold.</p> <p>Kudos to herself for not morphing into a snarky bitch when she said, \u201cLittle too much liquid fun, McKay?\u201d She jammed her hands in her pockets even when her fingers itched to smooth back his charmingly messy hair.</p><p>\u201cMy beautiful Rory. Thank you for comin\u2019 to get me. I\u2019m, ah, a little drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d When she got closer she smelled it too. \u201cYou okay to walk or should I bring the car around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably need to walk it off.\u201d Dalton stepped away from the building and swayed.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there, cowboy.\u201d She grabbed his arm and draped it over her shoulder. \u201cLemme help you.\u201d</p><p>His balance was way off so Rory half-pushed him and half-pulled him through the gravel parking lot to her Jeep. She propped him up on the passenger side wondering how she\u2019d wrestle him in. But he climbed in as if he were perfectly sober.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Didn\u2019t intend to end up this way. I hate bein\u2019 drunk.\u201d</p><p>She backed out of her parking spot. \u201cSo what were you doing at the bar tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReggie\u2019s bachelor party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve had a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Saw a bunch of people I used to know. Most of \u2019em were getting drunk and acting stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t act stupid. Except for the leprechaun thing.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck? \u201cLeprechaun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Leprechaun cocktail waitress. Think she was a stripper too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess they\u2019re hard up for chicks to strip in Wyoming if they\u2019re hiring leprechauns,\u201d she said dryly. Then she grinned. She was so going to lord this conversation over him. Maybe she\u2019d even speak with a brogue. Dance an Irish jig while she served him Lucky Charms.</p><p>\u201cThey shoulda asked you to be a stripper,\u201d Dalton slurred. \u201cYou\u2019d make a great stripper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to be a stripper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re flexible. But mostly because you\u2019ve got the body for it. Goddamn do I love your body. I just wanna put my hands all over it. Then my mouth. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening when I\u2019m behind the wheel in a moving vehicle, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t want you stripping for anyone but me. No other man gets to see you nekkid. Ever. So no stripping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. Now my lap dancing skills will go to waste.\u201d</p><p>Dalton made that growling noise. \u201cWhere the fuck did you learn to lap dance?\u201d</p><p>Not going there. \u201cDid one of the strippers treat you to a lap dance tonight?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cOne tried, but when I told her I wasn\u2019t interested, she moved on to the next victim.\u201d He hiccupped. \u201cJesus, my head is spinning like a fucking washin\u2019 machine.\u201d</p><p>Rory snickered. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t have been drinking so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. Know what sucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shitty way you\u2019re gonna feel in the morning?\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cThat too. What sucks is that I don\u2019t do this kinda shit anymore. And by getting hammered in the most popular bar in town, everyone still thinks I\u2019m the same drinkin\u2019 and fightin\u2019 and fuckin\u2019 around guy. But I\u2019m not that guy anymore. And I didn\u2019t like that guy very much. So why the fuck did he show up tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure that old Dalton was there tonight?\u201d</p><p>He looked confused. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get into a bar fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you fucking around with women including magical leprechauns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck no. I\u2019d never cheat on you, Rory. Never fucking ever. Been waiting a long goddamned time to have you. Now that you\u2019re mine, not gonna screw this up this time. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Not a combative drunk. A sweet drunk. And another sure sign he\u2019d changed. Her inner romantic did a pirouette and blew her a kiss before yelling told ya so, beyotch. She sighed. \u201cWhat sucks for me is you won\u2019t remember this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck I won\u2019t... Oh, hell. Stop the car.\u201d</p><p>Rory hit the brakes and pulled over.</p><p>\u201cGonna be sick. Shit.\u201d Dalton barely flung open the door before he started retching.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>But at least he hadn\u2019t thrown up in the car.</p><p>Like you did that night with him.</p><p>Even more awesome to be reminded of that.</p><p>She considered turning up the radio so she didn\u2019t have to listen to him hurling, but she toughed up. He kept yakking.</p><p>Finally he swiveled back around, nestled his head in the headrest and slammed the door. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to sit here a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Pretty sure there\u2019s nothin\u2019 left since I threw up my stomach lining along with everything in it.\u201d</p><p>Rory shuddered. \u201cNo color commentary necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>They were close to his place and she got him inside without much trouble.</p><p>He flopped on the bed in his room. Coat on, boots on, clothes on. Rory grabbed his wrist and pulled him upright. She lightly tapped his cheeks to get his attention. \u201cHey. Dalton. Gotta get your clothes off before you pass out.\u201d</p><p>Although his eyes were closed, he smiled. \u201cI love that you always wanna take my clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a bangin\u2019 body, McKay.\u201d First she peeled off his long black duster and he was zero help with that. Then she yanked off his left boot and then his right. She pulled the snaps on his shirt until it hung open. She couldn\u2019t help but run her palms down his pectorals. Warm. Firm. Rough. \u201cYes, you surely do have a bangin\u2019 body,\u201d she murmured. Her hands moved down his torso. She needed to undo his belt, but her fingers had another plan as they trailed across his ridged abdomen.</p><p>\u201cI hold my breath when you touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I never want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy man. If you don\u2019t breathe you\u2019ll pass out and not be able to feel anything anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe voice of reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly the romantic type, Dalton.\u201d Rory unbuckled his belt, unzipped his jeans and pushed him back on the bed so she could strip him to his boxers.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe romantic type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t show you very often, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. You deserve it. Especially from me.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThank you for picking up my drunken ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stay with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Then I\u2019ll get you hard, get myself off and leave you with your boxers around your ankles wondering what happened when you wake up alone tomorrow morning.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t even say she\u2019d stay and then just sneak out, which would be equally shitty.</p><p>Gazing into those vivid blue eyes, she brushed his hair from his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cWhere are we staying again?\u201d</p><p>Dalton bit back a laugh. Rory hadn\u2019t stopped talking since he\u2019d picked her up. He lifted their joined hands to kiss her knuckles. \u201cAt the Bullock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one on Main Street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe suite we\u2019re staying in is in a renovated building behind it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been to Deadwood. Everything is within walking distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But the fuck-me heels I\u2019m wearing at your request\u2014\u201d she shot him an arch look, \u201c\u2014aren\u2019t exactly winter sidewalk friendly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust hold on to me. I\u2019ll keep you upright.\u201d He grinned. \u201cUnless I\u2019m too busy keepin\u2019 you horizontal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so looking forward to that,\u201d she purred.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Rory gave the questions a thirty-second rest before she started in again. \u201cIs this a two-day poker tournament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s two one-night poker tournaments. Two different venues. Neither of which are at the Bullock. Which works out for us because I don\u2019t stay at the hotel where the events are held.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat seems odd and inconvenient. Have you always had that superstition?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cMostly it started when I traveled by myself and didn\u2019t want to pay the higher room cost. Didn\u2019t bother me when I split the hotel bill with Tell. So I found cheaper rooms close to the venue, because I wasn\u2019t actually in the room much. That\u2019s when I had much better luck. Don\u2019t know why that is, but I\u2019ve done it that way for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your odds of winning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than most. Tomorrow\u2019s pot is bigger so we\u2019ll see if I have to throw tonight\u2019s game so I don\u2019t have people tryin\u2019 to knock me out in the first round tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe strategy part of card playing boggles my mind.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. \u201cAt least I\u2019ve got you thinking there is strategy involved in Texas Hold\u2019em and it ain\u2019t all luck of the draw.\u201d</p> <p>Rory quit asking questions and gazed out the window.</p><p>The Black Hills were covered in snow so the drive up 385 to Deadwood was like a postcard. The setting sun reflected purple on the frosted trees and the sky. The roads were slick and the traffic was heavier than he expected.</p><p>This weekend marked the first time Dalton had brought a woman to a tournament. In years past he\u2019d taken women back to his room when the games ended, but he\u2019d never had a woman on the sidelines cheering him on. Winning or losing didn\u2019t matter to Rory\u2014she\u2019d be waiting for him regardless.</p><p>Deadwood didn\u2019t attract the big-league poker players, but the money was decent enough the mid-range players made it a destination. Those were the guys he worried about. The ones who considered Deadwood \u201ctheir\u201d town and banded together to defeat anyone new who dared to sit at the final table with them.</p><p>Rory waited in the truck while he retrieved the keys for their room. After he pulled up to the building he was glad for private parking. Deadwood appeared to be jam-packed. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s see the room. I\u2019ll come back for the luggage.\u201d</p><p>He unlocked the door and she stopped just inside the doorway. \u201cDalton. This place is awesome.\u201d</p><p>The suite of rooms wasn\u2019t decorated old west style, but modern. A living room filled with low-backed furniture that faced a gas fireplace. An eating area with a counter and barstools.</p><p>Rory disappeared around the corner and he followed her. \u201cLook at this bathroom.\u201d It had a gigantic walk-in shower with a bench and two showerheads, and the room boasted an enormous sunken tub, surrounded by opaque glass bricks.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like we can have some fun in there, huh?\u201d He took her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s see the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Rory squealed at seeing the king-sized four-poster bed and immediately jumped on it. \u201cThis has some give, which is lucky for us since you try to pound me into the mattress whenever possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a complaint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, high roller.\u201d She kicked off her shoes and sighed.</p><p>Dalton wandered to the window and peeked out to see a view of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you have to check in for the tournament?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout forty-five minutes.\u201d He\u2019d reached that antsy stage where he needed to expel his nervous energy before he started playing. He turned and Rory stood right in front of him.</p><p>She ran her hands down the lapels of his wool vest. \u201cYou look sexy as sin. With your black hat, jeans, boots and white shirt, now alls you need is a pocket watch with a gold chain, a thin cigar clamped between your teeth and you look every inch the mysterious rogue card sharp from Wild West days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBit of a fanciful image from a woman who refuses to admit her romantic side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been showing me the benefits of a little romance in my life, McKay.\u201d Rory placed her hand on his cheek. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Just ready to get goin\u2019 to the tourney. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be mad if I hung out here while you do your poker thing? You won\u2019t be there all night, right? I could just\u2014\u201d Rory pressed a kiss to the side of his neck, \u201c\u2014slip on something a little more comfortable and wait for you.\u201d</p><p>Her suggestion filled him with relief. He could get the feel for the people and the place without worrying about her. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ll get the luggage.\u201d</p><p>After he unloaded everything, Rory gave him a kiss for luck. Then she sang the chorus from \u201cThe Gambler\u201d really loud.</p><p>\u201cThanks for getting that stuck in my head,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>A few hours later Dalton brushed the snow off his shoulders and stamped the slush off his boots before he inserted the keycard into the door. Probably a good thing Rory had remained in the room. The weather sucked. Hopefully it\u2019d be better tomorrow night.</p><p>The room was quiet. No TV, although she did have the fireplace burning.</p><p>He checked the bedroom before he tracked her to the bathroom.</p><p>The lights were dimmed, music drifted from her iPod. A sugary sweet scent perfumed the air. All nice enticements, but none as enticing as his Aurora, up to her chin in bubbles, all that glorious blond hair in a messy pile on top of her head. Her cheeks were flushed from the heat, and maybe from the half-empty margarita glass in her hand. Her lips were tilted into a sultry smile. \u201cHey, five-card stud. So did you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliminated in the third to last round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Unless...that\u2019s what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cSee anyone you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne guy acted like he didn\u2019t know me, which is fine because he\u2019s an asshole. Another wanted to take me out for a drink to brag about how well he\u2019s been doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Rory sipped her drink. \u201cDid you go?\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s hungry gaze roved over her, from her soft pink mouth to her pink toes peeking out of the bubbles on the opposite end of the tub. \u201cWhen you\u2019re nekkid in a hotel room waitin\u2019 on me? Uh, no way in hell.\u201d</p><p>That curl to her lips got a whole lot sexier. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d He shucked his clothes. His cock, already onboard with the bath idea, bounced against his belly as he started to climb over the wide ledge of the tub.</p><p>Rory said, \u201cWait. Grab some drinks first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thinking.\u201d He snagged a beer and a can of premixed margarita mix out of the fridge in the bar area. He noticed two dome-covered trays on the counter. Back in the bathroom, he refilled her glass and said, \u201cDid you order room service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what time you\u2019d get back and I doubted we\u2019d want to go out for food, so I ordered in, figuring we could heat it up later.\u201d</p><p>Dalton grinned. \u201cThe only thing I wanna heat up right now is you.\u201d He threw his leg over the edge of the tub and immersed himself in sweet-scented water. He hissed. The water was hot.</p><p>\u201cFeels good, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Not as good as you\u2019re gonna feel. \u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Sitting opposite her, he set his beer aside and wrapped his hand around her ankle. \u201cHow long have you been marinating in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do before that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWandered around. Watched the fire. I might\u2019ve dozed off in that puffy bed, which is heavenly by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is ironic since we\u2019re gonna sin like motherfuckers in it.\u201d</p><p>Rory laughed.</p><p>He lifted her foot out of the water, pressed his mouth to her instep and lightly bit down.</p><p>\u201cGot a foot fetish, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if the feet in question are attached to you.\u201d He kissed her anklebone. Her instep by the ball of her foot. Then he ran his tongue across the pads of her toes.</p><p>Rory groaned softly.</p><p>He set that foot down and picked up the other. He grazed his teeth across her instep and dropped kisses on the top of her foot. He slipped his tongue between every toe.</p><p>Another soft groan.</p><p>Dalton slid his hands up her legs and floated toward her until they were groin to groin. Keeping his eyes locked on hers, his hands traveled up her body, over the curve of her hips, her belly, her ribcage, over those beautifully full breasts, her collarbones, up the column of her neck. He pulled her mouth to his, licking his way past her lips to kiss her with heat and patience, which drove her crazy. Rory wanted ferocious kisses. As much as he loved the passion that ignited in both of them so quickly, he liked the seduction.</p><p>Then he pulled back, gazed into her eyes.</p><p>Rory\u2019s wet fingers traced the outline of his lips. \u201cThis mouth...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m crazy for this mouth and all it can do.\u201d</p><p>He sucked her fingers and swirled his tongue around the tips.</p><p>She circled her legs around his hips and she canted her pelvis. She caught him off guard when she spun them around so his back was against the tub. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good with my mouth. So why don\u2019t you hop on the edge and I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d</p><p>Dalton created a mini-wave he jumped up so fast.</p><p>Rory moved in, her fingers digging into the tops of his thighs. The delicate way her breath drifted over the wet head of his cock, caused him to shiver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She fondled his balls and kissed the crease of his hip. Her lips traveled from his left hipbone to his right, straight across his shaft. Her hot little tongue licked away droplets of water on his skin as her lips headed down.</p><p>Then her mouth engulfed him.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>He cursed again when she worked him in deeper and held him there.</p><p>Rory released his cock an increment at a time until just the head remained in that warm, wet sucking haven. She repeatedly flicked her tongue over the sweet spot, her teeth holding his dick in place so he couldn\u2019t push forward or pull back. She was in total control.</p><p>And he loved every second of it.</p><p>Dalton braced his hands on the ledge and let her have her way with him. Wanting to close his eyes and lose himself in the sensations. But watching her was a huge fucking turn-on. She seriously got off on the power she had over him when his dick was in her mouth. He could see it in the feminine tilt of her lips. The dark challenge in her eyes. The little hums and moans told him that she loved winding him up tighter and tighter until he begged for her to let him unravel completely.</p><p>She jacked his shaft slowly. Then quickly. Her tongue mapped every inch of his dick from root to tip. She sucked his nuts until they were hard and tight. Then she returned to deep throating him while her thumb swept over his anus. His thighs quivered. His abdominals were straining. His vision wavered.</p><p>Motherfucking hell, could she suck cock. This was epic.</p><p>Then her finger breached his asshole and she stroked the spot inside that sent a jolt of pleasure zipping through his entire body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. So fucking close,\u201d he panted. His heart raced and he pumped his pelvis, trying to match her rhythm.</p><p>\u201cHold still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tryin\u2019... Oh, sweet lord, do that again.\u201d</p><p>Her hand stroked as rapidly on his shaft as her tongue flicked on the cockhead. Her mouth stopped long enough to say, \u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s eyes were starting to lose focus but he kept his gaze on her.</p><p>She rubbed that spot inside him; the slap slap slap sound of her hand working his cock bounced off the bathroom tile. When she used her teeth on the underside of the rim\u2014that kicked him over.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>But Rory didn\u2019t hollow her cheeks and swallow that first spurt. It landed on her lips. Then she angled back and aimed the come shooting from his cock at her tits. Milky drop after milky drop hit her creamy flesh and clung before slowly sliding down the slope of her breast.</p><p>His body shook from her intimate touch, but also from the sexy way she closed her eyes and arched back. Biting her lip and softly moaning as if she were coming.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t let up. Her hand pulled every last twitch from his cock, her finger rubbed every last pulse in his ass, and those actions together milked every last bit of seed from his balls.</p><p>Even as he struggled to regain his sanity, he stared at the uninhibited woman who took as much pleasure out of giving it as she did receiving it.</p><p>Then Rory opened those stunning green eyes. She slid her finger from his ass as her tongue darted out to capture the pearly drop of come clinging to the edge of her lips.</p> <p>Unfuckingbelievably hot.</p><p>Dalton practically leapt off the edge and on top of her. Fisting his hand in the messy topknot, he took possession of her mouth. Tasting himself, tasting the passion that exploded between them.</p><p>With his other hand he wiped his come from her chest. His fingers plucked her nipples. His palms smoothed over the heavy swells of her tits. He couldn\u2019t touch her enough. He ate at her mouth, sucked on her tongue, nibbled on her velvety lips. Then his hand followed the plane of her stomach, past the tight curls, straight down that juicy slit. He swirled his middle finger around the opening several times and pushed it inside that tight channel. The heat and slickness of her pussy already stirred his cock for round two. He fucked his finger in and out slowly, kissing her in the same purposeful way.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she said against his lips. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are wet.\u201d His mouth slid to the tip of her chin. \u201cDid you touch yourself while you were waitin\u2019 on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. God that feels so good.\u201d Rory tipped her head back, allowing full access to her neck.</p><p>He slipped in another finger, pushing a little deeper, moving a little faster. His tongue lapped at the water beaded on her skin. He released her hair to toy with her nipples. Pinching and tugging the points\u2014until her gasps became soft moans.</p><p>He swept his thumb over the edge of her pussy, stopping at her clit. \u201cI wanna hear you when you come.\u201d Then Dalton slid the pad of his thumb over that bundle of nerves, his fingers inside her rubbed her pussy wall behind her pubic bone.</p><p>Rory tensed, knowing he hadn\u2019t put his mouth on her yet and whatever he did next would send her flying.</p><p>Dalton pinched her nipple hard and latched onto the pulse point in her throat; his tongue mimicked the cadence of his stroking thumb.</p><p>A husky wail drifted from her mouth\u2014he felt the vibration on his lips as he sucked on her neck. Her body went rigid as her blood pulsed beneath his thumb and her pussy clamped down on his fingers.</p><p>Sexy as hell.</p><p>When Rory moved her head forward, Dalton backed off and slipped his fingers from her. Sliding his lips up the strong column of her neck, he rubbed his cheek along her jaw and swallowed her shallow breaths in a long kiss.</p><p>He finally released her lips and smiled. \u201cTakin\u2019 a bath with you is some fun, jungle girl.\u201d</p><p>Rory smiled back. \u201cYou know it.\u201d She snagged her margarita. \u201cWanna stay in a little longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I hardly touched my beer.\u201d He reached for it and cranked on the hot water. Then he reached for her. \u201cI love the feel of your wet body against mine.\u201d</p><p>She settled between his thighs, her back to his chest. She sighed and turned her head to kiss his jaw. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBringing me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. I just hope you\u2019re not too bored tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t stand behind you while you\u2019re at the table and offer advice?\u201d</p><p>Dalton snorted. \u201cYou already offered your advice in song form, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to admit the luck of the draw plays a part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. But card strategy and the ability to bluff are more key. There are two types of card players who win consistently.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the water she absentmindedly caressed his left thigh. \u201cWhat types are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMethodical. The ability to gauge the worth of an opponent\u2019s cards by watching the betting strategy they use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you methodical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an instinctual player. I don\u2019t figure the odds in my head of winning or losing if X card is flipped. I don\u2019t go in with a plan. I just play my gut.\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cI have had bouts of indigestion where my gut was totally off.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cThen there are the reckless players. They have some wins, but never consistent. They tend to play in local venues. So I\u2019m hoping to be playin\u2019 against a lot of players like that tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often do you bluff?\u201d</p><p>Dalton kissed the top of her head. \u201cWhenever I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an unanswerable question.\u201d He sipped his beer. \u201cWhat kind of poker player would you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoring. I wouldn\u2019t take any chances. I\u2019d be too embarrassed that I\u2019d get caught bluffing to actually try it. I\u2019m not reckless. And I don\u2019t have the math skills to be methodical.\u201d She poked his leg. \u201cI would\u2019ve guessed you were the reckless type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever when it comes to cards.\u201d Dalton put his lips on her ear. \u201cAnd not when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a bit.</p><p>Then Rory said, \u201cWhat do you see yourself doing in Sundance after you finish the house renovations?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d wondered if she would bring this up. Like he needed to have a plan. Or another job lined up. But he didn\u2019t want to talk about the elk farm possibility specifically, so he hedged. \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea, something I\u2019ve been working on. But it\u2019s out of my control, which makes me crazy.\u201d</p><p>She gasped dramatically. \u201cNo. You say you have a need for control? I never noticed it.\u201d</p><p>Dalton growled, \u201cI got a couple of ways I can remind you if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth my ideas involve rope. And you bein\u2019 nekkid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I want,\u201d he said silkily. \u201cBecause I\u2019d have the ropes. But I\u2019d make you come at least three times before I untied you.\u201d</p><p>Rory shivered and whispered, \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Setting aside his beer, he grabbed that mass of hair and angled her head to the side so his lips could barely skim the surface of her skin. \u201cYou want me to let that kinky and rougher side of myself out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been holding back with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Why? Have I left you wanting more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore hot sex with you? Absolutely. I\u2019d just hate it if you think I\u2019m some special butterfly that needs to be handled with kid gloves. When maybe...I\u2019m the type that wants to get tangled up in the net.\u201d She slowly flipped around so they were chest to chest.</p><p>Dalton cupped her chin in his hand. \u201cWe can play all the sex games you want, Aurora, but what\u2019s goin\u2019 on between us is not a game to me.\u201d He pulled her closer, taking her mouth in a savage kiss. His cock swelled and she groaned softly as it pressed into her belly. He broke the kiss to command, \u201cOutta the tub.\u201d</p><p>Rory pushed back and stood. Water and soap bubbles rolled down her lush body. She let him look his fill as she unpinned her hair and shook it free.</p><p>\u201cFucking gorgeous,\u201d he said in a low rasp.</p><p>She stepped over the edge and snagged a towel. She dried herself slowly, deliberately, her eyes held a hint of challenge. After wrapping the towel around her, she flounced out of the bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sprang out of the water. He barely ran a towel over his body before he chased after her.</p><p>She\u2019d nearly reached the bed when he tugged her towel free, leaving her naked. She whirled around and Dalton\u2019s mouth was on hers, with one hand fisted in her hair, the other clamped on her left butt cheek.</p><p>Rory\u2019s arms wreathed his neck and she kissed him with equal ferocity.</p><p>Dalton towed her to the living area and lowered her to the big couch.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we making carpet angels in front of the fireplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feelin\u2019 angelic right now, Aurora.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze briefly dropped to his cock. In one long sinuous movement, she stretched her right arm along the plush sofa until it was artistically arranged above her head. \u201cBring in the devil.\u201d</p><p>When she put her feet up on the couch, Dalton said, \u201cNo. Keep your right foot on the floor. Like that. Press your left knee into the back of the couch so I can see every inch of your pussy.\u201d As soon as she complied his mouth dried up. \u201cJesus. You\u2019re a fucking goddess.\u201d Then he dropped to his knees and buried in face in her cunt.</p><p>Rory arched up and her hands automatically landed on his head.</p><p>Dalton lifted his mouth and looked at her. \u201cNo hands on me. Next time I have to tell you I will break out the ropes.\u201d</p><p>With her arms above her head, her body was a beautiful curve from her pelvis to the tips of her fingers.</p><p>He traced her slit down to her opening and slipped two digits inside. Then he tongued her clit relentlessly until her sex spasmed against his mouth and her juices coated his face.</p><p>While she came down from that fast orgasm, he kissed the inside of her thighs. Her bikini line. The curve of her knee.</p><p>Rory propped herself up on her elbow. \u201cCrawl up here and fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Dalton scooted back, setting his left foot on the floor. Balanced on his right knee, he leaned forward and braced his left hand by Rory\u2019s head. Watching her eyes, he rolled his hips, gliding his cock along her pussy. Her wet, hot, wide-open pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? This?\u201d His shaft slid down her slick slit. He paused above the base of her pubic bone to drag the rim of his cockhead over her clit. Again and again and again.</p><p>Rory moaned. \u201cYes, that. Don\u2019t tease. Fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how flexible you are, yogi.\u201d Dalton\u2019s fingers formed a circle around her left ankle and he pushed her leg up and up until her knee was parallel with her shoulder. \u201cVery flexible.\u201d He angled his hips and pushed his cock into her to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cOmigod. That feels...\u201d She didn\u2019t finish her sentence when he started to move.</p><p>Dalton fucked her without pause. The position of her leg opened her completely, creating more skin contact when he bottomed out inside her. Every time. The slap of his body into hers, the harsh breathing, the creak of the couch surrounded him, adding to his urgency.</p><p>\u201cPush into me right...there. Yes.\u201d</p> <p>He kept his hand on Rory\u2019s leg as he pounded into her. She was so wet he had to pause before he thrust back in. \u201cArch your lower back. Yes. God that\u2019s so good.\u201d</p><p>Rory thought so too because she started to come. She threw her head back, her hair sliding off the couch; her hands balled into tight fists, her mouth went slack.</p><p>Beneath his palm, her thigh went stiff. He could feel her clenching her ass cheeks in time to the blood throbbing in her clit. The rhythmic pulls of her pussy muscles were like a silken vice around his cock, holding him in place.</p><p>He held on barely by the skin of his teeth as he rode out the storm with her.</p><p>When her limbs relaxed, he pumped into her so forcefully her body slid up the couch. His balls swung into her ass and he was done for.</p><p>He emptied himself into her, his mind blank.</p><p>But his heart? His heart was full.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The next night Rory showed up at the tournament ten minutes before it started.</p><p>After spending the day lounging around, goofing off, having sex on every piece of furniture in the hotel room, she thought she\u2019d seen all of Dalton\u2019s faces.</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s poker face scared her a little.</p><p>She didn\u2019t always have a clear line of sight to him. People walked in front of her blocking her view. But she\u2019d seen enough to notice that he defined impassive. No reaction if he won a big pile of chips. No reaction if he lost. The man was impossible to read, which was how he won the table and advanced to the next round.</p><p>During the break Rory hung back with the crowd of spectators and eliminated players, waiting to see if Dalton sought her out. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>He was a completely different person in this round than the previous round. He was friendly. Laughing. Trash talking. Very distracting. Acting as if winning was a surprise. He suckered them all in and handily walked away with that round too.</p><p>Rory paced, nerves getting the better of her during the next two rounds. If she was climbing out of her skin, how did Dalton remain so calm?</p><p>Because he\u2019s a master at masking his emotions.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t it. Was it?</p><p>One of the changes she\u2019d noticed in him was Dalton\u2019s long stretches of silence. Any other man she\u2019d call it brooding, but with him...she had no idea what was going through his head in those moments. Whenever she asked him, he smiled and deflected, just like he used to. Which made her think he hadn\u2019t changed as much as he\u2019d insisted.</p><p>The announcement for the upcoming burlesque dinner show echoed through the casino and Rory refocused.</p><p>Dalton sat at the final table in the winner-take-all cash game with a payout of forty grand. If he won, he\u2019d make more money in one night than she made in a year.</p><p>She\u2019d wondered which Dalton would play in the final game. Impassive Dalton? Jovial Dalton? Nope. Neither. The Dalton seated fourth in on the left side of the dealer seemed antsy. Other players noticed and began to watch him for a specific nervous tic that could be construed as a tell.</p><p>Maybe they should\u2019ve been paying more attention to their cards because it wasn\u2019t long before the table was down to three players.</p><p>Seeing how easily he slipped between three different personality types brought back her concerns. Did he treat her like a player to be managed in a card game? Could he gauge her mood and adjust his personality and responses accordingly? And if he was doing that, how much had he really changed?</p><p>Man, she had a crapload of doubt. And when they weren\u2019t rolling around in the sheets together, it made her wonder if they could overcome their tangled past.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter, remember? Hot sex, good times, when it\u2019s done it\u2019s done and there won\u2019t be any crying about what might\u2019ve been.</p><p>Shouts and clapping brought her out of her reverie. A bunch of people were standing around the table but she couldn\u2019t see anything.</p><p>Who\u2019d won?</p><p>Then everyone stepped away. Dalton\u2019s beaming grin was a sight to behold. No mistaking that for anything but a victorious smile.</p><p>Their eyes met. Rory recognized that look. Triumph and lust. A conquering hero hell bent on taking his prize.</p><p>So winning made him horny? Interesting.</p><p>If she was a betting woman, she\u2019d drop a C-note that Dalton would drag her back to their room as soon as possible. He\u2019d have her bent over the arm of the couch or pinned to the mattress within minutes of walking through the door.</p><p>But Rory didn\u2019t want that. Tonight she wanted to tease the beast. Sexually torment him to the point that he\u2019d fuck her with that dangerously raw edge he tended to keep hidden.</p><p>Before she delved any deeper into that fantasy, the big, broad cowboy was in her face, lifting her, spinning her in a circle. \u201cI won, I won, I won.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI see that. Remind me never to play strip poker with you. What happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta go to the cage, get my cash and give the tax man his due. Sign some papers.\u201d He stepped back and his hungry gaze took in her outfit. Cleavage-baring black bustier with a sheer pink blouse over the top. The stretchy black miniskirt clung to her ass and was about three inches shorter then she preferred. She hadn\u2019t worn hosiery, even though it was fucking freezing. She\u2019d slipped on heeled black boots that reached her knees.</p><p>Dalton made that growling noise. \u201cHow long you been walkin\u2019 around wearing that outfit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are smokin\u2019 hot. Jesus, woman. You\u2019re making me lose my train of thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this will get it back on track.\u201d She placed an openmouthed kiss on his neck above his shirt collar. \u201cGet your winnings so you can buy me dinner. I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feed you. Then I\u2019ll fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Obviously Dalton didn\u2019t care that anyone within earshot could hear him.</p><p>Rory brushed the front of her body against his. \u201cYou\u2019re hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 right I\u2019m hard. Winning always gets me hard. Add in the fact you\u2019re here with me? Lookin\u2019 like sex on legs? This hard-on ain\u2019t goin\u2019 away until I fuck you at least twice.\u201d</p><p>Pushing him to the edge wouldn\u2019t be a problem. The man was already there.</p><p>\u201cMr. McKay?\u201d a staff member inquired behind him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know. Gotta get the paperwork done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to ask if you\u2019d like to dine here. I can have a private table reserved for you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton looked at her. \u201cHow\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek. \u201cHang out by the slot machines. I\u2019ll be back in ten.\u201d</p><p>Rory wandered on the main floor. She had more fun watching people shoving nickels in the slots than doing so herself. She didn\u2019t stop for long in one place; too much restless energy. She did pause to look at a display of Old West memorabilia.</p><p>She sensed his return. Feeling his hot gaze tracking her backside, from her heeled boots up her legs. Lingering on the curve of her ass. Her hips. Her fall of hair that brushed the bottom of her shoulder blades.</p><p>Then Dalton\u2019s hands landed on her hips. He swept aside her hair and placed a very possessive kiss on the side of her neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gooseflesh broke out across her entire body and she released a soft moan.</p><p>\u201cThat moan drives me fucking insane. I wanna slip my hand under your skirt and finger you until you come. Then I\u2019d lick that sweet cream from my fingers.\u201d</p><p>Rory turned her head to nuzzle his jaw. \u201cThen I\u2019d suck it from your tongue.\u201d She actually felt his pulse jump.</p><p>\u201cJungle girl, we\u2019re gonna rip each other to pieces when we\u2019re alone.\u201d His mouth grazed her ear. \u201cAnd. I. Can\u2019t. Fucking. Wait.\u201d He punctuated each word with a kiss.</p><p>Her entire body hummed with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cBut I promised to feed you first, so let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Dalton clasped her hand and they climbed the stairs to the next level.</p><p>The host escorted them to a private table in the corner with windows on both sides.</p><p>She unrolled her silverware from her napkin and tried not to gawk. \u201cThis place is like...wow. Really upscale.\u201d</p><p>Dalton looked up from the menu. \u201cFood looks good. Since this meal is on the house, have whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>The waiter delivered bottle of champagne and poured two flutes.</p><p>Rory raised her glass. \u201cTo Dalton McKay\u2019s poker face and his incredible luck at cards.\u201d When he growled, she laughed. \u201cKidding. To your winning strategy.\u201d</p><p>They drank. Dalton refilled their glasses.</p><p>As he contemplated the menu, Rory studied him. Candle glow looked amazing on him. He\u2019d mussed up his hair during the games and she preferred that wild look. His full lips were pursed as if he was deep in thought. When he glanced up at her from beneath the brim of his black hat, she was struck anew by his rugged good looks. It\u2019d taken him longer to grow into that handsome face, but man, was it worth the wait.</p><p>\u201cSugarplum, why\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at me like you\u2019ve never seen me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re gorgeous. Every woman in this restaurant is staring at you. They\u2019re wondering what you\u2019re like in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there are women in here besides you, I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a sigh and refused to let her cynical side get a foothold and warn her it was just another line.</p><p>Dalton ordered the elk medallions with a wild mushroom and bourbon demi-glaze. Rory ordered the pumpkin ravioli in a sweet cream sauce.</p><p>After the waiter left, she glanced up at Dalton to see him staring at her with a decidedly predatory look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink anyone would notice if you hiked up your skirt and crawled onto my lap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure the entire restaurant would notice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t want anyone to see how it is between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s special?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s so scorching hot between us that watching might make their eyeballs explode.\u201d</p><p>Dalton smiled the wolfish gleam that turned the delicious curl of want inside her into a raging inferno.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI am not gonna crawl on your cock and ride you like a pony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame. Do I have other options?\u201d He drained the champagne and poured more.</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching you masturbate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here, right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Rory cocked her head. \u201cSuppose I did spread my legs and slip my fingers into my cunt to get myself off. You\u2019d still be hard and horny. How would you benefit?\u201d</p><p>Dalton plucked up her hand and rubbed the tips of his fingers on his lips. \u201cThe benefit for me is that you did what I told you. You have no idea how much I love watching you come. It\u2019s even better\u2014\u201d he kissed her fingertips, \u201c\u2014and hotter when you do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton, the list of things I won\u2019t do with you or to you or have you do to me is pretty short. But I draw the line at diddling myself between courses in a four-star restaurant.\u201d</p><p>That aw-shucks grin appeared. \u201cWorth a try.\u201d</p><p>Tempting to chuck a dinner roll at him but she resisted. \u201cCan you dial back the I need to fuck your brains out vibe, please? At least while we\u2019re enjoying this meal?\u201d Her gaze took in every inch of his face. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice change for us, being out on the town, dressed up and eating fancy food.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened. \u201cBaby, I\u2019ll take you out for a nice dinner and show you off every night of the week if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary. I want this night out with you. Celebrating you being the big money winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>During dinner he entertained her with stories from his travels in Europe.</p><p>Yet he didn\u2019t dial down the sexual intensity completely. It buzzed between them, making her hyperaware of his every movement. His every breath. His every uncompromising stare.</p><p>As Rory pondered dessert choices, she asked if he wanted to share. The molten look in his eyes when he murmured, \u201cI\u2019m havin\u2019 you for dessert,\u201d almost had her skipping the three layer chocolate cake with vanilla bean cr\u00e8me freche.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Floating on champagne, an amazing meal and a cup of strong coffee, Rory faced Dalton when he placed his hand in the small of her back as they left the restaurant.</p><p>He lowered his head and she expected a gentle peck. But he consumed her mouth in a blistering kiss, revving that sexual need into overdrive. When he finally released her lips, she knew the buzz she felt was all from him.</p><p>The elevator dinged and the doors slid open. As soon as the doors closed, Dalton shoved a keycard into the slot and they descended to the lowest level\u2014which she remembered was not street level.</p><p>\u201cDalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then that avid mouth was on hers again. He\u2019d crowded her into the corner with one hand gripping her hair and the other hand squeezing her hip.</p><p>By the time the elevator stopped, her head spun, her heart raced, and the inside of her thighs were damp and sticky. He could get her hot and bothered in the span of two floors.</p><p>After the doors opened he hit the button sending it back up. The space was dark. The only illumination came from the glow of the exit signs.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe extra gaming room in the basement. The casino only uses it when they run a big tournament. No cameras down here,\u201d he said against her throat. His big body pushed her backward. \u201cJesus. I want you so fuckin\u2019 bad I can\u2019t even walk a straight line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how...\u201d Rory moaned when his teeth skimmed the tendons straining in her neck.</p><p>\u201cThe head of hotel security owed me a favor.\u201d</p><p>Her ass bumped into something solid and she stopped.</p><p>Dalton said, \u201cHold on to me and hop up.\u201d</p><p>Once she was seated, she glanced down to see what she was seated on.</p><p>A table covered in green felt.</p><p>He created space for himself between her thighs. \u201cSo fuckin\u2019 hot in this skirt,\u201d he hissed in her ear as he rolled it up to her hips. \u201cNeed to get under it, get in you, before I explode.\u201d</p><p>Seeing Dalton this crazed to have her, feeling that pure sexual energy pulsing off him, made her wet, made her burn, made her brave. For him she could be the kinky girl who got fucked on a gaming table in the basement of a casino. In his eyes she was the red-hot lover that her lover couldn\u2019t get enough of. She could prove she was the reckless woman who got off on getting her man off any time, any place.</p><p>His lips danced across her skin, soft and wet and perfect. \u201cI want you.\u201d A soft pass. \u201cBut first I\u2019m gonna eat my dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d was all she managed before she found herself flat on her back\u2014on a poker table!\u2014with Dalton yanking her thong aside.</p><p>Then she didn\u2019t give a rip where she was. Dalton\u2019s mouth was licking her pussy, sucking every bit of juice from her swollen tissues. His growling moans vibrated against her flesh until that teasing tingle started behind her tailbone.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what she wanted or what he needed.</p><p>She clapped her hands on his cheeks and pulled that skillful mouth off her. \u201cI\u2019m wet, you\u2019re hard. Fuck me. Now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered and he undid his belt. His jeans and boxers hit the tops of his boots. He gripped the insides of her thighs and shoved them wider apart.</p><p>Then he crammed his cock into her so fast and hard she arched off the table.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he panted as he worked his cock in and out with long strokes. \u201cPull your shirt down so I can watch your tits bounce as I fuck you like this.\u201d</p><p>Rather than rip the buttons to do his bidding, Rory undid the buttons one at a time. \u201cYou like these?\u201d She cupped her breasts and pushed them up, creating a deep line of cleavage.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he gritted out. His hips began doing that twisty thing as he pumped inside her. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh high roller. You wanna see \u2019em, free \u2019em yourself.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s palms moved up her hips. Wearing the depraved grin that made her belly swoop, Dalton unhooked the first two hooks on the bustier before he tugged it down. Then her breasts were free, bouncing with abandon. \u201cFuck that\u2019s hot.\u201d He watched with a gleam in his eye, bottoming out on every thrust to make the flesh shake.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what way is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever you want.\u201d</p><p>Keeping his eyes on hers, Dalton bent forward and licked her nipple. Just one lash of his wet tongue. \u201cBrace your hands above your head on the rail.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she did, his hand slid between her legs and he traced her slit from where his cock filled her to the fleshy folds of her pussy lips. He bit down on her nipple\u2014the shock of pain immediately gave way to pleasure as the heat and wetness of his mouth surrounded the rock hard tip. He lifted his head, dark hair falling across his forehead in that untamed manner and his teeth hovered over her nipple. But the same time he bit down, he pinched her clit.</p><p>Rory gasped as the orgasm came out of nowhere. Her clit throbbed beneath his pinching fingers; his sucking mouth was firmly latched onto her nipple as he fucked her into that white void of bliss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soft kisses on the upper swells of her breasts brought her back to reality.</p><p>\u201cNeed you from behind.\u201d He pulled out and rolled her over, yanking her body down the table. Her hips were against the outside edge and the tips of her shoes could almost touch the floor. Almost. In this position Rory was completely at Dalton\u2019s mercy.</p><p>Good thing she didn\u2019t need to use any brain cells; hers were still buzzing from that outstanding orgasm.</p> <p>Dalton lifted her ass cheeks and shoved back into her pussy. His hands pushed against her butt to keep her hips from slamming into the edge as he hammered into her.</p><p>\u201cSo fucking perfect how this hot cunt grips me. It owns me.\u201d</p><p>Rory squeezed his cock on his next pass and he yelled, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips tightened on her flesh a split second before he released a long shuddering groan as he came.</p><p>And came.</p> <p>Dalton\u2019s legs shook. So did his voice. \u201cSo fucking... Jesus. I can\u2019t even come up with a word to describe that.\u201d</p><p>Then his hand was in her hair, cranking her head so he could destroy her with a searing kiss that managed to be sexy as shit and sweet as honey. When he finally released her mouth, she sighed again.</p><p>He lightly rubbed his lips back and forth across the shell of her ear. \u201cYou rocked my universe this time, jungle girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little spun out of orbit myself.\u201d</p><p>Then in typical Dalton fashion, he tended to her. Gently lowering her to her feet. Straightening her thong and tugging her skirt back into place. Kissing her with an erotic tease as he adjusted her bustier and buttoned her blouse.</p><p>Clasping her hand in his, he headed for the elevator, but she pulled him back.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your key card work for the stairs? Because I don\u2019t wanna parade through the lobby with sex hair.\u201d</p><p>Dalton kissed her forehead. \u201cOf course. Let\u2019s go back to the room. But first...\u201d He pushed her against the door to the stairs and planted a kiss on the side of her neck. \u201cThank you for tonight, Aurora. It\u2019s been one of the best nights of my life.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d rocked her to the core. But she also feared it wasn\u2019t her specifically who\u2019d starred in his fucking-on-a-poker-table fantasy\u2014she was just the woman who\u2019d helped him fulfill it. So to keep things between them light and sexy, she cooed, \u201cOf course it\u2019s one of the best nights of your life. You won a shit ton of cash, ate a fancy meal for free and got your rocks off.\u201d</p><p>His entire body stiffened at her flip response.</p><p>But Rory refused to feel guilty for reminding him\u2014and herself\u2014that this was all fun and games.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>In years past, Dalton had arrived at McKay family poker games with Tell. Then after they\u2019d lost\u2014always on purpose\u2014they\u2019d hit a bar, or a party, or a strip club.</p> <p>Trucks lined the driveway. It appeared he was the last to arrive. Stupid to have a bout of nerves. He\u2019d known these people all his life.</p><p>Ben answered the door before Dalton could knock. \u201cHey, come in. You\u2019re just in time\u2014we\u2019re drawing names.\u201d He held out a cowboy hat. \u201cPick a slip of paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich table you start at. There\u2019s too many of us so we\u2019re setting up two tables. Top three winners from each table will get to the final round. Now that you\u2019re here and there are thirteen of us...\u201d Ben frowned. \u201cThat don\u2019t divide evenly.\u201d</p><p>Once again Dalton felt like the odd man out. Last to arrive, last one picked for the team, the one everyone else had to move to make room for.</p><p>Ben clapped him on the back and looked at the number on the paper. \u201cNo matter, we\u2019ll go seven and six.\u201d</p><p>With the exception of Ben and Keely, Dalton hadn\u2019t seen any of his McKay cousins since he\u2019d returned. They all seemed friendly enough, but it wasn\u2019t like it used to be. Maybe because you\u2019re not who you used to be. He declined a beer from Quinn, who played bartender, and opted for soda.</p><p>Keely sidled up to him for a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping yourself mighty scarce, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some stuff goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Rory? Family gossip says you\u2019re seeing her all official and like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell do you have time to keep tabs on me when you\u2019ve got four kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue. Some days are a blur. JJ and Liam have hit the terrible twos and are absolute hellions. Hellions,\u201d she repeated. \u201cLuckily Piper loves to tattle so I hear everything those boys try when I don\u2019t have my eye on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat goes around, comes around, little sis,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>\u201cI was never that bad. Even Mom says so.\u201d She smirked. \u201cBut it oughta be fun hearing how Jack\u2019s afternoon went, since he\u2019s taking all the kids to grocery store today. Even I\u2019m not brave enough to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s great to have a built-in babysitter,\u201d Cord said. \u201cAlthough Kyler don\u2019t appreciate havin\u2019 to stay home and watch his little brothers and sister when he\u2019d rather be out tearin\u2019 around.\u201d Cord crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cFind it odd he volunteered to help you when he\u2019s got plenty of chores to do at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyler is a good kid. I\u2019m glad to have his help. He mentioned you and AJ had another boy. Belated congrats. How old is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaughn is two and a half. We keep our angel away from Keely and Jack\u2019s twin devil boys so as to not give him any ideas,\u201d Cord said, ducking Keely\u2019s swat.</p><p>\u201cLooks like the McKay ranch will be goin\u2019 strong for another generation with all the ranch hands in training,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>None of them suggested that he get on the stick, get married and add to the fray, since that hadn\u2019t exactly worked out last time.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve the table assignments, so listen up,\u201d Kade said. \u201cTable one will be, me, Keely, Quinn, Tell, Gavin and Colby. Table two will be Ben, Colt, Cam, Brandt, Cord, Dalton and Kane.\u201d He pointed to Ainsley at the end of the bar. \u201cAinsley has volunteered to be the banker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t volunteer; I was volunteered by my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandling money is a natural state for you, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Dalton wondered if Ben saw her stick her tongue out at him.</p><p>\u201cSo head over and get your chips if you haven\u2019t yet. Buy-in is fifty bucks.\u201d</p><p>Dalton stood in line next to Tell. He leaned in to whisper, \u201cYou playing it safe today, bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. Get ready for the showdown between you and me in the championship round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet who comes out on top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t makin\u2019 a side wager with you, Tell.\u201d Dalton grinned. \u201cBe like takin\u2019 food outta your kid\u2019s mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred bucks says I win it all.\u201d</p><p>Sucker. Dalton stuck out his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he took his seat at the table, he said, \u201cWho\u2019s dealing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t no fancy casino game. We take turns dealing,\u201d Kane said. \u201cAinsley keeps an eye on things so there\u2019s no cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would ever cheat at cards?\u201d Cam said with a mock gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou. Which is sad considering you are an officer, sworn to uphold the law,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t wearing my gun or badge now so alls fair,\u201d Cam retorted. He rubbed his hands together with anticipation. \u201cLet the bloodbath begin.\u201d</p><p>A lot of trash talking happened during the game. If anyone noticed Dalton didn\u2019t join in it wasn\u2019t mentioned. He just played until he ran Brandt out of chips. Cam took out both Cord and Colt. Kane eliminated Ben.</p><p>They took a break to grab snacks and more drinks, although they seemed to be drinking a lot less booze than they used to.</p><p>Gavin caught Dalton by the chips and dip. \u201cHave you heard from my daughter lately? She told me you two have been in contact over the years. And yes, she confessed she owns the house you\u2019re living in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow why would she do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of my business associates contacted me and asked, if Sierra was my heir, then why she wasn\u2019t buying property through Daniels Development. So I did a little research and found out she owns six properties. One here, one in Casper, one in Cheyenne and three in Arizona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl\u2019s got ambition,\u201d Dalton admitted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also got a financial backer. I\u2019m sure she used some of her inheritance from her grandparents to fund this...venture. But she\u2019d need someone older to partner with. Someone with solid credit. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s you?\u201d</p><p>He shot a look over his shoulder and lowered his voice. \u201cLook, Sierra is a savvy young woman. Her ideas are sound. She\u2019s grown up in the real estate business so she\u2019s not some wet-behind-the-ears kid earning a business degree with no practical experience. My gut instinct was to back her and it hasn\u2019t proven to be a bad investment. Return on investments are slow at this point, but I didn\u2019t give her any capital I couldn\u2019t afford.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s eyes remained skeptical. \u201cYour brothers\u2014no one in the McKay family has any idea how well-funded you are, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. And I\u2019d like to keep it that way. You should be proud of Sierra. The whole reason she\u2019s been doin\u2019 this is to prove to you she\u2019s a self-starter and she\u2019s qualified to run the business with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for saying that. I\u2019m damn proud of that girl and she\u2019s a good judge of character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you two whispering about over here?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cIssues I had fixing Rory\u2019s doggie door. Gavin installed it six months ago and we\u2019re brainstorming on how we can repair the broken seal,\u201d Dalton lied with a straight face. \u201cWhy? What\u2019d you think we were talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of you ganging up on me in the final round because I\u2019m the real threat in this contest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton and Gavin looked at each other and laughed. \u201cNice try, bro. See ya at the table.\u201d</p><p>Keely, Gavin, Tell, Cam, Dalton and Kane made it to the final table. Ben offered to act as the dealer.</p><p>\u201cSo, we have any side bets goin\u2019?\u201d Kade asked.</p> <p>\u201cIf I stay in longer than Cam, he\u2019s taking all of our kids so me\u2019n Jack can have a night out. If a miracle happens and he stays in longer than me, I have to take his girls and mine fishing. No men allowed, which means I\u2019ll be baiting hooks and removing hooks.\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cNo one else?\u201d</p><p>Dalton and Tell smirked at each other but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t gonna say who the odds on favorite is\u2014Gavin cough cough\u2014because he gambles with so much money every day. But if you\u2019re feelin\u2019 lucky, Ainsley is takin\u2019 bets on who\u2019ll take home the cash pot.\u201d Ben shuffled the cards. \u201cHere we go.\u201d</p> <p>At first everyone played conservatively. Then Tell bluffed his way to a win, which kicked in Kane and Cam\u2019s competitive sides. Unfortunately for them, they were suckered in by Tell\u2019s manipulation and they went out. Keely lasted a few more hands before she was down to zero chips. Gavin went all in with a full house eights high. But it wasn\u2019t enough to beat Dalton\u2019s full houses nines high over sevens.</p><p>So it came down to Dalton and Tell. Dalton let Tell think they were evenly matched as he kept dinging him for a few bucks here and there until Tell was down to two hundred bucks.</p><p>Dalton bluffed, knowing Tell would see through it. Tell won the hand and got a little overconfident. Dalton bluffed a few more times and lost several hands, but not in a row.</p><p>When Dalton was sitting on three aces and a pair of queens, he glanced over to see a hard set to Tell\u2019s jaw, which meant he was trying his damndest not to grin.</p><p>Gotcha.</p><p>Odds were Dalton had Tell\u2019s hand beat. Tell most likely didn\u2019t have a royal flush since Dalton held an ace and a queen from two suits. So unless Tell was holding onto four kings or four jacks...</p> <p>Dalton said, \u201cCheck.\u201d</p><p>Tell looked at his chips and pushed them into the center. \u201cAll in.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of oohs rang out.</p><p>Dalton looked as his cards, unfanned them into a single pile and set them on the table.</p><p>\u201cTo you, Dalton,\u201d Ben reminded him.</p><p>He shoved his chips into the middle of the table. \u201cAll in.\u201d</p><p>Tell spread his cards out and grinned. \u201cRead \u2019em and weep, bro. Hate to hand you another public loss, but there it is.\u201d Tell had a spade flush queen high.</p><p>\u201cAs purty as that little flush is? It don\u2019t beat this, does it?\u201d Dalton flipped over his cards one at a time...and his family alternately cheered and booed.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Dalton scooped all the chips to his side of the table.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Tell said, completely shocked. \u201cI know all your tells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew all my tells. Been a long time since we\u2019ve played cards.\u201d</p><p>Everyone surrounded Dalton, congratulating him. Someone said, \u201cSpeech,\u201d and Dalton knew the time had come.</p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting me to the poker game and handing over all your money.\u201d</p><p>Boos rang out.</p><p>Kane drawled, \u201cWhatcha been up to since you\u2019ve been back besides practicing polishing your poker hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsin\u2019 my handyman skills renovating my friend\u2019s house. And another opportunity has come along and I\u2019ve already started to pursue it.\u201d</p><p>He watched his brothers exchange a confused look.</p><p>\u201cWhich is what?\u201d Cam asked.</p><p>\u201cRemember that section of land I bought from the Fox family? The two hundred acres between Tell\u2019s place, and where the upper half borders Quinn and Ben\u2019s section, and the lower half borders Gavin\u2019s land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What about it? You gonna put a casino on there?\u201d Colt teased.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve applied for a permit for the state\u2019s pilot program for commercial elk farming.\u201d</p><p>Laughter broke out.</p><p>\u201cGood one, Dalton, you almost had us there,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. I already filed all the appropriate paperwork with the state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re doin\u2019 this so if you do get picked you can let it sit there fallow to show the state they can\u2019t mess in our livelihood,\u201d Quinn demanded.</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m dead serious. That chunk of land is perfect. It\u2019s rugged and hilly. I\u2019ve got the means to build the required fence. I\u2019ve got game supplier contacts in Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you put a new paddle lock on the gate?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cOne of the reasons. I hauled some fencing down there that I didn\u2019t want anyone messin\u2019 with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much damage a herd of elk can do to grazing land? Not to mention how freakin\u2019 much feed it takes to sustain them. And if they can\u2019t find that feed in the fenced-in area, well, where the hell do you think they\u2019re gonna go lookin\u2019 for it?\u201d Ben demanded.</p><p>Colby, Cord and Colt jumped in to back Quinn and Ben. All talking at once, yelling at him about what a big mess he was making of everything.</p><p>Brandt and Tell stared at him, clearly unhappy that he\u2019d brought this up in front of the entire family.</p><p>The words selfish and irresponsible and childish, vindictive and troublemaker were tossed around, hitting him center mass just like goddamned daggers.</p><p>He needed to get the fuck out of here now.</p><p>The noise escalated to the point the only thing that cut it was Keely\u2019s shrill whistle.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Keely shouted. \u201cHurling accusations isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t see why the hell you\u2019re even getting involved,\u201d Cord snapped at Keely. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a stake in the ranch and it ain\u2019t gonna affect your life at all.\u201d</p><p>Colby and Colt backed him. Then Quinn and Ben joined in and Cam had to break it up.</p><p>\u201cKnock it the hell off! Jesus. I\u2019da stayed home if I wanted to referee pointless bickering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay out of it, little brother. Because you don\u2019t have a stake in the ranch anymore either,\u201d Colt said hotly.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath, Colt,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I will. And why are you and Kade sitting on the sidelines? This\u2019ll affect you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we could get a word in edgewise,\u201d Kade said, \u201cWhich is par for the course lately. You, Colby and Cord just talk over the rest of us anyway, because your opinion is the only one that matters, right?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. This was getting ugly and it was just the beginning.</p><p>Gavin stepped forward. \u201cLet me speak.\u201d</p><p>Dalton waited for someone to point out he didn\u2019t have a stake in the ranch, and he wasn\u2019t even technically a McKay. But no one chimed in.</p><p>That\u2019s because they respect him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a rancher. But I do think you guys are getting all bent out of shape about something that might never happen. Dalton applied for the permit. That\u2019s it. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll get it. So the time to hold the discussions about elk escaping and affecting grazing land and hay stores is not now.\u201d</p><p>A few grumbles, but everyone quieted down.</p><p>But Quinn wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cSo where do you stand, Gavin?\u201d</p><p>It appeared Gavin would hedge and Dalton didn\u2019t blame him. He didn\u2019t want to get into it with his brothers either. So Gavin\u2019s response shocked the shit out of him.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re making these lines or whatever purely on border issues, then this elk farm would affect almost my entire acreage. And to be honest, the land I own has been a point of contention in this family for a number of years. Everyone has approached me on how to improve it, how to make it cattle friendly. I listened. But no one actually stepped up and gave me a solid plan on why I ought to draw up an official lease agreement. Except for Dalton.\u201d</p><p>Dalton felt all eyes on him while his remained on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHe drew up a workable, sustainable plan. Timetables for the clearing process, a growth chart of the number of head in the herd year by year, even when portions of it would remain fallow so it wouldn\u2019t be overgrazed. He asked for a five-year lease, which would go into effect after the improvements were made on the land\u2014improvements which were promised to be made on his dime.\u201d</p><p>A moment of quiet. \u201cDalton. When did you do all that?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>\u201cFour years ago,\u201d Gavin answered. \u201cAt the time Dalton was confident with the addition of Georgia and Jessie into the McKay workforce all the brush could be cleared and improvements made within six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we know any of this?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause the contract was between me and Dalton, since technically he was the sole owner of the chunk of land that bordered mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you asked me if we had any plans for it?\u201d Quinn asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. And you told me neither you nor Ben had the time nor the inclination to do what needed to be done to make that piece of land useable for your operation.\u201d Gavin rubbed the skin between his eyes. \u201cWhen a full year rolled around and no improvements had been made because Dalton couldn\u2019t do it by himself and didn\u2019t have the help he\u2019d counted on, he approached me, requesting that we void the contract. He didn\u2019t want me to be beholden to it and lose out on an opportunity to lease the land to someone else in case it came up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, that is not the action of a selfish man. Or a childish man. Or a vindictive man. Or a goddamned troublemaker. I don\u2019t know who tossed out that accusation because that\u2019s one thing Dalton isn\u2019t. Maybe he was wild as a kid\u2014I can\u2019t say because I didn\u2019t know him then. But I know him now, and in case you haven\u2019t been paying attention, he\u2019s not a kid anymore. He\u2019s a man trying to make a living like all of you. Takes a lot of guts to show up here, after being gone from the family fold for a number of years, and share his plans. He didn\u2019t have to. He did it out of courtesy and respect for all of you and you\u2019ve shown him none in return. None.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe no one would notice if he dropped to the floor and crawled away.</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re truly asking me to pick a side?\u201d His eyes met Ben\u2019s and then Quinn\u2019s. \u201cI vote yes for the elk farm. I\u2019d even re-up my lease agreement and give him a bigger acreage to work with because I know Dalton will make sure everything is done right.\u201d Gavin set his hand on Dalton\u2019s shoulder. Then he grabbed his coat and walked out.</p><p>To say the McKay family was stunned into silence was an understatement.</p> <p>Before the arguing started again, Dalton snagged his coat and left.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t until he was halfway home that he realized he\u2019d left his poker winnings on the table.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>It was especially hard to go to work on Monday morning after her fun weekend in Deadwood.</p><p>When the stack of elk farm applications arrived from the Cheyenne office, Rory was tempted to crawl under her desk and hide. She hadn\u2019t reached the land inspection part of her job yet\u2014she was still mired in the permit process. But the cutoff date loomed. Hopefully she\u2019d get out in the field soon.</p> <p>No morning staff meeting meant Rory could dig right in and get to work. She\u2019d cleared five applications\u2014checking with the register of deeds that the applicant was the actual property owner, adding to her map which sections of land in which areas had applied and grouping the applicants by county.</p><p>Since it was almost lunchtime, she put everything aside and retrieved her sandwich and salad from the break room fridge. Most days she didn\u2019t mind eating with her coworkers, but Hannah\u2019s presence had Rory returning to her office. No need to end up with Hannah-induced indigestion.</p><p>Rory checked her phone. No missed calls or texts from Dalton. Very strange. He hadn\u2019t contacted her last night after his McKay poker game. She\u2019d fully expected to hear how he\u2019d cleaned them out.</p><p>She and her mom were supposed to have an early supper since Gavin had also been at the poker game, but she\u2019d called around five begging off. Left to her own devices, Rory snuggled up with her dog and watched a marathon of What Not To Wear.</p><p>After lunch she dug back in to work. No issues with the next two applications on the stack. But the third application? Rory had a big, big problem with it. Because the applicant\u2019s name was Dalton McKay.</p><p>A thousand questions jumped into her head.</p> <p>But the biggest question was why hadn\u2019t Rory known Dalton intended to apply for an elk farm permit? Surely that would\u2019ve come up in all the times they\u2019d spent together. Then again, whenever she asked about his day, or what he\u2019d been doing, he gave the same response: working on a few projects here and there. Which she\u2019d always taken to assume meant remodeling projects.</p><p>That\u2019s what she got for assuming.</p><p>First she checked the land deed. Dalton had owned that piece for four years. Then she looked at the proposed plat of land for the feeding grounds. It was wedged between the McKay Ranch on the left side, more McKay land on the right side and at the bottom, a small section owned by Gavin Daniels. Aka, the land her mother used to own; aka, the elk farm would be close not only to the house Gavin and Rielle owned, but to the cabin on the property where she lived.</p><p>She checked the application date. Dalton had applied the week after he\u2019d returned to Wyoming.</p><p>The week she\u2019d started the special project.</p><p>Well. Wasn\u2019t that a coincidence?</p><p>Not.</p><p>Rory hadn\u2019t talked specifics of her job with him, keeping the details of her special project under wraps. She\u2019d mentioned she had paperwork to sort through before she got into the fieldwork portion of the assignment.</p> <p>So how had Dalton found out vetting elk farm applications was her project?</p><p>Easy. The man sauntered into the office frequently. That dimpled smile worked wonders\u2014even horrible Hannah hadn\u2019t been immune to his sexy cowboy charm. Since he usually cooled his boots in the reception area, he could\u2019ve overheard the project info from any number of sources. Or someone\u2014a female someone\u2014could\u2019ve told him just to get an up close look at his amazing blue eyes.</p><p>Which begged the question: why had Dalton applied?</p><p>To screw with his family after they\u2019d screwed with him?</p><p>Nah. He wasn\u2019t that kind of guy.</p><p>Or maybe it was the opposite. Maybe this application was a sleight of hand orchestrated by his family? The McKays were one of the most vocal opponents to the program. Had they figured since Rory was in charge of the project, if Dalton applied, she\u2019d choose him? Then the McKays would let the project molder and die.</p><p>Rory pawed through the rest of the applications but didn\u2019t see any with the last name McKay. Wasn\u2019t a surprise that the ranchers with land bordering the McKays hadn\u2019t applied for the temporary permit. No one wanted to tangle with the McKays. They\u2019d chew you up and spit you out like an old wad of tobacco. Then they\u2019d grind you into nothing beneath their boot heel as they walked away.</p><p>No more. She\u2019d had her fill of being walked on.</p><p>Since she had autonomy with this project, she backed up her files, made a copy of Dalton\u2019s application and shoved it in her purse. Then she locked everything else in her filing cabinet and left the office.</p><p>By the time she arrived at Dalton\u2019s house, she\u2019d worked herself into a lather.</p><p>Dalton answered the door but his smile dried up immediately. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. That\u2019s why I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me in and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Rory practically shoved him aside.</p><p>She started for the kitchen, only to wheel back around so fast Dalton ran right into her.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. You wanna tell me what put that murderous look on your face? And why I get the feeling I shoulda slipped on a cup before I answered the door today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d She slapped the paper in the center of his chest.</p><p>He snatched it and stepped back. Straightened it out and scanned the text.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change.</p><p>Stupid professional poker player face.</p><p>Dalton said, \u201cWhere\u2019d you get this?\u201d without looking up.</p><p>But before she could answer he crowded her, his eyes flashing fire. \u201cDid my brothers bring this to you first thing this morning? Or my cousins? Which ones? And why the fuck did they drag you into it? To embarrass me? I knew they were seriously pissed off yesterday, but I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d put some McKay muscle behind it. What am I saying? That\u2019s exactly what they do. They don\u2019t like something, they pull some strings and try to get it changed.\u201d</p><p>This was not going at all like she expected.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get ahold of this application, Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was delivered to my office today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the State of Wyoming. It was in a box with all the other applications I\u2019m processing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther applications you\u2019re processing?\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well what I\u2019m saying. The special project I was assigned at the WNRC? This is it. I\u2019m in charge of vetting applicants for this test program. I\u2019m the one who sends the recommendations to the state board on who gets awarded permits.\u201d</p><p>No change in his expression.</p><p>\u201cSo when you were hanging around the WNRC offices waiting for me, who told you it was my project? Someone had to spill the beans because the information sure as hell didn\u2019t come from me. And I find it really...coincidental that the date on the application is the week I officially started working on it. You\u2019d been in Sundance a week before you filed. One week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything? The permit process was listed in the paper that week. That\u2019s how I found out about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Why is that an issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you know exactly how to manipulate me, Dalton McKay, you always have. Alls you had to do was charm me, bed me and convince me you\u2019ve changed. Then act all crazy about me while you followed your own goddamned agenda. Just like usual. Nothing ever changes with you.\u201d She briefly closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m such an idiot. You\u2019re using me again.\u201d</p><p>Then he said two words that chilled her to the bone. \u201cGet. Out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I don\u2019t need this shit from you on top of everything else that\u2019s come down on me in the last day.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cThe hell I will. I deserve an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019ve got it all figured out. You\u2019ll argue with anything I tell you. And you\u2019re so worried that I\u2019m gonna fuck you over again that you can\u2019t even see the truth when it\u2019s right in front of you.\u201d He threw the paper at her. \u201cNow get out.\u201d</p><p>Stung, she snapped, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll go. But guaranteed I won\u2019t even consider your piece of land for the program given your manipulative behavior.\u201d</p><p>Dalton got right in her face. \u201cYou will give me a fair shake in all of this or the next place I go is to the state board to file a grievance with them. About you. You don\u2019t get to be judge, jury and executioner on this, Rory. I will fight you and the WNRC to make sure my application is given as much consideration as the other applicants\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me no choice! You storm into my house, accuse me of all kinds of underhanded shit\u2014none of which is true. You know how I feel about you. Goddammit, you know that I\u2019m not fucking playing you, Aurora.\u201d</p><p>She watched his jaw flexing as he ground his teeth together.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll never be able to convince you, will I? You\u2019ll never trust me or trust in this. That it\u2019s real. And that goddamn sucks.\u201d</p><p>His voice had dropped to that quietly resigned tone that scared her far worse than if he\u2019d yelled at her.</p><p>Dalton stepped back and opened the door but he wouldn\u2019t look at her. \u201cYou need to leave before one of us says something we\u2019ll regret and ruins everything that we\u2019ve\u2014or maybe I should say that I\u2019ve\u2014been trying to build with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did Dalton really believe that she didn\u2019t give a damn about him?</p><p>This was about fun times and sex games\u2014didn\u2019t you remind yourself of that fact every time things became serious? Self-preservation, remember? This isn\u2019t only about your relationship; this is about your livelihood. And now he\u2019s fucking with you on both levels. Why are you surprised?</p><p>Because there was more to it than that. And she wanted\u2014she deserved\u2014some answers.</p> <p>Maybe you should\u2019ve thought of that before you barged in here spewing accusations.</p><p>Before she cleared the doorjamb completely, Dalton said in a hoarse voice, \u201cI\u2019ll be out of town for the next two days. We can talk about this when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Rory spun around. \u201cWhat? Why are you just telling me this now?\u201d</p><p>Those hurt blue eyes hooked hers. \u201cI\u2019d planned to tell you tonight over dinner. But now... Anyway, I didn\u2019t want you to think I was running away again.\u201d</p><p>Then Dalton shut the door in her face.</p> <p>He\u2019d given her no choice but to back off and process everything that\u2019d just happened. Dammit. She wanted to beat on the door and resolve this now. She hated fighting with a lover. Hated it.</p><p>As Rory drove home, the reality of the situation hit her. What did it mean that she was more upset about what this meant for their relationship than how this might affect her job performance?</p><p>Dalton figured his brothers would need a day or two to cool off so he was surprised to see them on his doorstep Monday evening.</p><p>\u201cCan we come in?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends on if this is an ass-chewing session or a rational discussion. I\u2019ve had enough shit flung at me today that I\u2019m feelin\u2019 like a monkey.\u201d</p><p>They both looked at him blankly.</p> <p>Guess his sense of humor sucked too. \u201cYeah, come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice place,\u201d Tell said after they\u2019d trooped into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting there.\u201d He gestured to the table. They sat and he rested his back against the countertop. \u201cI\u2019d offer you guys a beer but I\u2019m out. You want coffee or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just wanted to come over and clear the air after the bullshit that happened yesterday. You took off pretty damn fast,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cNot that we blame you,\u201d Tell added. \u201cIt\u2019s just...the whole elk farm thing caught us off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wonder why I didn\u2019t tell you about my plan before I blabbed to the whole family?\u201d</p><p>Brandt and Tell looked at each other and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe reaction from the family yesterday was what I expected.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWith the exception of Gavin\u2019s comments. But I needed to make sure you guys were surprised by it too, so our cousins couldn\u2019t accuse either of you of not tellin\u2019 them about something that affects the ranch. Or could possibly affect it. Nothin\u2019 is guaranteed except the State of Wyoming cashed my five hundred dollar check for the permit application.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGavin was the only one makin\u2019 sense. And I hated how fast Cord, Colby and Colt turned on anyone who didn\u2019t agree with them.\u201d Brandt scrubbed his hands over his face. \u201cBeen goin\u2019 on a while and we\u2019ve sorta let it slide, but seein\u2019 that Kade and Kane feel the same way, I reckon it\u2019s time to take Uncle Carson\u2019s kids to task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only this,\u201d Tell said. \u201cBut they oughta know that we\u2019re supporting you no matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>Dalton tried not to let his shock show.</p><p>But it must have, because Tell said, \u201cWhy in the hell does that surprise you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because you haven\u2019t always thrown in behind me.\u201d</p><p>Brandt snorted. \u201cIf you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about the years you spent getting in bar fights, I\u2019ll remind you that me\u2019n Tell backed you plenty of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time we had a problem with you or what you were doin\u2019 or what you weren\u2019t doin\u2019, little bro, we told you. And if you really think about it, us getting in your face about shit didn\u2019t happen all that often.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>\u201cBesides, the last couple years you were here workin\u2019 on the ranch, after Dad got sober and Mom left, we had no idea what you were doin\u2019 with yourself in your off-the-ranch hours. You slammed that door in our faces whenever we asked. So we stopped askin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Dalton couldn\u2019t argue with that either.</p><p>\u201cWe might\u2019ve gotten concerned you had a gambling problem if we\u2019d known how often you were playing poker during that time. But when you told us that you paid cash for the Fox family\u2019s land...well, we couldn\u2019t exactly chew your ass for bein\u2019 a successful card player, now could we?\u201d Tell complained.</p><p>\u201cSo we think it\u2019s bullshit, whatever stick you\u2019ve got up your ass about this. About us.\u201d Brandt\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve always been able to count on is the three of us stick together. No matter what. That ain\u2019t changed just because you have.\u201d</p><p>At least they recognized he had changed. But he hadn\u2019t found the balls to give them the real reason for his fear that they\u2019d change toward him. So he deflected. \u201cYou\u2019re both on board with my plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your land, Dalton. You can do whatever the hell you want with it. You get that permit, well, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of this might be a moot point anyway. I found out the hard way that not only is the Crook County branch office of the WNRC in charge of processing applications, they also determine who\u2019s granted the permits.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I knew Rory had been assigned a special project at the WNRC, but she wasn\u2019t allowed to talk specifics. And I kept my application on the down low for obvious reasons. So guess whose application came across Rory\u2019s desk today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Dalton ran his hand through his hair. \u201cShe showed up here a few hours ago and lost her mind on me. Rory and I have a tangled history, some of it not pretty. Needless to say, she thinks history is repeating itself and that I was just usin\u2019 her to get a fuckin\u2019 permit. Jesus. That burns my ass because she knows better. I\u2019m not fuckin\u2019 around with her this time.\u201d</p><p>Brandt looked skeptical. \u201cYou two are involved, seriously involved from what I\u2019ve seen, and neither of you had any idea what the other one is doin\u2019 outside of the hours that you spend together?\u201d</p><p>When Brandt put it that way...it sounded unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you two ain\u2019t doin\u2019 a whole lotta talkin\u2019?\u201d Tell wiggled his eyebrows. \u201cI remember them days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be part of it. She\u2019s pissed and I\u2019m pissed and we\u2019re cooling things off for a few days.\u201d</p><p>Tell pointed at the duffel bag against the wall. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re goin\u2019 somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I talked to my buddy Boden last night. I left some stuff undone since I wasn\u2019t sure how long I\u2019d be gone when I left. So I\u2019m leavin\u2019 for Montana in the morning.\u201d Or maybe he\u2019d just take off tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019re you comin\u2019 back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019re gonna stop by the rehab hospital on your way outta town?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>Dalton shook his head.</p><p>\u201cBeen a while since you\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he made any improvements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But that don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Casper.\u201d Ever. \u201cIf you need me to check cattle or fix fence or babysit your kids while you\u2019re visiting him, I\u2019m more than willing to help out. But it is not helpin\u2019 out sitting in Casper\u2019s room and letting him glare at me. I\u2019m done with that.\u201d</p><p>Neither of his brothers responded. They weren\u2019t happy, but at least now maybe they\u2019d stop bugging him about it.</p><p>Brandt stood. \u201cWell, drive safe. Let us know you made it up there okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Tell clapped him on the back. \u201cFair warning. I\u2019m totally takin\u2019 you up on the free babysitting offer.\u201d He dug in his jacket pocket. \u201cBefore I forget...\u201d He handed Dalton a wad of bills. \u201cYou forgot the jackpot, so me\u2019n Brandt picked up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Dalton pretended to count it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s all there?\u201d Tell demanded. \u201cYou are one suspicious motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Just checking to see if you added the hundred you owed me for the side bet.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIs it included in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dalton held out his hand. \u201cPay up, bro. Fair\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>Brandt laughed and said, \u201cTold ya he\u2019d remember.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Rory yelled, \u201cCome in,\u201d after two knocks sounded on her office door Thursday morning.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rory.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw might\u2019ve actually hit the desk when she saw Dillon Doland, her ex-fianc\u00e9, in the doorway. \u201cDillon? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the area for business. Thought I\u2019d stop by and say hello.\u201d</p><p>Remembering her manners, she gestured to the chair in front of the desk. \u201cPlease. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He pinched the crease of his khaki pants after he sat.</p><p>At their first meeting, Dillon\u2019s fussiness with his clothes made her wonder if he was gay. After their less than spectacular sex life when they dated, she still wondered that.</p><p>Not nice, Rory.</p><p>Dillon bestowed his movie-star bright smile. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still part-time here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically? Yes. But I\u2019m on special assignment so I\u2019m fulltime until that ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the special assignment?\u201d</p><p>She winked. \u201cSuper duper secret.\u201d She\u2019d been so mad at Dalton she\u2019d just blurted out that information and she shouldn\u2019t have. Wouldn\u2019t it be her bad luck if he blabbed to everyone...just like he used to?

I\u2019ve got a good idea what you\u2019ve been tasked to do, given your field of study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I assigned this job because of your recommendation?\u201d she asked sharply.</p> <p>\u201cNo. So why don\u2019t you tell me what it is?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m processing applications and then screening applicants\u2019 land for the elk farm test program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Congrats on landing a big project because it\u2019s an important program to the state. How\u2019s it going so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get so many applicants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the drought, ranchers have been forced to cut down their herds. Everyone is looking for replacement income. I imagine you\u2019re getting applications from ranchers whose land fits the criteria, but have no intention of turning it into an elk farm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe director mentioned that to me. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019s wrong and all these applications are legit.\u201d After she\u2019d calmed down following the confrontation with Dalton, she wished she\u2019d had the presence of mind to ask if his application was legit. Yes, she\u2019d shown up at his place loaded for bear, but she stood by everything she\u2019d said\u2014on a professional level. On a personal level? Well, she\u2019d have to wait and see.</p><p>She tuned back in to Dillon\u2019s commentary. He hadn\u2019t noticed her momentary blip in concentration. \u201c...it\u2019s been interesting seeing it from a different angle. Any chance this temporary position could roll over into fulltime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful. This WNRC office is fully staffed. I\u2019ll return to my previous part-time position once I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>Dillon looked thoughtful. \u201cDid you take this job because it\u2019s in your hometown?\u201d</p><p>Tempting to lie, but she admitted, \u201cNo. It was the only job available.\u201d On such short notice.</p><p>\u201cExcept for the job you already had at the Wyoming State Parks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a permanent position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the pull to make it permanent,\u201d Dillon reminded her.</p><p>Didn\u2019t he understand that\u2019s why she\u2019d left? She\u2019d be stuck there with him? At least working here part-time she had options. \u201cIt was best if we didn\u2019t work together after...\u201d</p><p>Silence ensued.</p><p>Dillon sighed. \u201cYou broke it off with me without really much of a reason why.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here? To get answers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Things were going great between us and the next thing I knew, you returned the engagement ring and left town.\u201d</p><p>Going great. Right. \u201cLook, this isn\u2019t the time or the place\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen have dinner with me tonight so we can discuss it.\u201d</p><p>Crap. She\u2019d fallen right into that one.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me that much, Rory. I also wanted to mention new career opportunities for you, but it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to discuss them in your current place of business.\u201d</p><p>He knew that would intrigue her.</p><p>\u201cIs there a quiet place we can have dinner and a conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Twin Pines is a supper club outside of Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me. Will six o\u2019clock work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019ll give me time to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d look beautiful wearing a flour sack.\u201d</p><p>Dillon\u2019s compliment, while sincere, didn\u2019t affect her the same way Dalton\u2019s compliments did. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and stood. \u201cLooking forward to seeing you at six. I\u2019ll let you get back to work.\u201d He left her office.</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t take waste time dwelling on how their discussion would play out tonight. She had plenty to accomplish before then.</p><p>Three raps on her door and Glennis poked her head in. \u201cRory? Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust checking on whether...\u201d She sighed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m a snoopy busybody and I\u2019m dying to know if that man really was your ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>That startled her. \u201cThat\u2019s how Dillon introduced himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was Dillon Doland, assistant director for the Wyoming State Parks and he used to work with you. Then he chuckled and mentioned he\u2019d been engaged to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it weird he\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>Glennis\u2019s gaze sharpened behind her glasses. \u201cKnow what I find weird? That Dillon has more than a passing similarity to Dalton. Tall, dark-haired, blue eyes. Charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich describes half the men in the world,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>Glennis shook her finger. \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t realize at the time you\u2019d started something with Dillon because he reminded you of Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you and Dalton have a history, Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your familiarity the first day he sauntered in here. And sweetie, I am a Sundance native. I\u2019ve got a grasp of geography and I know you grew up practically next door to his family\u2019s ranch.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cDoes Dalton have any idea that you almost married a man who looks like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he\u2019ll do when he finds out?\u201d</p><p>Rory stared at the door after Glennis left. She was wrong. Her attraction to Dillon had nothing to do with his looks and that he had some of the same physical characteristics as Dalton.</p><p>Did it?</p><p>And besides, didn\u2019t all women have a type that appealed to them? Tall, dark-haired, blue-eyed men did it for her.</p><p>Putting it out of her mind, she got back to work.</p><p>Dillon was waiting by the hostess stand at the Twin Pines when Rory arrived.</p><p>He pulled her in for a hug and brushed a kiss on her cheek. \u201cRory. You look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d put extra effort into her appearance, wearing a form-fitting dress in dark pink, topping it with an iridescent shawl she\u2019d crocheted herself and finishing her bohemian look with bone-colored riding boots.</p><p>\u201cYou look stylish, as usual.\u201d He\u2019d worn a navy suit jacket, blue and white striped shirt, jeans and loafers. One thing about Dillon; he was always impeccably put together. Even after spending all day out inspecting parks land on horseback, he\u2019d return to the office in the same condition he\u2019d left.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rory.\u201d Naomi the manager looked between her and Dillon with a frown. As if she\u2019d expected to see her with Dalton.</p><p>Rory bristled. She could have a business dinner with whoever she wanted. And the only reason she was here was because Dillon might have a lead on a job or two for her.</p><p>Naomi led them to a table in the middle of the restaurant. \u201cI know you prefer a booth, but this is all I\u2019ve got at last minute. As you can see we\u2019re swamped tonight.\u201d</p><p>Dillon pulled out her chair. \u201cThanks.\u201d To Naomi she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Wyoming Wildfire band is playing on the club side. That gets people out on a Thursday night. Enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it that\u2019s a popular band around here?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>\u201cHugely popular. They only do one-night gigs, so they always play to packed houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes good business sense. The band I played in in college should\u2019ve done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in a band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover tunes only. I played bass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to head over after dinner and listen.\u201d</p><p>Rory agreed only because Dillon didn\u2019t dance. She checked to see who was bartending before deciding on a cosmopolitan.</p><p>After they ordered and the drinks were delivered, Rory got right to the point. \u201cI call bullshit on you just being in the neighborhood, Dil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am on WSP business. Headed to Buffalo and Sheridan to discuss a more detailed operating plan for the summer season. Part of the plan is to integrate the new with the old since two positions will be opening up. Fulltime positions. Habitat management in Sheridan and assistant park services manager in Buffalo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they new positions? Or vacancies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew position in Sheridan. In Buffalo the park services manager is retiring, his assistant is moving up to fill the position so we\u2019re hiring outside the office for a replacement.\u201d Dillon sipped his drink. \u201cDo either of those sound like something you\u2019d be interested in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, actually. When will the openings be listed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. Final selection in roughly six weeks.\u201d</p><p>That would work out perfectly. She\u2019d be done with the special project. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Rory poked his forearm. \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me. So spill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but it\u2019s not about either of those jobs. Strictly between us, there will be an opening in the Cody BLM office. Fulltime in Ag management.\u201d</p><p>BLM usually hired and promoted from within the organization before they opened up outside applications. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy is retiring. The only catch...this position is pretty much universally hated by everyone in the community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why the guy is getting out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it is why no one in that branch office has applied for the job and why the BLM is listing the position on the job boards next week.\u201d</p><p>Rory drummed her fingers on the table. \u201cThink the locals\u2019 attitudes would be worse if a woman took over the BLM job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny woman besides you? Yes. But I\u2019ve seen you in action, Rory. You can be coy and forceful. Most people don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve given you exactly what you want until they walk away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not always a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll make those good old boys believe they can \u2018manage\u2019 you right from the start. We both know better. Bob Buckman who heads that office can really use your skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting salary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFifteen grand higher than the standard because of the extra bullshit with the position. Possible yearly bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very interested in that one.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThought you might be. I already sent the paperwork to your home address with all the pertinent information for the Wyoming Parks jobs. Along with three letters of recommendation from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...above and beyond, Dil. Thanks.\u201d Rory should\u2019ve left it at that, but she didn\u2019t. \u201cBut I have to know what\u2019s in it for you to share all the info about available positions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs assistant Wyoming State Parks director, I want the best people for the jobs. You are a perfect candidate, Rory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you came to Moorcroft to tell me you mailed me some paperwork?\u201d</p><p>Dillon studied her for a moment before answering. \u201cI\u2019m here because of you and our unfinished business so don\u2019t pretend that\u2019s a big surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot pretending when I say your visit today caught me off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever see me again? As soon as Cheyenne reflected in your rearview mirror you left all the memories behind?\u201d</p><p>Pretty much, but it\u2019d hurt Dillon if she admitted she rarely thought of him. \u201cI have memories. We\u2019ll both always have them, but it\u2019s in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t get. It\u2019s not that far in the past. What did I do to make you turn away from me?\u201d He paused. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s what I didn\u2019t do?\u201d</p> <p>Rory knocked back a healthy swig of her drink. \u201cI know it sounds like a line, but I\u2019m being honest when I say it wasn\u2019t you\u2014not at all. It was one hundred percent me.\u201d</p><p>Dillon shook his head. \u201cI loved you. I wanted to spend my life with you. Doesn\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t\u2014that mean something to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to marry me in the first place?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat did we have in common besides that we worked together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both invested in our careers. We liked to watch movies. We liked to cook together. We both came from single-parent homes.\u201d He frowned. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that seem like a lot to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like enough.\u201d</p><p>That surprised him.</p><p>In for a penny. \u201cYou were nice to me when I didn\u2019t know anyone in the office. You took me under your wing and our relationship sprouted from there. We were comfortable together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd again, there\u2019s something wrong with that?\u201d he asked tartly.</p> <p>\u201cYes. I realized I wanted more out of a marriage than just companionship.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cIf you\u2019ll remember, we didn\u2019t have sex all that often. There was no intimacy between us. No passion.\u201d Rory held up her hand when he started to interrupt. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me that passion fades and a steady partnership is what really matters.\u201d</p><p>Dillon flushed.</p><p>\u201cI like you as a friend. And I mistook that friendship for something deeper. That\u2019s why I said yes to your proposal. But it\u2019s also the reason I broke it off.\u201d</p><p>The food arrived and they both dug in.</p><p>When Dillon said, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t someone else?\u201d out of the blue, Rory choked on her asparagus.</p><p>Once she\u2019d quit coughing, she assured him, \u201cNo, there wasn\u2019t anyone else. I think the break up would\u2019ve been easier for you to understand if there had been another man.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cEasier to stomach than the you lack passion and I foresaw a life of boredom with you answer I just got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDillon. I didn\u2019t say you lacked passion. I said there wasn\u2019t passion between us\u2014us\u2014which means the blame falls squarely on my shoulders too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it\u2019ve made a difference if we would\u2019ve talked about this?\u201d</p><p>Rory shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not fixable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find it hard to believe that I\u2019d want to try again?\u201d Dillon took her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful woman. Smart and funny. You\u2019re a great person, and I just let you walk out of my life without a fight.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything to fight for. What didn\u2019t he understand about that?</p><p>\u201cI can change, Rory.\u201d</p><p>She froze. What was with men always spouting off that I can change bullshit line? And why did most women believe it?</p><p>Don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you want to when it comes to Dalton?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can tell this is upsetting you.\u201d Dillon pointed to her steak. \u201cEnjoy your dinner. We can talk about this after we\u2019re done eating.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she finished her meal, she felt like she\u2019d swallowed a bowl of Mexican jumping beans. She needed to pace, move, do something besides sit here politely and eat food she couldn\u2019t enjoy. She said, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d and fled from the table.</p><p>She cut through the restaurant to the bathrooms and leaned against the hallway leading to the kitchen, taking a second to just breathe.</p><p>Why in the world would Dillon want to try again? She\u2019d just laid out all the reasons why they hadn\u2019t worked.</p><p>Wait. Was she some sort of...self-challenge? To see if he could win her back? Men were stupidly egotistical about things like that.</p><p>As she walked past the men\u2019s room, a short guy barreled right into her.</p><p>\u201cShit, I wasn\u2019t watching where I was goin\u2019.\u201d He looked up. A wide grin spread across his face. \u201cRory! Hey, are you working tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Busby, I quit, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder I ain\u2019t seen ya. So you here with Dalton?\u201d</p><p>Busby and Dalton were old friends and they\u2019d run into him when they\u2019d gone out. \u201cNo. I\u2019m with someone else.\u201d</p><p>That comment piqued Busby\u2019s interest, rather than ending it. \u201cMale or female? \u2019Cause if it\u2019s a female friend, you could introduce me to her and then the four of us could go out on a double date.\u201d</p><p>Damn nosy man. \u201cNot a woman. An old friend of mine from Cheyenne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. You guys goin\u2019 next door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave me a dance. It don\u2019t bother me none that you\u2019re taller than me.\u201d</p><p>The pervert just wanted to bury his face in her chest.</p><p>\u201cSee ya.\u201d He bustled away.</p><p>But after she returned to the dining room, she noticed Busby hadn\u2019t gone far. He eyed her from the bar as she sat next to Dillon.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. I ran into someone I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe band must be ready to start because everyone\u2019s cleared out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go whenever you are.\u201d She hoped he took that as she wanted to go home.</p><p>Dillon signaled the waitress for the check. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun to dance together since we didn\u2019t get the chance during our brief engagement.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze. \u201cYou dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. See? You don\u2019t know everything about me.\u201d</p><p>I know enough. I know when you reached out to grab my hand I felt nothing. I know when I look in your eyes I don\u2019t see burning desire that consumes you. I don\u2019t feel a sense of urgency...</p><p>\u201cThanks for dinner,\u201d she said as they waited in line.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. I think we broke new ground tonight by talking this out.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? How had their discussion encouraged him? \u201cSince I work tomorrow I\u2019ll have to leave after the first set.\u201d</p><p>Dillon paid the cover charge and they squeezed together at a tiny table in the back. \u201cYou want another drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. But go ahead if you want one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>Not likely. They\u2019d only staffed the bar with two bartenders. And this crowd liked to drink. She\u2019d made three hundred bucks last time she\u2019d worked this gig.</p><p>By the time Dillon returned, the band had started, making it hard to hold a conversation. That didn\u2019t deter Dillon. He kept trying to talk to her and she kept saying, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He did give up beyond commenting on a song or to point out a dancing couple. After he drained his drink, he took her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d</p><p>Luckily the first two songs were fast. Then the band announced the next song would end the first set.</p><p>Dillon pulled her closer and she winced when he tromped on her foot. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Rory caught herself trying to dance faster, like she could get this over with sooner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you a lot lately,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the job openings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? We weren\u2019t together that long and I\u2019m not that cool.\u201d</p><p>Dillon laughed. \u201cI forgot that you\u2019re so funny. Would it be so bad, giving me another shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking, Dillon. This isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me convince you another way.\u201d He clamped his hands over her ears and mashed their faces together, laying a kiss on her.</p><p>No. Dammit, no! She didn\u2019t want this. She tried to twist her mouth free from his, but he held fast, his tongue pushing between her lips.</p><p>Then he was ripped away from her and Dalton was in Dillon\u2019s face. \u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doin\u2019 with her?\u201d</p><p>Dillon blinked with confusion then demanded, \u201cWhat does it matter to you?\u201d</p><p>Rory tried to step between them, but Dalton was immoveable.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy problem is you, fuckface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll make you back off,\u201d Dillon snapped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton loomed even more. \u201cGonna hafta grow a bit before that happens.\u201d</p><p>People were starting to take notice.

Lover was too intimate.</p><p>\u201cWhy you havin\u2019 trouble explaining who I am to you?\u201d Dalton said without looking away from his opponent.</p><p>\u201cDalton, this is Dillon. My ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Then Dalton did turn and look at her. \u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 serious? What the hell is Dildo doin\u2019 here? Dancing with you? Goddamn kissing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t kissing him back,\u201d she said quickly.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, I know that. It\u2019s why I\u2019m so pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re the new boyfriend,\u201d Dillon said.</p><p>\u201cI am one helluva lot more to her than some simple goddamned boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, then isn\u2019t it funny she never once mentioned your name during our dinner?\u201d</p><p>Dalton made a low, snarling noise.</p> <p>\u201cA dinner in which she and I talked about getting back together?\u201d Dillon taunted. \u201cYou must not mean as much to her as you think you do, redneck.\u201d</p><p>Dalton didn\u2019t punch Dillon; he jumped him, knocking him to the floor.</p><p>Then he punched him.</p><p>Dillon rolled away and slammed his fist into the side of Dalton\u2019s head. He tried to hit Dalton in the throat, but Dalton blocked it and delivered an uppercut. Dillon looked dazed for an instant before he leveled a punch to Dalton\u2019s gut.</p><p>Unfazed, Dalton lunged for Dillon again and they both crashed to the floor. Dillon dodging Dalton\u2019s fists, bucking his hips to throw Dalton backward. Then Dillon was on top, whaling on Dalton.</p><p>Rory watched the fight, a dull roar whooshing in her head. All she could hear was the sound of her own breathing and the rapid thump of her heart.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Both men on the ground were bleeding.</p> <p>A crowd gathered, but no one stepped in to stop them.</p><p>Then they were on their feet again. Swinging at each other. Dalton picked Dillon up by his shirtfront and threw him. Dillon crashed into a table and hit the floor.</p><p>Now that the men were separated, the bouncers stepped in.</p><p>Shit, not just the bouncers. Dalton\u2019s cousin Cam McKay had one hand fisted in Dalton\u2019s shirt. Cam wasn\u2019t in his deputy\u2019s uniform but he might as well have been, the way the crowd scattered.</p><p>Rory glanced over at Dillon and saw the bouncers had helped him to his feet. A cocktail waitress handed him a wad of napkins to mop up the blood on his face.</p><p>Dillon was listening to the bouncers, not paying attention to her.</p><p>When she returned her focus to Dalton, he continued to glare at Dillon while Cam dressed him down. A spike of fear went through her when Cam beckoned her over.</p><p>\u201cYes, deputy?\u201d</p><p>Cam scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not on duty. I\u2019m here on a rare night out with my wife, so dealing with this hothead wasn\u2019t part of my plan. Goddammit, Dalton, when are you gonna learn fighting ain\u2019t the answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready learned it. I don\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was this tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warning. That fucker doesn\u2019t get to put his hands on her, or his mouth on her. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Dalton still didn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>\u201cIf I let go of you, you\u2019ll go after him again?\u201d Cam asked.</p><p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. I\u2019m taking you outside to cool you off.\u201d</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not leavin\u2019 Rory in here with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton. I can take care of myself. It was all a misunderstanding\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then he was in her face. \u201cDon\u2019t defend him. I don\u2019t give a shit what he was to you once; he\u2019s not that to you anymore. He has no rights to you. All those rights belong to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod. Like I\u2019m a piece of fucking property?\u201d</p><p>Cam grabbed Dalton\u2019s arm. \u201cNot kiddin\u2019. Outside. Now.\u201d To Rory he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton snarled something but Cam got him moving.</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t move toward Dillon until she knew Dalton was out the door. The bouncers left them alone.</p><p>Dillon was still mopping blood from beneath his nose. His right eye had swelled. Knuckle-shaped marks dotted the left side of his jaw. He\u2019d bruise, most likely. His shirt was untucked and ripped. Yeah, he didn\u2019t look so put together anymore.</p><p>He spoke first. \u201cYou could\u2019ve mentioned you were seeing a fucking psycho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was supposed to be out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s an excuse. Next you\u2019ll tell me the two of you had a big fight.\u201d</p><p>Her life was one big clich\u00e9. \u201cYeah, we did. He\u2019s the jealous type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known him since I was six. He almost married my best friend and we lost track of each other after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re both living back here,\u201d he stated flatly.</p><p>\u201cSo it appears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that coyness. I\u2019m bleeding, beat up and really pissed off at myself for coming here. So at least tell me if you\u2019ve always been in love with him.\u201d</p><p>Rory stared at him like he\u2019d just said the most idiotic thing on the planet.</p><p>Dillon pressed his point. \u201cI get it. Star-crossed lovers or something. Been in love with him since you were six. He broke your heart, or you broke his. You couldn\u2019t have him so you settled for me, a guy who kind of looks like him.\u201d</p><p>After seeing them together the only similarity between them was they were both men.</p><p>\u201cPsycho-cowboy and I have more than a passing resemblance to each other, Rory. And don\u2019t think he didn\u2019t notice it too as he was punching me in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want me to say, Dil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about goodbye? Because I finally understand that we\u2019re done. I also finally understand why you\u2019re willing to stay in a shitty-paying, low-level state job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton has nothing to do with that. I didn\u2019t even know where he lived when I took the job with the WNRC.\u201d</p><p>Dillon squinted at her. \u201cOne thing I did learn by coming here? You\u2019re right. We didn\u2019t know each other. Because the Rory I thought I knew? She would\u2019ve already filled out the applications for the positions with the Wyoming State Parks and she\u2019d be the first in line to apply for the BLM position. The Rory I knew was ambitious, planning for a career and not just settling for a job. Your skills are being wasted at the WNRC. We both know it. So I hope he\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>Rory lifted her chin. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see if he thinks I\u2019m worth it, because I am applying for those jobs, Dillon. All of them.\u201d</p><p>A calculating smile stretched across his face. \u201cGood. Now get away from me before he comes looking for you and finds you talking to me.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her purse and coat and exited through the employee entrance.</p><p>Coming around the corner, she saw Dalton pacing and Cam resting against the side of the pickup. Air puffed out of Dalton\u2019s mouth with every step. He reminded her of one of those cartoon bulls\u2014not that she\u2019d voice the comparison.</p><p>The soles of her shoes scuffed on the gravel and they both turned around.</p><p>Then Dalton was on her, his big hands gripping her biceps. \u201cWhat the fuck is goin\u2019 on, Rory? I\u2019m out of town two fucking days and I get a phone call from Busby, who says you\u2019re out with another guy? A guy who I find out just happens to be your former fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to dinner. I accepted. We have a history, Dalton, whether or not you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it. Not at fucking all. Why didn\u2019t you tell him about us?\u201d</p><p>How was she supposed to answer that?</p><p>Dalton\u2019s hands fell away.</p><p>The hurt on his face sliced through her like an ax.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...do this right now.\u201d Without another word he climbed in his truck and burned rubber getting away from her.</p><p>Cam stood beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s best to let him cool off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you. I\u2019m giving him a five-minute head start, then I\u2019m going after him. I caused this, I will cowgirl up and deal with it and with him.\u201d</p><p>Cam said nothing.</p><p>\u201cThank you for stepping in. It would\u2019ve been easier to ignore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my cousin, Rory. I\u2019d never ignore him and turn my back on him when he\u2019s hurtin\u2019. I know what that\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you understand that I won\u2019t leave him alone when he\u2019s hurting and caught in my mess.\u201d</p><p>Cam sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve broken up more of his fights than I care to admit to. I\u2019ve seen him drunk, belligerent, broken and pissed off. I\u2019ve never seen him on edge like this. So I gotta ask if you\u2019re sure you can handle him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d He\u2019d been hurt in anger too many times in his life to do it to someone else. \u201cGo in and enjoy the rest of the night with your wife.\u201d</p><p>Rory got in her car and drove to his house to face the music.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>If Dalton needed to replace the Sheetrock in the living room, he might\u2019ve put his fist through the wall. Instead, he paced. Beyond angry with himself. With Rory. With the whole fucking situation.</p><p>Since he\u2019d left Wyoming, he avoided barroom brawling. Yet, after seeing that cocksucker kissing Rory, there he was, fists leading the way. He rubbed his jaw. Guaranteed he\u2019d feel the aches and pains come morning.</p><p>He\u2019d hear about the stupidity of his public display from his brothers too. They\u2019d railed on him about his fighting ways the last two years he lived in Sundance. He hadn\u2019t been trying to prove anything; but there\u2019d been a whole slew of guys angling for bragging rights for kicking the shit out of a McKay.</p><p>So yeah, he\u2019d lost more fights than he\u2019d won, simply because he\u2019d been in more fights than his brothers and cousins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And of course one of his cousins had to be around when he lost control\u2014and of course that cousin had to be Cam. Then again, Dalton had expected more grief from the deputy. The usual, pull your head out of your ass and quit being a little shit lecture he\u2019d gotten umpteen times.</p><p>But Cam had removed him from the situation and that was it.</p><p>Dalton hated he wouldn\u2019t have known about the situation if not for Busby\u2019s drunken phone call warning him that Rory was out with another guy.</p> <p>Come to find out it wasn\u2019t just any guy. But her ex-fianc\u00e9.</p><p>He stalked to the fridge and grabbed the orange juice, drinking straight from the carton. Whenever he wanted whiskey, or felt he needed whiskey, he thought of how Casper acted under the influence. That immediately cut the craving for booze.</p><p>He stared out the dining room window, wishing he had a pile of logs to split and stack. Every muscle in his body straining as he swung the ax. Feeling the physical vibration racing up his arms as the blade connected with the wood. Hearing the satisfying crack as force altered a solid object into pieces. Nothing was more satisfying.</p><p>Well, nothing except for raw, down-and-dirty sex.</p><p>That\u2019s when three loud raps sounded on his door.</p> <p>Go the fuck away.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Dalton. I know you\u2019re in there. I\u2019m not leaving so you may as well open the door.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t rush over; he prepped himself for the best way to send Rory on her merry way.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t lock your door so you either let me in or I\u2019ll barge in.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door.</p><p>Rory stared at him for several long seconds before she said, \u201cLet me in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the mood.\u201d He rested his forearm above his head on the doorjamb, essentially blocking her. \u201cGo home, Rory.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved to his throat. \u201cIs that a bruise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hand to touch his face and he flinched. \u201cNot kidding. Go home. You don\u2019t wanna be around me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr is it that you don\u2019t wanna be around me?\u201d she countered. \u201cBecause tough shit. I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>Dalton leaned forward until they were nose to nose. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking push me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking push me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s rich, coming from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me in, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tough enough to walk through this door?\u201d he taunted. \u201cBecause if you do, I\u2019m not letting you leave until we work this out. And we\u2019ll work it out my way.\u201d</p><p>Rory turned her face from his; he half-expected she\u2019d take the out he\u2019d offered. But she pressed her warm mouth to the bruised spot on his throat. Then she whispered, \u201cYes, I\u2019m tough enough. But you already know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>God. He was so fucking insanely in love with this woman. Curling his left hand around her nape, he consumed her mouth. No sweet start that gradually morphed into passion. Dalton took her mouth like he wanted to take her. Hard and fast, with an almost brutal possession.</p><p>She wrapped herself around him, kissing him with hunger.</p><p>When the kiss grew even more intense, he jerked her inside and kicked the door shut. He stripped off her coat and herded her toward the bedroom.</p><p>What are you doing? Sex is not the solution. She\u2019ll fuck you and walk away and nothing will get resolved.</p><p>Dalton released her and stepped back. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Rory looked confused. \u201cNo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo we\u2019re not doin\u2019 this. You wanted to talk. So talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>He brushed past her and skirted the breakfast bar. He stopped in the kitchen and grabbed the orange juice carton. \u201cTalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDil showed up at my office today on state business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. He either lied to you or you\u2019re lyin\u2019 to me, so which is it?\u201d</p><p>She flipped her hair over her shoulder. \u201cHe said it was personal so no one in the office would know he wanted to talk business with me over dinner.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed snidely. \u201cSo when Dildo had his hands on you and his tongue down your throat\u2014that was part of the plan to fool your boss? Give me a fucking break.\u201d</p><p>Rory slammed her hands on the countertop. \u201cWill you let me explain? Or do you have it all worked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you had it all worked out when you stormed in here and laid out your theories as facts that I used you and lied to you? Not only about the application for the elk farm permit but about my real reasons for starting a goddamned relationship with you?\u201d</p><p>That shut her down for a second. But she rallied back with, \u201cFine, I was an idiot, all right? Is that what you wanna hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna hear why the fuck you spent all this time talkin\u2019 to your ex-fianc\u00e9 and he knew nothin\u2019 about me. Or us. Because I\u2019m nothin\u2019 to you, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not true, Dalton and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing Rory, I don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him with guilt, shock and embarrassment.</p><p>Dalton hated he was still on such shaky ground with her. Would she ever believe he\u2019d changed? What else could he do to convince her?</p><p>Rory blurted, \u201cAfter our business discussion ended, he started saying all this ridiculous stuff about our broken engagement, regretting that he let me walk away without a fight. He said he wanted to try and win me back.\u201d</p><p>Dalton couldn\u2019t stop the snarl that accompanied, \u201cThe hell that\u2019s ever happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy that time, I wanted to leave but I told him we\u2019d listen to the band. He asked me to dance and then he kissed me.\u201d Her gaze scrutinized his face. \u201cYou were there. You know I wasn\u2019t kissing him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlls I know is that I saw his hands on you and I wanted to rip them clean off his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nearly succeeded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not, because that motherfucker got in his licks.\u201d Dalton took a long drink of juice.</p><p>\u201cI know something else is eating at you. So just say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also noticed that he and I...\u201d He paused and watched her eyes. Even after all his attempts at showing her that he was around for the long haul, she still acted so wary. \u201cWe look alike.\u201d He started toward her and she immediately retreated. \u201cHe\u2019s tall. He\u2019s got dark hair. Probably has blue eyes. And he\u2019s totally fucking in love with you. Willing to fight for you. Remind you of someone else you might know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer. Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want me to say. Just stop. Please.\u201d</p><p>No way. He\u2019d come this far. \u201cSo is it a coincidence that I look like the man you almost married? Be hard to tell us apart in a dark bar, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about in a dark room, Rory? When you were with me could you pretend I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. I haven\u2019t been with you because you reminded me of Dillon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure, all right? I was with him because at first, on the surface, he reminded me of you. But there\u2019s no comparison, Dalton. None. You\u2019re ten times the man he is.\u201d</p><p>A few beats of stunned silence passed as he waited for her to elaborate or to confess she felt something more for him than she ever had for Dildo. But her mouth remained stubbornly closed.</p><p>So Dalton kissed her.</p><p>Passion, desire, need exploded\u2014a melee of hungry mouths, frantic hands, avid bodies, harsh breathing and harsher kisses.</p><p>Dalton wanted to pin her down and fuck the memory of every other man out of her brain and out her body. Imprint himself on her, in her so she\u2019d feel him as part of her even when he wasn\u2019t around. Mark her with his mouth, his teeth, his goddamn hands so she\u2019d see those marks and remember only him.</p><p>Rory dug her nails into the back of his neck. Then her hands moved down his chest, over his ribcage, across his belly, stopping at the waistband of his jeans. She nuzzled him, scattering kisses, nips and tiny licks on the cords straining in his neck. \u201cLet me show you. Any way you want. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Dalton pushed on her shoulders and she dropped to her knees. Her hands unbuckling his belt, unzipping his fly and opening his jeans. Then she yanked his boxers and jeans down, freeing his cock.</p><p>Her mouth, her goddamned mouth, so hot and wet and perfect; she destroyed him every time she sucked his cock like she was starving for it.</p><p>Well she was gonna get it all and then some tonight.</p><p>Rory worked him fast. Driving him to the point where his balls tightened, where he was more animal than man, teetering in that moment when he was so fucking close to coming he could taste it.</p><p>He yanked harder on her hair. He squeezed his fingers against the side of her face, digging his thumb deeper into her neck, holding her in place as he fucked her mouth exactly as hard and deep as he wanted.</p><p>Almost, almost...he glanced down at her face and saw his hand fisting her hair so strongly it pulled her scalp. Saw the red mark on her cheek from his palm. Then he saw how she squeezed her eyes\u2014in pain?\u2014every time his dick hit the back of her throat.</p><p>You\u2019re hurting her. You\u2019re punishing her with sex.</p><p>Is that how you treat the woman you love\u2014as a vessel to pour your anger and frustration into?</p><p>No. Goddammit no.</p><p>Horrified, Dalton abruptly pulled her off his cock and held her head in his hands. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this. Never like this.\u201d He shaped her beautiful face with his fingers. \u201cI never want to touch you when I\u2019m angry, Aurora. Never.\u201d</p><p>She looked confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand myself sometimes. But this...isn\u2019t right.\u201d Dalton helped her to her feet and yanked up his clothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he took her hand and led her to his bedroom.</p><p>She was still breathing hard. Wariness darkened her eyes.</p><p>He stripped first. As he stood naked before her, his rush of masculine power had vanished, leaving him feeling vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cDalton,\u201d she whispered, trapping his face in her hands, \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Rory blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cI love you and the thought of losing you, of you walking away from me because I\u2019m not the man you want...makes me crazy. It keeps me up at night. I\u2019ve changed. But have I changed enough so you believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. \u201cYou are the man I want. Just you. I\u2019m here with you and there\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be.\u201d</p> <p>He traced her swollen lips with the pad of his thumb. \u201cI was rough. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better kiss it and make it better, huh?\u201d</p><p>Dalton kissed her. Touched her. Showed her.</p><p>She responded in that sweet melting way she always did, giving herself over to him completely.</p><p>After he\u2019d removed her clothes and they were stretched out on his bed, skin to skin, heart to heart, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re mine, jungle girl. Only ever mine. I\u2019m never letting you get away from me again.\u201d</p><p>Her satisfied moans rang in his ears as he showed her twice just how much he loved her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s gaze moved over her naked body. Lingered on her sex-mussed hair. Then he lifted that one dark eyebrow. \u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>Rory shoved him.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou can be mad at me more often if that\u2019s how we work out our differences.\u201d He leaned forward and placed a tender kiss on the cup of her shoulder. \u201cThat was...mmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm? What\u2019s mmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sexual hum of a satisfied man. Mmm. I make that sound a lot around you. Thought you\u2019d recognize it.\u201d He propped himself up on his elbow and traced her nipple with his fingertip. \u201cI don\u2019t have a bunch of smooth words. What\u2019s between us defies description. I never knew it could be like that. And it\u2019s like that between us every damn time.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t know any smooth words, my ass.</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you go on and get your mad worked out. I can take it.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you applied for a permit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were processing the applications?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cBecause it was supposed to be kept under wraps. But the people in the office knew what I was working on\u2014I blame Hannah for trying to sabotage me. And the way I told you...\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to tell you at all. Not only because I thought it\u2019d cause problems between us. I know most ranchers\u2014especially the McKays\u2014are against this program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He stroked the upper swell of her breast with the back of his knuckles. \u201cBut somehow you forgot that I\u2019m not a rancher anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t talk about our jobs. Me, mostly because I don\u2019t have one. So can we have a rational discussion about what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. When I showed up on Monday, why did you assume your family had something to do with me learning about your application?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I had a big goddamned fight with them about it on Sunday after the poker game.\u201d</p><p>As Dalton told her what\u2019d happened with the McKays, she felt even worse for how she\u2019d handled it with him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was way less than professional.\u201d</p><p>He tipped her chin up and looked into her eyes. \u201cWasn\u2019t your lack of professionalism that bothered me. I thought things had changed between us. That you understood I\u2019d changed. But you believed the worst of me from the get-go, and I ain\u2019t gonna lie. Pissed me off more than it hurt me. At first.\u201d</p><p>Rory curled into him, resting her head on his chest and trying to wrap herself around him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This isn\u2019t an excuse for the way I behaved, but seeing your application caught me off guard. I figured your family would apply in the hopes of getting selected so they could tank the program. But you\u2019re serious about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely. Since I\u2019ve been gone for three years I had no idea what\u2019d been goin\u2019 on with the laws until I saw it in the newspaper. I was really shocked to read the elk farm pilot program had made it through the Wyoming legislature and the lawmakers hadn\u2019t bowed to the livestock producers\u2019 demands and killed it in committee again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook them long enough. You should see the book of regulations just for the temporary permit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the regulations are brutal\u2014I don\u2019t envy you that\u2014I\u2019m just happy this trial might end the stranglehold that Yellowstone and The Tetons have had on the feeding grounds.\u201d</p><p>She drew circles on his chest. \u201cSo this application isn\u2019t a whim for you? And right now, I\u2019m not asking as a WNRC employee, but as your...\u201d Lover? Girlfriend?</p><p>\u201cAs my what, Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs the woman who has humbly asked your forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>Her response didn\u2019t make him happy, especially in light of the fact he\u2019d confessed his love for her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on staying here when I first left Montana. Then my priorities changed and the elk farm opportunity caught my eye. I\u2019ve done the research. It\u2019d give me something to do here instead of returning to ranching.\u201d Dalton\u2019s palm skated down her arm. \u201cMy brothers are on board with my idea. One hundred percent. Even though the rest of the McKays are not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised they\u2019re giving you full support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. If I get awarded the permit, it\u2019d give me a reason to stay and be part of the family again.\u201d</p><p>Rory tried not to freeze up. She tried to keep her breathing steady. She tried not to think about what that statement meant. An ugly, horrible thought occurred to her. For once in their relationship, she had all the power. Her decision would determine whether or not he stayed.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s hand cupped her face and he tilted her head back so he could look at her. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta know that you\u2019re gonna give me a fair shot.\u201d</p><p>She kissed the base of his thumb. \u201cIt\u2019s good that this is out in the open. But it can\u2019t all be out in the open. There are things I can\u2019t talk about, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean things about your job that you can\u2019t talk about, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, right.\u201d</p><p>Dalton knew she was hedging but he allowed it. \u201cAre we done talkin\u2019 for now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause we\u2019ve still got a lot of kissin\u2019 and makin\u2019 up to do.\u201d</p><p>In the past ten days since their big blow up, Dalton and Rory had stuck to the parameters of not discussing specifics of her job. But he wondered if she had anyone to talk to about work-related stuff, because she was really stressed. She\u2019d barely touched her lunch. \u201cYou gonna finish them fries?\u201d</p><p>Rory slid the plate at him. \u201cI told you not to order a salad because you\u2019d be hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ordered a salad because you never finish all your food and I hate to see it go to waste.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything funny or cute in response, which wasn\u2019t like her. She tapped her fingers on the table and stared into space.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot looking forward to my next inspection.\u201d</p><p>Dalton picked up her restless hand. \u201cWant me to come with you? I\u2019ll knock the guy around if he disrespects you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBizarrely sweet offer, so thank you, but I have to fight my own battles. I just wish there weren\u2019t so damn many of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all it\u2019s been this week?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you no battles when you inspect my land.\u201d He kissed her knuckles. \u201cBut the offer stands if you need a bodyguard when you\u2019re makin\u2019 your rounds. \u2019Cause sugarplum, you know how much I love your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d A naughty smile curled her lips. \u201cBut anytime you wanna dress like a bodyguard in a tight black T-shirt, black camo pants, a leather jacket and badass don\u2019t-fuck-with-me sunglasses...well, cowboy, you just go right ahead.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed.</p><p>A shadow fell across them and they both looked up.</p><p>His cousins Cord and Colt stood at the end of the table.</p><p>Awesome. Dalton hadn\u2019t seen them since the poker game and didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d say to them.</p><p>Cord smiled at Rory. \u201cHey, Rory. Haven\u2019t seen you in a while. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. How\u2019re things with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t complain.\u201d Cord looked at Dalton. \u201cDalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your lunch,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>Like hell.</p><p>\u201cI need to get to work so you can have my spot and keep Dalton company while he eats that piece of bread pudding he\u2019s been eyeing.\u201d Rory paused. \u201cUnless you\u2019re here to gang up on him? I\u2019ll stick around in case it gets heated.\u201d</p><p>Dalton loved that she had his back.</p><p>\u201cWe ain\u2019t gonna gang up on him,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She leaned across the table and mock whispered, \u201cLucky for them that I don\u2019t have to break out my kung fu moves in defense of you, huh?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but laugh; she cracked his ass up.</p><p>When Rory slipped out of the booth, Dalton stood and tugged her into his arms. After kissing her soundly he said, \u201cBe careful out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you\u2019re up for doin\u2019 anything tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Rory gave him another quick peck. She reached for her coat. \u201cLater, McKays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya, Rory.\u201d Then Cord looked at Dalton. \u201cGot a minute to talk?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI guess.\u201d He signaled to the waitress. He\u2019d been in here enough times the past few weeks that she knew what he wanted. She slid a plate of warm bread pudding in front of Dalton and poured Cord and Colt each a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe owe you an apology.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019d come out quick. But his cousins weren\u2019t the type to beat around the bush. Dalton sliced off a chunk of dessert and popped it in his mouth.</p><p>Colt said, \u201cNeither of us handled the news about your plans in the best way. I\u2019d blame my reaction on booze except I don\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><p>Dalton snorted.</p><p>\u201cSo bein\u2019 an asshole is all on me, cuz, and I am sorry for that,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>\u201cWhile I still don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re doin\u2019 as far as applying for an elk farm permit for land that borders our ranch land, it don\u2019t excuse me bein\u2019 a dick to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappens a lot, according to my son,\u201d Cord grumbled.</p><p>\u201cKyler said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Cord pushed his hat up and looked at him. \u201cKid\u2019s got a case of hero worship since he\u2019s been helpin\u2019 you. So when he overheard me\u2019n AJ talkin\u2019 about what\u2019d happened after the poker game, he lit into me. Jesus. Said I was a hypocrite and if I took issue when someone tried to tell me what I could do on my land, then I had no right to tell you what to do with yours.\u201d</p><p>Dalton bit back a smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd rather than waitin\u2019 to see if he\u2019d made his point with me, he kept goin\u2019. So in addition to bein\u2019 a hypocrite, I\u2019m a controlling asshole who doesn\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like to be young. Or what it\u2019s like to want to do something besides bein\u2019 a rancher.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOuch. How\u2019d you handle that?\u201d</p><p>Cord sighed. \u201cNot well. But that\u2019s pretty much par for the course between me\u2019n Ky these days. Half the time I wanna throttle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest of the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make the most of the two years we\u2019ve got left before he heads off to college because it doesn\u2019t seem that long ago he was five and he hero worshipped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid, Cord. At least he ain\u2019t afraid to voice his opinion to you.\u201d</p><p>Colt nudged Cord. \u201cGetting off the subject.\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a more productive subject for us anyway. Not that I\u2019m one to offer up any advice about father-son relations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo change with Casper?\u201d Cord asked.</p> <p>The man is incapable of change. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gotta be hard on you guys. But I know Brandt and Tell are glad to have you back.\u201d Colt sipped his coffee. \u201cMan, did they lay into us. Between them and Kane and Kade tossing in their two cents\u2019 worth I felt about an inch high by the time they finished with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Cord added. \u201cThough I\u2019m pretty sure Tell was jokin\u2019 when he suggested we write our apology in blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d Dalton asked suspiciously. \u201cBecause my brothers demanded it?\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed. \u201cTake it down a notch. We\u2019re apologizing because we said a buncha shit to you that was wrong. Colby would\u2019ve come too but he got waylaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetting something fester ain\u2019t good. Best to get this out in the open, deal with it and move on,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cAlong those lines, Ben said to tell you that the two of you are squared up now. Something about you both bein\u2019 dumbasses that overreact?\u201d Colt looked at him. \u201cDoes that make any sense to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d</p><p>Cord raised an eyebrow but didn\u2019t ask specifics. \u201cSo on certain points of this issue, we\u2019ll agree to disagree for the time bein\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I appreciate the olive branch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re cool then?\u201d Colt asked.</p><p>Dalton grinned. \u201cAt least until the next poker game and you guys are pissed off that I cleaned you out again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Seething, Rory sat in the WNRC truck and beat her hands on the steering wheel, punctuating each, \u201csonuvabitching, motherfucking cocksucking goddamned asshole\u201d with another smack of her hands. When she missed and hit the horn, she scared herself so bad she screamed.</p><p>Okay. Enough. Breathe. Focus on deep cleansing breath in, negative energy out.</p><p>Rory closed her eyes. Inhale one, two, three...hold. Exhale one, two, three. Again. Three more cycles and she should\u2019ve been calmer. She shouldn\u2019t have been thinking, fucking know-it-all asswipe douchebag and imagining clipping him with the four-wheeler so hard he tumbled into the ravine.</p><p>She really, really, really fucking hated her job today.</p><p>Up at the crack of dawn, hauling an ATV on back roads two hours away. Only to be confronted by a foul-tempered, big-mouthed, sexist, ageist, government-hating rancher who spewed vitriol from the moment she\u2019d opened the pickup door until three hours later when she\u2019d finished the survey of his land for the proposed elk farm permit.</p><p>And to top it off, the smug man had only applied for the permit to fuck with the \u201cuseless, liberal-leaning, pseudo-regulatory agency\u201d that she worked for.</p><p>The trip was an entire waste of her day. She could\u2019ve checked out three other proposed landowner sites, but no, she had to give each permit equal consideration. Even those who openly professed they were dicking with her.</p><p>Rory had half a mind to report the jerk-off to the brand board for improper tagging or to the Wyoming Livestock Board, aka\u2014the Wyoming CDC-cow disease control\u2014for possible foot and mouth disease.</p><p>Sucked that she was too...honest to do it. Sometimes she wished she could just be a devious, coldhearted, vengeful bitch.</p><p>Who was she kidding? She couldn\u2019t even be honest with herself. What happened to her plan of indulging in the most amazing sex in the history of mankind with sex god Dalton McKay and not falling for him?</p><p>She was so so so screwed.</p><p>Berating herself wasn\u2019t helping. She needed a physical activity that\u2019d burn off this negativity. Too bad she couldn\u2019t chop wood. That always worked off a good mad. But her mom had replaced the wood stove in the cabin with electric heat.</p><p>Not enough snow to shovel.</p><p>She could take Jingle for a run. Except Rory didn\u2019t run\u2014ever\u2014and Jingle preferred to sit on the couch like a pampered pooch.</p><p>Yoga...for being a great workout, her mind needed stimulation, not serenity.</p><p>Rory could tag Vanessa and see if she was up for booty-shaking at the Back Porch, the college dance bar in Spearfish. But then she\u2019d be tempted to drink and she had to get up early tomorrow and face another angry rancher or three.</p><p>Wait. Wasn\u2019t a Zumba class offered at the community center tonight? The body-pumping, sweating action with loud music blocking out all her crappy, crabby thoughts was exactly what she needed.</p><p>She parked the truck and trailer in the fenced-in lot at the WNRC and hopped in her Jeep. Since she had her gym bag with her workout clothes she drove straight to the community center.</p><p>The class was jammed with women of all ages. The mood in the big gymnasium buzzed with high energy even before the class started.</p><p>Rory wasn\u2019t familiar with the routines so she picked a spot in the very back of the room. When Heather, the class leader, bounded in, headset on, hands clapping in the air, the room went wild.</p><p>Huh. She never got that kind of reaction at the start of yoga class. Then again, Heather was one of those itty bitty pocket-sized women\u2014five foot one, ninety pounds of solid muscle, gleaming red hair, alabaster skin, infectious smile. Rory could hate high-energy Heather if she wasn\u2019t the most genuinely sweet person she\u2019d ever met.</p><p>\u201cAll right, ladies! Let\u2019s get this party started. And pay attention because I\u2019m gonna sneak in some new dance moves.\u201d</p><p>The music blared from the speakers and bodies started gyrating to the beat.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, Rory was sweaty, gasping for breath and much happier. As she waited in line at the drinking fountain, laughing with other class members, her yoga student Ricki nudged her. \u201cDon\u2019t turn around, but that guy who came to your yoga class that one time is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And if his eyes could talk they\u2019d be yelling at you to strip and get on all fours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicki!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. He hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off you\u2014I mean off your butt\u2014since the moment I saw him. With the way some of the women were looking at the doorway the last ten minutes of class, he must\u2019ve been standing there watching you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were women turning around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh. Because the man is sex on legs. And he\u2019s wearing a skintight wife beater and my god, have you seen his freakin\u2019 chest and arm muscles? What does he do for a living? Lift cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he lifts logs, actually.\u201d</p><p>Ricki\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>Rory mopped her face with her towel. \u201cYep. I\u2019m sleeping with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda hate you a little bit right now.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. She took several long drinks of water before she walked over to where she\u2019d left her gym bag. Knowing Dalton\u2019s gaze was on her, she twisted her shoulders as if working out some kinks in her neck. Then she set her hands on her hips and slowly leaned forward, until the top of her head touched the floor. Hanging upside down, Rory sent him a look that said, baby, I\u2019d love to work out some kinks with you.</p><p>The depraved man grinned at her and crooked his finger.</p><p>So, yeah, maybe she added an extra sway of her hips as she sauntered over to him. And maybe she hooked her arm around his neck and gave him a big smacking kiss in front of everybody, her he\u2019s mine vibe readily apparent.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s blue eyes shone with male amusement. \u201cKiss me again. I don\u2019t think those two women in the corner quite got the message that you\u2019n me are a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d This time she hooked the towel around his neck and tugged him closer, her mouth snaring his in a steamy kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Dalton emitted that sexy rumble in the back of his throat, she broke the kiss with a quick laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou feelin\u2019 ornery, Aurora?\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019ve got a cure for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I, but it\u2019ll cost ya.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned back and raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhatcha got in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you skulking in the back watching me dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkulking,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThe damn door was open. And sugarplum, your ass is like a goddamned beacon for me. I started watching it and couldn\u2019t look away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, such a sweet-talker.\u201d Rory slid her hands up his chest. \u201cYou like the way I dance, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>She twisted her fingers in the damp tendrils on the back of his neck. \u201cRemember that night I picked you up after the bachelor party and you asked if I\u2019d give you a lap dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when we were in Deadwood and you were Mr. High Roller, begging me to give you a lap dance, peeling twenty dollar bills off the stack of cash saying, \u2018I make it rain, I make it rain, I make it rain\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Dalton grinned. \u201cAll in good fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Rory pressed her body to his. \u201cWell, I\u2019m in the mood to give you that lap dance tonight. But like I said, it\u2019s gonna cost ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay it.\u201d</p> <p>She cocked her head. \u201cJust like that? Without asking the price or the parameters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParameters?\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cLap dances don\u2019t have parameters except for no touching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lap dance has parameters \u2019cause it\u2019s not your money I\u2019m after, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour soul.\u201d Rory laughed at his skeptical look. \u201cKidding.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his hand on her ass and pulled her closer yet. He angled his head and placed one soft kiss below her ear. \u201cYou want my soul? It\u2019s yours. Since you\u2019ve already got my heart.\u201d</p><p>Oh, you suck, Dalton McKay, with your sweetness and fire and always knowing the perfect thing to say, and how the hell was I ever supposed to resist falling for you?</p><p>\u201cYou were saying,\u201d he murmured against her throat. \u201cWhat parameters were you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to be naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Rory darlin\u2019, that ain\u2019t how lap dances work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parameters, remember? If I can get you off during the lap dance, without using my hands on your...pole, then you\u2019ll agree to be my sex slave for two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you can\u2019t get me off? What\u2019s my reward?\u201d</p><p>Uh, yeah, Dalton wouldn\u2019t be able to hold off. No way, no how. Rory fought a cocky smile. \u201cThen you get to do anything you want to me. Except for demanding a threesome. Not into that. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever happening, because no one\u2014\u201d he got right in her face, \u201c\u2014and I mean no one, ever gets to put their fucking hands on you but me. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Holy balls. Talk about intense. Talk about possessive.</p><p>Talk about hot.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He relaxed. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a time limit to this lap dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. Thought you might not remember to ask about that. Five songs.\u201d</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cTwo songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Two songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree songs no more than nine minutes total.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cDeal.\u201d She kissed him. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme grab a quick shower here first\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not gonna shower either. I like your scent after you\u2019ve been working out.\u201d She turned her head and let her tongue follow the ridge of his biceps, licking the salt from his skin. \u201cI like how you taste after you\u2019ve been working out.\u201d</p><p>Dalton made that growling noise again.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought...I\u2019ll race ya.\u201d She pecked him on the mouth and practically skipped out of the gym.</p><p>But somehow, Rory still didn\u2019t beat him to his place.</p><p>Inside, Dalton leaned against the breakfast bar separating the living room and kitchen, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>Poor man wore a scowl. She dropped her coat, kicked off her shoes and moved to stand in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be looking forward to this, Dalton, not like you\u2019re about to face a firing squad.\u201d</p><p>That brought out his sexy wicked grin. \u201cTrust me, baby, I\u2019m all about this lap dance. Just thinking about what I\u2019m gonna demand from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting the cart before the horse, ain\u2019t ya, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and smooched her nose.</p><p>\u201cYou get the chair and I\u2019ll plug in my iPod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the chair gonna go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving room. You might wanna move the coffee table.\u201d</p><p>Rory scrolled through her song list and selected her seductive tunes. Then she plugged her iPod into the audio system and turned around.</p><p>The straight-backed dining room chair sat where the coffee table usually did. Dalton curled his hands over the top of it. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you to strip, but I wanna help you do that.\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned suspicious.</p><p>\u201cRelax. If you don\u2019t like something I do...tell me to stop.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou have got to be kiddin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart the music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t count as part of the lap dance. Stand still so I can strip you.\u201d Rory slipped her fingers beneath the bottom edge of his tank top and began to pull it up. When the material cleared his nipples, she gave each flat disk a kiss. Then a lick. Then a suck.</p><p>\u201cRory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what.\u201d</p><p>She jerked the shirt over his head and tossed it aside. She planted kisses down the center of his torso as she lowered herself to her knees. Hooking his gaze, she mouthed his cock, which was already hard\u2014big surprise\u2014through the material.</p><p>\u201cRory!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAll right.\u201d Hooking her fingers in the stretchy waistband, she slowly tugged the shorts down, watching as the tip of his cock bounced against his lower belly. He hadn\u2019t worn a jockstrap.</p><p>\u201cWord of advice, sugarplum? You frowning at my dick ain\u2019t instilling any confidence in me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his. \u201cSorry. Just wondering if you ever wear a jockstrap or a cup when you\u2019re working out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why? Is that a weird question? Because I seriously don\u2019t know about these man things\u2014no dad growing up, remember? And since your body is so buff, that means you work out a lot, so I just wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a curious kitty. Yeah, sometimes I wear a jock. Depends on what I\u2019m doin\u2019 in the gym and what workout shorts I\u2019m wearing.\u201d He ran his knuckles down the side of her face. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But sometime, I wanna see you model them. I\u2019d probably really love how the straps frame this tight little ass of yours.\u201d Rory yanked his shorts to his ankles and licked his shaft from root to tip before opening her lips and swallowing him.</p><p>And releasing him.</p><p>And swallowing him.</p><p>She did that about five times before his big head overruled his little head.</p><p>Dalton clamped his hand on her jaw and pulled her off.</p><p>Very, very slowly she might add, but hey, who was keeping track?</p><p>She was, heh heh heh. Rory ahead by giving head, one to zero.</p><p>\u201cBack. Away. From. My. Cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d hear you say that, big guy.\u201d</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>Rory rolled to her feet and pointed to the chair. \u201cGet comfy.\u201d</p><p>Dalton grabbed a throw pillow off the couch and plopped it on the seat before he sat. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said defensively at her questioning look. \u201cThe seat is wood, you\u2019re gonna be bouncing on my lap and I don\u2019t want my balls to get pinched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor balls. I could kiss \u2019em and make \u2019em better?\u201d she cooed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be doin\u2019 that anyway when I win this lap dance off.\u201d He threw his arms wide. \u201cBring it on, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands by your sides, baby, and no touching, remember?\u201d Rory pulled the elastic band, freeing her hair from the ponytail. Shaking it loose so the soft strands swished across his face. Then she peeled off her T-shirt and ditched her sports bra. She kicked her feet out and stretched, keeping her ass right in front of him, knowing he could see her tits swaying as she loosened her muscles.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cTopless ain\u2019t fair, Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, it\u2019s so cute how you think that\u2019ll matter. Because you\u2019re goin\u2019 down.\u201d She looked over her shoulder at him and smirked. \u201cLiterally. You\u2019re gonna go down on me for two hours straight after I win this lap dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe a little hard for me to have my mouth on your pussy when my dick is gonna be buried in your sweet ass when I win.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and leaned over to turn on her iPod.</p><p>The first strains of Santana\u2019s \u201cSmooth\u201d drifted through the speakers and Rory started out with her back to him. Arms above her head. Ass swishing over his crotch, the end of her hair teasing his chest. She ground down on him a little harder each time. Feeling that hard cock twitching and jerking against the lower curve of her butt cheeks.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s heavy breathing echoed to her even over the sounds of the music.</p><p>A wave of want rolled through her. Yes, she wanted to win this contest, but mostly because she wanted to know that she\u2014the way she moved, the way she teased him\u2014turned him on as much as her mouth or her hand on his cock. She loved the byplay between them. The tension in his body. The heat in his eyes. All for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He groaned when she cupped her own breasts. And arched her back against his chest.</p><p>Then Rory sat on his right thigh and placed her hands flat on the floor, dragging her pussy up and down that rigid muscle. The cant of her hips showcased her ass. She arched and rolled like a cat, each pass making her pussy wet and her nipples harder. She stood and pressed her butt against his chest as she leaned into a forward bend with her hands around his shins.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell, you\u2019re flexible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the better to use my body to twist you into knots.\u201d Rory mounted his other leg and rolled and shimmied. Her hair swinging, her booty bouncing, sweat started to bead on her skin.</p><p>His deep voice cut through her concentration. \u201cI can feel how hot and wet your cunt is. Let me touch you and bring you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempting, cowboy, but I\u2019ve only just started. I\u2019m gonna get a lot wetter and a lot hotter in the next two songs.\u201d</p><p>The music ended.</p><p>Rory spun around and pressed her pussy against his shaft when the next song started. The chair\u2019s low proximity to the ground allowed her to raise and lower herself easily, so she kept constant pressure on Dalton\u2019s cock as she moved up and down. And the extra bonus? With her hands on those broad shoulders of his for balance, her tits were in his face. Right in his face.</p><p>The sneaky man tried to move his head back, out of range, but she just moved her hands to the back of his neck and held him in place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d She slowed and shifted her hips side to side instead of up and down.</p><p>His belly muscles quivered. His arms were stiff by his side, probably because he was clenching his fists.</p><p>Then a wet, warm tongue lashed the side of her breast and circled her nipple.</p><p>Rory stopped mid-grind. \u201cHey. Keep your mouth to yourself, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. God, I love your tits.\u201d Dalton kept his eyes locked to hers as he enclosed her nipple in his hot mouth and sucked hard.</p><p>\u201cDalton! What are you doing? You oughta lose by default.\u201d</p><p>Dalton licked and sucked and growled against her flesh. \u201cSo indignant and bossy. And yet, you\u2019re not getting these hard nipples outta my face.\u201d</p><p>Of course he\u2019d noticed that. She slid her palms to his cheeks and tipped his head back. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You said no touching with my hands. You didn\u2019t say a damn thing about not usin\u2019 my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was assumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by me. But whatever. Unless you\u2019re\u2014\u201d his eyes gleamed and he flashed his pearly whites, \u201c\u2014afraid that my mouth on you is too big a distraction?\u201d</p><p>Cocky man. Rory brought her nipple right up to his lips and said, \u201cHave at.\u201d</p> <p>Someplace in the foggy haze of being face to face, chest to chest and groin to groin with him, so close she could smell his skin, feel his heartbeat, she realized she\u2019d sort of lost control of the situation.</p><p>But if she retreated now, forcing him to stop the delicious assault on her breasts, Dalton would think she was backing off because she was losing.</p><p>Hell. No.</p><p>Rory writhed against him more forcefully. Faster. Pumping her pelvis in time to the crescendo of the music. If she kept up this pace much longer, she\u2019d be coming, not Dalton. Especially if he used his teeth on her neck. Right. There.</p><p>Not fair. The sneaky man had abandoned her nipples for her neck, completely aware that made her lose any coherent train of thought.</p><p>Needing a breather, she stopped and slid back until she balanced on his knees.</p><p>The music changed again.</p><p>Dammit. She had three minutes left to make him come. She wanted this victory.</p><p>But as Rory stared into Dalton\u2019s gorgeous face, seeing those beautifully expressive eyes and the secret way he was smiling at her, she understood they\u2019d both won.</p><p>The sultry sounds of Faith Hill singing \u201cBreathe\u201d flowed through the room.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s eyes were on her as he reached up to curl his hand on her neck. He stroked her jawline with the edge of his thumb. \u201cI remember this song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe danced to this at Keely\u2019s wedding. The way you wrapped yourself around me, and how your head just seemed to fit perfectly on my shoulder, I never wanted that song to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one of those moments,\u201d she said softly. A perfect moment.</p><p>\u201cAurora, you\u2019re beautiful, you\u2019re sexy, you just gave me the best goddamned lap dance I\u2019ve ever had, but can we be done with this now, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it a draw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes.\u201d</p><p>Dalton picked her up, took her down to the floor, stripped her yoga pants off and impaled her.</p><p>The sweetness of their conversation didn\u2019t translate to sweet lovemaking. He pounded into her. Hot, sweaty and hard. Demanding. Clasping her right hand in his left, he pinned it above their heads. Pulling her left leg up high, around his hip, opening her fully so every time he thrust, his pelvis connected with her clit.</p><p>She gasped. Instead of waiting for that gradual buildup and the explosion, she felt as if this connection was one long body-shuddering orgasm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I love seein\u2019 you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton, I... It\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s perfect. So close, baby. Bring me with you.\u201d</p><p>Rory arched up and tightened her cunt muscles around his pistoning shaft. One long hot kiss later and they hit the detonation point together.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Brandt and Tell were sitting in Tell\u2019s favorite booth when Dalton dragged himself into the Golden Boot.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He shucked his duster and hung it on the wall hook before taking his spot on Brandt\u2019s right side. He noticed they\u2019d ordered beer for themselves but not for him. \u201cYou got another round comin\u2019? Or am I buying my own beer tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure what you were drinkin\u2019 these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheap beer, same as always.\u201d Dalton gestured to the bartender for a round. Then his gaze moved from Brandt to Tell. They\u2019d both cleaned up and wore nonworking clothes. The old Dalton would\u2019ve made a sneering remark about them dressing up to please their wives, but he let it lie. \u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think something\u2019s up?\u201d Brandt asked evenly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Thursday night. You guys are both getting kids to bed and stuff during the week. I usually see you on the weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot lately, bro. You\u2019ve been spending all your weekends with Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd most weeknights,\u201d Tell added. \u201cWe asked you out last week, but you had plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRielle invited us over for supper. First time she\u2019s acknowledged me\u2019n Rory are involved, so it was kind of a big deal.\u201d He didn\u2019t know why Rory\u2019s mom intimidated the hell out of him; she just did, which was ridiculous because the woman was the same size as a garden sprite. But her love for Rory\u2014holy shit, talk about fierce. No doubt if Dalton somehow wronged her baby girl, she\u2019d just bury him in her garden and no one would ever know the difference.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not avoiding us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust certain family members?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>Meaning Casper. Maybe he oughta just buck up and tell them the truth so they could be done with this.</p><p>Lettie brought the beer to the table, mostly so she could flirt with Tell. Tell gave it right back to her in a way that had both Dalton and Brandt laughing.</p><p>Dalton took a drink of beer and settled into the booth. \u201cHow long\u2019s it been since you guys hung out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe\u2019n Georgia used to come here all the time. No surprise Jackson\u2019s arrival into our lives cut our bar time short. But we meet up with the gang at least once a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHitting the bars never was me\u2019n Jess\u2019s thing, so it\u2019s been a while for me.\u201d Brandt looked around. \u201cNothin\u2019 ever changes in here, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, not all change is good,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>Dalton decided to tackle that statement head on. \u201cHard not to feel that was directed at me, Tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d ask how far into this family shit you\u2019re willing to wade. \u2019Cause it goes a helluva lot deeper than what you\u2019re seein\u2019 on the surface.\u201d</p><p>That response jarred them into silence for a bit.</p><p>But Tell wasn\u2019t a back-down kind of guy. \u201cAnd that right there just proves my theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell, don\u2019t,\u201d Brandt warned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good, Brandt. I wanna hear his theory.\u201d</p><p>Tell leaned forward. \u201cYou didn\u2019t cut and run only because of Addie. And you knew that day you said goodbye to us that you wouldn\u2019t be comin\u2019 back anytime soon. So I gotta ask if staying away had to do with something me or Brandt had done to you.\u201d</p><p>This was it. Dalton spun his bottle on his cocktail napkin. \u201cYou guys hadn\u2019t considered that might be part of my issue until I pointed it out to you the day I left. Did any of it resonate? Or was the problem\u2014aka me\u2014solved when I bailed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, it seriously fucked us both up,\u201d Brandt said hotly. \u201cYou laid that on us, took off, and left us with such goddamned...guilt and no way to make it right with you. If your intent was to force us to stew in our own juices, then it worked.\u201d</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cWhat I said to you that day, I said without malice or without an ulterior motive. Do you wish I\u2019da just left without giving you any idea on why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days, yeah. Those days that Brandt and I spent drivin\u2019 around doin\u2019 chores together, when we couldn\u2019t talk about it because there was just another big hole in our lives, that no amount of talkin\u2019 would ever fill. You think your leavin\u2019 didn\u2019t affect us? Fuck you. We\u2019d already lost one brother and then poof, you were gone too. And we had to live with the fact that we played a part in driving you away.\u201d Tell drained his beer. \u201cFuck. I don\u2019t wanna do this. There\u2019s part of me that believes talkin\u2019 about this shit is actually gonna make it worse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You have no idea.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re here, we\u2019re here, and it\u2019s time, little bro,\u201d Brandt said in that don\u2019t argue tone.</p><p>\u201cOrder another round. We\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d Dalton headed for the bathroom, but ended up pacing in the hallway. He had a bout of motherfucking nerves that just about had him bolting out the door.</p> <p>He pressed his shoulders against the wall and closed his eyes, his last conversation with Casper three years ago pushed front and center just like it\u2019d happened yesterday.</p><p>He\u2019d been sitting outside his trailer, nursing a whiskey when Casper had shown up. As soon as the man had climbed out of his pickup, and Dalton had seen the mean set to his mouth, he slammed the booze, knowing he\u2019d need it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re out of hiding. You always have run away instead of bein\u2019 a man and facing up to your mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Dalton said nothing. His dad was on a tear and he\u2019d stay on it until he\u2019d had his full say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool for leaving that sweet Addie at the altar. Don\u2019t know how you ever convinced that nice Christian girl to marry you anyway with your reputation for drinkin\u2019, gamblin\u2019, whorin\u2019 and brawlin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He shoved his ball cap back and looked right into those cruel blue eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s a church-going, recovering alcoholic, who don\u2019t even live in this town anymore, who don\u2019t have nothin\u2019 to do with his sons, know so much about my supposed reputation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a smart mouth,\u201d Casper sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t think this scandal is gonna go away anytime soon. You really screwed the pooch on this one.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. \u201cThought you cut out all vulgar language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I said ain\u2019t as vulgar as what you done.\u201d His gaze scrutinized Dalton\u2019s every facial injury. \u201cSee some of it\u2019s already caught up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 I can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to be around the next time someone knocks that smug look off your face.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton flashed his teeth. \u201cOr you\u2019re welcome to try and do it yourself, right now, old man.\u201d</p><p>Casper snorted. \u201cSays a lot about your character that you\u2019d get off on beating me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only have yourself to blame since that\u2019s a trait I inherited from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou inherited nothin\u2019 from me,\u201d he spat. \u201c\u2019Bout time you knew the truth. So after this last stunt you pulled, I prayed for divine assistance, needing His direction. He gave me the sign I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did God tell you to do? Ride out here and berate your son until he begged for forgiveness for adding another black mark to the McKay name?\u201d Dalton demanded.</p><p>That malicious glint in his face showed again. \u201cYour mama oughta be asking for forgiveness for the lies she told. Lies everyone has always believed. But I knew. The sign is as plain as the nose on your face.\u201d</p><p>Was Casper going senile? \u201cYou ain\u2019t makin\u2019 a lick of sense. What\u2019s my nose and a sign got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your nose got to do with it? Look at that nose. That face of yours. Have you ever taken a good long look at yourself in the mirror, boy? When you ain\u2019t been preening yourself like a peacock? If you ever had, you\u2019d realize that you don\u2019t look nothin\u2019 like your brothers and you sure don\u2019t look nothin\u2019 like me.\u201d</p> <p>He had dark hair and blue eyes, just like the rest of the McKays. He was bigger than his brothers\u2014bigger than all the McKays except for Cam. \u201cCam and Carter favor the West side so that don\u2019t mean nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure does mean something. It means you ain\u2019t my kid.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking. Your mom screwed around on me and I had to look at and deal with the ugly result of that since the day you were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So I get a two-fer? You\u2019re showing that nasty-ass mean streak you\u2019re so goddamned proud of while you\u2019re telling a bald-faced lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your words. God is lookin\u2019 down on you.\u201d</p><p>No, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s always looked down on me.</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t a lie. Because blood types don\u2019t lie. And you don\u2019t have the same blood type as Luke, Brandt and Tell.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t prove anything...did it? Fuck, he\u2019d slept through that part of biology. How was he supposed to remember his brothers\u2019 blood types? When he couldn\u2019t remember his own?</p><p>\u201cAnd if you want real proof that you ain\u2019t mine? I\u2019d even take a paternity test.\u201d</p><p>A niggling feeling of unease started at the back of his neck. What if he was telling the truth?</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think your mom coddled you? Protected you? She knew I knew that you weren\u2019t my flesh and blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t coddle me and she sure as fuck didn\u2019t protect me from you or else I wouldn\u2019t have been on the receiving end of your strap so many times.\u201d Or maybe...that\u2019s why he\u2019d been singled out.</p><p>Don\u2019t fall for this.</p><p>\u201cAsk her,\u201d Casper challenged. \u201cLook her in the eye and demand to know what man she was with when she left me for a week. Oh, roundabout nine months before your birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t because you\u2019re a fucking liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t ask her because you know it\u2019s the truth. Part of you has always known you don\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no way that bastard could\u2019ve known that Dalton had always felt that way. \u201cWhy are you doin\u2019 this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past time you knew the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust me? Or everyone? You\u2019re gonna make an announcement to the world that your ex-wife fucked around on you? That\u2019ll be seen for exactly what it is: an old man\u2019s bitterness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a hoot about sharing that info with the world at large. I just thought you oughta know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? So you can hang this over my head? Threatening to spew this supposed secret to my brothers, thinking it\u2019ll keep me in line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt and Tell won\u2019t hear the truth from me. They\u2019ll hate the messenger and ignore the message, as usual.\u201d His lips twisted in a parody of a smile. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re still their brother even if you ain\u2019t my kid.\u201d</p><p>Dalton couldn\u2019t think straight. So much of who he was, was about being a McKay\u2014and all it meant to be part of that family.</p><p>Who was he if he didn\u2019t have that?</p><p>And was it really a surprise that Casper had held onto this crucial, critical information until the lowest point in Dalton\u2019s life?</p><p>No.</p><p>Casper could kick a man who was down and smile while doing it.</p><p>Dalton tried to make his voice hard and cold. \u201cWhat exactly am I supposed to do with this information, Casper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse it to find some direction,\u201d Casper snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve been content floating through life, letting your brothers do all the ranch work while you\u2019re spreading your sins across the five state area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothin\u2019 to do with the ranch so how would you know what Brandt and Tell are doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think your brothers haven\u2019t mentioned it to me a time or two, how little you\u2019re involved. It\u2019s obvious Brandt and Tell don\u2019t need your help running the ranch. And you\u2019ve got no claim on it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeings that I\u2019m not a McKay,\u201d Dalton said dully.</p><p>Casper kept his arms crossed over his chest and gave him a patronizing look. \u201cYep. Don\u2019t you be putting your burdens on folks that don\u2019t need them. When you\u2019re the real burden.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Dalton had known he had to leave Sundance right away.</p><p>He opened his eyes, surprised to find himself in the hallway of a bar and not sitting on the steps in front of his trailer watching Casper\u2019s taillights disappear.</p><p>Dalton still didn\u2019t want to tell his brothers what had gone down. But he\u2019d given this secret way too much power to wreck the brother bond he had with Brandt and Tell. He headed back to the table, his heart pounding like he\u2019d run the mile.</p><p>Brandt and Tell weren\u2019t talking. They looked up at his approach.</p><p>He knocked back his beer to wet his suddenly dry mouth. \u201cTell was partially right. I wasn\u2019t honest with you guys about why I left so fast. I made the decision after Casper showed up at my place.\u201d</p><p>Tell said, \u201cFuck, that must\u2019ve been fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it this way: it left its mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>Now that the moment was here, Dalton couldn\u2019t even look his brothers in the eye. He focused on his beer bottle, his fingernail edging the soggy label as he tried to peel it off in one piece.</p><p>No one uttered a word for an excruciatingly long time.</p><p>Finally Tell said, \u201cShit. This is gonna be bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dalton nodded.</p><p>Brandt gently pried the bottle out of Dalton\u2019s hand. When Dalton looked up at him, Brandt said, \u201cNo more stalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper said I\u2019m not his son.\u201d</p><p>Tell and Brandt exchanged a look. The why\u2019d you let him get under your skin and make you believe bullshit like that that\u2019s obviously not true look.</p><p>Then Brandt nudged another beer at him. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to walk us through it, so we can understand why you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieved him?\u201d His embarrassment turned into anger. \u201cFuck you both if you don\u2019t remember what a master manipulator Casper is. I know you\u2019ve forgiven him or something. Fine, that\u2019s your choice. I won\u2019t judge you for what you\u2019ve decided works for you and what you can live with when it comes to him.\u201d</p><p>Both his brothers squirmed\u2014as he\u2019d meant them to. Dalton didn\u2019t judge them. He deserved the same courtesy.</p><p>\u201cTake it down a notch,\u201d Tell said evenly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have some touchy-feely, all-is-forgiven attitude when it comes to Dad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brandt\u2019s face had gone the mottled red that indicated he was a hair away from exploding. \u201cHow\u2019d the conversation where Dad told you all this come about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to the trailer. Spewing his usual bullshit about me. You two only put up with me because you didn\u2019t have a choice. He baited me and like I\u2019d done way too many fucking times in my life, I took the bait.\u201d He upended his beer. \u201cHe leveled the boom that I wasn\u2019t a McKay. Mom had an affair and tried to pass me off as his kid, but he\u2019d always known I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Brandt spat. \u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you know that Mom actually nutted up and left Casper one time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Where\u2019d you hear that? From him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But Mom mentioned it in another conversation. Here\u2019s the kicker. It happened nine months before I was born.\u201d</p><p>Both Brandt and Tell\u2019s faces went white from shock.</p><p>Dalton should\u2019ve taken a breath, given them a chance to absorb it, but he kept going. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been enough to give anyone doubt, so when you add in the fact he\u2019s called me Mama\u2019s boy, a mutant, a freak and waste of space my whole life, it cements that doubt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget he secretly beat the fuck outta me for years, like I was a redheaded stepchild,\u201d he said, ignoring Tell\u2019s interruption. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve got blue eyes and dark hair, but I don\u2019t have the same blood type as you guys.\u201d</p><p>Brandt paled further.</p><p>\u201cCasper hammered away at me. And I fucking hated I stood there and let him do it. I was at the lowest point of my life\u2014other than when Luke died\u2014and he went out of his way to make it worse. To make me doubt everything I thought I knew about myself and who I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you to leave?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. He suggested no one would notice if I did go. Especially not you guys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after that conversation, nothin\u2019 could\u2019ve made me stay in Sundance. Nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell between them.</p><p>Finally Brandt said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. It mattered to me. It changed me in a fuckin\u2019 instant. I had to face the fact that so much of my identity for twenty-seven years was based on havin\u2019 the McKay last name. If I wasn\u2019t a McKay, who was I? Up until that point my life was predetermined. Grow up, get married, be part of the McKay ranch. I knew that life was no longer an option for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come to us? Talk to us?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably because that\u2019s what Casper expected me to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Mom about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t make myself ask her. Afraid to know either way, I guess. But within a month of my conversation with Casper, within a month of bein\u2019 gone from here, I felt freed. I didn\u2019t have the fear I\u2019d turn into a raging asshole for no reason. I stopped letting Casper\u2019s influence be an excuse for everything shitty I did in my life. For fightin\u2019, for drinkin\u2019, for usin\u2019 and discarding women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe it? That he\u2019s not...?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>\u201cHe offered to take me in for a paternity test, which also went a long way in convincing me that I wasn\u2019t his kid. It\u2019s a moot point to me now whether or not we share DNA. Whatever definition I needed about who I am I found on my own.\u201d He released an embarrassed laugh. \u201cI swear I haven\u2019t become some philosophical hippie-type, yammering on about finding myself. But I had to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Dalton. I don\u2019t even know what the fuck to say to this.\u201d</p><p>Dalton looked at Tell. \u201cWhich is why I didn\u2019t share this shit with you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also why you didn\u2019t wanna come back here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we supposed to do with this?\u201d</p><p>Dalton leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m asking for one thing. I don\u2019t want you to bring this up with him. Period.\u201d</p><p>Tell shook his head. \u201cThe mean motherfucker can\u2019t\u2014won\u2019t\u2014speak so it\u2019s the perfect time to give him a piece of my mind about the absolute fucking wrongness of what he done to you. \u2019Cause he can\u2019t say shit back and he\u2019ll have to sit there and take it like we did for so many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Brandt agreed.</p><p>\u201cTo what end? He\u2019s in the hospital. You really gonna be able to forgive yourselves if by layin\u2019 into him he has another stroke or something? No sir. I won\u2019t have that on my conscience or yours. So promise me you\u2019ll leave it be. Both of you. You\u2019ll never bring it up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton, be reasonable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d he bit off.</p><p>\u201cFine, fuck, I promise,\u201d Tell snapped.</p><p>Dalton looked at Brandt. \u201cYou too. I need your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cSo nothin\u2019 changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Casper? If I had a quarter for every time I hoped he\u2019d change, I\u2019d be a rich man. The whole freakin\u2019 point of this conversation was to clear the air between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than the smoke comin\u2019 outta your ears? As far as I\u2019m concerned? Yes. The topic is done. Now can we talk about something else?\u201d</p><p>They tried. But by the thirty-minute mark Dalton knew it was a lost cause. Although it was still early, they called it a night.</p><p>Brandt texted Jessie to let her know he was on his way home, but he had things to do in the barn so not to wait up.</p><p>He\u2019d managed to keep it together at the bar. But the instant he stepped into the barn, stripped off his shirt and slipped on boxing gloves, every bit of rage exploded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think. He just started hitting.</p><p>He didn\u2019t fucking care if Dalton was Casper\u2019s kid. Dalton was his fucking brother. And the fact Dalton had been hurting for three long goddamn years, with no support from either of his brothers, with him believing they thought the worst of him, that they were no different in their opinions than their dad, just kicked his rage, sorrow and sadness to another level.</p><p>And he kept hitting the bag harder.</p><p>No wonder Dalton had left. It was a wonder he\u2019d opted to return.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>He punched until he couldn\u2019t punch any more.</p><p>Once Brandt had stopped moving he felt the chill in the air. His lungs burned. His face was wet. Sweat for sure. Maybe some tears. His arms ached. As did his shoulders and his jaw. But not as much as his heart ached. The weight of it had him clinging to the heavy bag.</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>Her sweet voice roused him from the darkness as it always did.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cCome inside and let me patch you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back inside, Jess. I\u2019ll be there in a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre sound asleep.\u201d He heard her footsteps on the gravel getting closer. \u201cYou gonna tell me what happened tonight?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I can.</p><p>Jessie approached him slowly. The beat-the-fuck-out-of-the-heavy-bag sessions were rare these days, but he didn\u2019t try and hide the fact he needed them. Jessie accepted everything about him. Even this.</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t fucking know.\u201d</p><p>Her arms came around him. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ve got you. I\u2019ve always got you.\u201d</p><p>She led him into the house. In the bathroom she cleaned his hands, spreading antibiotic ointment on his bleeding and bruised knuckles. As she fixed him up, Brandt started to talk.</p><p>When he finished speaking and looked at his wife\u2019s tear-stained face, he realized something was missing. Somehow she\u2019d known at least part of the story.</p><p>\u201cJess. This doesn\u2019t come as a shock to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe part where Casper convinces Dalton he\u2019s not his kid? Yes. Then again, I shouldn\u2019t be shocked by anything that twisted fucker says or does.\u201d Jessie met his gaze. \u201cBut yes, I knew that Casper had physically abused Dalton.\u201d</p><p>Brandt fought a surge of anger. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t you tell me you knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t sure if you knew about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until after Dalton left. Tell finally told me. Just how long have you known?\u201d Brandt saw the guilt in her eyes. She\u2019d known longer than he had. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the same reason you kept it to yourself after you learned the truth from Tell.\u201d Jessie placed her hands on his cheeks. \u201cBrandt. I love you. You know that. I was married to Luke and although we had issues, one thing I\u2019d never do is break a confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven after he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then.\u201d Her eyes searched his and Brandt felt his guts twist up all over again. \u201cUp until now. I didn\u2019t tell you because I saw what it did to Luke; it ate at him like a damn cancer. He didn\u2019t know about the abuse until the day Dalton finally stood up to Casper when Dalton was fourteen years old. Luke was in the machine shed that day, sleeping off a hangover, so neither Casper nor Dalton knew he was there. When he heard the voices and Casper demanded that Dalton drop his pants...\u201d Jessie looked away.</p><p>Brandt had to clench his jaw to keep the bile from spilling out.</p><p>\u201cLuke thought Casper might\u2019ve been...sexually abusing Dalton. Evidently Luke grabbed a shovel and was ready to beat Casper to death. Then he heard Dalton go ballistic and tell Casper he wasn\u2019t taking any more beatings\u2014seven years was enough. Then Dalton punched him or something, I really don\u2019t know the specifics. I just know that after Dalton took off, Casper was shocked to see Luke. And really shocked when Luke told him if he ever laid a hand on Dalton again, he\u2019d kill him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTheir relationship wasn\u2019t great before that, but it got worse afterward. Luke had so much self-loathing for not protecting Dalton. He knew it\u2019d further crush Dalton if he realized his older brother knew about the abuse. And since Dalton had stood up to Casper that day, in Dalton\u2019s mind, he\u2019d finally put a stop to it himself. Luke figured Dalton deserved to think he was strong enough to fight back, so he couldn\u2019t ever bring it up with him or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Luke told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And he made me promise that it stayed just between us. Luke always felt it was his job to look out for you guys. To make sure Casper couldn\u2019t destroy the love you had for each other and the solidarity Luke had tried so hard to build between the four of you.\u201d</p> <p>Brandt rested his forehead on Jessie\u2019s shoulder and fell apart.</p><p>When he could breathe without it hurting, when he didn\u2019t have any tears left, she kissed him, touched him and stayed strong enough for both of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking tired of all this, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. Come on. Let\u2019s get you in bed.\u201d</p><p>Once they were in their bedroom, Brandt pulled her into his arms and her body fit against his like it was meant to. \u201cI love you. You\u2019re the best thing in my world. And I\u2019m glad that Luke didn\u2019t have to shoulder that burden alone. I\u2019m grateful he had you to talk to about it. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>After a few moments, she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t talk about Luke with me and that\u2019s fine. I just hope you are talking about him with your brothers. He deserves to be remembered and missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Tell and Dalton...you will get through this.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, just up the road, Tell sat in the driveway in front of his house for a long time before he climbed out of his truck.</p><p>Although Georgia had left the light on in the living room, he expected she\u2019d gone to bed. Which was probably good because he planned to drink a helluva lot of whiskey. Then he could blame the sick feeling on booze.</p><p>He shucked his coat and kicked off his boots. He headed directly to the liquor cabinet, pulling out the bottle of Koltiska that Brandt had given him to celebrate Jackson\u2019s birth. He remembered missing his baby brother that day. Dalton had been a part of damn near every milestone in Tell\u2019s life so it\u2019d seemed...wrong somehow for him to miss that one.</p> <p>Tell didn\u2019t even bother with a shot glass; he just chugged straight from the bottle.</p><p>How the fuck could Tell ever look at his father again with anything except disgust? With this...Casper had gone beyond alcoholic asshole unhappy with his lot in life and taking it out on everyone around him. The man was a fucking psychopath. An evil manipulator. A fucking puppet master. An evil sonuvabitch.</p><p>Casper McKay had pitted his sons against each other. He wreaked havoc with his own brothers and caused a rift in the family that\u2019d taken years to repair. He verbally abused his wife. All of those things were bad by themselves.</p><p>They should\u2019ve washed their hands of him years ago. Fuck that forgive and forget mindset. Fuck that honor thy father tenet.</p><p>There was no doubt in Tell\u2019s mind that Dalton was Casper\u2019s kid. No doubt. If Dalton had spoken to their mother, he would\u2019ve learned firsthand that Joan McKay hadn\u2019t been unfaithful. Yes, she\u2019d left Casper once. She\u2019d gone to stay with her family in Nebraska. But her aunt and uncle had convinced her that marriage was a lifelong commitment in the eyes of God and advised her to return to her husband and work it out. So she had.</p><p>Tell had accidentally overheard that conversation between his mother and mother-in-law one night last year when he\u2019d been up feeding Jackson. They\u2019d talked about their struggles with being more afraid to leave a bad marriage than to stay in it. How long it\u2019d taken to muster up the guts to leave for good.</p><p>He thought of Jackson and got that warm surge of love. How could a father do to his own child what Casper had done to Dalton? Plant the seeds that his son wasn\u2019t really his son and watch that kid cut himself off from his entire family?</p><p>Because he could. Because Casper knew Dalton wouldn\u2019t tell anyone. Just like he hadn\u2019t told anyone about the years of physical abuse he\u2019d suffered at the hands of their father.</p> <p>Fury boiled through Tell like hot lava.</p><p>What a fucked up mess.</p><p>The booze hit him hard. He shoved the bottle out of reach and cradled his head in his hands. If he felt this lost and miserable for Dalton, how had Dalton felt the last three years?</p><p>After Dalton had first left, Tell had reached out to him, but when Dalton\u2019s response times got longer, it\u2019d gotten easier to put off making that phone call. If he had any guilt, he\u2019d quickly squashed it with the self-righteous reminder that the phone lines ran both ways.</p><p>Dalton had shut himself off and they\u2019d let him. They\u2019d fucking let him.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt more like a miserable fucking excuse of a human being as he did in that moment.</p><p>The floorboard creaked behind him. \u201cTell?\u201d</p><p>He was too choked up to respond.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>A pause. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>Georgia draped her arms over his shoulders, hugging him from behind. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here, holding on to you until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Tell took the strength and comfort she offered and began to talk.</p><p>After he finished, his beautiful, sweet wife rested her damp cheek against his. No surprise his tenderhearted love had shed tears for Dalton. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What else can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doin\u2019 it. Every day you do it for me. I\u2019ve got so much...because of him. He\u2019s the one who kicked me in the ass to tell you how I felt about you. He all but gave us this house. It\u2019s fuckin\u2019 killin\u2019 me that he\u2019s been dealin\u2019 with this shit alone.\u201d Tell didn\u2019t bother to hide his tears. He just closed his eyes, held onto her and let them fall.</p><p>\u201cYou can be there for him now. You guys can get past this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he didn\u2019t want to, he wouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came back because me\u2019n Brandt didn\u2019t give him a choice. He\u2019s staying here because of Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Dalton go to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m pretty sure he hasn\u2019t told her about any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell. Baby. Rory deserves to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m making it mine.\u201d Georgia retreated and unplugged her phone from the wall charger. She scrolled through her contact list and held the phone to her ear, sliding a notepad on the counter within reach.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia. What are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. \u201cHey, Rielle, it\u2019s Georgia McKay. Look, I\u2019m sorry to be calling so late, but I need to get in touch with Rory. No, it\u2019s not an emergency. All I can say is it has to do with Dalton. Okay. I\u2019m ready.\u201d Georgia scrawled the numbers on the notepad. \u201cThanks, I appreciate it. I\u2019m sure nothing is wrong, but I wanted to check in with her. Good-night.\u201d</p><p>Georgia immediately dialed the number.</p><p>\u201cRory? Hey. It\u2019s Georgia McKay. Your mom gave me your number. Have you heard from Dalton tonight? He went out with his brothers and Tell just got home. I wondered if Dalton drove to your place afterward.\u201d Pause. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; they didn\u2019t end up in a fistfight. And Tell...he\u2019s a bit wrecked after what went down and he says Brandt is the same way. I don\u2019t know how Dalton is faring, or if he planned to call you, but I figured you\u2019d want to know. Uh-huh. As far as I know. I\u2019d start there first. If Dalton needs anything, please call us right away\u2014no matter what time it is. Thanks, Rory.\u201d She hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d</p><p>Georgia set down the phone. \u201cWhether or not Dalton tells her is his choice. But if they\u2019re involved on the level I believe they are, it\u2019s also Rory\u2019s right to know if he needs her. It\u2019s her right to be there for him.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes when she wrapped herself around him.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a bit. I should call my mom. She needs to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need some time to process this. Besides, didn\u2019t you promise Dalton you wouldn\u2019t bring it up with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We said we wouldn\u2019t bring it up with Dad. I\u2019ll honor that. But I won\u2019t keep this from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. But Joan will have plenty of sleepless nights after you talk to her. So let her have the rest of tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>The porch light was off so Rory knew Dalton wasn\u2019t expecting her.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten a little freaked out by Georgia\u2019s phone call. Whatever happened must\u2019ve been bad.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he reached out to her?</p><p>Because he\u2019s always dealt with family stuff on his own. Rory wondered if he\u2019d ever told his brothers or even his mother how often their dad had taken a strap to him.</p><p>She remembered the first time she\u2019d found him after Casper had finished with him. Dalton had tried to blame his red-rimmed eyes and wet face on hayfield dust, but she\u2019d known he\u2019d been crying. She\u2019d never seen the marks, he\u2019d never talked about it, but she had seen how Dalton winced sometimes when he sat down.</p><p>Except the summer he\u2019d grown several inches. They\u2019d met by the creek and she\u2019d been shocked by Dalton\u2019s giddiness. Now that he was bigger than his dad, the man no longer had the advantage and the beatings were over. Rory had hidden her horror at hearing the abuse Dalton had endured for years\u2014she wondered if he remembered the rapid-fire way he\u2019d blurted the whole thing out, almost like he was in shock.</p><p>She recalled crawling into her bed and crying herself to sleep. When her mom had asked her what was wrong, she couldn\u2019t tell her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What if Dalton didn\u2019t want her here?</p><p>Tough shit.</p><p>Rory marched up to the door and banged on it.</p> <p>No response.</p><p>She banged louder. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there.\u201d</p><p>The door opened. \u201cRory? What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>She ducked under the arm blocking the doorway before he could shut her out. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear from you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, sorry. I had shit goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince I\u2019m here, let\u2019s swap \u2018how was your day, dear?\u2019 stories.\u201d Rory kicked off her boots and dropped her outerwear into a pile before she headed for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just show up at someone\u2019s house at ten-thirty at night without warning.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cWhy not? You do it to me all the time.\u201d</p><p>Dalton stared at her.</p><p>Sweet Lord. His eyes were so...haunted. She automatically curled her arms around his waist and pressed herself against him. \u201cI missed you, okay? Is that so wrong?\u201d</p><p>Then Dalton squeezed her so tightly tears rushed to her eyes. \u201cNot wrong at all. I was needing...missing you too.\u201d</p> <p>The fact he admitted he needed her, yet he hadn\u2019t reached out to her, cut a little. She tipped her head back to look at him. \u201cYou know you can just call me up to chat about stuff any old time.\u201d</p><p>Dalton pushed her hair back from her face. \u201cWho called you and said I might need to chat about...stuff?\u201d</p><p>Rory considered lying, but Dalton should know his family was worried about him. \u201cGeorgia.\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned wary. \u201cWhat\u2019d she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that you had a meeting with your brothers and maybe you\u2019d need someone to talk to. Which I took as the secret McKay code that you really needed sex. And you know I\u2019m all over that and all over you whenever possible because you\u2019re a beast in the sack.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. But it was a sad smile. \u201cWill you believe me if I admit I\u2019m not in the mood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that. So what were you doing before I got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpacing out.\u201d He brushed his lips across hers. \u201cI\u2019m fine. You don\u2019t gotta hang around like I\u2019m on suicide watch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShoot. I was really looking forward to being all heroic by saving your life and shit. Way to wreck my night, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>Dalton chuckled. \u201cI see you\u2019re in one of them moods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you gonna let me stick around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be a pain in the ass while I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to watch my show?\u201d he volleyed back.</p><p>\u201cProbably. Are we watching porn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish. I DVR\u2019d the Universal Poker Tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate to point it out, McKay, but that is porn for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusted.\u201d He led her to the couch.</p><p>When she sat next to him, he grabbed her legs and draped them across his lap. He wrapped his arm around her and pulled her close. \u201cI am glad you\u2019re here, jungle girl.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour Dalton gave running commentary on every hand. Pointing out what he felt were mistakes and how he would\u2019ve played it differently.</p><p>\u201cYou know...have you ever told me why you quit the poker circuit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people assume I quit because I lost my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not most people, Dalton. But that\u2019s not the case, is it? You let people think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier than tellin\u2019 them the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cI made a fuck ton of money and quit while I was ahead.\u201d</p><p>Rory shifted to straddle his lap. She held his face in her hands, forcing him to look at her. \u201cA fuck ton? Is that an official financial term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is according to my accountant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking this because I want a detailed financial spreadsheet, but there\u2019s one thing we haven\u2019t talked about. The fact you don\u2019t have an official job. You said in the last couple of years you were a logger, and a hunting guide. Now you\u2019ve applied for the elk farm. None of which will make you rich, and yet you don\u2019t seem to be struggling to make ends meet while you\u2019re waiting for that decision to be handed down.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cDo we really have to do this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019m not asking in an official capacity.\u201d</p><p>Dalton remained quiet for a minute or so. \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019ve got enough cash and investments that I don\u2019t need a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>Then those blue, blue eyes hooked hers. \u201cForever. Since I played my cards right.\u201d</p><p>Rory groaned. \u201cI\u2019m ignoring your puntastic-ness to ask if you\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I can pick and choose what I want to do because the job interests me. Granted, I can\u2019t buy a mansion in Beverly Hills or a fleet of sports cars or a yacht, but I\u2019m comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalkin\u2019 about it smacks too much of bragging. I got to this point by havin\u2019 a successful run at poker for about four years prior to leaving here. I didn\u2019t blow the money on booze and broads\u2014well, not all of it.\u201d He smirked. \u201cEven though I was winning, I had a budget and I stuck to it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cGetting paid once a year when I was ranching meant I was already used to stretching out my money. Early on Jack Donohue gave me good financial advice. Then Chase recommended an investment guy and he\u2019s diversified my initial investments. Now I\u2019m able to live off the income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy banker. My accountant. My investment guys.\u201d He twirled a section of her hair around his finger. \u201cAnd now you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... Why don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell people that I\u2019m not a lazy drifter, picking up odd jobs here and there and shirking my ranching responsibilities, but I\u2019m independently...comfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Dalton tugged her closer by her hair and brushed those full lips over hers. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t care what people think of me, Rory. I spent way too many years tryin\u2019 to live up to family reputations and expectations. Now the only expectations I live up to are my own.\u201d</p><p>Here was her opening. \u201cIs that what happened with your brothers tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it, especially not when I have a gorgeous woman on my lap who offered to take my mind off my troubles with hot sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turned me down, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was then. Now I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 a nekkid dose of sexy you is exactly what I need.\u201d He cupped her ass and warned, \u201cHang on,\u201d before he stood. He set her on her feet and kissed her in the sweetly seductive way guaranteed to melt her resistance.</p><p>Rory threaded her fingers through his and followed him into his bedroom.</p><p>He reached for the bedside lamp but she stayed his hand. \u201cI think the darkness fits tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I love lookin\u2019 at you when you come.\u201d</p><p>She pushed his T-shirt up and he yanked it off. Then her mouth and hands were all over his warm chest. Her fingers mapping every ridge of his abdomen. Her mouth following the curve of his pectorals. She loved his chest hair. The feel of it on her face. The scent. She rubbed against it like a cat, filling her senses with him.</p><p>And while she licked and tasted and nibbled, he ran his hands through her hair. From scalp to tip. Dalton could be so gentle or he could grab a fistful and be forceful. When she used her teeth, that forceful side appeared.</p><p>He held her head in place and said, \u201cI love your mouth on my nipples.\u201d</p><p>Rory tortured him and those sexy male grunts and groans told her he enjoyed every second. While her mouth focused on his incredible chest, her hands roamed everywhere else. Over his beefy biceps and strong forearms, broad shoulders and muscular back. His masculine form wasn\u2019t only powerful, it was beautiful.</p><p>His hands cradled her head and tipped it back. \u201cAurora, did you just growl at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She twisted out of his hold and sank her teeth into the meaty slab of his pectorals. \u201cBecause I love, love, love this body of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know\u2014sweet Jesus, you\u2019re killin\u2019 me with that hot little tongue.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s fingers inched to the waistband of his sweatpants. One tug of the string and they were down around his ankles. His cock bounced against his belly. She cupped his balls, playing with them before her fingers enclosed the shaft.</p><p>Dalton hissed.</p><p>She moved her hand up and down, adding the slight twist at the head that made him crazy. Her tongue traced his collarbone from the hollow of his throat to the ball of his shoulder.</p><p>Then his hands were in her hair, his mouth taking control as he kissed her.</p><p>His passion could be overwhelming at times. But this was sweet heat. A need for tenderness. Rory fell into the kiss so completely her hand stopped moving on his cock.</p><p>Dalton finally released her lips. He whispered, \u201cI need your skin beneath my hands, Aurora.\u201d</p><p>She managed to disentangle from him and stepped back. In less than thirty seconds she was naked.</p><p>Immediately those work-roughened hands were on her.</p><p>Her body became a mass of gooseflesh, quivering from his touch. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s dark and I can\u2019t see your face, hands and knees on the center of the bed, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I love how you think you\u2019ve got a say in this, you don\u2019t.\u201d Rory put her hands on his chest and shoved with all her might.</p><p>Dalton hit the mattress and laughed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow how about you make yourself comfy in the center of the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to turn the light on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lights.\u201d Rory crawled up his body. She bent her head and licked his cock from bottom to top.</p><p>His entire body jerked.</p><p>She laughed and tongued the tip, precisely on the sweet spot. Then she slipped that hot hard shaft into her mouth and held it there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was expecting, but damn do I love your mouth on my dick.\u201d</p><p>She hummed around the thick meatiness of him and he jackknifed.</p><p>Rory eased back, an inch at a time until the wide crown rested on her bottom teeth. She suckled the tip and released him. Once again she placed her hands on his chest and shoved him back. \u201cBehave, McKay, or I\u2019ll spank you.\u201d</p> <p>That comment caused his entire body to go rigid.</p><p>She scooted up, hanging above him, hoping to see his face. But the blackness was absolute. \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry. I was kidding.\u201d She found his mouth and kissed him until he relaxed and kissed her back. Then she scattered kisses along his jawline, stopping at his ear. \u201cYou know I\u2019d never do that without your consent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His hands skated up and down her back. \u201cIt just caught me off-guard after the stuff I talked about with my brothers tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, I want you to make me forget.\u201d</p> <p>That broke her heart a little. \u201cI\u2019ll take that challenge.\u201d Rory planted kisses straight down his body from his chin to his cock. She jacked his shaft while she sucked his balls. Then she licked that stiff pole up one side and down the other. She swept her thumb across his anus as her head bobbed.</p><p>\u201cStop. I love that but I can\u2019t take much more before I blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I want you to blow?\u201d Rory nuzzled his groin, the musky scent familiar and it always made her wet.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll swing that ass of yours around and sit on my face so I can blow your mind while you\u2019re blowing mine.\u201d</p><p>She pushed up onto all fours and zigzagged her tongue from his left hipbone to his right. \u201cI want you in me, Dalton.\u201d She poised herself above his pelvis and impaled herself on his cock.</p><p>Her head fell back and she released a long groan. \u201cI\u2019ll never get used to how amazing this feels.\u201d She rode him a few more strokes and then Dalton reached for her.</p> <p>He palmed her breasts. Caressed her nipples. Followed the contour of her belly with deliberate sensual strokes until he reached where their bodies were joined. He pressed his thumb into the creamy center of her, swirling over her clit.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that word.\u201d Dalton pushed up on one arm and latched onto her nipple while working her into a writhing mass.</p><p>Rory kept a slow and steady rhythm as she braced her hands on Dalton\u2019s thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou got me so riled up I\u2019m hanging on by a thread,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you need to get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mouth on my nipple.\u201d She groaned when his hot mouth enclosed the tip. \u201cMove faster on my clit. Yes.\u201d</p><p>He thrust his pelvis up, thumb flickering madly on the exact spot. His tongue performed the identical rhythm on her nipple.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a long build-up. Rory was lost in his mouth and his hands and then zing, there it was. The sweet throb that sent her body rocketing. Her hands squeezed his quads. She gasped when Dalton\u2019s teeth scored the stiff peak of her nipple.</p> <p>Then his hands were on her hips, pushing her higher and pulling her back down. \u201cSqueeze me,\u201d he panted.</p><p>Rory angled forward to hold onto his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cRight. Like. That.\u201d He slammed into her hard one last time and his body shuddered with his release.</p><p>After a bit, Dalton fell back onto the mattress and he dragged Rory down with him. Maybe it made her a sap, but she liked that he didn\u2019t pull out right away. He kept their bodies joined as long as possible.</p><p>She connected their mouths in a deep soul kiss. She loved kissing him, but he needed extra kisses and touches tonight and it was such a joy to give them to him.</p><p>He swept her hair aside and placed his lips on the pulse pounding in her throat. \u201cYou are sexy as fuck and I\u2019m lucky you\u2019re here with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rory felt that melting sensation.</p><p>His callused hands floated over her naked back. He kissed her temple. \u201cTold you a dose of your sexy ways was the perfect antidote to my crappy night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with crappy family stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wanted an explanation on why I\u2019ve stayed away. So I gave them one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>His fingers stilled for a moment before resuming again. \u201cI told them about Casper tracking me down five days after the wedding fiasco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive days? You saw him the same day we talked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a few hours after that. And in that thirty minute conversation with him, my life changed.\u201d</p><p>Rory lifted her head to look into his eyes, but he\u2019d turned his face away from her.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cWas that why you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone the next day? Yep. Had I planned on leavin\u2019 before that conversation? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never told anyone what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until tonight.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected their bodies and covered them with the comforter. \u201cSorry. I was getting cold.\u201d She snuggled into him. \u201cIf you want to tell me, fine. But if you\u2019d rather not discuss it, I\u2019m fine with that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably oughta know.\u201d</p><p>With her cheek on his chest, Rory felt his heart rate pick up.</p><p>Then he began to talk. Relaying the conversation in a tone so dead and flat her stomach hurt.</p><p>And when he finished talking, her heart ached.</p><p>\u201cShocked you into silence. That\u2019s gotta be a first.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t be flip. I can\u2019t imagine the level of hurt you\u2019re feeling. How isolated and alone you must\u2019ve felt.</p><p>\u201cRory?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m stunned. I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p><p>Dalton kissed her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t okay.</p><p>The longer she lay there, the more upset she became. When she couldn\u2019t hold back her anger and sorrow, she untangled herself from his arms and rolled across the bed, setting her feet on the floor.</p><p>Then the tears came full force. She had to clap her hand over her mouth to keep from crying out. But she couldn\u2019t stop her body from shaking.</p><p>\u201cRory? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dalton flipped on the light. Then he was crouched in front of her. \u201cWhat... Are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I\u2019m crying.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to explain.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me something that fucking heartbreaking and just expect me to roll over and go to sleep.\u201d She covered her face with her hands. It was so wrong and she hurt for him so bad.</p><p>\u201cThis is exactly why I didn\u2019t tell you. This is the reason I didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder Georgia said Tell wasn\u2019t all right when he got home from talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. Mary fucking sunshine. Spreading love all over the goddamned place. My brothers couldn\u2019t even look me in the eyes when they left the bar. And now you\u2019re bawling in my bed.\u201d He stood abruptly. \u201cJust stop. I can\u2019t stand to have your pity.\u201d</p><p>She leapt to her feet. \u201cMy pity? That\u2019s why you think I\u2019m crying? Because I feel sorry for you? That\u2019s not it. Not even fucking close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of guilt! From the time we were kids I knew that your dad was hurting you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton winced.</p><p>\u201cI did nothing, Dalton. Nothing. I could\u2019ve told my mom or one of your brothers or even your mom but I didn\u2019t. And to find out he\u2019s still fucking with you? He\u2019s still bent on reducing you to that scared little kid? It kills me. It kills me and enrages me and if that man were in this room right now I\u2019d tear him to pieces. So I\u2019m back to crying. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve been able to do for you is to weep like some helpless little girl. Then and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby. Please. Stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. You\u2019ve deserved better from everyone around you including me. How you can even look at me...\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s hands framed her face. \u201cI look at you because I love you. That you\u2019re crying for me shreds me inside. To know that crazy wild friend, a tough girl who refused to cry after you sliced open your knee, cried for me all those years ago? That grabs me by the throat and makes it hard to breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were always so tough, McKay. I didn\u2019t want you to think I was a wussy girl so you\u2019d stop coming around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 would\u2019ve stopped me from coming around. I acted tough. A front I kept up for years. Probably why I picked so goddamn many fights. I had to prove I was tough enough to win. And if I couldn\u2019t win, then I showed them I was tough enough to take whatever was dished out.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 you would\u2019ve done back then could\u2019ve changed anything. Do you hear me? I stood there every single time he brought out the strap. Until the day I didn\u2019t.\u201d His thumbs wicked away her tears. \u201cYou were there that day. I was so damn proud of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beatings stopped. But that mean mouth of his didn\u2019t, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And it\u2019ll always be like that with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you done with him? Has sharing the truth with your brothers about what an unforgiveable asshole Casper McKay is freed you to walk away from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt freed me years ago. But knowing that past history between him and me, can you see why it was so easy for me to believe his claim that I wasn\u2019t his son?\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s eyes searched his. \u201cThat\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? Do you think you\u2019re his son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, I don\u2019t care. I spent the last three years comin\u2019 to terms with who I am. Not as a McKay, not as a rancher, not as a gambler, but as a man on my own. Once I liked that guy staring back at me in the mirror every morning, I knew it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Dalton took a step back.</p><p>That\u2019s when she noticed a half-packed suitcase behind him. \u201cDalton? Why is your suitcase out?\u201d</p><p>A guilty look crossed his face. \u201cI was heading to Montana this weekend. There\u2019s some stuff I need to get.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you also want to avoid your brothers, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He jammed his hand through his hair. \u201cYeah, that was part of it.\u201d</p><p>Rory marched up to him. \u201cYou dropped this on them tonight and then you run off the next day? How is that fair? Maybe you\u2019ve had years to come to terms with the idea you\u2019re not Casper\u2019s son, but they haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich means it\u2019ll take them more than a few hours to process it, Rory. Me goin\u2019 away for a couple of days ain\u2019t gonna matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. You\u2019re assuming a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me to butt out?\u201d</p><p>Dalton touched her face. \u201cNo, baby, I\u2019m not. I\u2019d never do that. This affects you too. It affects us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen when did you plan to tell me you were leaving?\u201d When he looked away from her, she knew. \u201cOn your way out of town.\u201d Despite her fury, she kept her tone icy. \u201cYou say you\u2019ve changed? Bullshit. You\u2019re still running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Was he trying to convince her? Or himself?</p><p>Rory got right in his face. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Stay here and deal with it. Stay here with me and let me help you deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRory\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say you love me? Prove it. Don\u2019t go.\u201d She wrapped herself around him. \u201cStay. Please. Grab that suitcase and come home with me. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her so tight she couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Dalton hadn\u2019t seen much of his brothers in the week that\u2019d passed since his...confession or whatever the hell it was. He\u2019d talked to them both on the phone. That\u2019d been easier than a face-to-face meeting, especially since Brandt and Tell were still in shock. He understood it wasn\u2019t that his brothers didn\u2019t believe him; they just didn\u2019t want to believe it.</p><p>Those conversations were the first in the past two months they hadn\u2019t asked if he\u2019d be visiting the rehab hospital.</p><p>His sweet, wonderful, thoughtful sisters-in-law had each stopped by in the guise of dropping off a decent home cooked meal for the lone McKay bachelor. He hadn\u2019t minded that Jessie hugged him a lot. He\u2019d held it together when she\u2019d broken down about Brandt\u2019s reaction after he\u2019d left the bar. While part of him was relieved to hear Brandt\u2019s reaction in front of him had been more about saving face until he could unleash his anger in private, another part hated that his brother was dealing with any guilt.</p><p>And Rory...after she\u2019d begged him not to go to Montana, something had shifted in their relationship. But he hated to think the change was because she felt sorry for him. And asking why she wanted to spend all their free time together when she\u2019d been so insistent on showing him she had a full life without him, smacked of desperation.</p> <p>So this official business meeting with Rory gave Dalton a case of nerves. He needed this elk permit. After all he\u2019d been through with his brothers, he knew that he\u2019d never return to ranching with them. As much as he\u2019d harped on honesty between them, Dalton couldn\u2019t tell Rory that the only reason he\u2019d applied for the permit was because of her. If she wasn\u2019t living here he wouldn\u2019t have bothered.</p><p>There were a number of ways she could take that\u2014none of his explanations sounded good in his head so he\u2019d be better off not giving voice to them.</p><p>And he had to take care today to separate the Rory in his bed from Rory the WNRC employee who was evaluating him. Her evaluation wasn\u2019t as a person. She wasn\u2019t judging him as a lover, or a lifelong mate, but an acceptable risk for the test program.</p><p>He\u2019d left the gate open and parked off to the side where she could see his vehicle. He hadn\u2019t unloaded the ATV he\u2019d borrowed from Tell. Rory would need to unload hers and he figured he\u2019d seem overeager if he was ready and helped her without asking. Rory was independent that way.</p><p>The wind began to blow. He checked his cell phone to see if he\u2019d missed a call. Might seem like Rory was late, but he\u2019d been twenty minutes early.</p><p>The government vehicle bounced into view and pulled up beside him.</p><p>There was a moment of awkwardness when they faced each other. But then Rory said, \u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d and leaned in, giving him a quick peck on the mouth. \u201cWe\u2019re adults. We can be professional about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. So at the risk of offending your professional status, do you need help unloading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>They were ready to go at the same time.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a preference what I show you first?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>\u201cNatural boundaries. Then where you\u2019d supplement with fencing. Proposed feed and water sites. And if there\u2019s a section not covered in snow, I\u2019d like to look at the native grass and vegetation, although I realize it\u2019s not an accurate representation this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Since I know the terrain I\u2019ll lead, but if you have any questions or need me to stop or slow down, just honk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. But a slower pace is better for me.\u201d</p><p>After adjusting their clothing, heading into the wind, Dalton started down the easiest path. He tried to catalogue the area as Rory might. It did appear a little desolate in this section. No cover at all. Rocky. There was enough vegetation in the summer to run maybe twenty head of cattle but he wasn\u2019t sure what that translated to as far as head of elk. But this wasn\u2019t the area where he\u2019d concentrate the feeding grounds.</p><p>As if she\u2019d read his mind, Rory honked. He stopped and she pulled up alongside of him.</p><p>\u201cIn your application, you didn\u2019t plan to utilize this area for anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shouted over the engines. \u201cToo close to the road. I\u2019d add higher fencing, but where I envision the habitat starting is down a little farther.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Let\u2019s go there.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived at the first section, about halfway into the piece of land, with the natural boundaries, they left the ATVs and walked.</p><p>Rory didn\u2019t say much. She took out a small notebook and wrote in it. She\u2019d ask a question or two. Do the silent survey thing and they\u2019d move on. Seemed they walked most of the bottom half of the property. She was very thorough\u2014he\u2019d give her that.</p><p>The wind kicked up and snow started coming down harder. Pretty snow\u2014huge flakes that swirled like a white tornado in the gusts of wind.</p><p>She moved closer to him. She\u2019d worn coveralls and a heavy jacket, just like he had, but even three layers wasn\u2019t much protection. \u201cGetting nasty out here. Let\u2019s head back.\u201d</p><p>The trek back to the ATVs was uphill and straight into the wind, making conversation impossible. By the time they reached the vehicles they needed to catch their breath.</p><p>Dalton faced away from the wind, resting his backside on the back end. He tugged Rory against him. \u201cLemme be your windbreak until we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it made him a sap, or stupid, but it felt right in that moment. Holding Rory while the snow blew around them. She anchored him in a way he\u2019d never imagined.</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cOkay, my lungs stopped burning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine too. I\u2019ll lead the way.\u201d</p><p>Even with all the stops on the way down, it still took them longer to get back up to the flat land.</p><p>After they\u2019d loaded their respective four-wheelers, he said, \u201cWanna sit in my truck while your vehicle warms up before you head back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great. I have some more questions anyway.\u201d</p><p>Rory ditched the hat and the hood before she loosened the scarf and pulled off her gloves. \u201cMan. I didn\u2019t know we were supposed to get a snowstorm today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d He removed his gloves and grabbed the thermos from the bench seat. He twisted the cup off the top and unscrewed the lid.</p><p>\u201cIs that...hot coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am. Don\u2019t know how hot it is anymore.\u201d Dalton poured the steaming liquid in the cup and passed it to her. \u201cHave the first sip. We\u2019ll share.\u201d</p><p>Rory tipped the cup and drank. Then she moaned. \u201cStill hot enough. God. This is heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFew things are better than a cup of hot coffee after you\u2019ve been out workin\u2019 in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She gulped the remainder and passed the empty cup back. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He poured himself a cup and couldn\u2019t help but sigh after the first sip. He reached over and cranked the heat higher. \u201cYou said you had more questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBiggest one is why do you think you can keep elk within the boundaries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re dumb. Give \u2019em food and water in the same place and they\u2019ll stick around. No different than cattle really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when the male elk are in the rut? Think the bulls will go looking across other pastures for more cows to breed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. The way to keep that from happening is limiting the number of bulls. Given the size of the farm, I\u2019d say between forty and fifty elk is the maximum number for the herd. Then cycle the bulls out after two years. Let someone else grow bulls for size and horns. I\u2019m more interested in keeping a healthy herd and that means calves. Isn\u2019t the survival rate of an elk calf in the wild under ten percent, given the number of predators?\u201d</p><p>Rory nodded. \u201cThe whole let-nature-run-its-course argument isn\u2019t valid. Especially not in Wyoming. The state has been supplementing feed for the Yellowstone and Teton herds since the 1930s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know a lot about this.\u201d He held up his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t take that the wrong way. I know you\u2019ve got a master\u2019s degree, but to be honest, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what your degrees were in. Now I understand why your boss selected you for the project. But you oughta be workin\u2019 in Yellowstone or the Tetons. Hell, you oughta be running those programs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked at him strangely. Fidgeted. \u201cCan I have another cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>Why had she hedged? \u201cSure.\u201d He poured and handed it over.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d After she took a drink, she asked, \u201cSo what will you do if another section of land is selected for this program?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been lookin\u2019 at land in Montana. My buddy Boden is one of those naturalists. He doesn\u2019t stock elk on his hunting preserve, which is just a backwards way of thinking when he already feeds the damn animals. It\u2019d be better for his business if he could guarantee an elk to the guys who pay the astronomical out of state hunting fees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have an outlet to peddle your elk flesh?\u201d she asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Dalton grabbed her hand. \u201cSo it\u2019s all on your shoulders whether or not I make this venture work here. If it\u2019s a no go...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and hated himself for the lie that was about to come out. \u201cThen maybe I\u2019ll have to go.\u201d</p> <p>Rory didn\u2019t get indignant and warn him she hated ultimatums. A shrewd look entered her eyes and vanished. \u201cWell. Then let\u2019s hope your land measures up in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance you can tell me who I\u2019m competing against?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance. But I will say I\u2019m at the tail end of these inspections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaved the best for last, huh?\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cAre you comin\u2019 over tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t planned on it. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t see you last night and I\u2019m missin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, sugarplum, if you\u2019ve got other plans. Your loss that you won\u2019t get to see the romantic surprise I had for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of romantic surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual kind. I tell you I\u2019ve got a surprise and refuse to tell you what it is.\u201d</p><p>Rory laid her hand on his cheek. \u201cYou are a horrible tease. But I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>He pressed kisses up the inside of her wrist. \u201cDrive safe.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton followed her vehicle out the gate and locked it behind him, wondering what he\u2019d been thinking, promising her a surprise.</p><p>He had a few hours to figure it out.</p><p>Rory had just finished her last inspection of the day and was finishing up notes, when her phone rang with an unfamiliar number. \u201cMay I please speak to Aurora Wetzler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so I see you did list that as your preferred name. This is Lonna Davis, administrative coordinator from the Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit in Missoula. We received your application for the opening in the Ag management division. We wondered when would be a good time to set up a phone interview with the CESU director?\u201d</p><p>Holy. Shit. Stay calm. She\u2019d sent in that application four months ago. Since she hadn\u2019t heard anything, she\u2019d assumed the position had been filled. \u201cI imagine the director is busy, so what would work best with his schedule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s free Thursday afternoon. Around three o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Is this the best number to reach you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anything changes I\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>After Rory hung up she had to recheck the caller ID to make sure she hadn\u2019t been dreaming. Yep. Montana area code.</p><p>A phone interview was huge. She hadn\u2019t made it past the application status with any of the jobs she\u2019d applied for in the last six months.</p><p>And now she had two possibilities.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten a callback from the BLM in Cody, which she hadn\u2019t expected. She had an in-person there next week\u2014barring any road-closing snowstorms. So Dalton bringing up her qualifications for a job in Yellowstone would\u2019ve been the perfect time to tell him about the interview. But then he\u2019d made that crack about leaving Sundance if he didn\u2019t get awarded a permit, and she was glad she\u2019d kept her mouth shut.</p><p>Chances were slim she\u2019d get the Yellowstone job anyway.</p><p>She\u2019d looked at the job description for the assistant\u2019s position in Buffalo and decided not to apply. Although the fulltime job paid well, it was close to what she faced every day at the WNRC\u2014busywork that had nothing to do with her degrees.</p><p>As much as she appreciated that Dillon had put in a good word for her with the Wyoming State Parks in Sheridan, even if she got a callback from them she\u2019d wonder how much of that was due to Dillon\u2019s influence.</p><p>But this CESU job...she\u2019d applied for that one on her own. So if she made it past the phone interview she might have a chance at scoring her dream job.</p><p>Rory couldn\u2019t help but squeal with excitement. But it would be nice to have someone to share her excitement with.</p><p>\u201cNo offense, Dalton, but this is not what I\u2019d call a romantic surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? A few games of ping pong will get your blood pumping.\u201d He bounced back and forth at the end of the ping pong table like a professional tennis player awaiting a serve. \u201cIt sure does mine.\u201d</p><p>Rory lobbed the ball at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any additional stimulus in the blood pumping department, Mr. McKay.\u201d</p><p>Dalton grinned. \u201cCome on baby. Show me whatcha got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suck at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You did great when we played it on the Wii.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same. It\u2019s like believing I can be a rock star because I shredded on Guitar Hero.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cShredded? Woman, I totally wiped the floor with you. High score, remember?\u201d</p><p>Rory shook her paddle at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. You are so competitive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinning competitions is the best way to prove my manliness. To show you that I can protect you and provide for you.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd rock your world with a bitchin\u2019 power ballad that makes you wanna get nekkid with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSo we playin\u2019 this or what?\u201d He crouched and spun his paddle. \u201cI\u2019ll even let you serve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m gonna lose, I\u2019ll only play if I get to pick our next activity.\u201d When she saw the glimmer in his eyes, she amended, \u201cAn activity with our clothes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot, sugarplum, that ain\u2019t no fun. Winner should get to choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Winner\u2019s choice. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Dalton pitched Rory the ball. \u201cServe it up.\u201d</p><p>The first game didn\u2019t last long; Dalton won by four points.</p><p>He said, \u201cBest two out of three?\u201d</p><p>The second game...Rory won by two points. She acted surprised. \u201cWow. We\u2019re tied up. How\u2019d that happen?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Dalton got suspicious.</p><p>And his suspicions were justified when Rory creamed him in the third game by thirteen points.</p><p>Her victory dance was short-lived. She had six feet three inches of bested cowboy in her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>Rory smirked. \u201cThink you\u2019re the only one who can bluff, McKay?\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his jaw worked as he stared at her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought this new improved Dalton would be a sore loser. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect that kind of sneaky-assed behavior from you, Rory.\u201d The hard line of his mouth softened when he grinned. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so awesome!\u201d He picked her up and spun her around. \u201cYou totally had me snowed. I might make a poker player out of you yet.\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me how you\u2019re so damn good at ping pong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bar I worked at in Laramie had a ping pong table. And since I bartended there for four years...I got pretty good. Used to have guys demand to play me for free shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many free shots did you give away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne. But the guy was a tourist and had been a championship ping pong player in China or something. So I gave him a whole bunch of shots, got him drunk and challenged him to a rematch.\u201d She buffed her nails on her shirt. \u201cI beat him. Not the most stellar example of fairness, but hey, I won and that\u2019s all that mattered to me.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed. Then he kissed her. \u201cI love that you constantly surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of surprises...how did you come up with playing ping pong as a romantic surprise for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky guess?\u201d</p><p>Rory poked him in the chest. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn odd whim?\u201d</p><p>Another two pokes to his chest as she shook her head. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the truth. I\u2019d intended to take you out for a nice dinner at Field\u2019s. Renting a private room, hiring one of them fiddle players that walks around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a strolling violinist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Whatever. Anyway, I thought it\u2019d be romantic, sharing a candlelight four course meal, champagne, roses, chocolate...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>His gaze hooked hers. \u201cBut since you inspected my land today, I worried all that hearts-and-flowers shit might look like a bribe. Not only to you but to others in the community and I\u2019d never put your professionalism at risk.\u201d He blushed but didn\u2019t look away. \u201cSo I brought you to the community center for a game of table tennis, an activity which ain\u2019t romantic and you\u2019d never mistake as a bribe. Especially since you whupped my ass.\u201d</p><p>The man was an idiot. A sweet idiot, but an idiot nonetheless. And she was so insanely in love with him it scared her.</p><p>\u201cSo since you won our battle, you choose what happens next.\u201d</p><p>Rory ran her palms down his shoulders, his biceps, his forearms. On the way back up her fingers traced the cut muscles and well defined bulk. She loved seeing him in sleeveless black T-shirts, the tighter the better. He worked hard on this body, he oughta show it off. She curled her hands around the back of his neck and leaned in to rub her mouth across his pectoral. And she got that rush of want from his scent\u2014laundry soap, sweat, deodorant and his underlying musk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRory, you keep doin\u2019 that and I won\u2019t be able to walk out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Sometimes I just look at all this\u2014\u201d her hands slowly cruised down his chest, stopping on his abdomen above his pelvis, \u201c\u2014and I\u2019m blown away that it\u2019s all mine.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s fingers on her chin lifted her face to look into her eyes. \u201cAre you admitting you own me every bit as much as I own you?\u201d</p><p>Her this-is-just-sex side didn\u2019t even bother to speak up anymore. Nor did it lodge a protest when she said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed to get you home. Now,\u201d he said in that low, dangerously sexy growl.</p><p>She swept her lips over his in a fleeting kiss. \u201cHold that thought. I won so I get to pick the next activity.\u201d Took every ounce of restraint to step back instead of closer.</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s wrestling.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNope. But it does begin with a W.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t a pool in there so it doesn\u2019t have to do with water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weight lifting. You lift; I get to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell would you wanna watch me lift weights? Lots of grunting, straining, sweating.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cGet that look off your face, jungle girl. It\u2019s not even close to sex and it sure ain\u2019t sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that, won\u2019t I? It\u2019ll be interesting to see you pump something besides me for a change.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d never actually watched a lover working out with weights before. Oh, sure, she\u2019d seen guys lifting weights in the gym. Quite a few of them had amazingly hot bodies, but it hadn\u2019t affected her beyond her appreciation for the strength and beauty of a buffed up masculine form.</p><p>But watching Dalton pumping iron? Whole. Different. Story. Seeing his biceps and triceps flexing and glistening with sweat. Taking in every inch of his bulky forearms. Seeing the strain across his shoulders beneath his T-shirt as he pulled on the weight and pulley thing. Watching the V ripple in his quads as he performed squats and that also caused the thick bulge in his calf to contract.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t like Dalton paid attention to her attentiveness to him. He remained focused on each exercise and when it ended he\u2019d move to the next one. He didn\u2019t watch his weightlifting form in the mirror like she\u2019d seen so many other gym rats do. No admiring smug glances as he stared at himself.</p><p>She knew he\u2019d started working out in hotel fitness facilities as a way to stave off boredom before poker tournaments. It wasn\u2019t like Dalton was overly muscular with biceps bigger than her waist or his own neck. He needed that strength in his logging job. He didn\u2019t work out to impress anyone, although that cut, ripped and toned body was an impressive benefit. For her.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Rory, stop doin\u2019 that.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved from his butt to his eyes. \u201cStop doing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLicking your lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I wouldn\u2019t be licking my chops, cowboy, if you didn\u2019t have the very finest chops I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all the times we\u2019ve been nekkid together, what? You weren\u2019t lookin\u2019 at me?\u201d He set down the dumbbells and perched on the edge of the weight bench.</p><p>\u201cI look at you plenty. Touch you plenty.\u201d She sauntered forward.</p> <p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get the point of this. You\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 me lifting for half an hour.\u201d</p><p>Rory straddled his legs and lowered herself onto his lap.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s hands circled her hips to steady her. \u201cWhoa, sugarplum, what are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She licked a rivulet of sweat from the hollow of his throat up to the edge of his jaw. \u201cHaving a little taste of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does that mean we\u2019re done here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sucked on his earlobe before she blew in his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s late. We\u2019re probably the only ones left in the whole place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means it\u2019s time for us to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel you getting hard,\u201d she breathed against his damp skin. She inhaled a lungful of him and sighed. \u201cYou smell delicious. Your muscles are so pumped up right now. I bet you could lift a small truck, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah. I guess.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her hand between them and lightly stroked his nipple as she strung kisses down the column of his throat. \u201cJust looking at you gets me hot. I suspected it\u2019d be sexy watching you pumping iron, but I had no idea it\u2019d make me so wet.\u201d Rory sank her teeth into the warm, salty section of skin where shoulder curved into neck. \u201cSo very, very wet and ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman, unless you want me to pin you to this weight bench and fuck you, you\u2019d better take it down a notch.\u201d</p><p>Rory pulled his hair, yanking his head back when he attempted to nudge her away from his neck. \u201cI was thinking more of you fucking me in the storage closet. But this weight bench will work.\u201d She nibbled the edge of his jaw up to his ear. \u201cOr even the ping pong table.\u201d</p><p>He groaned when her lips hit the spot that made him shiver. \u201cYou are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA master at great ideas. I know.\u201d She flicked her tongue across the spot just to feel him shudder again. \u201cSo where\u2019s it gonna be, power lifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloset.\u201d With his hands on her ass, he pushed upright and carried her to the far corner of the room. He set her on the floor and she turned to open the door. Once they were crammed into the tiny space, she didn\u2019t bother to turn on the light.</p><p>The storage closet held the usual cleaning supplies and stacks of folded towels on the shelving.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know about this place?\u201d Dalton asked against the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cFound it when I was looking for something for my yoga class. God, do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d He used his teeth on her nape.</p><p>\u201cYes... Wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo waiting. Jeans off. Panties off.\u201d</p><p>So much for being in control.</p><p>No, you do have control. \u201cYour shirt comes off too.\u201d</p><p>She only managed to get naked from the waist down before Dalton\u2019s hard, damp muscle-bound body was crowding her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking you against the wall, baby.\u201d</p><p>His deep voice vibrated from her ear straight to her clit.</p><p>\u201cBut first, since you\u2019ve been teasing me about how wet you are\u2014\u201d his big hand cupped her mound and two fingers slid down her pussy to her opening, \u201c\u2014I\u2019d better make sure.\u201d Then he plunged his fingers inside her. In and out. Twice. \u201cFuck yeah. You are dripping wet for me.\u201d</p><p>Rory drifted into that floaty space, where her body was primed, her senses were attuned to the heat and scent of his body.</p><p>He removed his fingers and she held her breath, waiting for that first hard thrust.</p><p>But his fingers touched her lips. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She parted her lips and he slipped those slick digits onto her tongue. She tasted the muskiness of her sex and the salt on Dalton\u2019s fingers.</p><p>His sexy, raspy voice exploded in her ear. \u201cSuck like you were sucking my cock.\u201d</p><p>Rory hollowed her cheeks. With his fingers all but vacuum-sealed, she sucked hard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Dalton dragged openmouthed kisses down her throat as she sucked and swallowed. \u201cFucking love that you\u2019re a dirty girl. Sucking your come from my fingers. So crazy to fuck me that you drag me into a damn storage closet.\u201d He wiggled his fingers free from her mouth and smashed their lips together in a mind-bending, orgasm-inducing kiss.</p><p>He broke free long enough to demand, \u201cJump up and hold on.\u201d</p><p>One leg up, both legs up and then her thighs were circling his waist.</p><p>Dalton pressed her against the cold cement wall with the sheer strength in his body. Holding her ass cheeks in his hands, he tilted her pelvis and plowed in to the hilt.</p><p>Her nails dug into his shoulders. Each powerful snap of his hips had her clinging to him more tightly, gasping more loudly.</p><p>The only noises coming out of his mouth were grunts and labored breaths. The heat from his chest seeped through her shirt making her wish for better skin on skin contact. Then his hips started the side-to-side grinding motion.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll get you there. Move on me. Take it. I\u2019m so close I won\u2019t last much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what\u2019ll get me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhisper dirty things in my ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d he asked, slamming into her. \u201cWhen I tell you this hot, wet cunt is sucking on my cock like you do when you deep throat me? My cock is so slippery with your juices they\u2019re running down my leg.\u201d He let his tongue trace the shell of her ear. \u201cHottest fucking thing in the world would be to see you on your knees lapping up that sweet juice on the inside of my thigh and then that wicked tongue of yours licking my dick clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. Faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that for me, wouldn\u2019t you, dirty girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please just...\u201d Rory threw her head back as the throbbing in her groin started, pulsing around Dalton\u2019s shaft from her clit rubbing against the hard ridge of his pubic bone.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m done.\u201d Dalton drove in one last time.</p><p>Her tissues were so sensitive, still tingling from her climax, that she felt every hot spurt shooting from his cock.</p><p>He shuddered in her arms. This man gave her his all every time, in so many ways.</p><p>Dalton leaned back and locked his gaze to hers. \u201cI guess a date playing ping pong is more romantic than I gave it credit for.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Dalton was finishing his second cup of coffee at seven a.m. when he heard the knock on the door. He half-expected to see Rory standing on the steps. Holding a box of doughnuts and wearing that I-want-to-bang-you smile. But the grin he had in place vanished at seeing Brandt and Tell on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>They pushed past him and they faced each other in the entryway. Both his brothers looked like hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gut tightened and he repeated, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad had another stroke sometime last night. And...\u201d Brandt closed his eyes.</p><p>And Dalton knew before Tell said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>The words hung between them.</p> <p>Did he feel sad? Guilty? Angry? Relieved?</p><p>No. He felt fucking numb. Like this was some sort of trick and they\u2019d go to the rehab hospital and Casper would be sitting there, glaring at them, with his fooled-you-boys-again look on his face. So Dalton didn\u2019t say anything, lest he say the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cThe hospital called me on my cell about five-thirty this morning when I was out feeding cattle.\u201d Brandt scrubbed his hand over his razor-stubble jaw. \u201cThey found him in bed and it, ah, appeared he\u2019d died a few hours earlier.\u201d</p><p>Dead dead dead dead dead, kept echoing in Dalton\u2019s brain.</p><p>\u201cBrandt caught me right after I finished chores and we thought we\u2019d better tell you in person.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. Say something. \u201cI\u2019ve got coffee on.\u201d He led them into the kitchen and poured two cups. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe gotta call the uncles. Three of us, three of them.\u201d</p><p>Dalton didn\u2019t want to do that. Why couldn\u2019t Brandt do it? He was the oldest.</p><p>\u201cI figured we\u2019d talk about who\u2019s calling Mom. I guess I\u2019d better call Barbara Jean too.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Dead dead dead dead dead.</p> <p>Stop. It.</p><p>\u201cDalton? Did you say something?\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Brandt drained his coffee. \u201cAin\u2019t gonna get any easier if we put it off. I\u2019ll call Carson, Tell, you call Cal, and Dalton call Charlie.\u201d Then Brandt pulled out his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cWait a second. What are we supposed to stay? That Casper is dead and we\u2019ll be in touch?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>\u201cHe has a point, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them know that\u2019s all the information we have for now, we haven\u2019t even been to the funeral home yet.\u201d</p><p>Dead dead dead dead dead.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have Uncle Charlie\u2019s number,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>Tell read off the number and Dalton punched it in. Brandt had wandered into the living room, so Dalton headed to his bedroom.</p><p>His Uncle Charlie picked up on the fourth ring. \u201cYeah, who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dalton, Uncle Charlie.\u201d</p><p>A beat passed.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for calling so early, but we got word this morning that Casper had another stroke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s uh...\u201d Dead dead dead dead dead.</p><p>\u201cHe...passed on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. The hospital called Brandt so we\u2019re letting everyone know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell, Dalton, I\u2019m sorry for you boys. I truly am.\u201d</p><p>Dalton figured he\u2019d better get used to accepting condolences. \u201cThanks, Uncle Charlie. I\u2019ll pass that along to my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that. So Carson and Cal...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt and Tell are letting them know as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Is there anything we can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now. We\u2019ll be in touch soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Don\u2019t hesitate to call on any of us, if you need us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed. Talk about feeling disjointed. None of it seemed real. And he knew it\u2019d get a lot more surreal in the upcoming days. He needed to be grounded. Almost without conscious thought he called Rory.</p><p>Resting his elbows on his knees, he waited for her to pick up.</p><p>\u201cHey, handsome. A phone call from you is a great way to start my day.\u201d</p><p>Dalton had such a sense of relief just from hearing her voice that a lump clogged his throat.</p><p>\u201cI missed you last night. I wish we were kissing each other goodbye at the door right now.\u201d</p><p>Me too.</p><p>His nonresponse tipped her off. \u201cOmigod. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cCasper had a fatal stroke last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton. I\u2019m sorry. When did you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt and Tell are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, I know you\u2019re in shock. And I wish I could be there with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You have a ton goin\u2019 on at work right now and I\u2019m not sure what all we\u2019ll be doin\u2019 today anyway. I just needed...\u201d You.</p><p>\u201cI can get an emergency day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, Rory. I don\u2019t want you to waste your time when I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will keep in contact with me today? Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. And, uh, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019m glad you called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first person I thought of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart. Take care of yourself today until I can come and take care of you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Dalton hung up. He looked at the rumpled sheets. He wanted to crawl back in bed and yank the covers over his head. Dealing with this shit was gonna suck.</p><p>But he returned to the kitchen to make plans with his brothers.</p><p>Four hours later they were in Casper\u2019s room at the rehab hospital. No time for grieving as far as the hospital was concerned; they needed the room. They provided boxes and asked if Brandt, Tell and Dalton needed help packing up. But there wasn\u2019t much of anything. Some clothes, a Bible, a few notepads, toiletries and the bedding.</p><p>After they loaded the stuff in Brandt\u2019s truck, they drove to Casper\u2019s apartment. At some point Brandt had called Casper\u2019s pastor and he agreed to meet them there.</p><p>Dalton hadn\u2019t ever stepped foot in the place and he really didn\u2019t want to be here now. When Brandt and Tell asked his opinion on what should be done with the furnishings, he suggested donating it all to the church. He knew his brothers thought he was being sarcastic, but he wasn\u2019t and was forced to explain. Someone needed this stuff a lot more than any of them did, it didn\u2019t hold sentimental value and Casper would\u2019ve preferred that anyway.</p><p>Pastor Joneki arrived. He immediately prayed for God to give them strength in their time of grieving.</p><p>Then they sat at the kitchen table and the pastor opened a folder. \u201cI have your father\u2019s funeral plans here as well as how he\u2019d like his belongings distributed.</p><p>Dalton exchanged a look with Brandt and Tell.</p><p>Brandt spoke. \u201cWhen did he make those arrangements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast year. After he had a mild stroke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d Tell demanded. \u201cBecause we didn\u2019t hear nothin\u2019 about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs was Casper\u2019s preference. He spent two days in the hospital and was released. As his spiritual counselor I wasn\u2019t allowed to divulge that information.\u201d He smiled benevolently.</p><p>Dalton bit back a nasty question about how much having a spiritual counselor cost Casper each week in the collection plate. But Pastor Joneki didn\u2019t look like the conman religious type. An aura of...comfort surrounded him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d appreciate anything you can tell us now,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cThe stroke scared him. From my understanding, his stake in his family ranch had already been dealt with. I\u2019ve not seen a copy of his will, so I\u2019ve no idea what that entails.\u201d</p><p>At least Casper hadn\u2019t been able to give his stake to the church because no doubt the man would\u2019ve done it just to spite his brothers and his sons.</p><p>\u201cAnd so you know I\u2019m on the up and up and didn\u2019t in any way coerce Casper into his generosity, he had this list notarized before he brought it to me and then we had it notarized afterward.\u201d He smiled again. \u201cIt\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interests to make sure everything is official. So let\u2019s deal with the items he\u2019s donating to the church.\u201d The pastor set the list in the center of the table and they all leaned closer to look at it.</p><p>Bottom line: he\u2019d left everything to the church. So Dalton had gotten his wish in not having to deal with rummaging through his dad\u2019s stuff.</p><p>Next he\u2019d bequeathed all the cash in his bank accounts to the church.</p><p>Tell looked at Brandt. \u201cAny idea how much that is? We talking five hundred bucks? Or half a million?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to talk to the lawyer and see what we\u2019re legally allowed to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you, I have no idea of the amount of money either. Next, on to the funeral plans. The funeral will be held at Our Lord and Savior Christian church. No visitation. Closed casket. A casket that he\u2019s already chosen through the funeral home. Hymns to be chosen at my discretion.\u201d</p><p>Dalton had the fleeting thought, Please don\u2019t pick \u201cHow Great Thou Art\u201d.</p><p>\u201cPrivate burial will be in the McKay family cemetery, next to his firstborn son Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he denote pallbearers?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>The pastor looked at his notes and frowned. \u201cHis three sons and each of his brothers\u2019 oldest sons. Six total.\u201d</p><p>So, the bastard wasn\u2019t spiting him from the grave and leaving him off as a pallbearer.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s only been a few hours, but with so many things already taken care of, have you considered a day for the funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cWith all the family livin\u2019 here three days is plenty of time.\u201d He looked at his brothers. \u201cUnless you want to try and do it Thursday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday is fine,\u201d Brandt said and Tell nodded.</p><p>The pastor stood and they all followed suit. \u201cIf you need anything at all, please don\u2019t hesitate to call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pastor Joneki, we appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch on Thursday just to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. Are any of you going to speak on your father\u2019s behalf?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brandt said at last. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it a simple ceremony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will tell you that the congregation will want to host a light meal directly after the service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper was very well-liked with the members of the congregation. They\u2019ll want to share their condolences with you.\u201d</p> <p>None of Casper\u2019s sons knew what to say to that.</p><p>The pastor left, and Brandt, Tell and Dalton stared at one another. Tell looked around and rubbed the back of his neck as if spooked by something. \u201cDo you ever get the feeling you\u2019re in a parallel universe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And on that note, let\u2019s get outta here.\u201d</p><p>Rory showed up at Dalton\u2019s house right after work. She didn\u2019t mention the half-empty bottle of Laphroaig on the coffee table in his living room. Nor did she mention the fact he stared blankly at the TV that wasn\u2019t on. She just crawled into his lap and wrapped herself around him.</p><p>Despite him dosing himself with scotch, his body was nowhere near relaxed. She ran her hands through his hair. \u201cHey.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton came out of his haze enough to say, \u201cHey,\u201d and kiss the top of her head.</p><p>She was at a loss for what to say, so she just stayed close. Whether he needed or appreciated her gentle touches wasn\u2019t the point; she just wanted him to know she was there.</p><p>After a bit he sighed. \u201cDid you want a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She got in his face. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just get a little taste from you.\u201d She pressed her lips to his. Licking and teasing until his mouth opened and her tongue snuck inside.</p><p>Rory moaned softly at the smoky mix of scotch and Dalton. She sought out every taste, keeping the kiss easy.</p><p>His hands slid up her back and curled over her shoulders, pulling her closer so they were chest to chest. Then those wonderfully rough-skinned, highly skilled hands were in her hair.</p> <p>The man had such a thing for her hair.</p><p>The kiss didn\u2019t catch fire; it stayed on the sweet side, the comforting side. The I-love-you-and-I-don\u2019t-know-how-to-help-you side.</p><p>Dalton moved his lips to her ear. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Rory.\u201d</p><p>She angled back to look into his eyes. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask you to get drunk with me, but I hit it a little hard earlier so I\u2019m done for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? I could make you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed the strands of hair he\u2019d tangled up. \u201cCome to think of it, I haven\u2019t eaten all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me fix you a quick sandwich.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d He didn\u2019t loosen his hold on her so she waited. \u201cCan you stick around a little longer after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She left a lingering kiss on his lips before she retreated to the kitchen.</p><p>Her stomach growled so she made an extra grilled cheese sandwich for herself. She heated up a can of tomato soup, found the crackers and set everything on the table.</p><p>She draped her arms around his neck from behind and kissed his temple. \u201cSoup\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>Dalton ate most of the meal. He didn\u2019t speak besides to tell her thanks for cooking for him a couple of times.</p><p>Rory couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d felt so helpless. But she wouldn\u2019t push him to talk even when she wanted to know everything running through his brain. Every weight on his heart.</p><p>He stood. \u201cI\u2019m gonna hit the shower.\u201d His gaze swept over the stove and returned to her. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about doin\u2019 them dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit bossing me around and take your shower.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she heard the water kick on, she loaded the dishwasher and cleaned up the kitchen. She poured him a glass of iced tea and left it on the coffee table next to the scotch.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a change of clothes and she\u2019d worn her uniform long enough, so she grabbed a pair of Dalton\u2019s athletic shorts, a sleeveless T-shirt and a pair of socks. She was in her bra and panties when he walked into the bedroom, holding a towel around his waist.</p><p>A little drool might\u2019ve slipped out the corner of her mouth. As many times as she\u2019d seen his sculpted body, as many times as she\u2019d had her hands and mouth all over those cut muscles and pressed herself that warm male skin, she should be used to the rolling wave of lust whenever she caught sight of him nude.</p><p>But she hoped she\u2019d never get used to it. Never take for granted this sexy hunk of man was with her. And if he had his way, he\u2019d be with her for the long haul. Rory had started to believe that might actually be possible for them.</p><p>Then he dropped the towel and that tight round butt was within reach.</p><p>Under normal circumstances she\u2019d play grab ass with him. Scrape her nails down his back while her mouth attacked the back of his neck. Or she\u2019d drop to her knees.</p><p>Rory did none of those things. \u201cI borrowed some clothes if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Dalton spared her a glance. \u201cAnything I have is yours, so no worries.\u201d He slipped on a pair of flannel pants\u2014he\u2019d gone commando, no surprise\u2014and a white T-shirt.</p><p>The man rocked a plain white tee like no one\u2019s business. She could see the muscles in back ripple. The flex of his arms showed off those biceps, triceps and forearms. Not to mention his shoulders seemed nearly as wide as the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cWhile I love how you\u2019re lookin\u2019 at me, sugarplum, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to takin\u2019 you for a tumble.\u201d</p><p>She saw he\u2019d been watching her in the mirror. \u201cI was just admiring you.\u201d She walked to him and wrapped her arms around his middle, resting her chin on his shoulder. \u201cNo pressure to get naked with me. But I won\u2019t hide my lustful thoughts from you either.\u201d</p><p>Dalton lightly brushed his lips over hers, and said, \u201cI love you. It\u2019s there. All the time. Like your lust. And I won\u2019t hide it from you or anyone else either.\u201d He planted a chaste kiss on her forehead and grabbed her hand. \u201cWatch some mindless TV with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>In the living room he flipped on the TV and stretched out on the couch. He patted the cushion and she stretched out in front of him so their bodies touched from head to toe.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the guy who clicked through channels. He picked a channel and stayed there. Some sitcom was on but Rory had no idea which one and she doubted Dalton would know either.</p><p>Talk to me. Please.</p><p>Rory felt his lips on her crown. The random kisses and constant caresses were the only sign of normalcy in him. She had no idea how much time had passed and she\u2019d started to drift off when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cThe funeral is Friday.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue seemed frozen.</p><p>\u201cWill you come with me?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that just sound like I asked you on a date to my father\u2019s funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rory rolled over and looked into his eyes, repeating, \u201cNo. We\u2019re beyond dating anyway.\u201d She placed her hand on his heart and snuggled into him.</p><p>A moment later he said, \u201cIt was seriously fuckin\u2019 bizarre today. Even now I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening.\u201d He talked in a monotone, detailing the events. She remained still, tucked against him, her thumb sweeping back and forth over his pectoral.</p><p>\u201cAfter the meeting with the pastor at the apartment we went to the funeral home.\u201d A shudder worked through him. \u201cCreepy fuckin\u2019 place. Since my dad had made arrangements beforehand, it was just some weird formality. Like if there were additional charges who\u2019d pay for them and all that bullshit. I mean, what kind of charges can a dead guy rack up?\u201d</p><p>She barely stopped herself from flinching at his flip response.</p><p>\u201cSo then this mortician asks if we want to see him, since there wouldn\u2019t be visitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt turned green like he was gonna pass out. Tell shook his head. But I...\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cI said yes.\u201d</p><p>Oh, baby, no.</p><p>\u201cSounds fuckin\u2019 horrible, but I had to see him for myself. That he really was dead, not just playin\u2019 some big goddamned joke on us, to see if we\u2019d mourn him when he was gone. And how fuckin\u2019 pathetic is it that\u2019s even a possibility? That he\u2019s such a mean bastard he might actually do something like that?\u201d He took a breath and exhaled with frustration. \u201cSo I followed the guy back to the viewing room or whatever the fuck it was. And it smelled...\u201d Dalton shuddered again. \u201cI don\u2019t even wanna talk about or think about that. Anyway, there he was, on a steel table, just like on TV, with a sheet covering him. Only part of him I could see was his head. And even though I felt like I was gonna throw the fuck up, I got close enough to look at him. Really look at his face. His skin was this pasty gray, but it was him. The only thing I could think of was he carried that goddamned sneer of his into death. So I got the hell outta there. I don\u2019t even remember what I said to Brandt and Tell. I just know when they dropped me off the first thing I did was crack open the scotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s good you got a final look at him. You\u2019ll never have to wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept wonder what the fuck is wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt nothin\u2019 when I looked at him, Rory. Nothin\u2019. Not sadness or anger or even relief. What kind of cold bastard does that make me?\u201d</p><p>Her heart was breaking for him but she managed to keep her voice from cracking. \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re in shock, okay? Give yourself a break. It\u2019s only been about twelve hours since you found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this next stage. Am I supposed to cry?\u201d</p><p>Tread lightly. \u201cI think so. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t? Does that make me an unfeeling bastard? Especially when after Luke died and all that shit went down I swore the man would never make me cry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone grieves in a different way. You won\u2019t grieve for him like you did your brother. And your brothers won\u2019t grieve the same way you do either.\u201d</p><p>He remained quiet, but tense. The way he rubbed her back fluctuated, too, between lazy and fast. Then he quit touching her entirely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect my mom to be upset,\u201d he said after a bit. \u201cBrandt called her and he said she started crying so hard he couldn\u2019t understand her. I guess Dad\u2019s girlfriend had a hard time too. Then she asked if she could sit with the family during the service and how the hell are we supposed to make that decision? My mom was married to him for forty years. By all rights she should get the goddamn sympathy from people, not some do-gooder chick Casper picked up in church. So see? I hear myself say shit like that and I feel like an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton. It doesn\u2019t make you an asshole if that\u2019s how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I really don\u2019t wanna talk about this. I don\u2019t. Knocking back the scotch did shut off the goddamned voices in my brain. I just wanted to pass out. Wake up hung-over as shit tomorrow because then at least I\u2019d feel something.\u201d</p> <p>Rory placed her fingers over his lips and tilted her head back to look at him.</p><p>But his eyes were squeezed shut.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should down that bottle of scotch.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly and her hand fell away.</p><p>Then those blue eyes were open, open in so many ways.</p> <p>\u201cScrew the scotch. I\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re more potent than a barrel of any booze.\u201d Dalton pushed her hair behind her ear. \u201cAnd when I drink you down, you fill me up. You don\u2019t leave me feeling empty.\u201d</p><p>A weird booze analogy but she\u2019d take it. He kept staring at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not what I meant. I need you to take me to the place where it\u2019s only us. Where no one else can get in. Where nothin\u2019 exists but you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that. I\u2019d love to do that. But I have to be sure you won\u2019t use the fact we made love on the day your dad died as another mark against yourself today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face. Outlining his jaw. The wide-set cheekbones. The pillow of his lips. \u201cOkay.\u201d Rory turned her head so his mouth connected with her cheek. She didn\u2019t have to say anything, he just seemed to know that she needed the connection of his lips on her skin.</p><p>He trailed soft kisses down the side of her jaw, adjusting the angle on the way back up so he was kissing her neck. Then he retreated and his fingers were tugging and twisting her hair. \u201cBedroom.\u201d</p><p>They undressed quietly, separately.</p><p>Dalton wrapped his arms around her and lowered them onto the bed. He held onto her for the longest time. She wondered what he was thinking about, if he was already regretting this, but she didn\u2019t want to break the moment. Then he stretched his body on top of hers. \u201cI love you. So fucking much.\u201d</p><p>Rory ran her fingers though his hair. \u201cI know. So please let me be what you need.\u201d</p> <p>His stormy blue eyes bored into hers. \u201cYou are everything I need.\u201d</p><p>Then Dalton kissed her so sweetly, with such surety that Rory finally believed him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Dalton decided it\u2019d been smart for Aunt Carolyn and Uncle Carson to hold the family get together after the burial at their place. That way he, Brandt and Tell and their families could leave when everything got to be too much.</p><p>He was wound as tight as a top. Shocking to see so many people at the service. Although Dalton suspected the funeral attendees were there to support the living and not pay respect to the dead.</p><p>He\u2019d kept his hand in Rory\u2019s throughout the service. When the pastor went on for ten solid minutes about the good Christian man Casper had become. How he\u2019d turned his life over to serving God. How he\u2019d proven no one is ever too old to change. And the whole time, Dalton\u2019s resentment built. His father hadn\u2019t apologized or asked for forgiveness from the family he\u2019d wronged over the years. He\u2019d added to his list of horrors he\u2019d inflicted on his sons after getting sober and finding Jesus.</p><p>Just when he decided he couldn\u2019t sit through another minute, the sermon ended. The final hymn was sung. He did his duty alongside his brothers and cousins as a pallbearer. He suffered through the endless parade of parishioners who expressed condolences and spoke highly of Casper to the point Dalton wondered if he\u2019d somehow ended up at the wrong funeral.</p><p>And even when he knew how wrong it was, he couldn\u2019t keep the thoughts from taking over his head.</p><p>So needing a minute or ten, Dalton practically sprinted outside. He stared across the pasture, wondering what happened now. Knowing the numbness he felt wasn\u2019t from the cold.</p><p>Rory wouldn\u2019t chase him down to chat. His brothers might. But they were busy wrangling kids and talking to various family members.</p><p>So color him surprised when he heard footsteps. He turned to see his Uncle Charlie ambling toward him. \u201cSo this is where you wandered off to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed some air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say as I blame you. Hard to hold a conversation in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat many people makes me a little on edge...not that I don\u2019t appreciate the family\u2019s support.\u201d Dalton sighed. \u201cBeen livin\u2019 alone in the woods too long I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have it loud like that than if everyone was sitting around staring at each other not sayin\u2019 a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He figured his uncle had a specific reason for tracking him down.</p><p>\u201cAny word on the elk farm permit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Rory\u2019s got a couple places left to inspect. And just because we\u2019re together don\u2019t mean she\u2019s gonna pick my land for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t envy her, havin\u2019 to make that decision. Even if you are the best candidate folks around here will believe you were picked because of that relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther people\u2019s opinions ain\u2019t something either of us can control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So much stuff in our lives is out of our control, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s something I hafta say to you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s gut tightened. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Casper done to you. And I don\u2019t want you getting pissed off at Ben.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cWhen did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while back. He needed a couple of days to cool off before he brought it up with me. And lemme tell you, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen my even-tempered son that upset.\u201d</p><p>Dalton said nothing.</p><p>\u201cSuppressed rage ain\u2019t really something me\u2019n Vi have had to deal with when it comes to our sons, either when they were younger or now. Don\u2019t know if that comes from me bein\u2019 a lot more laid back than Carson, Cal or Casper. Or if it\u2019s just plain dumb luck. Alls I know is if I\u2019d heard a whisper of the beatings my brother doled out to you, I would\u2019ve dealt with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I never told anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom never knew?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cCasper always knew exactly what to say to get me to fall in line. He said if I told her, he\u2019d turn the strap on her, since it was her fault that I\u2019d become a lazy mama\u2019s boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when it started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven. Old enough to take the punishment and old enough to keep quiet about it.\u201d He shifted, leaning over the fence\u2014not like he was trying to jump it and get away or anything, but it was damn tempting. \u201cMom had to go to work around that time, remember? Luke had gotten sick with pneumonia and the hospital bills were bad and we didn\u2019t have health insurance. I know Dad got pissed off at Luke like it was his fault. Anyway, with Mom workin\u2019 at the nursing home and Luke, Brandt and Tell doin\u2019 most of the chores after school, it was just me\u2019n Dad at home. Most the time he yelled at me. Or ignored me. It wasn\u2019t like he beat me every week or every month. That\u2019d be too predictable. He liked the element of surprise. His punishment tool of choice was a thin black strap. He never put the marks where anyone could see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight\u2019ve been better if he had because then maybe your mom or brothers or someone at school would\u2019ve seen \u2019em. Maybe one of us would\u2019ve seen them.\u201d Charlie fiddled with his hat, a sure sign of nerves. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have let you be. None of you boys. No excuses. No matter if we couldn\u2019t stand Casper, we should\u2019ve done more to protect you from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brothers didn\u2019t need protection. And there\u2019s no way you could\u2019ve known. My own mother lived in the house with me for years while it was goin\u2019 on and she didn\u2019t know. If someone had seen the strap marks, we both know Casper would\u2019ve said it wasn\u2019t your business on how he disciplined his sons and that would\u2019ve been the end of it.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed probably meant Charlie understood but was frustrated by the truth of the long ago situation. Dalton hadn\u2019t told him that to alleviate Charlie\u2019s guilt\u2014his uncle\u2019s guilt wasn\u2019t his problem.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve just accepted that your dad beat the shit outta you on a regular basis?\u201d Charlie demanded. \u201cChrist, Dalton, you don\u2019t think you somehow deserved it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack then? He had me convinced I did. Now? I know he was an abusive asshole who got off on a mindfuck. One thing I\u2019ll never do is make excuses for him for what he did to me. The past is the past. But I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let the memory of that consume me. Ruin me. Ruin my future. Make me into a bitter motherfucker who uses verbal and physical abuse on the people in my life. That means letting this go. I\u2019ll never be like him. Never,\u201d he repeated hotly. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of years to come to terms with this, Charlie. While I appreciate your concern, I\u2019m dealing with enough shit right now without havin\u2019 to revisit this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. It might be old news to you, but it ain\u2019t to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Uncle Carson and Uncle Cal?\u201d</p><p>Charlie shook his head. \u201cNot Vi either. Ben told me in confidence. But I refused to promise him that I wouldn\u2019t bring it up with you.\u201d He paused. \u201cOr with Casper. And I did talk to Casper about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not what Dalton had expected. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week. I needed time to cool off too. Even now that he\u2019s dead I don\u2019t regret what I said to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask what you said to him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust that there\u2019d been lots of times over the years he\u2019d pissed me off. That he\u2019d done shitty things, and selfish things, and stupid things. But all them paled in comparison to him abusing his son. I told him he was the worst kind of coward and I was ashamed of him, more so than I\u2019d ever been in my life. That if I\u2019d known what he\u2019d done to you, I\u2019da taken a strap to him myself. Then I\u2019da turned him over to Carson and Cal who\u2019d take their pound of his damn hide too. Our dad, for all his faults, never whipped us. He might\u2019ve been a gruff man with a short fuse and had no time to bear fools, but he\u2019d never done nothin\u2019 like that to any of us. So what the fuck? Where had Casper picked up that abusive behavior?</p><p>\u201cThen I warned him he couldn\u2019t blame his actions on booze, because it wasn\u2019t the goddamned bottle that\u2019d been hittin\u2019 you. I said if he thought what he was doin\u2019 to you wasn\u2019t wrong, then he wouldn\u2019t have hidden it from his wife and his sons and everyone else. I asked him how he intended to explain his actions toward a child\u2014his child\u2014when he stood in judgment before God. That he oughta hope God had a more forgiving heart than me because I\u2019d never forgive him.\u201d</p><p>Charlie looked at him. \u201cI also said he should\u2019ve spent more time begging for forgiveness from you than sitting in church pretending to be the good Christian man decent folks would shun if they knew what he\u2019d done. If they knew how black and cold his heart and soul really were they wouldn\u2019t welcome him with open arms.\u201d</p><p>Holy. Shit.</p><p>\u201cI know there are some people who\u2019d rip me to pieces for acting that way toward a man who couldn\u2019t speak to defend himself, but I stand by my actions. I did it because it was time someone took him to task. So I\u2019m hoping you ain\u2019t upset that I was the one who done it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m...shocked. But I\u2019d never judge you on doin\u2019 what you felt you needed to, Uncle Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I understand you\u2019d moved on from all that childhood bullshit, Dalton. I knew you\u2019d avoided goin\u2019 to the hospital to see him and maybe I\u2019d chalked it up to you bein\u2019 a selfish kid who needed to grow up. But I finally saw your avoidance for what it really is. Self-preservation. I admire the hell out of you for bein\u2019 the bigger man. For walking away. For not letting him define you.\u201d</p><p>Good thing Dalton was holding onto the fence or he might\u2019ve fallen down. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve your thanks for doin\u2019 what was right for a change. And even when it was the last time I spoke to my brother, I don\u2019t have any regrets about what I said. I just thought you oughta know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Charlie clapped him on the back and walked away.</p> <p>The chill was getting to him. He\u2019d almost reached the house when he saw his brothers, sisters in law and their boys walking down the steps. Carson stood on the porch steps, watching them go.</p><p>When he saw Dalton, he motioned him over. \u201cYou okay? You\u2019ve been out here a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well wasn\u2019t like I was hiding out here so no one would see me cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think anyone\u2019s shedding a tear that he\u2019s gone.\u201d Carson scrubbed his hand over his jaw. \u201cSweet Jesus. And ain\u2019t that a fine thing for me to say about my brother on the day we planted him in the ground.\u201d</p><p>Dalton kept his eyes on his uncle. \u201cHim bein\u2019 dead don\u2019t change who he was when he was alive. And I\u2019m more than ready to put this day behind me.\u201d I\u2019m more than ready to put him behind me.</p><p>\u201cMe too. Anything you need?\u201d</p><p>His gaze moved to the front door. \u201cIs Rory still inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so. Want me to get her for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah. But would you tell her I went home and I\u2019ll see her tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Carson frowned. \u201cSon, you sure you don\u2019t wanna come in and tell her yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. Tell Aunt Caro, Aunt Kimi and Aunt Vi I said thanks for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Night, Dalton. Take care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya.\u201d</p><p>Dalton didn\u2019t remember much from the drive home. He could barely keep his eyes open. Once inside his house he plugged in his nearly dead cell, stripped and crawled between the sheets.</p><p>His mother showed up at his door two hours later.</p><p>Dalton wished he would\u2019ve stayed in bed. But then they\u2019d be having a conversation in his bedroom instead of the living room since she\u2019d just barged in.</p><p>\u201cBy all means, Ma, come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left Carson and Carolyn\u2019s without saying goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here? To chew my ass about some post-funeral breach of etiquette? Don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>His mother waltzed into his kitchen and opened cupboards until she found what she was looking for.</p><p>Booze.</p><p>She snagged two plastic cups and pointed to the couch. \u201cSit.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, you had to be expecting this.\u201d</p><p>And don\u2019t you want to know the truth?</p><p>No. He\u2019d already come to terms with this.</p><p>Dalton sat in the recliner.</p><p>His mother perched on the end of the couch closest to him.</p><p>And he noticed her hand shook when she dumped scotch in the cups.</p><p>Fuck. Why was she nervous?</p><p>Yeah, you\u2019ve really come to terms with this.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her when he picked up his cup. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell. Don\u2019t be mad at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. We called him Tattle-Tell for a reason growing up.\u201d</p><p>She barked out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about that.\u201d</p><p>Dalton sipped his drink. \u201cWas it hard for you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarder than I thought it\u2019d be, if you want to know the truth.\u201d She lifted her glass. \u201cSome asshole at the senior center asked me if the only reason I was going to the funeral was to make sure my ex was really dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, like my mother always said, consider the source. Which leads to why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa. Don\u2019t. Okay? It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my say, Dalton, whether you like it or not. So could you look at me please?\u201d</p><p>He counted to ten before he raised his head and met her eyes. Kind eyes. Eyes spilling over with tears.</p><p>\u201cAfter everything I went through with that man over the years. Some of it pretty awful stuff...I didn\u2019t think I could hate him any more than I did. I was wrong. After what he told you...\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t say it. Please don\u2019t say it.</p><p>\u201cI almost didn\u2019t come here tonight to tell you this. But I want all this shit done and buried now that your father is gone.\u201d</p><p>Dalton didn\u2019t move. He didn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cCasper McKay was your father, Dalton. Period. I never cheated on him when we were married. The time in question, when I left him? Unlike your father\u2019s claim he didn\u2019t know where I\u2019d run off to and I\u2019d shacked up with some guy, I stayed with my aunt and uncle\u2014my elderly aunt and uncle. And you can imagine how miserable that must\u2019ve been if I returned to my husband after a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think you secretly hoped he wasn\u2019t your father. And that hope...changed you.\u201d She poured another splash of scotch in their cups. \u201cI\u2019m not excusing what he said to you. But not knowing if he was or wasn\u2019t your father allowed you to cut ties with everything that\u2019d always defined you, which you needed. Probably more than you knew. And I understand why you believed him without question. I suspect he\u2019d been laying the groundwork for something like that for years.\u201d</p><p>Dalton swirled the scotch in his cup. \u201cDid he believe I wasn\u2019t his kid? That\u2019d explain the beatings and the ridicule he leveled on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that bastard knew very well that I never screwed around on him. He never doubted you were his kid, but he made you doubt it and that\u2019s where he got that sense of power. After all the shit you\u2019d been through the week you called off the wedding, Casper knew he could say whatever the hell he wanted to you and you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, just like you\u2019d kept quiet on the abuse.\u201d She knocked back a slug of scotch. \u201cI confronted him about that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>She stared into her cup. \u201cA few months after I started seeing a counselor. She told me I needed to face him head on so I could deal with my guilt and place the blame where it belonged; on him. So I showed up at his church one Sunday morning. Hoo-boy was he shocked to see me. More flustered than I\u2019d ever seen him. He did not want me hanging around chatting up his new churchy friends.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even smile.</p><p>\u201cI asked him out for coffee. I think he would\u2019ve agreed to anything to get me out of his little religious sanctuary. In the restaurant I let fly with everything I had. My disgust for him, for everything he\u2019d done to you. And do you wanna know what that sonuvabitch said to me?\u201d Her haunted eyes met her son\u2019s. \u201cIf I\u2019d been a better mother I would\u2019ve known. He knew exactly what\u2019d cut me the deepest and he did it without blinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you punched him.\u201d</p><p>His mom reached out and squeezed his knee. \u201cNo, but I did lose my temper. He laughed and claimed you hadn\u2019t told anyone about it until you were an adult because then you could exaggerate the past events to make people feel sorry for you and hate him.\u201d She squeezed his knee again. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized he was afraid people would believe you. Imagine his shock when I told him since he\u2019d spoken so highly of his minister, I intended to ask for his help in learning to find forgiveness.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now that made Dalton smile. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. He lost his mind and the restaurant manager had to intervene. I left. I let Casper stew on that for a few weeks. Petty thing to do, but it gave me a sense of satisfaction and I was able to overcome a few blocks I had with the situation. I did show up at his church a couple times a year, just to be ornery, just to watch him squirm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Ma. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cGood to hear. So you might think after Tell told me this last bullshit manipulative lie your father spewed I would\u2019ve confronted him. But this time I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what the man wanted and I wouldn\u2019t give him the pleasure. You didn\u2019t give it to him either. Isn\u2019t it pathetic he\u2019s been waiting over three years for the fallout to begin? He died disappointed and alone and maybe it makes me a horrible human being to say this, but I can\u2019t think of any man who deserves it more.\u201d</p><p>Dalton watched her chin tremble and he picked up her hand. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut as much as I hate him and what he\u2019s done, if not for him...I wouldn\u2019t have my sons. My wonderful sons. You boys are the light in my life and living proof that genes don\u2019t matter. You\u2019re all fine examples of good men, and that\u2019s a miracle to me because you didn\u2019t have that example growing up. You became who you are in spite of your genes and I couldn\u2019t be prouder.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cAnd today, I couldn\u2019t be sadder that your father died without really knowing any of you. Really sad because that was his choice.\u201d</p> <p>They stayed like that for a while. Not speaking, just holding hands, lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>Finally Dalton said, \u201cWere you with Brandt and Tell tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurrounded by their wives and kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re lucky.\u201d He shook his head and drained his booze, shoving the glass aside. \u201cNot lucky. They worked to have the lives they\u2019ve got. I\u2019m happy for them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s room for you in all their lives. In mine too. We missed you, but we\u2019re all very glad you\u2019re back home.\u201d She stood. Wobbled. Laughed and sat back down. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had a little too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. You oughten be drivin\u2019. Where are you staying tonight?\u201d</p><p>His mom looked confused. \u201cHadn\u2019t really thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo crash here. I\u2019d like the company.\u201d</p><p>Tears swam in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like that too.\u201d</p><p>Dalton picked up the bottle of booze. \u201cBut we\u2019re putting a lid on the truth serum.\u201d</p><p>She stretched out on the couch.</p><p>\u201cMa. I don\u2019t expect you to sleep on the couch. You can have my bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine here. I prefer it actually. That way when I can\u2019t sleep I\u2019ll have more room to pace.\u201d</p><p>He probably wouldn\u2019t sleep much either.</p><p>After he\u2019d brought her a pillow and a blanket, she asked, \u201cDid the truth set you free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it hasn\u2019t weighed me down, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can live with that.\u201d</p><p>He could too.</p><p>Jingle barked like crazy and jumped off the bed, growling as she raced to the front door.</p><p>Rory sat up and squinted at the clock. Midnight. Sometimes turkey or deer would trip Jingle offline, but the barks were a sharp warning, which meant a person, not an animal was outside the house.</p><p>Just as Rory reached for her handgun in the nightstand drawer, Jingle\u2019s barks turned into happy yips and she knew her late night caller was Dalton.</p><p>He\u2019d left Carson and Carolyn\u2019s house without a word to her. As helpless as she\u2019d felt, as much as she\u2019d ached to comfort him, she had no idea how to go about it, so she\u2019d left him alone. The last thing Rory wanted was to intrude on his grief.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard from him yesterday at all.</p><p>She remained in bed, listening to his deep voice as he talked to Jingle. The cupboard door squeaked. The man was such a sucker, spoiling the dog with treats. In the small entryway she heard the thump thump of Dalton\u2019s boots hitting the floor. The faucet turning on and off. The gnawing sound of Jingle attacking her rawhide chew.</p><p>Footsteps moved closer, stopping at the edge of the bed. The rustle of clothes being removed. The mattress dipped and that warm, hard male body spooned in behind her, pulling her close.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re ruining Jingle\u2019s killer instincts. She was ready to tear your leg off to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I rewarded her with a treat for bein\u2019 your badass protector when I\u2019m not around.\u201d He kissed the back of her head. \u201cSorry if I woke you. I just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>After a long while, he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I wanted to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso understandable. I imagine it\u2019s been rough.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when he pulled away from her. He rolled over and sat on the edge of the bed.</p><p>Rory saw him hunched over, his head in his hands. Was Dalton...crying? She pushed to her knees and moved in behind him, pressing her face into the back of his neck and wrapping her arms around him.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t crying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this, Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrieve him,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Her chest tightened. Her throat constricted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can. That makes me a cold goddamn bastard. Even after all the shit he did I never wished for him to die. But now that he\u2019s dead and buried, I still don\u2019t feel anything. No relief, no remorse, not even a tiny kernel of happiness that I\u2019ll never have to deal with him again. Makes me sound fucking heartless. But at least if I was gloating or angry that nothin\u2019 ever got resolved between us I\u2019d feel something.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut. Hurting for this man on more levels than she could possibly fathom.</p><p>\u201cThe worst part is I never held out hope there\u2019d be reconciliation. I wouldn\u2019t have believed him if he\u2019d tried to make amends with me. How fucking sad is that?\u201d He shoved his hand through his hair. \u201cThat movie mindset is fucking with my head in a bad way. Where there\u2019s some kind of deathbed apology, confession, whatever, where all the past issues are resolved, where forgiveness is offered and accepted, where everyone has a good cry and the person who wronged you your whole life drifts off, finally at peace. Real life ain\u2019t so tidy. People die and shit doesn\u2019t get resolved. And the person who doesn\u2019t deserve the peace is the person who\u2019s dead. The living are the ones who need it.\u201d</p><p>Rory tilted her head and wiped her tears on the sleeve of her nightgown. Dalton didn\u2019t need her tears. He needed her strength.</p><p>He shivered. Then he tried to shake her off. \u201cSorry. You don\u2019t need me showing up at midnight and laying all this bullshit on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop apologizing.\u201d She tried to tug him back into bed but he wouldn\u2019t budge. She tugged harder. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet under the covers with me. You\u2019re freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You should stay with me. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d She squeezed him hard. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>After a few beats, he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Rather than snuggling into him like she usually did, she propped herself up on the pillows and brought his head against her chest.</p><p>When Dalton curled into her completely, she briefly squeezed her eyes shut to stem the tears.</p><p>She sifted her fingers through his hair. Petting him. Soothing him. Trying to comfort him.</p><p>Dalton pressed a soft kiss on the top of her breast. \u201cThank you.\u201d Finally his big body relaxed. His breathing turned slow and steady.</p><p>Rory couldn\u2019t get to sleep. She\u2019d been tossing and turning before he\u2019d showed up. Wondering how she\u2019d tell him she\u2019d be gone all this week.</p><p>What kind of woman left her lover alone to deal with his grief just a few days after he\u2019d buried his father?</p><p>She\u2019d debated on postponing the in-person interviews she\u2019d scheduled, but she\u2019d opted to keep the appointments. She\u2019d waited for nine months for these opportunities so no way could she afford to pass them up.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>The call from Tell the following week asking Dalton to come over wasn\u2019t posed as a request. Or maybe he\u2019d misunderstood. Seemed he\u2019d been doing that a lot these days.</p><p>The weather was crappy. Blowing snow that cut visibility to a few feet out on the road. Took him fifteen minutes longer to reach Tell and Georgia\u2019s place than it should have.</p><p>He entered the screened entryway and brushed the snow pellets off his outerwear before he hung up his duster. He automatically kicked off his boots. He glanced up to see Georgia standing in front of the glass door that connected the house and the entryway.</p><p>She smiled and opened the door, standing back so her baby bump wasn\u2019t in the way. \u201cGlad you made it. Looks like it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I left Sundance forty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe good news is we\u2019ve got food, drink and an extra bed if you get stuck here.\u201d She playfully pushed him. \u201cOh, don\u2019t look so horrified. Might be fun.\u201d</p><p>They walked through the kitchen into the living room.</p><p>Brandt and Tell sat on opposite ends of the sofa watching TV. \u201cHey, bro. Come check this out. It\u2019s so bad out there we made the national news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I know. I was just out in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re advising no travel,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>He stared hard at his brothers. \u201cAnd yet you insisted I haul ass over here right away, in a freakin\u2019 blizzard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Cause we\u2019re supposed to get ten more inches,\u201d Tell said. \u201cCheckin\u2019 cattle is gonna suck. Good thing we\u2019ve got an extra pair of hands.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then both Brandt and Tell looked at him.</p><p>\u201cForcing me to do cattle checks with you? Is this your way of makin\u2019 me feel included in the family business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Brandt grinned. \u201cWon\u2019t it be fun? All of us bein\u2019 snowed in together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. And watch the F-bombs, little bro. Little pitchers have big ears and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching a DVD in the family room. Jessie\u2019s not feelin\u2019 well so she\u2019s lying down upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie is here too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be fun if she and the boys were snowed in at home and I was snowed in here.\u201d</p><p>Dalton sat on the recliner. \u201cYou guys planned this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the snow, but we figured we could take advantage of it. Spend time together when none of us can hop in our trucks and drive away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, don\u2019t you remember when we were kids how much fun it was havin\u2019 a couple of snow days?\u201d Tell asked. \u201cWe gotta take these opportunities when they come. Who knows if they\u2019ll ever come again.\u201d</p><p>Any anger Dalton might\u2019ve had about his brothers\u2019 manipulation...disappeared. He flopped back in the recliner. \u201cI remember that one snowstorm; I must\u2019ve been eight or so. Luke taught us how to play poker. Guess we didn\u2019t understand that strip poker is something you\u2019re supposed to play with girls, not your brothers.\u201d</p><p>Brandt grinned. \u201cWas that the time you had to run outside in your underwear and make snow angels?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes and the snow was hip deep. Luke and his stupid effed up games. More like truth or dare than poker.\u201d Dalton looked at Tell. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have to eat something weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA raw egg mixed with a can of sardines.\u201d Tell shuddered. \u201cNastiest thing I\u2019ve ever put in my mouth. It tasted a whole lot worse comin\u2019 up two hours later than it did goin\u2019 down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you barfed,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cLike I was gonna confess that,\u201d Tell shot back. \u201cLuke would\u2019ve made me eat another batch because he would\u2019ve claimed it didn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie. After I lost the final poker hand, he made me do one-handed pushups until I collapsed.\u201d A few seconds of silence passed. Then Brandt said, \u201cWhy\u2019d we let Luke boss us around like that? He never let anyone else be in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Luke always had the best ideas. And his ideas were usually fun. Plus, he included all of us. He was always like that\u2014from the time Dalton was old enough to toddle along.\u201d Tell stared into his coffee cup. \u201cEven when Luke was in his early twenties and out tearing it up with his buddies, he still made time for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight sound stupid, but Luke was more a father to me than Casper ever was,\u201d Dalton said softly. \u201cI ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 Luke was perfect, although as time passes I think we tend to overlook the faults of the dead.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t ever happen with Casper\u2019s memory; Dalton could guarantee it. \u201cAlong with teaching us all the ranching shit Dad didn\u2019t know or wouldn\u2019t pass on to us, Luke made sure we had fun. We never would\u2019ve gone huntin\u2019, fishing or camping if not for him.\u201d</p><p>The conversation had taken a turn toward melancholy and Dalton wondered what Brandt was thinking. Had to be a Catch-22 for him; he wouldn\u2019t have the life with Jessie and his kids if Luke was still alive. So when Brandt opened his mouth to speak, Dalton braced himself.</p> <p>\u201cI reckon Luke would expect us to stick together and take advantage of this time to have some fun.\u201d He leaned over and lightly punched Tell in the arm. \u201cSince you\u2019re the most fun lovin\u2019 of the three of us, and I\u2019m the oldest, I\u2019m makin\u2019 that your job. Bein\u2019 the ambassador of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmbassador.\u201d Tell snorted. \u201cI expect you both to salute me from now on.\u201d</p><p>Dalton and Brandt flipped him off at the same time.</p><p>\u201cNice, guys. Real nice.\u201d</p><p>Brandt turned off the TV. \u201cLet\u2019s get the cattle check done.\u201d</p><p>They traversed the shitty roads to feed cattle. Luckily the herd was in a pasture between Brandt\u2019s and Tell\u2019s places, so they didn\u2019t have to venture far into the blowing snow and frigid conditions to roll out bales of hay. Since the feed truck would\u2019ve gotten stuck in the snow banks, they had to fill buckets with cake by hand and then scatter it close to the line of hay.</p><p>For as cold as the outside temperature was, by the time they\u2019d finished checking and feeding three hours later, Dalton was soaked with sweat.</p><p>Back at Tell\u2019s house he showered and called Rory. \u201cHey, sugarplum, how you doin\u2019? You hunkered down all nice and toasty in your cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My power went out first thing this morning so I\u2019m at mom and Gavin\u2019s. Are you sitting in your living room watching endless hours of Universal Poker Tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m snowed in at Tell and Georgia\u2019s with Brandt and Jessie and all their kids. And dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How\u2019d that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was suckered into it, but it\u2019s all good. Really good. Might sound stupid but now I remember why I liked to hang out with them. Not just because they\u2019re my brothers but they\u2019re genuinely good guys. I feel like I\u2019ve got my family back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out on the air mattress. \u201cWish you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I hope it clears up by tomorrow. I\u2019m scheduled to hit the road for some work stuff.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cHow come I didn\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s a last-minute thing.\u201d</p><p>That sucked. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour days. Possibly more.\u201d Rory sighed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been warned by the office the cell phone service is spotty at best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo cell phone reception in Wyoming? I\u2019m shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to warn you if you don\u2019t hear from me not to worry that I\u2019ve been eaten by bears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you letting me know.\u201d He dropped his voice to a growl. \u201cThe only one who\u2019s allowed to eat you is me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora.\u201d</p><p>The door swung open and all three of his nephews jumped on him. Whoa. The little buggers could bounce pretty high on an air mattress.</p><p>\u201cUncle Dalton, come on, you promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta go. Please call me while you still have phone service, okay? Wyatt, dude, this is not the WWE.\u201d</p><p>Rory laughed. \u201cHave fun, you deserve play time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Bye.\u201d Dalton clicked the phone off and tossed it aside. \u201cAll right boys, you asked for it.\u201d</p><p>But he let them dog pile him anyway.</p><p>Later that night, Dalton, Brandt and Tell were sitting at the dining room table, drinking beer and playing dice. Jessie and Georgia were in the den watching an Iron Chef marathon, the boys were in bed and the dogs were snoozing by the door.</p><p>It seemed like old times, but better than old times.</p><p>Brandt said, \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a goofy grin, Dalton. We ain\u2019t playin\u2019 poker so that\u2019s not your bluffing face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just thinkin\u2019 this is fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou glad we gotcha snowed in with us?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d The only way it would be better was if Rory was here.</p><p>Tell got up from the table.</p><p>Dalton looked at Brandt. \u201cWas it something I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. He probably had to take a leak. We\u2019ve been hard on the beer tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie. I don\u2019t drink like I used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re gonna change that tonight,\u201d Tell said, plopping a bottle of booze in the middle of the table along with three lowball glasses.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. That\u2019s high-end Redbreast whiskey,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s like over a hundred bucks a bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured we deserved a few belts of the best Irish.\u201d Tell looked at Dalton. \u201cAfter all the years you dealt with the worst sort of Irish belts.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then Brandt said, \u201cJesus, Tell, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Too soon?\u201d</p><p>Dalton started laughing.</p><p>His brothers looked at him like he\u2019d lost his marbles, so he managed to stop laughing, but his grin stayed in place. \u201cNo, Tell, it\u2019s not too soon. In fact, this shit has been doggin\u2019 me for a long damn time. I\u2019m more than ready to kick it in the ass and give it a final send off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s crack the seal then and give that motherfucking shit a sendoff we\u2019ll all remember.\u201d Brandt grinned. \u201cOr maybe we won\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Tell twisted the cap and sniffed the bottle. \u201cAye, it smells like the peat bogs of me youth. I can almost taste the salty brine of the ocean and see the heather blowing in the meadow breeze, me laddies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, that\u2019s the best \u2018frosted Lucky Charms they\u2019re magically delicious\u2019 impression I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a whiff of that.\u201d He waved the bottle under his nose. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>Dalton passed out the glasses. \u201cPour it, \u2019cause you gotta let it breathe for little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshite,\u201d Brandt growled. \u201cPour the bloody stuff. And I\u2019m talkin\u2019 more than a wee dram, boy-o.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cBrandt is speaking in tongues. It\u2019s a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallelujah and pass the whiskey,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about letting it rest?\u201d</p><p>Dalton grinned. \u201cTotal bull. You still don\u2019t know when I\u2019m bluffing, do ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suck.\u201d</p><p>Tell filled the glasses only to the quarter mark. He raised his glass. \u201cTo snow days.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They clinked glasses and downed the whiskey.</p><p>A sweet, slow burn warmed Dalton from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cThat is the best stuff I\u2019ve ever tasted,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cDamn. Who knew I had expensive taste?\u201d He nudged his glass over. \u201cHit me again, barkeep, but this one\u2019s a sipper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDitto.\u201d</p><p>Once their glasses were half-full, Dalton told them about his experience at an Irish bar in London.</p><p>After he finished, Tell asked, \u201cDo you plan on traveling anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Brandt rested his elbows on the table and looked at Dalton. \u201cMe\u2019n Tell got something to say about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? You have to do this now? When we\u2019ve been havin\u2019 such a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why we need to do it now,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>Rather than waiting, Brandt launched right into it. \u201cWe know why you left and why you stayed away. I\u2019m just sorry we didn\u2019t know the why of it when it happened. But that\u2019s neither here nor there. Dad was an obstacle to you coming back here and to you sticking around.\u201d</p><p>Tell sipped his drink, then said, \u201cNo need to sugarcoat this. He\u2019s gone; obstacle gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Brandt inserted, \u201cwe know Dad wasn\u2019t the only reason you left. We\u2019ve accepted our role in it, and I speak for both of us when I say we\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally fuckin\u2019 sorry,\u201d Tell added.</p> <p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 we can do to undo what\u2019s been done to you. But we can do a couple of things to change how we handle stuff from here on out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike making sure Dad doesn\u2019t have a voice even though he\u2019s dead. He wrecked a lot of things in our lives. You leavin\u2019 meant he took that time you were gone away from us too. So he finally accomplished what he\u2019d been tryin\u2019 to do for years; he drove a wedge between us. And I say fuck that shit. No more. He don\u2019t have that power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen, brother.\u201d</p><p>Dalton didn\u2019t get where this was headed.</p><p>\u201cBottom line is we want you here, man. With you back it\u2019s like it\u2019s supposed to be. So we\u2019ve come up with a plan. \u2019Course it\u2019s a contingency plan, but hear us out.\u201d</p><p>Brandt said, \u201cWith all the crap that\u2019s gone down in the last month, we\u2019ve realized we don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re raising elk or wildebeests or owls as long as you\u2019re doin\u2019 it here close to us. And if by some miracle your elk integration plan isn\u2019t accepted by the state, we\u2019ll help you turn that chunk of dirt into another enterprise. Raising buffalo or turtles or unicorns. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that don\u2019t work for you, we\u2019ll put in that feedlot like we talked about,\u201d Tell said. \u201cI\u2019ve got the updated regs and what we don\u2019t understand I thought Rory could help us figure out, since she\u2019s fluent in the government\u2019s language. But the truth is we\u2019ll support you in whatever you decide. We want you to be part of lives, Dalton. A permanent part. That\u2019s why we wanted to talk about it now. While\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re a little drunk?\u201d Dalton supplied.</p><p>Brandt shook his head. \u201cWhile we\u2019re reminded that we got a responsibility to each other. All three of us. No one gets left behind in this family. No one gets forgotten in this family. Not ever again.\u201d</p><p>Tell leaned closer. \u201cWe just thought you oughta know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, guys. It means a lot.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t get choked up. Would not.</p><p>So it was a belated wake of sorts, for Casper McKay. But they didn\u2019t toast him. They didn\u2019t curse him. They didn\u2019t talk about him much at all.</p><p>They let him go.</p><p>Rory was updating her latest files in the guest bedroom when her mom knocked once and poked her head in.</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a good time to take a break.\u201d She patted the bed and Jingle jumped off. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>Her mom waggled two bottles of Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade. \u201cI brought refreshments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a bad influence on me, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I was a teetotaler until you started bartending. Now look at me. I\u2019m a cocktail connoisseur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, that stuff is low end. Surprised you can drink it after Gavin\u2019s spoiled you with expensive hooch.\u201d Rory gave her a one-armed hug. \u201cYou look great, as always. A little too High Pro glowy\u2014if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>Her mother rolled her eyes. \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Gavin rocked your world before he kicked you out of bed and turned on ESPN?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come down here because my husband ditched me. It\u2019s late and I came to check on you to see if you fell asleep doing your homework like you used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Ha. I\u2019ve got a few hours left. I have to get it all done and turned in by next Friday. I\u2019ll lose the rest of this week and the weekend to travel\u2014provided I can actually leave tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere all are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCody first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Dalton going with you since he doesn\u2019t have a job?\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to toss out Dalton didn\u2019t have to work\u2014ever\u2014but she refrained. \u201cHe has a job. Finishing the house remodel, remember? And he\u2019s awaiting my decision on the elk farm.\u201d</p><p>Her mother swigged from the bottle. \u201cDoes he have a better shot than most at you choosing his land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can be completely unbiased when it comes to doing my job.\u201d Her personal life when it came to Dalton? Whole different manner.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. That wasn\u2019t an accusation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m a little sensitive about that. Part of me fears if I do choose Dalton, people will accuse me of nepotism. And if I don\u2019t choose him, he\u2019ll think my decision was based on avoiding charges of nepotism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t regret your decision, it was the right decision at the time.\u201d Her mom crossed her legs. \u201cThings going all right between you and Dalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious. The last time I saw him was after...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a better place. In fact, he\u2019s snowed in with his brothers right now. Sounds like they\u2019re having a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is great to hear. But I still get the feeling something isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>The boozy lemonade hit her stomach like battery acid and she set the bottle aside. \u201cEverything is right between me and Dalton for a change. He\u2019s a better version of the guy I used to be so crazy about. This time it\u2019s not bullshit. He doesn\u2019t want anything from me...but me. I know he\u2019s in love with me, which is why it\u2019s so hard for me to keep my distance until I get a few things sorted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareer decisions.\u201d</p><p>Her mom frowned. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re going to Cody? I didn\u2019t think that area was part of your district.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Rory snatched the bottle and swallowed a mouthful of booze to bolster her courage. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a WNRC business trip. The office believes I\u2019m taking personal time. Which I am, but not for a vacation. I\u2019ll be there for a job interview. Three job interviews in fact. One is in Cody, one is in Sheridan and one is in Missoula.\u201d</p><p>That startled her mother. \u201cMontana? I didn\u2019t know you were looking for work elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Since you\u2019ve kept mentioning I\u2019ve been in a funk since I moved back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in a funk. And I didn\u2019t know it was your job making you so unhappy,\u201d she said a little snippily. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you talk to me about this stuff anymore. There were plenty of other things that happened to you around that time to put you off your game.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Breaking off my engagement with Dillon didn\u2019t cause this funk. I\u2019ve been unhappy with this job from day one. I settle. That\u2019s my pattern. I settled for the first guy I met in a new town and I was so eager to end that relationship, I settled for the first job that came along. Dalton coming into my life shook it all up\u2014but for once I didn\u2019t make decisions based on anything besides what I wanted. So I\u2019ve applied for jobs with other organizations. This is my second interview with CESU in Missoula. I\u2019m really excited about that one. I\u2019d get to utilize my degrees and it could chart the course of my career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? Or should I say...but?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told Dalton about any of the job applications. I\u2019ll admit I had an ulterior motive at first for keeping it to myself. But after handling this special project, I\u2019ve regained some of the confidence I lost after feeling unemployable for months.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWhen it rains, it pours, huh? I have three interviews in three days and in the past nine months I couldn\u2019t even get one place I applied to call me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have faith in you in finding the right career path\u2014even if that path leads you away from here.\u201d Her mom touched her knee. \u201cI never expected you\u2019d settle in Sundance permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Rory prompted.</p><p>\u201cBut what will you do if you don\u2019t get any of those positions? They\u2019d be a fool not to hire you. Granted, as your mother I\u2019m a little biased.\u201d</p><p>Rory shoved aside the papers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to get my hopes up. So the answer is...I don\u2019t know.\u201d And she couldn\u2019t share the other problem dogging her; if she picked Dalton for the permit, he\u2019d be stuck in Sundance another two years.</p><p>Problem was, she loved Dalton\u2014not that she\u2019d told him. After everything that\u2019d gone on with his family, Rory didn\u2019t see Dalton leaving here. He\u2019d been killing time in Montana, waiting for the right time to return home to Wyoming.</p><p>So even if she didn\u2019t choose his land for the elk program, he\u2019d find another use for it because he had his brothers\u2019 full support. And it would be the ultimate test on whether he\u2019d choose her. Whether he really had changed and meant everything he\u2019d said about them belonging together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRory?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her mom. \u201cSorry I\u2019m a little spacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I want you to do what makes you happy, sweetheart. Wherever that may be and whoever you might be with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeaning...you don\u2019t think Dalton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat matters is what you think. But more importantly, it matters what you do.\u201d Her mom grabbed the empty bottles and stood. \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to think about it with all the time you\u2019ll spend in the car the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p> <p>Rory showed up on Dalton\u2019s doorstep a week later. Although they\u2019d kept in touch, it\u2019d been two long weeks since she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>She knocked on the door.</p><p>Dalton opened it and stared at her like she was an apparition. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d and crushed her against his chest. His mouth found hers, and he kissed her with surety and tenderness. With love. With passion. This kiss was perfect. So perfect how he knew exactly what she needed. A girly rush of emotions pushed front and center and she just about blurted out that she loved him when he broke the kiss. Just to be safe, Rory kept her face tucked in his neck.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to keep you on your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I like to keep you on your back.\u201d</p> <p>She lightly punched him in the stomach and he laughed.</p><p>Then he nuzzled her ear. \u201cI missed you like crazy, Rory.\u201d</p><p>As much as Rory took comfort in that, her belly fluttered with nerves. \u201cI missed you too, McKay. I just finished up the last of the paperwork for the special project. I thought I\u2019d swing by. So we could talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a coffee conversation? Or a whiskey conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot the makings for an Irish coffee conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompromise. I like that about you.\u201d Dalton took her hand and pulled out a chair at the breakfast bar. \u201cSit. I\u2019ll start the coffee.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her satchel on the chair next to her. \u201cTell me about your day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much to tell. I spent the day doin\u2019 my Cinderella imitation cleaning this place now that all the remodeling is done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooks great. I love that you\u2019re comfortable enough in your masculinity that you don\u2019t see cleaning as demeaning.\u201d She groaned. \u201cUnintentional rhyme, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Dalton grinned. \u201cGlad to hear it. I worried maybe you\u2019d secretly been penning poetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDealing with government regulations has sucked every ounce of verbal creativity out of my soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine.\u201d He grabbed two coffee mugs. Poured a generous slug of whiskey in each one.</p><p>\u201cIt smells clean in here. Sometimes I wonder if my house smells like dog.\u201d Way to babble. Maybe you could ask him what product he used that left behind the lemony fresh scent.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d His gaze pinned hers. \u201cWhy you acting so nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am. I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna like this, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this paperwork you finished up... That means you\u2019ve made your final decisions on who gets awarded the permits?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially.\u201d Stop stalling. Rory dug in her satchel and pulled out two pieces of paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour future.\u201d She placed the identical documents on the counter. \u201cI did all the research on this, but the final decision is up to you.\u201d She tapped the closest document. \u201cThis one recommends your land for the elk farm permit.\u201d Then she tapped the next. \u201cThis one denies it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>She shoved both papers at him. \u201cYou get to choose. Whether you stay here and run it. Or whether you don\u2019t. I\u2019ll back you on either decision.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the papers in silence. Then he poured coffee.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019d mean a lot to you, finally getting to utilize the land you own for something you want. And I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if I didn\u2019t believe the habitat was more than adequate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you givin\u2019 me the option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else you need to know first.\u201d Rory swallowed a mouthful of coffee. The burn of the whiskey and the hot liquid sent her into a coughing fit.</p><p>Dalton was right there, rubbing her back, asking if she was all right, asking how he could help her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Maybe some water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>Maybe his concern was a stupid little thing, but it just reinforced her feelings for him. Dalton McKay was a capable caretaker, something she wouldn\u2019t have believed if he hadn\u2019t proven it to her time and time again over the past few months. No one had ever believed Dalton capable of taking care of himself, let alone anyone else. The fact he showed her that side of himself meant she had a part of him that no one else did. He didn\u2019t only act sweet and loving when he wanted something from her in return.</p><p>He handed her the glass of water and watched as she drank. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been happy in my job, prior to this special assignment. I\u2019ve been dreading going back to being a part-time lackey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said they might reward you for a good job and move you up the ladder?\u201d</p><p>Rory forced herself to maintain eye contact. \u201cThat was a lie. I\u2019ve been applying for jobs with other agencies for months. I never intended on staying in Sundance permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re you. Or I thought you were the same love \u2019em and leave \u2019em guy you\u2019d always been. Showing up here after three years and swearing we were meant to be together. I didn\u2019t believe it. I didn\u2019t trust it. I didn\u2019t trust you. I suspected you had an agenda\u2014even before the permit issue arose between us.\u201d As much as she wanted to hide her face, she looked him dead in the eye. \u201cI decided I\u2019d hang out with you to cure my loneliness, gorge myself on hot sex with you until I had a great new job and I\u2019d move on.\u201d</p><p>The strong muscle in his jaw worked but he said nothing.</p><p>\u201cBut something happened. I fell in love with you. The Dalton I knew now. Not the asshole from years ago, not even the sweet, bossy Dalton I used to antagonize when we played in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out. Inasmuch as I realized that assholish side of you didn\u2019t exist anymore, I understood I haven\u2019t been that wronged girl for a number of years. I may talk tough, may act tough sometimes, but I\u2019m not cruel. I\u2019ve never been a cruel person and I won\u2019t start being that way now\u2014especially to you. You\u2019ve dealt with enough cruelty in your life, Dalton. You don\u2019t deserve that from someone who loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Truly.\u201d She fought tears. \u201cWhich is why this is so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurora. Love makes everything easier,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Such a vulnerability to this man. That just made her love him more. \u201cBut I\u2019m not the only one who loves you. Your family loves you and they\u2019ve got you back. You finally came clean with them about what had kept you away. You just lost your father and you\u2019re dealing with some pretty mixed emotions about that. You\u2019ve stopped running from your problems so it\u2019s not fair to ask you to run away with me. Seems like we both have horrible timing with the run away with me thing, huh?\u201d</p><p>That startled him. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week I got offered a permanent fulltime position with Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit in Missoula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re takin\u2019 it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor sure. I interviewed there in person last week and they offered me the job on the spot. I also interviewed with the BLM in Cody but didn\u2019t make the final cut because they were looking for someone with more experience. Anyway, I gave notice at WNRC. Next week is my last week.\u201d She stared into those compelling blue eyes. \u201cSo I\u2019m leaving Sundance. But I don\u2019t want this to end. I\u2019m asking you to come with me to Missoula.\u201d</p><p>Stunned silence.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you. But I realize the timing for this couldn\u2019t possibly come at a worse time for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory, that doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her fingers over his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t. Even if you\u2019re convinced you\u2019ve made up your mind and know what you want, I\u2019m asking you to take a little time and really think it through. Talk to your brothers. Talk to your mom. Make a rational decision, not an emotional one.\u201d</p><p>Dalton was so shocked or deep in thought that he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Rory shouldered her satchel and walked out.</p><p>She made it to her Jeep before she heard the screen door slam. She whirled around and Dalton was in her face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make an emotional decision?\u201d he demanded, crowding her against her car. \u201cThat\u2019s the only kind of decision that\u2019s worth anything.\u201d He snapped the paper in her face. Then he crumpled it into a ball and threw it over his shoulder. \u201cDeny me the elk farm permit. The only reason I applied for it is because I thought you\u2019d be livin\u2019 here and I\u2019d need something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t completely honest with you. I don\u2019t have a burning desire to raise elk. I saw an opportunity, a reason to stay in Sundance. Yes, I have family here and I\u2019ve dealt with some issues that will keep my brothers and their families part of my life. But Rory, I was here for you. I stayed for you. If you\u2019re not here, there\u2019s no reason for me to stay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blinked at him. Maybe the inability to speak was contagious because she couldn\u2019t make her lips move.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I thought I lost you once and that\u2019s never happening again. Never. I don\u2019t even need five seconds to make a decision. You go, I go. We belong together. Not just while you\u2019re killin\u2019 time waiting for a killer job, or I\u2019m killin\u2019 time hoping to heaven that you\u2019ll fall in love with me. We are forever.\u201d Dalton curled his hands around her face. \u201cSo yes, I\u2019ll run away with you to Missoula. But when we go, you\u2019ll be wearing my ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me to marry you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m telling you that we will be married. I\u2019m willing to wait until you\u2019re settled in your new job, but I want you as my wife, Rory. I want everyone to know that you\u2019re mine. That we\u2019re building a life together.\u201d</p><p>Over the past few months when Dalton looked at her a certain way, or placed a kiss below her ear, or ran his finger down the inside of her arm, she sensed his satisfaction. His possession. She\u2019d chalked it up to sex. Now she saw it for what it really was. Love that went beyond anything she\u2019d ever thought any man could feel for her, let alone this man who owned her heart, body and soul.</p><p>It was past time she let him know she felt the same.</p><p>She ran her hands through his hair. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He quit breathing entirely. Then he said, \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Before she could repeat it for a third time, because she knew that\u2019s what he\u2019d ask for, his mouth was on hers. Not consuming her with a fierce kiss, but leveling her with tenderness and gratitude. And hope. There was so much hope in him, in this kiss, that her eyes grew wet.</p><p>The kiss went on and on. Gentle and hot, packed with the type of sweet need that caused her to cling to him tighter.</p><p>When he finally released her mouth, he murmured, \u201cYou really mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I love you, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the best day of my life. Right now, in this moment with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine too.\u201d</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>Six months later</p><p>\u201cDo you, Dalton Patrick McKay, take Aurora Rose Wetzler to be your lawfully wedded wife? To have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, from this day forward, until death do you part?\u201d</p><p>Dalton froze.</p><p>This was it. The next step would tie him to this woman permanently and the judge\u2019s final words would pronounce them husband and wife.</p><p>Dalton McKay, husband.</p><p>That sounded...perfect. Really fucking perfect actually.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He lifted Rory\u2019s hand to his mouth for a kiss. \u201cI do, I do, I do. I cannot wait for this woman to be my wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sorta went off-script,\u201d Rory whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an off-script kinda guy.\u201d</p><p>The judge cleared his throat. \u201cMay I continue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah, sure, go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, Aurora Rose Wetzler, take Dalton Patrick McKay to be your lawfully wedded husband? To have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, from this day forward, until death do you part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged rings.</p><p>Then the judge said the magic words. \u201cBy the power vested in me by the State of Wyoming, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Kiss your bride. Kiss your groom. This union is official.\u201d</p><p>Dalton curled his hands around her face, the beautiful face of this woman whose eyes were shining with love for him. \u201cI love you.\u201d He kissed her with sweetness and devotion. And he had to laugh softly when he finally pulled back. \u201cSugarplum lip gloss. Nice touch.\u201d</p><p>Loud clapping behind them echoed through the trees.</p><p>They turned together and faced their family.</p><p>Hugs and claps on the back and even more hugs were exchanged. Then everyone backed off, giving them time alone.</p><p>They\u2019d kept the ceremony for immediate family only. His brothers had stood up for him. Rory\u2019s mom and Sierra had stood up for her.</p><p>Now they stood before each other, husband and wife, in the exact same place where they\u2019d met for the first time.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUs. How perfect this is. But also in all those years we hung out here and all the games we played, we never once played house.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause playing house isn\u2019t a game for us. It\u2019s for real. For keeps.\u201d</p><p>And she swore she didn\u2019t have a romantic streak. The fact she\u2019d insisted they get married here and she carried a bouquet of plum blossoms and her lip gloss spoke volumes to him.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that look, McKay. You were thinking of a way to get me up onto that rock just so you could push me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. It wouldn\u2019t be the same because the six-year-old Rory I remember wouldn\u2019t be caught dead wearing a princess dress. She would\u2019ve jumped into the creek before I could shove her off, just to save face.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you look spectacular.\u201d The white satin dress clung to her every curve from the waist down. From the waist up it was all fancy beading, lace and poufy stuff. Rory had let her hair hang loose rather than putting it up, knowing the second Dalton got her alone, all the pins would come out and he\u2019d take it down anyway.</p><p>\u201cThank you. You look pretty spectacular yourself.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d chosen a western-cut black suit with a plaid vest and no tie. Not once during the brief ceremony had he felt like he was choking.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Rielle said to Rory, \u201cGavin and I are heading up to the house to make sure everything is set for the party.\u201d</p><p>Rory kissed her mom\u2019s cheeks. \u201cGo on. We\u2019ll be up in a minute.\u201d As soon as her mother was out of earshot, Rory murmured, \u201cI cannot believe she\u2019s hosting the wedding reception at her house. I know it\u2019s just a family reception, but that means all those McKays. And all their kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re one of them too now, Mrs. McKay.\u201d</p><p>Tell and Georgia\u2019s little girl, Carly, started to fuss. As Dalton\u2019s first niece she was the official flower girl even when she didn\u2019t do anything but look cute as a button in her beribboned dress. Tucker had done better than expected as ring bearer, but he\u2019d lit out for the creek with Landon, Wyatt and Jackson as soon as possible.</p><p>Brandt and Jessie\u2019s baby girl, Bethany, let out a loud wail.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll grab the kids and head up to the house too,\u201d Brandt said and yelled for the boys.</p><p>Dalton\u2019s mom gave him another hug. \u201cI\u2019ll ride up with the judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not staying here by myself to watch the newlyweds suck face,\u201d Sierra announced. Yanking up the skirt of her bridesmaid\u2019s dress, she whistled for Jingle and shouted, \u201cHey Dad, wait up.\u201d</p><p>And then they were alone.</p><p>Dalton faced Rory with a grin. \u201cYou know, we could...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not, Dalton McKay. I am not having sex with you on that rock... Omigod please, stop doing that. Right now. Seriously...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d he murmured against her throat.</p><p>Rory grabbed a handful of his hair and yanked so they were looking at each other. \u201cSave it for the honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean tonight, right? And not waiting to have my wicked way with my wife until we\u2019re in Spain?\u201d Having Rory to himself for two weeks in Europe was gonna be some fun.</p><p>\u201cOf course I mean tonight. You do have a room reserved for us someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need reservations in the great outdoors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not expecting me to spend my freakin\u2019 wedding night in a sleeping bag out in the woods, are you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNope. You get enough of the great outdoors in your job.\u201d Their transition to living together in a new state, as a couple, had gone much smoother than they\u2019d imagined. They\u2019d bought a house, a small fixer-upper to give him something to do. He\u2019d found a logging company that needed part-time seasonal help and he planned to serve as a hunting guide in the fall for Boden. But for the most part, he was content being in their home, taking care of Rory, supporting her in the career she loved.</p><p>She swept his hair from his forehead. \u201cI love you. Promise me we won\u2019t get separated for too long at the reception?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d Then he kissed her. The kiss caught fire, like it always did between them. His mouth wandered, as did his hands. He\u2019d just about had her talked into a quickie, when he heard motors gunning behind them and a series of annoying beeps.</p><p>Dalton stepped in front of Rory so she could straighten the top of her dress.</p><p>Kyler pulled into view in a side by side ATV that\u2019d been decorated with white streamers and graffiti and had tin cans tied to the back end. A big sign said, Just Hitched.</p><p>More loud beeps sounded and he saw Sierra riding another ATV. She pulled in behind Kyler.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me she\u2019s not wearing her bridesmaid\u2019s dress on that muddy ATV.\u201d</p><p>Sierra waved at them with the bottle of champagne and yelled, \u201cWahoo! We started the party without you, suckas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...she\u2019s drinking.\u201d</p><p>Dalton laughed.</p><p>Kyler bounded over. \u201cYour wedding party got back to the house and realized they hadn\u2019t left you a way to get back.\u201d He tossed Dalton the keys and pointed to the ATV. \u201cYour chariot awaits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Ky. Could you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive Sierra back to the house? I\u2019d planned on it.\u201d He propped his hands on his hips. \u201cNot sure an open bar was the best choice for the reception. Anyway, I\u2019ll keep an eye on her tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I appreciate it,\u201d Rory said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Seriously. Don\u2019t say nothin\u2019 to my parents.\u201d He frowned. \u201cIf they think I\u2019m havin\u2019 any kind of fun they\u2019ll make me stay with the little kids.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Kyler looked at Sierra when she honked the horn ten times in a row and yelled, \u201cCome on, little cuz.
