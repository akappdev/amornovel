I stood momentarily with the rain pelting my face, tilting my head back to see the top of the tallest building in the state of Washington\u2014all seventy-six floors of it. I knew that fact because I looked it up on the Internet. I needed to get an idea of what I would be dealing with. Not that my friend Rob, who I was here to see, worked on the top floor, but it was close. His office was on the fifty-second floor, which meant a long torturous elevator ride. Something I wasn\u2019t looking forward to at all. Back home in Woodfalls, Maine, the tallest building was the three-story Wells Fargo bank they had built across from Smith\u2019s General Store a few years back. I was attending college at the University of Washington at the time, but back in Woodfalls it was big news. My mom, the town\u2019s resident busybody, made sure I received daily updates about the construction. Now, as I stood here, the building in front of me made our little bank back home look like a dollhouse.</p> <p>The rain was beginning to find its way down the generic yellow raincoat I had purchased from the Seattle airport just that morning. The pilot had gleefully informed us before landing that Seattle was having its rainiest September in years. The irony that the rainiest state in the country was having its rainiest year in history was not lost on me. Why wouldn\u2019t it be cold, rainy, and miserable? It matched the way I felt about this place. Of course, that wasn\u2019t always the case. When I first arrived in Seattle three years ago, I was a greenhorn from my podunk hometown. That was why I had chosen UW. It was as far away from Woodfalls as I could possibly get without applying to the University of Hawaii. Three years ago, I had decided that nine months of rainy weather was a fair trade-off to finally be surrounded by civilization. That and it was hundreds of miles away from my often annoying but well-intentioned mother. The endless array of restaurants, museums, and stores and the music scene had tantalized me, making me vividly realize just how lacking and uncultured Woodfalls was. Everything about Seattle intrigued me, making me never want to leave, but Puget Sound was by far my favorite thing about being there. On the weekends I would haul my laptop and textbooks down to one of the caf\u00e9s on the waterfront. I would spend hours drinking coffee and working on schoolwork. That is, when people-watching didn\u2019t distract me. That trait is something I had obviously inherited from my mom. Still, everything had been going along just the way I had imagined it would. It was liberating to be out from under my mom\u2019s thumb and the prying eyes of everyone back home. Here I could be my own person, with my own life. Then everything went to hell. I met Justin Avery\u2014the whirlwind hurricane who left my head spinning and my stomach dropping to my knees like I was on a roller coaster.</p><p>My thoughts were broken when a wave of water splashed up from the road, soaking my pants from the knees down. \u201cTerrific,\u201d I grumbled, looking down at the ruined pair of strappy sandals I had just bought. This was what I got for abandoning my typical attire of jeans and Converse shoes.</p><p>Stepping away from the offending curb before another rogue wave of nasty puddle water could finish the job, I focused on making it into the building without busting my ass, or, worse yet, breaking my neck. The fake leather that had seemed so smooth and comfortable when I bought the sandals was now doing a great impersonation of a roller skate. My toes were also threatening mutiny from the cold, only adding insult to injury. This was the gajillionth reason why I had vowed never to return to Seattle. The city and I had bad blood between us.</p><p>The only reason I was standing here now was for Melissa and Rob, my two best friends from college who had demanded that I be here for their engagement party. I\u2019d tried every feasible excuse I could come up with\u2014\u201cI\u2019m sick,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m out of the country,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t get off work.\u201d No excuse seemed to stand up to Melissa\u2019s bullshit meter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of our best friends. You have to be here,\u201d Melissa insisted.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I hate you. I\u2019m not your friend. I never was your friend,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI wish you could see the world\u2019s smallest violin I\u2019m playing for you right now. Come on. Pull on your big-girl panties and stop hiding.\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable silence interrupted the conversation before Melissa finally spoke up again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brittni. I\u2019m a bitch for even saying that. I just mean you can\u2019t let what happened dictate your life forever,\u201d Melissa had reasoned. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re my maid of honor. I need you. Just think of this trip as a test, like dipping your toes in water. Chances are you\u2019ll hardly see him, and if you do, it\u2019s not like you guys even have to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019ll see me lat\u2014\u201d Her words were cut off as I ended the call.</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u201d was the best answer I could give at the moment. The only hope I had left was my boss.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to go since I\u2019ll need you more next month,\u201d Ms. Miller, my principal at Woodfalls Elementary, had stated. \u201cMary Smith has her wrist surgery scheduled for October and won\u2019t be able to return to work until February. I swear, I\u2019ve never seen someone so damn gleeful over a surgery. I\u2019m sure it has something to do with that god-awful book-reader thingy she got for Christmas. She\u2019s always crowing about some new author she\u2019s discovered,\u201d Ms. Miller added, looking perplexed. \u201cMe, I need an actual book in my hand, not some electronic doodad that will most likely come alive and kill me in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking now might be a good time to lay off the science fiction flicks,\u201d I had countered dryly as I tried to squish the unease that had settled in the pit of my stomach. That was that. Ms. Miller was the only obstacle left. It seemed fate wanted me in Seattle.</p><p>Now, two weeks later, here I was with my shoes squishing across the tile floor of Columbia Center. It was glaringly obvious that nothing good could come from me returning to Seattle. I skirted around a security guard and headed for the women\u2019s bathroom so I could survey the damage.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I muttered when I took in my appearance in the long expanse of mirrors that lined the wall. I looked like a drowned rat. My long hair, which I had painstakingly straightened earlier, had been replaced with my typical corkscrew curls that were the bane of my existence. \u201cDamn,\u201d I sighed as I pulled my compact from my purse so I could repair my makeup-streaked face. This was just another sign I shouldn\u2019t be here. If my friend Rob hadn\u2019t been expecting me for lunch, I would have chalked it up as a lost cause and headed back to my hotel. At the moment, I\u2019d gladly trade my soaked clothing and frozen toes for solitude in my hotel room.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip, wimp-ass,\u201d I chastised myself out loud, ignoring a startled look from a form-fitting suit-clad woman before she hustled out of the bathroom. \u201cYeah, keep moving. Nothing to see here but the freako talking to herself in the bathroom,\u201d I said, grabbing a handful of paper towels to mop up my feet and legs. Tressa, my best friend back in Woodfalls, would have a field day if she saw what a mess I was, and Ashton, my other friend, would laugh and make a joke about it. I was supposed to be the one who never got frazzled and always held it together. Tressa was the more dramatic one of our trio. She made snap decisions often, never giving any thought to the consequences. Growing up, I was often left holding the short end of the stick in most of her escapades, but I didn\u2019t care. I envied her fearless attitude. I could have used an ounce of her fearlessness at the moment. I was the cautious one. The overanalyzing, skeptical, glass-is-half-empty kind of girl. Only once had I thrown caution to the wind, and it had bitten me in the ass. That one mistake was never far from my mind. How could it be? I left town and ran back home because of it. Being back at the scene of my troubles didn\u2019t help the situation. I needed to get my act together. Two years was a long time ago. I needed to buck up or whatever shit they say to get someone to stop freaking out.</p><p>I pulled my brush from my bag and ran it through my damp blond locks, cringing as it tugged through the tangled curls that had taken over my head. After a futile moment of trying to make my hair look more dignified and less like a refuge for wayward birds, I gave up and threw it in a clip, which at least made it so that I no longer looked like the bride of Frankenstein from those cheesy black-and-white movies. I added a layer of my favorite lipstick and finally felt halfway normal.</p><p>\u201cYou got this,\u201d I said, pivoting around and striding out of the bathroom. I ignored the eruption of laughter from the two giggling girls who were entering as I was leaving. Obviously I would be their comedic relief for the day.</p><p>I straightened up, finding the backbone that had liquefied and all but disappeared the moment the plane\u2019s wheels had touched down on the wet tarmac that morning. \u201cScrew him. He doesn\u2019t own the city. I have every right to be here,\u201d I told myself as I headed for the long bank of elevators to the right of the bathrooms. A small crowd of people hurried onto one of the elevators as the doors slid open. I declined to join the overflowing box, waiting instead for the next elevator, which would be less crowded. Being closed in with a group of strangers wouldn\u2019t cut it for me. I couldn\u2019t stand being in confined spaces anyway, but elevators and I had a hate/hate kind of relationship. I hated them, and if the seventh-grade hand-crushing incident was any indication, they hated me too.</p> <p>\u201cNo problem. The doors will open and you will step inside. Nice and easy,\u201d I whispered to myself. I knew it would require all my will and strength to remain sane on the elevator as it carried me up fifty-two floors to Rob\u2019s office. As is always the case with my luck, he couldn\u2019t have been on the first five or so floors, making the stairs a viable option. N-o-o-o-o-o, it had to be practically up in the clouds.</p><p>The ding signifying the arrival of the next car prompted me out of my inner whine-fest. I took a deep breath as if I were about to jump into water before cautiously stepping aboard the elevator. I exhaled a sigh of relief as the doors slowly closed and I found myself alone for the impending ride up. This was a good thing in case my hyperventilating, I-wish-I-sucked-my-thumb-or-at-least-had-a-stiff-drink elevator behavior decided to surface.</p><p>My relief was short-lived when a hand reached between the closing doors, causing them to reopen.</p><p>\u201cYou know, sticking your hand in like that can result in serious injury.\u201d Personal experience had me pointing that out before the words locked in my throat.</p><p>All the air escaped from my lungs and I wheezed out a startled swear word as the elevator doors slid closed, trapping me inside with him. I would have gladly shared the ride with a couple of brain-starved zombies instead of him.</p><p>Our eyes locked as all the animosity and hatred from two years ago radiated off him in waves.</p><p>\u201cJustin,\u201d I squeaked out in a voice that was totally not my own.</p><p>\u201cSelfish bitch,\u201d he greeted me with venom dripping from each word as he punched the button for the fifty-second floor with the side of his fist.</p><p>I cringed as the elevator walls began to close in on me. I knew he hated me. He had all but shouted it in my face the very last time we\u2019d been in the same vicinity. His eyes and words had cut me like razor blades. Every syllable had traveled across the quad until all the students who had been lounging around had turned to stare at us with morbid fascination.</p><p>Justin was the love of my life.</p><p>2.</p><p>October 2010</p><p>I met Justin on a drizzly October day during my sophomore year at UW. I disliked him on sight. He was covered in equal amounts of tattoos and girls who giggled at every word that dripped from his lush lips. Everything about him screamed bad boy, from his ripped jeans and pierced eyebrow to his painted-on white T-shirt. This, combined with his smoking a cigarette, pretty much sealed the deal for me. I\u2019d lost my grandma to lung cancer a year ago. Ironically, she\u2019d never smoked a day in her life, but my grandpa had smoked like a chimney before he passed away when I was five. Turns out all that crap they say about secondhand smoke isn\u2019t some mystical fairy tale. That shit really does kill.</p><p>I ignored Justin and his admirers as I ordered a strawberry Danish and a coffee before setting myself up at a table under a large umbrella. I had a paper due the next day in my Teaching in Diverse Populations class. Usually, I preferred the caf\u00e9 here to the library because it was closer to the dorms. Besides, my dorm room that morning had proved to be more of a distraction than an actual study haven. My roommate, Melissa, was a total sweetheart, but her constant interruptions made getting anything written nearly impossible. She was buzzing about some big Halloween party at Alpha Delta Phi the following week and freaking out about what kind of costume she should wear as she frantically searched the Web for something original that would catch the eye of some guy. I told her to go as a Victoria\u2019s Secret angel and she\u2019d be all set. \u201cYou know, sexy panties and bra\u2014add in a pair of wings and you\u2019ll have all the attention you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to attract that kind of attention,\u201d she wailed, glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, you said you wanted to snag a hunk. Your words, not mine,\u201d I pointed out dryly as I closed my MacBook. I lifted my backpack from the floor and stowed away my laptop and books.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d she asked, whipping her computer around to reveal a person covered in purple balloons.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go as an atom?\u201d I asked, slinging my backpack over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re grapes, not an atom, smart-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo wear the bra and panties underneath and then you can pop the balloons at an opportune time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it,\u201d she snorted, throwing a pillow at me. \u201cWait, where are you going?\u201d she asked as I headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cLook, I love you despite the fact that you\u2019re a total spaz, but seriously, you make studying damn near impossible,\u201d I answered, throwing her a kiss.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to order you purple balloons?\u201d I heard her call through the door as I headed down the hall.</p><p>I shook my head. She was a mess, but surprisingly, we\u2019d really hit it off after a few initial speed bumps last year. Melissa\u2019s vibrant and enthusiastic personality reminded me of my friend Tressa. Every emotion she was feeling was always on display for the world to see, like she was throwing up the Bat-Signal or something. Everything was a big deal whether it was good or bad. I was the polar opposite, not wanting the whole world to know every little detail about me. On our first night as roommates, I\u2019d watched her with morbid fascination as she had buzzed around our room chattering nonstop about the great year we were going to have, and how we would be the best of friends. After hours of endless chatter, she had finally fallen asleep in the middle of regaling me with stories of all the parties and hot guys we would be exposed to now that we were in college. While she snored loudly in the bed next to mine, I vowed that first thing in the morning, I would do everything in my power to switch roommates, but by the time the next morning had dawned bright and early, she didn\u2019t seem nearly as bad. Of course, that was probably because she woke me with a steaming cup of coffee from the small kiosk near our dorm. Anyone who recognized the importance of a morning hit of caffeine couldn\u2019t be all that bad. I won\u2019t lie, though; during the next few weeks I did question the sanity of that decision. Now, a year later, I was glad I didn\u2019t follow through with my initial plan. Sure, there were still times she wore on me, but she was pretty terrific all the other times. Even if she did act like a hyped-up Red Bull junkie most of the time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaving Melissa to her costume dilemma wasn\u2019t that much of a hardship. Despite the dreary day, I enjoyed sitting by myself at one of the caf\u00e9s just off campus. I was supposed to be doing my schoolwork, but people-watching kept distracting me while I sipped my coffee and nibbled on a sinfully good Danish that practically melted in my mouth.</p><p>I was halfway through my second cup of coffee and finally working on my paper when the annoying squeals from a nearby table broke my concentration.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d a girl asked in one of those fake baby-talk kinds of voices that got on my nerves. I could practically hear her eyelashes batting.</p> <p>\u201cWell, sweetheart, I designed that one when I was seventeen. The other half is here,\u201d a masculine voice drawled behind me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. On your thigh? I want to see,\u201d another voice squealed so loud that I\u2019m sure dogs halfway across the state were sent into a barking frenzy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that easy, babe,\u201d the same masculine voice chuckled as he answered. \u201cWhat are you willing to trade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh brother,\u201d I said, louder than I intended. The sudden silence behind me clued me in that my comment had been heard. Now was one of those times I wished my best friend Tressa were here. She hated when girls made an ass of themselves by fawning over some guy. Better her making the loudmouth comment than me.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, like, I\u2019ll show you mine, if you show me yours?\u201d the same piercing voice asked after a few awkward moments had passed.</p> <p>I waited to hear what his response would be, completely annoyed with myself for paying attention to their conversation. I fought the urge to turn and look at Mr. Sure of Himself to see what had the two girls so entranced.</p><p>\u201cYou have no interest in seeing my art?\u201d he asked into my ear, making me jump.</p><p>I silently berated myself for jumping. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d I asked, taking in his rugged appearance. He had nice eyes, I\u2019d give him that, but the typical bad-boy getup made any interest I might have had go down several notches. It seemed like he was trying too hard to portray his image. Even the drenched white T-shirt that showed his six-pack abs and a well-defined chest covered in tattoos was a complete turnoff. I wondered what he would have done had it not been raining. Suddenly, I found myself laughing at a mental picture of him using a garden hose to soak himself down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d he asked, seeing that I was trying not to laugh. Without waiting for my answer, he pulled out an empty chair. The heavy metal squawked loudly across the concrete as he scooted himself toward the table.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cAnd get rid of the cigarette,\u201d I added, not caring that I didn\u2019t even know him.</p><p>His lips quirked at my testy tone before looking down at the cigarette. I expected him to scoff at my demand or even ignore it, but he surprised me by using the sole of his shoe to put it out. He earned a few more brownie points by placing the butt in his pocket versus throwing it on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t your \u2018girlfriends\u2019 wither away into a pile of simpering drama now that you\u2019ve left them?\u201d I asked, casting a look over my shoulder, where the two blond bombshells were staring daggers into my back.</p><p>\u201cNah, they\u2019re cool,\u201d he said, flashing them a smile, which must have been laced with some kind of potion considering the way they both smiled back at him with such adoration. I was disgusted. He was nothing but a flirt who treated women with little respect.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to hurl,\u201d I commented, making him turn his attention back to me.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re hard-core. So, I\u2019m getting the sense you don\u2019t like me. Is it because I interrupted your studying, or have we maybe hooked up before? Because I definitely think I would have remembered that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I shudder at the thought. Does that crap actually work?\u201d I sniped. The fact that he was callous enough to find nothing wrong with flirting with me while he was on some weird m\u00e9nage-a-trois date was irritating as hell.</p><p>My comment only spurred more laughter from him. \u201cI think you just broke my heart,\u201d he said, clutching his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your Playboy bunnies will be more than willing to repair it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you make it up to me by going out with me?\u201d</p> <p>This time it was my turn to laugh. \u201cUm, no thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked with genuine curiosity.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t like you,\u201d I answered, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not directly, but I know your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy type?\u201d he asked, ignoring the calls he was getting from the girls at the other table.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s forget for a moment how you\u2019re over here flirting with me while your fan club over there is cooling their heels waiting for you. I\u2019m a little puzzled what they see in you, but the fact that they\u2019re dumb enough to actually share you makes me believe you must be an out-of-work musician or something like that. Guitar player, right?\u201d</p><p>He threw his head back, laughing loudly at my analysis. \u201cWrong on both. I couldn\u2019t play an instrument to save my life. Not to mention, I\u2019m pretty much tone-deaf. As for your first assumption, neither of them is my girlfriend. I met them at a party last night and agreed to meet up for coffee today. But enough about them. I\u2019m curious to know why you came up with these assumptions?\u201d he asked, sitting back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest while he casually crossed his ankles.</p><p>\u201cHmm, could it be the Barbie twins you\u2019re stringing along? You may not think you\u2019re dating them, but they sure think something is going on,\u201d I said, deliberately cutting my eyes in their direction. \u201cOr, it could be all the ink. Is it a fetish, or are you just blatantly seeking attention? Your whole persona screams misunderstood tortured soul. I\u2019m guessing your parents ignored you and this is a vain attempt to get their attention,\u201d I added with complete disinterest. A hint of what almost looked like disappointment flashed in his eyes but was gone in a second, convincing me I was imagining things.</p><p>\u201cAre you one of those fortune-tellers?\u201d he drawled. \u201cHey, what number am I thinking of? Kidding. What about you? Gotta be a psych major, right?\u201d he asked, raising his pierced eyebrow, which I failed miserably at ignoring.</p><p>\u201cEducation,\u201d I answered, holding up my Teaching in Diverse Populations book.</p><p>\u201cAnd you moonlight as some kind of psychoanalyzer? Watching and judging everyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I bristled at his description. I wasn\u2019t some busybody who clucked her tongue judgmentally anytime someone did something I disagreed with. That was my mom\u2019s thing. Not mine. Okay, so I liked to watch people, but that was different. It\u2019s not like I ever said anything negative, at least out loud. God, was he right? Did occasionally thinking snarky thoughts while nosing into people\u2019s business make me no different than my mom? It had to be different. Besides, who didn\u2019t do that? Was there a sane person who could actually walk through Walmart without judging someone? I pondered these questions as Mr. Wet T-Shirt continued to eye me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just observant,\u201d I finally answered lamely. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re not some misunderstood musician, what are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, what species? Well, when I was younger I pretty much assumed I was a monkey, but as I got a little older I was convinced either my parents were from another planet or I was. Recently, it\u2019s come to my attention that I might also be part ass,\u201d he answered cheekily.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I answered, sitting back in my chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to tell you what I am the next time I see you,\u201d he answered, standing up as his blond companions called his name again in unison. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m Justin,\u201d he said, holding out his hand.</p><p>I held out my own hand, reluctantly. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not even going to give me your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ll be seeing each other again,\u201d I answered, knowing I sounded like a total bitch. I didn\u2019t see any point in encouraging something that was never going to happen.</p><p>\u201cYou never know. Maybe next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all depends on how many girls are in your entourage. If there is a next time, which I highly doubt,\u201d I pointed out, tugging at my hand, which was still clasped in his.</p><p>\u201cWell, until then,\u201d he said, giving my hand one last squeeze before releasing it. He strolled away from the table, not bothering to look back.</p><p>I could hear Barbie One and Two pouting about his absence as they headed in the opposite direction from where I was sitting. I didn\u2019t turn around, even though for some insane reason I wanted to. I knew I\u2019d never see him again, and most likely he\u2019d forget about me before he even got to the next block. I might have come off as a total hag, but it was smart not to give in to the charms of some playboy. No matter how handsome he was. Yep, I\u2019d definitely dodged a bullet.</p><p>3.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>11:18 AM</p><p>The air whistled from my lungs rapidly as I struggled to come to terms with seeing Justin. I knew I would be running into him eventually, but I was still unprepared for this sudden appearance. Yeah, we shared the same best friends. I just thought I would have more time to prepare myself. If Satan himself had popped up and said, \u201cWelcome to hell,\u201d I don\u2019t think I would have been more shocked. It was bad enough I was riding in a steel death trap held up by tiny cables that supposedly could handle a certain weight, but I felt like a mouse dropped into a box with a snake. There was no escape from the one person I could honestly say hated me. I focused on keeping my breathing slow and steady to try to ease the sudden feeling that I would pass out.</p><p>I could feel Justin\u2019s stare burning a hole in me as I worked to keep my eyes averted from his. I concentrated instead on finding the button for Rob\u2019s floor, but they all seemed to blur together in a haze. Then I realized Justin had already pushed the button for the fifty-second floor. Of course he was going to see Rob. Why else would he be in this elevator at the same time as me? That asshole Rob. This was a setup. I was going to kill him. He knew how Justin felt about me, about our history. Did Rob think we would all show up to his office and make up and then head to lunch like nothing had ever happened? Justin had made his feelings quite clear two years ago. Even the passing of time and having lunch together wasn\u2019t going to erase the past hurt or the words we had shared.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d he bit out as I clutched the rail inside the elevator.</p><p>Bristling at his tone, I lashed out even though I knew I shouldn\u2019t rise to the bait. \u201cWhy, do you own this building now? Did you suddenly become a self-made millionaire while I\u2019ve been gone? Perhaps you finally grew some balls concerning your art,\u201d I sniped out pointedly, looking at the newest tattoo on his neck. I knew it was a low blow, but I couldn\u2019t have stopped the words if I tried.</p><p>\u201cHuh, look who\u2019s talking, sweetheart,\u201d he drawled condescendingly.</p><p>I fought the urge to punch him and wipe the sarcastic look off his face. The injustice of the whole situation was total bullshit. He\u2019d refused to ever own up to his part and instead let it tear us apart. I know what I did was awful, but he had set the wheels in motion. Not that I even needed to justify my actions. My decisions were mine to live with, but that didn\u2019t mean the burden was mine to carry alone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you\u2019re still an asshole,\u201d I said, watching the numbers above the door light up with each floor we passed. Only twenty floors left and I could get back on an elevator going down. I\u2019d take a cab to Melissa\u2019s and let her know what I thought of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s interference.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not surprised you\u2019re still a selfish bitch.\u201d</p><p>I tore my eyes away from the numbers to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cSome things never change,\u201d he snarled just as the elevator came to a halt.</p><p>Relieved that I could finally escape the oppressiveness of the enclosed box, I waited for the doors to slide open. When they didn\u2019t open after a moment, I looked up at the numbers, confused that they were all lit up.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d Justin said, reaching for the telephone in the elevator\u2019s call box.</p><p>Dread filled me. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck?\u201d I asked as panic quickly made its appearance. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck?\u201d I repeated, since he had ignored me the first time.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I heard through the receiver in Justin\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWe stopped moving here. Is something wrong with the elevator?\u201d Justin answered, holding the phone closer to his ear so I could no longer hear her response. Not that anything the mysterious person had to say would have mattered at the moment. I was freaking out, making it hard to hear anything but my own shallow breaths.</p><p>I frantically jabbed at the OPEN DOOR button over and over again to no avail. My breaths became short quick pants as I struggled to bring air into my lungs, which were refusing to cooperate. The elevator walls felt like they were closing in on me. I instinctively held out my arms to push them away. Black spots popped up in front of my eyes and I felt myself swaying slightly. I could hear Justin\u2019s voice from far off as he hung up with the operator.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he asked, still sounding like he was talking from the other side of a tunnel.</p><p>\u201cI hate closed-in spaces,\u201d I mumbled, realizing just as blackness pulled me under that this was another thing he didn\u2019t know about me.</p><p>Maybe we really never had known each other at all.</p><p>4.</p><p>November 2010</p><p>The crashing of our dorm room door against the wall woke me out of a sound sleep Halloween night. I sat up confused, rubbing my knuckles across my eyes so I could fully comprehend the sight in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d I asked, taking in the sight of Melissa standing in the doorway with half-inflated balloons covering her from her neck to her ankles. She looked like a cluster of grapes that had been left on the vine too long and had started to shrivel up.</p><p>\u201cI met someone,\u201d she squealed, bouncing up and down on my bed, not caring that she was crushing my legs.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d I asked, tugging at my legs to dislodge them from under her bony butt.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s not like the others. He\u2019s different,\u201d she said in a dreamy voice as she absently picked at the balloons that covered her body.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I answered, swinging my legs off the mattress. Glancing at the clock, I grimaced when I saw the time. \u201cGahhh, Melissa. It\u2019s two freaking AM. I have a trig exam in the morning,\u201d I complained, heading to the communal bathroom we shared with the room next door. Whoever came up with the brilliant idea that four girls could share a teeny-tiny bathroom must have been smoking crack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOops, sorry. I lost track of time. Rob and I spent hours talking. He\u2019s so smart and funny. He\u2019s some kind of business major, but he writes this poetry that makes your toes curl,\u201d she gushed as she flopped backward on my mattress, popping the few remaining balloons on her back that still had air in them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d I mumbled. I was used to her immediate fascination with something that was new and shiny. I closed the bathroom door behind me, but I could still hear her chattering away like I was in the room.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you meet this Rob the Poet character?\u201d I asked once I was back in my bed.</p> <p>\u201cBobbing for apples. He tied my hands behind my back,\u201d she sighed happily, pulling the balloons off one at a time.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019d watch who I mentioned that to. You know, the whole bondage thing,\u201d I teased, stifling a yawn.</p><p>\u201cHa, that\u2019s so not funny,\u201d she growled, throwing a balloon at me that missed the mark completely as it fluttered harmlessly toward the floor.</p><p>\u201cI try. Now shut off the light. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, party pooper,\u201d she grumbled before plunging the room into darkness.</p> <p>I fell asleep to the sound of more deflating balloons and Melissa still chattering on about how fantastic Rob was and how she couldn\u2019t wait for me to meet him. She finally quieted down after I chucked a pillow at her, even though I heard her complaining quietly how it would have been easier to take her costume off if she had a little light.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cHurry, Brittni, we\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Melissa demanded, hopping impatiently from one foot to the other while I pulled my favorite loosely woven sweater over my head.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said it starts at seven,\u201d I replied, adding the final touches to my appearance.</p><p>\u201cIt does, but Rob wanted us to get there early so we can support his friend. So get your ass in gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but need I remind you I\u2019m the one doing you a favor here? Art shows really aren\u2019t my thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, I know. How about you mention it another million times? But you agreed to go so Rob\u2019s best friend in the world isn\u2019t embarrassed if he doesn\u2019t get a good turnout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, having me there to witness his misery is a perk, how?\u201d I asked, pulling on my coat.</p><p>\u201cBodies are bodies. Anything that looks like people actually showed is better than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d I said gloomily, wishing I\u2019d stood firm on my original answer, which had been a resounding no. Melissa had worn me down over the last few days using every resource in her arsenal from begging to outright bribery. Her final last-ditch attempt was to offer to bring me morning coffee every day for the next month. That finally sealed the deal. What can I say? I\u2019m a coffee whore.</p><p>\u201cYou at least have to act like you\u2019re having fun or you\u2019ll be getting decaf delivered in the morning,\u201d she said as we made our way across campus huddled together. The brisk November wind was making a good effort at cutting through our jackets.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d I gasped.</p><p>\u201cI would. Now show me a smile.\u201d</p><p>I finally let my lips spread into a smile that came off more as a grimace.</p> <p>\u201cWhoa, slow down, sister. We don\u2019t want to scare them. How about a smile that doesn\u2019t look like someone is pulling off your toenails with pliers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d I asked, flashing an exaggerated smile that was all teeth.</p><p>\u201cBetter, I guess, but you might want to rethink the piece of spinach you have stuck between your teeth,\u201d she chirped, nudging me toward the campus art museum.</p><p>\u201cCrap, really?\u201d I griped, using my nail to dislodge the offending leaf.</p><p>\u201cAt least I told you,\u201d she pointed out as we stepped into the warm lobby. \u201cWhew, it is freaking cold out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing compared to what we get back home this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insanity,\u201d she replied, pulling off her jacket as she scanned the atrium. \u201cOh, there\u2019s Rob,\u201d she squealed, smoothing her hair down before dragging me off toward a dark-haired guy standing off to the side of the entryway talking to another guy who had his back to us.</p><p>\u201cMelissa,\u201d Rob said as he broke off his conversation and dragged Melissa into his arms for a quick hard hug.</p><p>\u201cRob, this is my roomie, aka college bestie, Brittni Mitchell,\u201d Melissa said, tugging my hand so I was face to face with her current crush.</p><p>\u201cRob, it\u2019s nice to meet you. Melissa thinks quite highly of your poetry,\u201d I said, holding out my hand for him to shake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a hugging kind of person,\u201d he said, ignoring my outstretched hand to pull me in. I automatically stiffened since I wasn\u2019t much of a hugger. It must be a trait I inherited from my dad because my mom is the exact opposite. She would hug a stranger on the street. Even Tressa and I were more the punch-in-the-arm kind of friends than hugging it out. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet my friend Justin,\u201d Rob finally said, releasing me. I knew by the chuckling behind me that it was too much of a coincidence to pray that his friend was not the same Justin who had hit on me the previous week.</p><p>\u201cBrittni, is it? I told you I\u2019d be alone the next time we met,\u201d the same voice drawled.</p><p>I turned around to acknowledge him after flashing a glare at Melissa, who looked completely mystified.</p><p>\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d she asked, looking questioningly at Rob, who looked equally confused.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we had the honor of meeting last week,\u201d I answered sarcastically. \u201cDid you leave your Playboy bunnies at the mansion, or are they fetching you a drink?\u201d I added, making a production of looking around. I knew I was being an uber bitch. I had no idea what was wrong with me. So he was a flirt. Half the males at UW were flirts. It just rubbed me the wrong way that he had no problem flirting with me while he was with someone else.</p><p>\u201cI told you, they\u2019re just friends, so sheathe the sword, honey,\u201d he answered smoothly, completely unscathed by my biting tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d Melissa hissed in my ear.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I mumbled out of the corner of my mouth, feeling slightly abashed at my behavior.</p><p>\u201cWell, knock it off. It\u2019s rude to insult the artist at his first showing,\u201d she said through gritted teeth, looking embarrassed for me.</p><p>\u201cThis is your show?\u201d I asked unbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cSurprised again? How could a bad boy have actually left the tattoo parlor and dropped the beer long enough to create something, right?\u201d he quizzed, smirking at me.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I answered, smiling grudgingly at him for the first time. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll reserve further judgment until I look around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from you,\u201d he answered, with the same smirk on his face. It was clear he was enjoying himself immensely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That wasn\u2019t nice of me,\u201d I said apologetically, turning toward my friend, who was studying me like I was a creature that had just crawled up from the pits of some swamp. She looked at me with an equal mixture of horror and morbid fascination. I couldn\u2019t blame her. In the year and half that we had been roommates, I had never acted like this. Sure, I could be standoffish, but I was never stuck up. It was like I was channeling my inner Mean Girl.</p><p>Rob, on the other hand, was openly laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny, bro?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>\u201cDid you say \u2018bad boy\u2019? More like \u2018dud boy,\u2019\u201d he said, gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a douche-stick. I could totally be a bad boy,\u201d Justin complained, socking Rob in the arm.</p><p>\u201cRiiiiight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I asked you here tonight to lend some moral support,\u201d Justin said dryly.</p><p>\u201cDude, I\u2019ve got your back on your art, but the bad-boy status is a no-go,\u201d Rob said, slinging an arm around Melissa\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSo, let\u2019s show these ladies your kick-ass artwork,\u201d he added, leading Melissa into the main room of the building.</p><p>\u201cYou game?\u201d Justin asked me, nodding toward the room.</p><p>\u201cSure, let\u2019s see what you got,\u201d I said, following along, but not sure what to expect. Maybe something abstract, like art created from metal or maybe beer bottles. Stepping through the doorway, though, I was completely caught off-guard at what I saw. The art on display in front of me stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Justin asked, turning to look back at me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak as I took in the pieces scattered throughout the room. I wasn\u2019t even sure if beautiful was the right word to describe his art. It deserved a word with more impact, like breathtaking, even though that didn\u2019t seem quite sufficient either. They literally took my breath away. He didn\u2019t use the typical canvas to make his mark. Instead, he used huge slabs of distressed wood that were easily six feet across and five feet high. Each piece of wood was different in shape, but there was no mistaking that every one belonged to him. He didn\u2019t do the cutesy landscapes or abstract art that left you scratching your head in confusion. I guess an ignorant person would call what he did portrait art, but to call it that was almost an insult. Each piece depicted a different face. Some were young, while others were older. There was an equal mixture of women and men of all races. Each one was beautiful beyond words. Instead of covering the wood with paint, he had used the paint to enhance the natural coloring in all the different types of woods he used. It was as if he had stamped an image on each piece.</p><p>\u201cInsane, right?\u201d Melissa squealed, joining me. I hushed her, not wanting to spoil the mood with mindless chatter.</p><p>\u201cSo come on. What do you think?\u201d Justin asked earnestly as Melissa melted away into the background. I took a moment to answer as I studied the painting of the elderly woman in front of me. The attention to detail blew my mind as I took in every wrinkle and crease on her face.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re amazing. You\u2019re going to be famous,\u201d I breathed, finally able to speak.</p><p>\u201cDid hell just freeze over, or did you just give me a compliment?\u201d he asked, winking at me as he reached for my hand with excitement. \u201cThere\u2019s hope for us yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope? That\u2019s an awfully strong word to use,\u201d I said, looking down at our linked hands. \u201cI\u2019m not going out on a date with you, even if you\u2019re not a typical bad boy,\u201d I added, pulling my hand from his. I tried not to think about how warm and inviting it had felt wrapped around my fingers or whether every part of him was equally warm.</p><p>\u201cGive me one good reason why not,\u201d he coaxed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you two. One, you\u2019re a terrible flirt,\u201d I said, holding up a finger.</p><p>\u201cHey, I think my flirting skills are top-notch,\u201d he interrupted, deliberately being dense.</p><p>\u201cExactly, you\u2019d flirt with anything that has a pair of tits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. I\u2019ve never hit on a cow,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cOnly because there aren\u2019t a whole lot of cows walking around the Seattle area,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re exaggerating the flirting, but that\u2019s a doable fix. What\u2019s reason number two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t date smokers. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, easy fix,\u201d he bragged.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really a smoker. I enjoy an occasional cigarette, but that\u2019s about all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t date people in denial who only smoke occasionally,\u201d I stated skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. I bet I smoke a cigarette a week, if that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven one a week is a deal breaker for me. I hate the smell and the smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. I won\u2019t smoke while we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about dating? We were talking about one date,\u201d I squawked, wondering how he\u2019d gained the upper hand. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about his persistence.</p><p>\u201cFine. Go out with me once. If you hate it, no harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go out with you. I don\u2019t even like you,\u201d I said, less convincingly than I had the last time I\u2019d seen him.</p><p>\u201cSure you do. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said confidently. \u201cCome on, one date.\u201d</p><p>I studied his earnest expression for a few seconds, mentally weighing the pros and cons. \u201cFine, but I\u2019m going to hate it,\u201d I said, caving as he grinned at me.</p><p>5.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>11:20 AM</p><p>I came to with Justin hovering over me. My eyes focused on his, and for a moment I thought I saw a flash of concern before his stare hardened again. \u201cI never thought you\u2019d take the damsel-in-distress route,\u201d I heard him say as he backed up to the far side of the elevator.</p><p>I closed my eyes again to try to get my bearings. Whatever asshole comments he had, coupled with the fact that I was lying on some nasty elevator floor, were the least of my concerns. My biggest problem was that I felt no movement beneath me, meaning I was still stranded in this death trap. I slowly slid myself up until I was sitting against the wall of the elevator. Feeling no less panicked than when I blacked out, I focused on keeping my breathing steady to move my attention from the elevator walls, which still felt as if they would smother me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d I asked, indicating the call box.</p><p>\u201cJust that there\u2019s some kind of power failure and we should sit tight while they call the experts,\u201d he barked out. He couldn\u2019t even bring himself to look at me as he held his phone in the air. \u201cI\u2019m not getting dick for cell service either. I\u2019m going to kick Rob\u2019s ass when we finally get out of here.\u201d</p><p>His words slowly registered in my brain. Sit tight? What the hell did that even mean? Sit tight for the next few seconds? A few minutes? Several hours? Seriously, who tells someone to sit tight while they\u2019re trapped with their ex in a small enclosed space hundreds of feet in the air?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to pass out again, are you?\u201d he asked sarcastically as he studied me from across the elevator. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you being such a pansy.\u201d</p><p>I ignored his ribbing while I concentrated on my breathing. \u201cDid she guesstimate how long it would take?\u201d I tried to sound unconcerned but knew it was pointless.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? We\u2019re stuck together. Talk about irony at its worst,\u201d he snapped. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say you\u2019d had something to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, you got me,\u201d I snapped, sitting up straight. \u201cI\u2019ve missed your winning personality so much that Rob and I worked out this whole plan to hijack an elevator so I could be alone with you and tell you how much I missed you, and how I can\u2019t live another day without you, and how I\u2019ve tried to get hold of you for the last two years. Oh wait\u2014I haven\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He eyed me critically for a moment before looking away, almost satisfied. My sudden anger had dissipated any panic I was feeling. Judging by the look on his face, it was as though that had been his intention all along, but I knew better. It would be a cold day in hell before he ever did anything that came close to helping me.</p><p>The little bit of adrenaline I felt from my outburst was short-lived. Slumping back against the elevator again, I no longer felt like the walls were closing in on me, but it didn\u2019t make the situation any more comfortable. We both sat in stubborn silence, as if the first one to talk would somehow lose the battle. The tension was high and began to feel heavy and oppressive, but I wasn\u2019t about to cave.</p><p>\u201cSince when are you scared of elevators?\u201d Justin asked, without looking at me.</p> <p>I silently celebrated my small victory and even debated being petty for a moment and not answering him, but the silence was wearing on me. \u201cSince always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe because we never went on an elevator together\u2014or maybe we just didn\u2019t talk about those things.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re pretty good at keeping secrets.\u201d</p><p>I sighed loudly. This was why there would be no reconciliation, even after two years. I had made a decision that threw down a gauntlet between us. I clamped my mouth closed, determined not to say another word until we were out of this situation. Pulling my iPhone from my bag, I began to scroll through my apps in search of anything to help pass the time. No bars meant no Facebook or Twitter, so I clicked on Spider Solitaire. I could feel Justin\u2019s eyes boring into me, but I wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of looking up. By the time I was playing my second hand of solitaire, I had successfully managed to put him somewhat out of my mind. When he finally did speak again, the suddenness of his voice made me jump.</p> <p>\u201cSo, why the hatred of elevators?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Glancing up, I weighed his question, wondering if it was even worth it to tell the story. Surely the elevator would start moving at any time. Justin continued to stare at me, waiting for an answer. This was how it had always been with us. He was always asking questions about my life before college, wanting to hear all my stories. I had chalked it up to the artist in him, who seemed to look at life in layers, as if it were a painting or a sculpture. Looking back now, it seemed crazy that I had never shared the elevator story with him since it was such a traumatic moment in my life.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in seventh grade my hand got crushed in an elevator door,\u201d I answered, flexing the fingers on my right hand, which to this day still tended to tighten up and often went numb.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, waiting instead like he had so many times before for me to continue. It was so achingly familiar that my heart actually hurt. In the two years since our breakup, I had convinced myself that our relationship had been nothing special. That it only seemed that way because it was so intense and new at the time. Now, sitting here, it was painfully clear that I was kidding myself to think I could dismiss what we had shared.</p><p>\u201cWe were on a field trip to the public library in the big city not far from Woodfalls. It was a yearly tradition for seventh graders and believe it or not, was a pretty big deal for us considering the library in Woodfalls at that time was a joke. We were supposed to be doing research for some class project on influential figures of the twentieth century. Our teacher was old school and wanted us to use actual books for research in lieu of the Internet. Anyway, this library was huge and had two floors with an elevator. Well, for some reason\u2014I don\u2019t even remember why anymore\u2014a few of us decided to go for a joyride. Then, that creep Tommy Jones, who knew I was scared anyway, had convinced everyone to run off the elevator just as the door was closing. Afraid of being on the elevator by myself, I stuck out my hand to stop the door, but my hand didn\u2019t make it to the rubber sensor that should have caused the doors to bounce back open. Instead, the elevator door closed against my fingers for the entire ride up to the second floor. I screamed bloody murder the entire time and freaked out everyone in the library,\u201d I said, grinning wryly. \u201cEspecially when they saw my hand,\u201d I added, wagging my fingers at him. \u201cI broke all four fingers on my right hand and also sprained my left hand in my frantic attempt to try to pry the elevator door open. By the time I got to the hospital, my fingers were swollen to the size of sausages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pound the prick Tommy Jones with your cast?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNope. I didn\u2019t have to. Word spread to his mom, who happened to be the principal of our school. She stuck it to him, made him shadow me for six weeks. He had to do all my writing for me in my classes. I had a cast on one hand and an Ace bandage wrapped around the other, but watching Tommy doing double work was almost worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have still pounded his ass,\u201d Justin growled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re quick to overreact in a situation,\u201d I said, instantly wishing I could recall the words.</p><p>\u201cAt least I react in some fashion, like any normal human. I\u2019m not some freaking robot that can\u2019t show any emotion,\u201d he snarled, turning away from me. My heart dropped. We were never going to get past this. He thought I was emotionless, but he hadn\u2019t been there to see what had really happened. I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to dwell on how harsh he sounded, because I knew the truth.</p><p>6.</p><p>November 2010</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked with Justin leading me by the hand from my dorm room. It had been a week since his art show and the day of our first date had finally arrived. I\u2019d had serious doubts and even tried backing out. I pleaded with Melissa to lie and cover for me, but she wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cWhat the frick is your deal with this guy?\u201d she asked, placing her hands on her hips for emphasis because somehow that made her point more clearly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been like this before. You\u2019ve got your OCD issues when it comes to dating, and whatever that crazy one-date-only rule is, I\u2019ll never understand, but usually you give the dude a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I sighed, sinking down on my bed. \u201cSomething about him just unsettles me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnsettles? Do you not trust him?\u201d she asked, concerned. \u201cDid he do something?\u201d she added, looking as ferocious as her slight five-foot-one-inch frame would allow.</p><p>\u201cChill, mother hen. No, he just makes me feel weird, kind of jittery. I disliked him on sight, and yeah, maybe that was wrong and a bit presumptuous on my part. Especially considering at his art show I got a glimpse of a side of him I wasn\u2019t expecting, but now I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be disappointed because he\u2019ll turn out to be the asshole I pegged him for in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some messed-up logic,\u201d she said, hitting me with a pillow. \u201cIt sounds to me like you like him and you don\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders since she\u2019d pretty much nailed it on the head.</p><p>\u201cIn that case then, no, I won\u2019t lie for you. It\u2019ll do you some good to forget about these preconceived notions of yours and realize that sometimes it takes more than one date to get to know someone. Besides, you\u2019ve got to give a little to get a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like you. I don\u2019t give anything on the first date,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cHey, whatever, slut, that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d she squealed, tossing the pillow at my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d I laughed. \u201cAnyway, I disagree. If the first date sucks, then why should I torment myself by going out a second time? Face it, Melissa, college guys are the same duds they were in high school. They\u2019re just a little cockier and more persistent here,\u201d I pointed out, since her track record wasn\u2019t that much better than mine.</p><p>\u201cRob is different, though,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd maybe Justin will be too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say. Only time will tell,\u201d I said, rising reluctantly from my bed so I could get dressed.</p><p>An hour later I wished I were still on my bed instead of heading out on some date, during the day no less, waiting for Justin to answer my question.</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you where we\u2019re going, it\u2019ll ruin the surprise, but I think you might like it,\u201d he said, grinning confidently as he stopped in front of a beat-up jeep with no roof and no doors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like jeeps?\u201d he asked, leading me to the passenger side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel about them one way or another. I\u2019ve never ridden in one. It\u2019s just\u2014you do realize you live in Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not the most practical vehicle for this state, is it? You know the whole \u2018no roof, no door, lots of rain\u2019 thing. Not to mention, I could easily picture one sharp turn sending me tumbling out to become instant roadkill.\u201d With those words, I pulled on my seat belt to make sure it was firmly latched.</p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re not afraid to get a little wet, are you?\u201d He cranked the engine, which started with a loud grumble before idling louder than I was used to. I\u2019m sure the missing windows and roof were partly to blame for some of the noise, but not much.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d I answered. \u201cJust tell me you at least have an umbrella.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as we accelerated down the road. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it has a roof and doors for rainy days and a soft top for the summertime, but when it\u2019s cool like this with no rain in the forecast, I like to take it all off,\u201d he said conversationally.</p><p>I nodded but didn\u2019t answer since the wind whipping around us made it difficult to hear. I was glad I\u2019d pulled my hair back before I left my room, since riding like this would have surely turned me into a striking replica of a scarecrow. The breeze was downright cold as we sped along, but surprisingly it felt kind of nice as it chilled my face. My fear of tumbling out the side of the jeep had faded as the exhilaration of the ride took over. There was an odd sense of freedom that came from speeding down the road with nothing boxing me in. I didn\u2019t realize I was smiling until Justin commented on it.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were a jeep kind of girl,\u201d he said, pulling into a half-full parking lot.</p><p>\u201cSeattle Aquarium?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of my muse for a new series I\u2019m working on,\u201d he answered, hopping down from the jeep and heading over to my side. He pulled off his gloves and placed his hands on my chilled face. The warmth of his hands and his close proximity set me on edge.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I pulled back.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I was just warming up your face. It\u2019s beet red from the wind,\u201d he answered, taking another step closer. We stared at each other for a moment as if in a trance. I couldn\u2019t help focusing on his lips, wondering what they would feel like on mine. Part of me wanted to shove him away, but then I thought about what Melissa had said. My brain was sending me frantic warning messages and I could feel myself leaning in like I had no control of my body.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me help you down,\u201d he said, reaching for my hands. I sat for a moment, confused about what had just happened. Did he just play me, or had I misread his signals? The look on Justin\u2019s face gave me no indication. Either he had a great poker face, or he was oblivious and I was the idiot who thought she was about to be kissed.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHuh, yeah, I guess,\u201d I answered, hoping I didn\u2019t sound as squirrelly as I felt at the moment. \u201cI thought you only painted people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost times I do. I was asked to do a series for the hospital, so I\u2019m kinda mixing it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s awesome. It must be cool to earn money off your talent while you\u2019re still in school.\u201d Money was kind of tight for me since I only worked a few hours a week at a local daycare. Working around my school schedule had proven to be much more difficult this semester and I had lost a ton of hours.</p><p>\u201cNah, this isn\u2019t a paying gig,\u201d he answered as we approached the ticket booth.</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s insanity. Your work is too good to give away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool. I just like being able to do what I love. Besides, think about all the people who will get to see it every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, but I still think you should get paid. I know a hospital is a more charitable kind of thing, but I also know they make the bucks too.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, making it obvious he wasn\u2019t all that crazy about the direction of the conversation. I wanted to say more about the fact that he was being taken advantage of and that he needed to know his value, but I let it drop. It wasn\u2019t any of my business to tell him what he should or shouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>Some of the awkward tension left Justin once we walked through the aquarium doors and he linked his fingers with mine. I could have easily pulled my hand away but became quickly distracted by the large window in front of us with hundreds of fish swimming behind it. We didn\u2019t have anything this cool near Woodfalls. My only experience with aquariums was a trip to the Baltimore National Aquarium I had won in a short-story writing contest when I was thirteen. Ten winners got to go. The best part was our English teacher, Ms. Cooper, was our chaperone. The worst part was the twelve-hour van ride to Baltimore. I felt nauseated the entire way, but once we got there it was completely worth it. I enjoyed seeing all the different exhibits and being able to feed the dolphins and touch the stingrays. The Seattle Aquarium was tiny in comparison, but I kinda preferred the intimate feel. Plus, it was a hell of a lot less crowded.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d I proclaimed, staring into the large enclosure.</p><p>\u201cPretty cool, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you saying how much you liked Puget Sound last week, so I thought you\u2019d enjoy seeing what\u2019s beneath the surface,\u201d he said, sitting down on a bench. He unzipped an old worn-out backpack that had seen better days and pulled out a sketchpad and a thick pencil.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re doing fish for the hospital?\u201d I asked, nodding toward the large window.</p><p>He ignored my question and focused completely on the sketchpad in his hands. It was as if he had been put under some kind of trance the moment the sketchpad hit his hands. The pencil seemed to have a mind of its own as it moved effortlessly across the page. I turned my attention back to the fish behind the thick glass. It was entertaining to watch the dynamics of life in a world so different from my own. Some of the fish swam lethargically along, like they didn\u2019t have a care in the world, while others seemed to be chasing each other as they darted in and around the plants. With my eyes still on the live show in front of me, I settled on the bench next to Justin, who still had not looked up. Minutes faded away and many families came and went. Some gasped over the fish behind the huge glass, while others didn\u2019t look impressed at all. Through dozens of screaming and squealing kids, Justin and I remained on the bench. If not for the scratching of the pencil, I would have assumed he had fallen asleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was thirty minutes later when he finally looked up from the page. \u201cSorry, I wanted to get that down while it was still fresh in my mind,\u201d he said, closing the sketchpad.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast,\u201d I said, holding out my hand. \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not done,\u201d he answered, stowing it in his bag.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t argue. The intensity he had the entire time he was drawing led me to believe he took his work very seriously.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d he asked, indicating the large expanse of windows in front of us. \u201cPretty cool way to show visitors a glimpse into what it\u2019s like beneath Puget Sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s breathtaking. I could stay here all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d he said, throwing his head back to laugh. Several preteen girls turned to stare at him, looking completely entranced before dissolving into a heap of giggles. As we left the viewing area, I could still hear them giggling and chattering away.</p><p>\u201cI think you have a fan club,\u201d I said, throwing a look over my shoulder at the girls.</p> <p>\u201cYou think?\u201d he asked, raising his pierced eyebrow, which naturally drew my attention. Everything about him seemed designed to appeal to the opposite sex. I wasn\u2019t the only one to notice as we continued walking through the aquarium. I caught women young and old openly admiring him. There was no denying he was attractive. Obviously, any warm-blooded female would attest to that. Knowing the way the female mind works, I realized I was also being judged by his many admirers as to whether I was worthy to be with someone with his looks. Not that I felt I was ugly, but feeling insecure around guys was never my thing. Being with Justin had a way of making me feel like I was lacking in one capacity or another. It was more my problem than his, and I realized that. The only problem was I was beginning to find I actually enjoyed his company. He was laid back, good-natured, and very easy to talk to. It was a shame I had to end things before they got started.</p><p>We were eating lunch when I mentioned it. \u201cToday has been really fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I sense a but coming?\u201d he asked, dipping a French fry in ketchup.</p><p>I smiled slightly at his intuitiveness. At least he wasn\u2019t dense like the last guy I ended it with before the first date was even over. \u201cBut, I just think we\u2019re too different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m not the most open person,\u201d I started, glaring at him when he grinned broadly at my words. \u201cFine, it\u2019s obvious,\u201d I acknowledged. \u201cThe point is you\u2019re the exact opposite. You have a way of making someone feel special even if you don\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d he asked, settling back in his chair with his arms crossed across his chest.</p><p>\u201cLike you don\u2019t know,\u201d I answered, exasperated. \u201cA smile here. A wink there. You\u2019re a born flirt. I may have been off on the bad-boy part, but I was dead-on when it comes to your flirty nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlirty nature? God, could you emasculate me any more?\u201d he joked, leaning forward so we were closer. \u201cSo, I\u2019m friendly. No harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlayer,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cEasygoing,\u201d he volleyed.</p><p>\u201cTease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAffectionate.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help laughing at his persistence. \u201cWhatever way you phrase it, I\u2019m not looking for a relationship.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d he asked with a more serious tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I answered honestly. \u201cI\u2019ve been here a year and a half and I feel like I\u2019m barely scratching the surface. Take today, for example. I\u2019m not sure I would have ever come here if you hadn\u2019t brought me. It\u2019s not like this is a place my friends are talking about. There are so many things I want to do that I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to do before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrict parents?\u201d he questioned.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just, I\u2019m from a very small town. You know, the kind of place where you sneeze and everyone knows about it. God forbid you actually do something scandalous like make out with Gregory James in Mr. Jacobs\u2019s science lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGregory James? Is he someone I have to worry about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. My point is I\u2019m enjoying my freedom more than I ever thought I would. I don\u2019t feel like bogging it down with a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get lonely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met my roommate?\u201d I joked. \u201cMelissa kinda doesn\u2019t allow for loneliness.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cShe is something else. I like her, though. Her enthusiasm is cool and Rob seems to dig her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t get me wrong. I love her to death, but she pretty much fills any void I may have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you two were those kind of roommates,\u201d he teased, his innuendo clear. \u201cMaybe I should come hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you two don\u2019t have pillow fights?\u201d he asked, giving me puppy-dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cStrangely, no. We also don\u2019t have wet T-shirt contests or play Truth or Dare every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust on some nights?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cIs it hard-wired in every guy\u2019s brain that girl-on-girl is hot?\u201d I asked, popping a fry into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cDepends on the girls,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cOh boy. Sexist much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls just look at it wrong. It\u2019s more of a compliment that we\u2019d like to see you hook up at least once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me while I puke,\u201d I said, making exaggerated gagging noises.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re done with lunch?\u201d he asked. He crumpled up his burger wrapper and tossed it into his empty fry container.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Are we leaving?\u201d I asked. I was surprised he\u2019d given in so quickly. Just goes to show my instincts were dead-on.</p><p>\u201cHell no. If I only get one date with you, I\u2019m going to make it worthwhile. We\u2019ve pretty much seen everything here, so we\u2019re going to head out to see one of my favorite things about Seattle. You game?\u201d</p><p>I turned his words over in my mind, trying to decide what to do. My intention had been to call it a day once we left the aquarium. I wasn\u2019t one to give false hope for something that wasn\u2019t going to happen, but he already knew where I stood and seemed to accept it. I didn\u2019t see the harm in finishing the day as long as he knew once it was over, that would be it.</p><p>\u201cLead the way,\u201d I finally answered, trying to convince myself it didn\u2019t mean anything that he smiled broadly at my words.</p><p>My second ride in his jeep was as exhilarating as the first. The sun had broken through the cloudy morning haze, making it feel almost warm outside. My face was still red and felt slightly chapped by the time we pulled into the parking spot at our next destination. \u201cOlympic Sculpture Park?\u201d I questioned.</p><p>\u201cHave you been here?\u201d he asked, sounding disappointed.</p><p>\u201cNo, but some guys were talking about it in my psychology class last semester. I\u2019ve wanted to come out here but kept forgetting about it,\u201d I answered, jumping down from the jeep.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad I thought to bring you here, then,\u201d he said, leading the way.</p><p>I could see why this was his favorite place. Even though I wasn\u2019t an artist, something about the outdoor museum was tranquil and peaceful. The art was oversized and I knew I was most likely missing the significance of each piece, but I still enjoyed looking at each one. Justin kept up a running commentary, providing all the details of the nine-acre park. He also pointed out the pieces that were permanent and the sections that were there on a temporary basis. I couldn\u2019t help eating up his words. His attention to detail and facts about each piece kept me interested.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked as we made our way back to where we had started from.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely has the cool factor,\u201d I answered, buttoning up my jacket to ward off the sudden chill in the air.</p><p>\u201cThanks for bringing me here. Today was fun,\u201d I admitted as we left the park.</p><p>\u201cDay\u2019s not over yet. It\u2019s time for some grub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain? We just ate,\u201d I said, checking the time on my phone.</p><p>\u201cLike four hours ago. Besides, by the time we eat it\u2019ll be closer to five hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother favorite place of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have a lot of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I like something, I don\u2019t have any qualms about stating my feelings,\u201d he answered in a voice that made me wonder if it held a double meaning.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d Justin asked as we piled into his jeep.</p><p>\u201cNot too bad now, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be a Popsicle once we start moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, reaching behind my seat and extracting an oversized fleece blanket. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s clean. I keep it in here for when my kid sister is in the jeep with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my sister. Are you always this distrustful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but with your reputation I\u2019m just trying to stay on my toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat reputation?\u201d he asked, popping open the glove compartment and pulling out a skullcap. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some pretty funked-up views about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Melissa told me you\u2019ve dated enough girls to fill a sorority house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Talk about people in glass houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insinuating that I\u2019ve gone out with as many people as you?\u201d I sputtered indignantly.</p><p>\u201cInsinuating? Hell no. I\u2019m stating a fact. You\u2019re no different than me, sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cWhatever helps you sleep at night,\u201d he said loudly over the wind that was whipping through the vehicle.</p><p>I fought the childish urge to stick out my tongue at him. His dating life and mine were worlds apart, considering the fact that I didn\u2019t fall into bed with every guy I dated. I kept that piece of information to myself, though. No reason to discuss my sex life with someone I hardly knew. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if loose-lips Melissa had already filled him in on my stats in that category. Her ass was mine when I got back to the dorm. Revenge would be swift and just.</p><p>We drove in silence for close to thirty minutes and despite my misgivings about the blanket on my lap, I ended up burrowing my face in it when the wind became almost painful. With the warm fleece against my sore face, the ride was bearable and I could enjoy it despite my watery eyes.</p><p>I began to have misgivings about more than the blanket as the city and businesses faded behind us and were replaced by suburbs. Justin made a left turn, and a right, and a left again. Not that it mattered. All the house-lined streets looked the same. There were no restaurants in sight, which left me with only one sadistic thought. Please don\u2019t let him be a weirdo who is dragging me to his dungeon or something.</p><p>My heart sank when he pulled into a circular driveway and parked behind an oversized SUV that screamed family vehicle.</p><p>\u201cPlease, for the love of all things holy, tell me you\u2019re not some crazy stalker. That this isn\u2019t your secret residence and you plan on chaining me up in your basement or something,\u201d I said, eyeing the brightly lit house with trepidation.</p><p>He looked at me like I had sprung an extra head before laughing loudly. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m fresh out of chains. This is my mom\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d I mumbled as he jumped down from the vehicle.</p><p>He laughed at my colorful choice of words, but I could have sworn I heard him mutter something along the lines that he\u2019d like to do just that.</p><p>7.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>12:14 PM</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d Justin ranted. He surged to his feet after twenty minutes of uncomfortable silence in our stalled-out tomb.</p><p>I remained silent as he paced back and forth, swearing with each step. His outburst was unexpected. The entire time we\u2019d dated he\u2019d always been so laid back, except for the end, of course. I watched him with a heavy heart, wondering where the boy I had fallen in love with had gone. The man pacing in front of me showed little resemblance to the person I once knew. Was this my fault? Did the lies and secrets lead to this?</p><p>After a few minutes of watching him tick like a bomb waiting to go off, I finally broke into his rant. \u201cHow\u2019s your family?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>The words instantly had the effect I knew they would. Above all else, Justin loved his family. The first night I met them I would have gladly swum with a tank full of hungry flesh-eating piranhas rather than walk into their house. It had taken Justin a full five minutes to talk me out of his jeep. I remember how he had laughed at my apprehension as we made our way up the lighted path to the front door. It was obvious he thought I might bolt, which was completely possible.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all the same,\u201d he sighed against the elevator wall. \u201cCrazy, loud, obnoxious at times, but I guess some would call it lovable,\u201d he answered with a hint of pride in his voice.</p><p>\u201cSome things never change,\u201d I mused. I had to admit I missed them.</p><p>\u201cThey still ask about you,\u201d he admitted, studying his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cThey do?\u201d I asked, although I wasn\u2019t surprised. They were sweet people who had welcomed me from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cI never told them what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d I asked in a strained voice.</p><p>\u201cNo. I figured, why ruin the illusion?\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cThey all thought you were perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never pretended to be perfect,\u201d I mumbled, picking invisible lint off my pants. \u201cHow\u2019s Hollie?\u201d I asked, trying to steer the conversation away from another yell-fest.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great. The same gangly, awkward, but beautiful girl. She started middle school last year and is a total band geek now,\u201d he answered like a proud parent. She was his kid sister, but in truth he was probably a better father than her real dad.</p><p>\u201cBand? That\u2019s great. I guess the tone-deaf gene skipped her, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have. She definitely has mad skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Travis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better once we convinced him he wasn\u2019t that unique just because he came out of the closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your dad? Is he still giving him a hard time?\u201d I inquired with an edge in my voice. Out of his whole family, the only one I\u2019d disliked was his father. Since his parents were divorced, I\u2019d had the misfortune of meeting him once. He was a total monkey-douche. How Justin\u2019s sweet, loving, and a bit harebrained mother wound up with such an ass was beyond me. He was unyielding and opinionated and gave all new meaning to the word dictator. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The ringing of the elevator\u2019s emergency phone interrupted our conversation. \u201cFinally,\u201d I shouted, jumping to my feet as Justin grabbed the receiver.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe\u2019re fine, just ready to get out of here.\u201d I wished I could hear the voice on the other end. With all my nervous energy, I almost ripped the phone from his hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. You can\u2019t be serious,\u201d he replied, looking deflated. \u201cCan you at least contact Rob Froch on the fifty-second floor and let him know we\u2019re in here? He\u2019s expecting us.\u201d His words immediately took the wind from my sails also. I slid back down against the elevator wall, waiting for the inevitable bad news.</p> <p>\u201cIt may be a couple hours at least before they can get someone here to fix it,\u201d Justin complained as he hung up the receiver.</p><p>8.</p><p>November 2010</p><p>Meeting Justin\u2019s family was as awkward as I thought it would be. His mother was pleasant during the introductions, but judging by the surprised look on her face, my visit was as unexpected for her as it was for me. I kept a smile plastered to my face as we exchanged pleasantries, while I plotted Justin\u2019s demise the entire time in my mind. Things became more comfortable after his brother and sister joined us, and I watched how they interacted together. He teased his little sister, Hollie, mercifully, but she ate it up. It became glaringly obvious Justin was her hero. His younger brother, Travis, instantly drew me in with his intuitiveness and tender but humorous insight. During dinner he regaled us with stories that I\u2019m sure Justin would rather have remained family secrets. My stomach ached from laughing so hard. It turned out Justin\u2019s mother was a teacher, which made for smooth conversation also. We talked about my majoring in education and how things had changed in public schools during her twenty-five years of teaching. Things had gone so well at that point that I was in the process of silently patting myself on the back, when of course the inevitable happened, and I dropped a stack of dishes as I was helping clear the table. Justin, Travis, and Hollie had all responded by applauding at me standing among the pile of broken dishes. Suddenly, Justin\u2019s demise became an option again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about the dishes,\u201d I apologized for the hundredth time as Trish, Justin\u2019s mom, walked us to the front door.</p> <p>\u201cHoney, it\u2019s really no big deal. They were a gift from my former in-laws, so you actually did me a favor,\u201d she said, patting me on the back.</p><p>I returned her smile, even though I felt like a complete heel.</p><p>\u201cCome back and break dishes soon,\u201d Hollie teased from the couch, where she was reading a book.</p><p>I grimaced at her words as everyone else laughed at my expense.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, or was there something else you\u2019d like to drop?\u201d Justin joked before opening the door and guiding me out.</p><p>\u201cI should kill you for that,\u201d I complained as we made our way back to his jeep.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you trying to kid? I saw the way you were smiling. You enjoyed yourself. Admit it,\u201d Justin chided me as he opened the door to the jeep. He and Travis had reinstalled the roof and doors after dinner. His mom had chastised him about trying to freeze me out. I tried to reassure her it wasn\u2019t all that bad, but she\u2019d played the mother card and gave the guys no choice in the matter. The nighttime drop in temperature made me silently thankful for her insight. I would have frozen my butt off.</p><p>\u201cFine. It wasn\u2019t as bad as getting the skin on my face melted off,\u201d I declared, buckling my seat belt. \u201cThough I could have done without the dish disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I would hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were cool,\u201d I admitted, trying to keep things in perspective.</p><p>\u201cThey thought you were \u2018cool\u2019 too,\u201d he said dryly, seeing through my nonchalant fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t live on campus?\u201d I asked as he cranked the engine.</p><p>\u201cNo. I moved back home when my dad decided to make an example out of Travis. He moved out and I moved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018make an example out of Travis\u2019?\u201d I couldn\u2019t picture anyone having a problem with the sweet, lovable teenager I had just met.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad didn\u2019t take too kindly to Travis coming out. He put Travis through the wall in our dining room when he found out,\u201d Justin bit out as he clenched the steering wheel tightly in his hands.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? No offense, but how could he not have known?\u201d I asked. After having a simple conversation with Travis, I was able to figure it out. Not because he wore it like a badge or anything, but his mannerisms and soft-spoken nature had been a dead giveaway.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, my dad is famous for ignoring what\u2019s right in front of his face. He doesn\u2019t like it when things stray from the path he\u2019s set. God forbid his little soldiers have a mind of their own or move to a different beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what beat do you move to?\u201d I asked, sensing so much more to his story.</p><p>\u201cJust put it this way: My dad is in the frame of mind that art is for pansies. He had some crazy notion that I would grow up to be a lawyer or some crazy shit like that. When he found out I was majoring in art, he gave me an ultimatum. Pick a real major or get out. I got out. Of course, I made it hard for him to ignore my art,\u201d Justin said.</p><p>Suddenly, his words from a couple of weeks ago clicked through my head. \u201cYour tattoos are your designs,\u201d I stated as understanding dawned on me. \u201cYou got them so your father would have to face it,\u201d I said with awe, wondering where that kind of belief and strength came from. It made me think about my relationship with my own mom. It wasn\u2019t until I turned fifteen that her notorious busybody ways really began to bother me. I wanted to tell her but could never think of a way to do it without hurting her feelings. Instead, I made it my goal to hold my secrets close and away from her eagle eyes. It was that desire that had prompted me to apply to a school as far from home as I could get.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got my first tattoo when I moved out. The second and third followed quickly after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d I asked, wondering if his father was finally accepting his dreams.</p><p>\u201cSilent treatment for two months,\u201d Justin answered proudly.</p><p>\u201cMature much?\u201d I said sarcastically.</p><p>Justin\u2019s laugh had a bit of an edge to it. \u201cTwo months is nothing. He hasn\u2019t spoken to Travis in like a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a dick,\u201d I said, not caring that I was talking about his parent.</p><p>\u201cThat about sums it up,\u201d Justin said, shooting me a real grin this time. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else. We\u2019ve wasted enough of our one and only date talking about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, I don\u2019t know. You might be able to score another date if you play your cards right,\u201d I answered in my most blas\u00e9 tone.</p><p>\u201cI knew the ole meet-the-family trick would seal the deal,\u201d he said triumphantly, slapping the steering wheel with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me you played me?\u201d I asked with mock indignation.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen. Admit it. You were wrong about me,\u201d he said, placing his hand on my knee.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes on his hand, wondering exactly how I felt about it on my knee. I was by no means a prude, but by allowing it I was sending a signal that I was interested. Moments stretched into seconds and seconds into minutes as I allowed his hand to stay. It was neither ignored nor forgotten as each minute slowly passed and the warmth of his hand heated my leg beneath it. I felt like a preteen on my first date with a guy I was crushing on. Back when each brush of his skin against yours would send your pulse racing and make your palms sweaty. Each time he removed it to shift gears on the jeep he would return to the original position on my knee, distracting me all over again.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked, breaking into my knee trance.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked confused, pulling my mind back to reality. \u201cOh, we\u2019re back,\u201d I said as I spotted my dorm.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, cutting the engine.</p><p>\u201cJust tired, I guess,\u201d I answered lamely.</p><p>He looked disappointed at my words, but nodded like he understood and climbed from the vehicle. I mentally kicked myself for my uncouth response as he made his way around the vehicle and opened my door. His chivalry didn\u2019t go unnoticed, especially since the last guy I dated not only didn\u2019t open doors for me, but actually let a door slam in my face as he walked through ahead of me. Melissa didn\u2019t even try to reason with me on that one. \u201cOnly a dickhead would allow a door to slam in the face of his date.\u201d Her words, not mine.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to walk me all the way up,\u201d I told him, trying to regain some of my common sense as I climbed down from the vehicle.</p><p>He looked at me incredulously. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019d just drop you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as foreign a thought as you would think. I figured it was the whole I\u2019m-a-college-guy-and-chicks-are-lucky-to-be-with-me mentality.\u201d</p><p>He mumbled something about missing out, but I couldn\u2019t quite catch it. I thought I caught kiss and dumb-ass losers, but I couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>\u201cI had a lot of fun today,\u201d I surprised myself by admitting as we reached the front door of my building.</p><p>\u201cWas there ever any doubt?\u201d he teased, lightly tugging at my hand until I was standing in the embrace of his arms.</p><p>I snorted out an unattractive laugh. \u201cHave you missed my track record? There\u2019s always doubt when it comes to dates and me,\u201d I joked, trying to appear casual even though his face was suddenly inches from mine. I could make out each line and curve that made his lips look so delectable. I wanted to kiss him and yet I was scared. Kissing was hit-or-miss for me and everything seemed to hinge on it. Today had been pretty close to perfect, but what if he turned out to be one of those kinds of kissers. The ones who tried to eat your entire face and felt it was their job to slather you in saliva\u2014or he could be one of those kissers who used his tongue like a weapon, and not in a good way. In my mind, kissing was an art form, not an assault. Lips should be soft and gentle at first, while the tongue cautiously introduces itself. Only after they\u2019ve met and hit it off should they become more commanding and take charge.</p><p>\u201cHey, where did you go?\u201d Justin asked, breaking into my lip-trance.</p><p>\u201cUh, what?\u201d I asked, dragging my mind away from his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou totally seemed to fog out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I was thinking about an assignment I should probably work on tonight,\u201d I lied, meeting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked. He called my bluff as his own eyes wandered down to my lips.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said with bated breath as he moved closer.</p><p>\u201cBecause it sure looked like you were focused on something else,\u201d he teased, leaning in so his mouth was a hair away from mine. \u201cYou sure you weren\u2019t thinking of something else?\u201d he asked as his warm breath fanned across my face.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I asked, unwilling to give him the satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cLike maybe this,\u201d he said, placing his lips firmly on mine.</p><p>The instant our lips touched, any doubts about what kind of kisser he would be flew from my mind like a kite caught in a sudden gust of wind. His lips were every bit as lush and soft as they looked. I responded to his touch like I had never been touched before. My lips felt desirable and special as he treated them like a rare delicacy. His hands found my hips and he pulled me in closer. My own hands crept up his chest until they were gripping his jacket in knotted fists. Without breaking the kiss, he slowly backed us into the shadows of the building. The small part of my brain that could form a rational thought was thankful for his foresight, only to be quickly shut off as he coaxed my lips open. His tongue slowly found mine as he seduced my mouth and my senses. Everything faded away as I lost myself in the slow burn of desire that was multiplying through every cell in my body.</p><p>After a moment, he pulled away as I tried to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cI knew kissing you would be hot,\u201d he said, resting his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t one-sided,\u201d I admitted, still gripping his jacket.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to kiss you since you gave me attitude the first time we met. I\u2019ve been dying to know what those bossy lips felt like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy?\u201d I said, shoving at his chest halfheartedly.</p><p>He captured my hands in his, pulling me close. \u201cI like that you were bossy. The girls who normally want to hang around me always turn into giggling bobbleheads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you have a way of reducing girls to blithering idiots,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a blithering idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my moments. It\u2019s those damn lips and pierced eyebrow. They wilt away our senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think my lips are sexy?\u201d he asked huskily, running said lips across my cheek. They left a trail of heat across my skin as they made their way to my ear.</p><p>\u201cDid I say \u2018sexy\u2019?\u201d I asked in a shaky voice as his hot breath breathed into my ear.</p><p>\u201cWell, you said \u2018damn lips,\u2019 which I happily translated into \u2018sexy lips.\u2019 Can I see you tomorrow?\u201d Justin asked, switching gears.</p><p>\u201cI have to study for a World History exam on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about after?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I hem-hawed, trying to decide if two dates in a row was a wise idea. I wasn\u2019t sure how fast I wanted things to go.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you know you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do, do I, Mr. Know It All?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want to see me tomorrow?\u201d he asked, placing his lips back on mine.</p><p>All thoughts of taking it slow and casual fled from my mind like they were being chased by demons. I\u2019d been right all along. He was definitely dangerous.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I get to pick the place,\u201d I caved.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d he said, finding my lips one more time. \u201cNow get your cute butt inside before you freeze it off,\u201d he said, taking in the shivers I\u2019d been unsuccessfully trying to suppress.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s bossy now?\u201d I griped, pulling open the door.</p><p>His chuckles followed me as I made my way into the building with a goofy smile on my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be careful with that one. He\u2019s nothing but a player.\u201d A voice startled me from behind.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. I turned around to face the one girl in our building who drove me absolutely batshit crazy. It had taken less than one day last year to see right through her act. Kara put on a good Southern charm show, but after one conversation, it was obvious she was as venomous as a poisonous snake. My instincts had proven to be true. Somehow, she managed to be the root cause of any drama that happened in our dorm. She had an uncanny knack of making people think they were special just as she placed her well-sharpened knife in their backs. Her lies and half-truths had backfired in her face, and by the end of last year everyone was wise to her routine. I\u2019d hoped I wouldn\u2019t get stuck being in the same dorm with her again, or that maybe she\u2019d live off campus somewhere, but I wasn\u2019t that lucky. For the most part, I\u2019d been able to escape her web of drama. Melissa wasn\u2019t as lucky, which would have been enough for me to hate Kara if I hadn\u2019t already come to that conclusion on my own. I had a strict rule: Don\u2019t fuck with my friends. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. You hurt someone I loved and that was it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJustin. He\u2019s a player. He uses and moves on. Just thought you should know,\u201d she said, fluffing her hair.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the news flash. Don\u2019t you have a \u2018woe is me\u2019 Facebook status update to make or a picture to upload on Instagram?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a bitch. I never would have pegged you as the type to go out with a playboy. I was just trying to help. Trust me. I know from personal experience what a bastard he can be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well go \u2018help\u2019 someone else. Any so-called advice you have to offer is neither needed nor asked for. Got me?\u201d I said, making my point clear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see if you\u2019re still saying that when he leaves you high and dry for the next set of tits that catches his eye,\u201d she snipped, all honey gone from her voice.</p><p>\u201cDuly noted,\u201d I muttered, taking the steps two at a time to the second floor. My kiss-induced elation had dissipated by the time I made my way to my room.</p><p>\u201cCrap, it was that bad?\u201d Melissa asked, looking up from her nails she was painting.</p><p>Without answering, I threw myself back on my bed, mulling Kara\u2019s venomous words through my head. It wasn\u2019t like she had delivered earth-shattering news. I knew he had a colorful dating track record, but playing sloppy seconds to that bitch Kara made me want to dry-heave. Anyone else I could overlook, but a hookup with that twat was a different story.</p> <p>\u201cBrittni, tell me. Was he a complete dud?\u201d Melissa asked, throwing the stuffed turtle she kept on her bed at me.</p><p>\u201cNo. He was effing great, but I can\u2019t see him anymore,\u201d I said, feeling sick as I uttered the words aloud.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? If he was so fantastic, why can\u2019t you see him anymore?\u201d Melissa demanded, throwing a pillow at me this time when I didn\u2019t answer her right away.</p><p>\u201cBecause, he went out with Twat-Waffle Kara,\u201d I moaned against her pillow that I had pulled over my face. I couldn\u2019t decide if I wanted to scream or smother myself.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. Please tell me you\u2019re joking?\u201d Melissa asked, making gagging noises.</p><p>\u201cI wish. I ran into her downstairs, where she tried to warn me about him. As if she\u2019d ever try to help anyone. I think she was just looking for a way to tell me they had hooked up,\u201d I wailed. What a disappointing end to an otherwise perfect date. I wouldn\u2019t even allow myself to think about the kiss. The idea that his lips had kissed hers made me seriously consider taking a stiff bristle brush to my own lips.</p> <p>\u201cMonkey asses. I was hoping he was the guy for you,\u201d Melissa huffed, returning to her nails.</p><p>\u201cYou and me both,\u201d I grunted, heaving myself off the bed so I could drown myself in the shower. This would be why I set such high guidelines when it came to dating.</p><p>By the next morning I was able to successfully put Justin in the same category with all the other guys who didn\u2019t matter. I blocked out the insistent voice that kept trying to convince me otherwise. I took the wimp\u2019s way out and sent him a text, telling him I would need the whole day and evening to study for my made-up exam. He never returned my text, which showed he had the attention span of a gnat. I patted myself on the back, convincing myself I had dodged a bullet.</p><p>The day turned out to be long and tedious anyway as I really did try to get schoolwork done. It proved to be difficult as my brain highlighted moments from the day before. The way he had warmed my face when we had arrived at the aquarium or the way his younger sister\u2019s eyes had shined when he told her he was taking her to see her favorite play. By two o\u2019clock, I gave up studying. It seemed futile at the moment. I tossed my schoolbooks on my desk and lay back on my bed with the book I\u2019d bought a few days prior. Even recreational reading proved to hold little appeal as my mind continued to focus on Justin. Finally giving up, I tossed the book aside and picked up my iPhone. The relief I felt after I had sent him my lame text earlier turned to irritation as I pondered why I hadn\u2019t heard from him. Bypassing the text messages, I went to my standby Spider Solitaire game that always did the trick when I needed something to occupy my mind.</p><p>Several hours later, I\u2019m embarrassed to say, I was still lying on my bed playing the mindless game when Melissa returned to our room.</p><p>\u201cHey, you want to get some dinner?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad, okay?\u201d she said, stepping into the room, but leaving the door open behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be ma . . . Oh God, please tell me you didn\u2019t,\u201d I mumbled as Rob and Justin strolled into our room. Our room that was the size of a closet to begin with. With two extra people we were packed like sardines.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Rob and I will be back in a minute,\u201d Melissa said, dragging a confused Rob from our room as she ignored the daggers she knew I was glaring at her.</p><p>I swung my legs around and sat up on my bed, trying not to dwell on the fact that Justin wasn\u2019t exactly catching me at my best. My hair probably looked like a bird\u2019s nest and I was wearing an oversized UW T-shirt with no bra and my favorite Victoria\u2019s Secret sweats.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I demanded, taking out my discomfort from the situation on him.</p><p>\u201cWe have a date,\u201d he replied. He plopped down on Melissa\u2019s bed, looking unfazed by my tone.</p><p>\u201cWe had a date. I sent you a text,\u201d I stated, holding up my phone for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, and if I remember correctly, you broke it off so you could study,\u201d he said pointedly, looking at the game that was still open on my phone.</p><p>\u201cI was giving my fried brain a break,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal, Brittni? I like you. A lot. I\u2019ve made that clear, but I can\u2019t keep chasing you if you don\u2019t want to be caught,\u201d he huffed, running his hand across the light layer of scruff that covered the bottom half of his face. \u201cI mean, what do you want from me? Are you really not interested?\u201d</p><p>I sighed heavily. How could I articulate my feelings without sounding like a jealous half-wit? \u201cIt\u2019s not you . . .\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Tell me you\u2019re not trying to feed me the \u2018it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2019 crap. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to stomach that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. It is you. Well, not you exactly. It\u2019s who you\u2019ve banged,\u201d I snapped, jumping to my feet so I could pace the room.</p><p>\u201cWho I\u2019ve banged? Are we at that point in this relationship where we\u2019re handing over our lists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cYou want to think it\u2019s ridiculous, that\u2019s your problem, but did you really have to sleep with Kara the Twat-Face?\u201d I sank back down on my bed and dropped my face to my hands.</p><p>\u201cKara the Twat-Face?\u201d he questioned, prying my fingers from my face.</p><p>\u201cFine, that\u2019s not her real name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief, but I\u2019m still drawing a blank here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t change the fact that you dated the one girl I can\u2019t stand, Kara Bellmont,\u201d I said, wanting to puke.</p><p>\u201cKara Bellmont? In that bitch\u2019s dreams,\u201d he shuddered.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t date her?\u201d I asked. What a relief if he was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cHell no. She was in my Bio Chem class last year. She tried, believe me. Always talking about how she \u2018can\u2019t keep any of the formulas straight,\u2019 and \u2018could we get together to study.\u2019 Study, my ass,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you never fell for her sweet-Southern-girl bullshit?\u201d I asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cLook. I\u2019ve dated lots of girls. You know this, but that chick is bad news. Too much damn fake drama for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break. The Barbie twins you were with the first day I met you were about as fake as they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I never said I was perfect. Besides, who really caught my attention that day? Oh yeah, that\u2019s right, it was you. I told you, I\u2019m not a player, Brittni. You\u2019re going to have to believe me or this thing between us is never going to work,\u201d he said, putting the ball in my court. \u201cAnd you have to stop jumping to conclusions about me.\u201d</p><p>He was right, of course. From day one I\u2019d been too harsh where it concerned him. \u201cI\u2019m just scared,\u201d I finally admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be scared?\u201d he asked, reaching for my hands.</p><p>\u201cBecause I suck at this whole relationship thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. We can learn how to be good at it together,\u201d he said, pulling me to my feet. \u201cI think we should practice with kissing,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cKissing sounds like a good place to start,\u201d I whispered as his lips claimed mine.</p><p>9.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>12:55 PM</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d I grumbled, checking my iPhone for the millionth time.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too. I wonder if that asshole Rob even knows we\u2019re stuck in here. He\u2019s probably eating lunch as we speak,\u201d Justin complained, glancing at his phone. \u201cStill no damn signal. I freaking hate elevators!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you sound like me,\u201d I said, digging through my purse in a vain effort to find something edible. I struck gold when my hand closed around the cereal bar I had gotten at the airport earlier. Digging farther, I found the small bag of nuts they gave me on the plane. \u201cYou wanna eat my nuts?\u201d I asked in an attempt to lighten the mood. He sat for a moment without looking up. \u201cCome on. You know you want to eat my nuts,\u201d I said, pulling the small bag from my purse and holding it out. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Grab my nuts,\u201d I teased, causing the corners of his mouth to rise into a smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I smiled, remembering how much he loved peanuts.</p><p>\u201cHow did Rob talk you into coming to his office if you hate elevators so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me he wanted to talk about an engagement surprise he had planned for Melissa. He swore me to secrecy. As far as Melissa is concerned, my plane isn\u2019t supposed to land for several more hours,\u201d I sighed. I still wasn\u2019t pleased that a trusted friend had lied and tricked me.</p><p>\u201cI bet she\u2019s excited you\u2019ll be here for the party,\u201d he said in a voice absent from the earlier hostility.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was happy when I finally caved,\u201d I answered. I instantly regretted my words, knowing I had given too much away.</p><p>\u201cCaved? You mean you didn\u2019t want to come to your best friend\u2019s engagement party?\u201d he asked, raising the eyebrow that had once been pierced.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you take out your eyebrow ring?\u201d I asked, avoiding his question.</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago. I decided it was time for a change,\u201d he answered as the hostility returned to his voice. That was definitely another dagger meant for me.</p><p>I kept my head down rather than take the bait. Of course his words hurt, but I\u2019d be damned if I was going to let him see that.</p><p>\u201cWell? You said \u2018caved.\u2019 Does that mean I was almost spared the pleasure of seeing you again?\u201d he asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember; were you always such a dick?\u201d I asked, matching his tone.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I didn\u2019t become a dick until you lied to me and took something from me without even giving it a second thought. You and your goddamn secrets!\u201d he snapped in a raised voice.</p><p>\u201cThey were my secrets\u2014MINE,\u201d I yelled. I was sick of fighting a battle with him I would never win.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horseshit. I deserved to know. God, the fact you don\u2019t get that makes me sick. I wish I had never talked to you that day,\u201d he snarled, turning away in disgust.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d I lied as my weakly mended heart broke into pieces.</p><p>10.</p><p>November 2010</p><p>\u201cSo, this is your rodeo. Where to?\u201d Justin asked as we climbed into his jeep.</p><p>\u201cWell, since this is a second date and I\u2019m not entirely sure how those are supposed to go, I thought we\u2019d hit one of my favorite places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuget Sound?\u201d he asked, merging into traffic.</p><p>\u201cYou definitely win brownie points for paying attention,\u201d I commented. \u201cNo wonder all the girls like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can thank my mom for that. I think she was afraid I\u2019d turn out like my dad, so she preached the whole respecting-women thing. She has nothing to fear, though. Travis and I would never turn out like him. Travis is too soft-spoken to ever raise his voice to anyone, let alone a girl. And, me\u2014I don\u2019t know, I think maybe growing up and seeing the way my dad treated my mom, I always felt in my gut it was wrong. That girls shouldn\u2019t be treated that way. Does that sound weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the girl was a total bitch?\u201d I inquired, messing with him.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rise to the bait. I\u2019m a lover, not a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she keyed your jeep and slept with your best friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a thing for Rob?\u201d he asked, raising his eyebrow suggestively.</p><p>\u201cAre you avoiding the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth? I\u2019d probably pound my friend for sleeping with my woman, but if she\u2019s going to cheat, she\u2019s not the girl for me. As for keying this beauty, it would probably add character,\u201d he said, patting the dashboard of his jeep. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go out with guys long enough to cheat, so you should be safe.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at my words as he searched for a parking spot. \u201cFood first, or would you rather walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we walk for a while? Once the sun goes down it might be too chilly outside for a stroll.\u201d</p><p>Nodding his approval, Justin laced his fingers through mine as we made our way to a path that ran along the water. He kept up a steady stream of questions as we walked. At first I felt weird divulging so much about myself, but he steadily chipped away at my defenses. He asked me all kinds of questions about Woodfalls, intrigued by the dynamics of such a small town. I thought he was going to pass out when he heard the closest art museum and Starbucks were forty-five minutes away. For whatever reason, I found it difficult to open up about my mom. I did confess how much it bothered me that she was considered the town busybody and was often ridiculed for it.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re both natural people-watchers, but she takes it a step further. I\u2019ve tried to explain it to her, but she laughs it off and reassures me that everyone likes that about her. I don\u2019t have the heart to tell her how I really feel. It\u2019s now a game in Woodfalls to see how long everyone can keep Pam from finding out something,\u201d I sighed. \u201cDespite what I think her flaws are, I know she loves me and I love her. At the end of the day, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt must be rough,\u201d he said sympathetically. He draped his arm around me as a sudden gust of wind blew off the water.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d I answered. I felt guilty painting such a bleak picture of my life in Woodfalls, but no one seemed to realize how hurtful all the remarks about my mom were to me. I learned early on to use dry humor and sarcasm as a shield. \u201cWhat about you? Do you ever wish things were different with your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, all the time when I was younger. Especially when I hung out at Rob\u2019s house, or with some of my other friends. I used to get jealous when I\u2019d see them interacting with their dads, who treated them like they actually mattered. My dad was like a drill sergeant. Follow orders or suffer his wrath. It was usually only verbal, at least. Me and my brother and sister all learned at a young age to avoid those moments as much as possible. He used to proudly brag that we were all so well behaved because he ran a tight ship. Truthfully, it was because he scared the shit out of us. Eventually, as I got older, he didn\u2019t look nearly as intimidating as he did when I was five and six.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did your mom even fall for him? She seems so different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were high school sweethearts. He proposed to her before he joined the Army, and they got married after he came home from basic training. Mom said she got pregnant right away, but my dad didn\u2019t have the best experience in the service. He hated it, becoming bitter and angry. I don\u2019t know if leaving him back then was ever a consideration. I think maybe she always hoped he would somehow change back into the man she originally fell for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s grateful she has you,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cThat was a pretty solid thing you did, moving back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, I told you I was a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMan, you\u2019re tough, but I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll win you over. Are you ready to eat yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. There\u2019s a great little pizza place not far from here,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat\u2019s if you like pizza,\u201d I joked, although I had yet to meet a guy who didn\u2019t like pizza.</p><p>\u201cThis is your day. You call the shots,\u201d he declared. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>The topics of conversation during dinner were far more lighthearted. We chatted about my job at the daycare and his ideas for the job at the hospital. Feeling more comfortable with him than I had the day before, I broached the subject of whether he should charge the hospital for his work. I pointed out they were lucky to have someone with his artistic abilities and he at least deserved some kind of compensation. After he changed the subject to a story about his brother and sister, it became obvious the hospital job was still a subject he wasn\u2019t comfortable discussing, so I let it go. Instead, he regaled me with stories about Travis and Hollie when they were younger, and I told him horror stories about working with small children at the daycare.</p><p>As the evening progressed, I was finally able to identify what made Justin stand out from every other guy I had ever dated. He had a mature way about him and seemed to have a firm grasp on what he wanted out of life. You would never expect it from looking at him, which had been my initial mistake, but he had shown his maturity by confronting his father and stepping in to help take care of his family. Since I arrived at college, I seemed to date one of two types of guys: Either they were wishy-washy about their futures and wanted to party all the time, or they were so fanatical about their goals that they didn\u2019t care who they crushed along the way. Justin seemed to be the happy medium. He was laid back and funny, but at the same time he had a seriousness that matched my own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to beat around the bush here, Brittni. Like I told you before, I like you,\u201d Justin said as we were leaving the restaurant. \u201cAnd I would really like to take you out again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy \u2018like,\u2019 do you mean you want to go steady and I need to start drawing hearts with our initials in them?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cExactly, and I\u2019m going to get matching T-shirts that say \u2018I\u2019m with her\u2019 and one that says \u2018He\u2019s with me\u2019 for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that\u2019s pushing it?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, it is,\u201d he laughed. \u201cSo, are you ready to give this whole dating thing a try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to say we\u2019re going steady?\u201d I asked, scrunching my nose.</p><p>\u201cHow about we stick with \u2018we\u2019re dating\u2019 instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDating. I guess I can do that. Melissa will be so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob too,\u201d he said, parking the jeep in an empty lot several blocks from the campus.</p> <p>I looked at him questioningly as he yanked the emergency brake.</p><p>\u201cI figured we should seal it with a kiss, and since I don\u2019t relish the idea of kissing you in front of your dorm again with everyone looking, I thought a little privacy was in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, can I trust you to be a gentleman?\u201d I asked as he cupped my face with his gloved hands.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he replied before his lips captured mine.</p><p>I sighed with satisfaction as his lips slowly moved against mine. His tongue was gentle and naughty at the same time as it coaxed my mouth to open for more. His hands drifted from my face and down my neck as they slowly began to explore my body. The gentleness of his touch ignited a fire inside me and I strained to get closer to him, loathing the gearshift that was proving to be a hindrance. After a few minutes of trying to work around it, we were forced to give up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m now wondering if this is why my mom was so into the idea of me getting this jeep, because she knew this would be a pain in the ass,\u201d Justin complained, thumping the long stick with the side of his fist.</p><p>\u201cI sense a conspiracy,\u201d I said, sliding back into my own seat while I got my breathing under control.</p><p>11.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>1:37 PM</p><p>Justin had remained stoically silent since his last outburst. I acted like I didn\u2019t care and felt my indifference was well played by the way he would glare at me every few minutes. While he sat contemplating my demise, I played the \u201cif only\u201d game in my head.</p><p>If only I hadn\u2019t stopped to stare at the building when I first arrived, I might have wound up on a different elevator. If only I\u2019d stayed in the bathroom a few seconds longer, I could have missed the ride in Elevator Hell all together. If only I had stayed out of Seattle, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here playing the damn \u201cif only\u201d game.</p><p>Eventually I realized the game only made matters worse. It wasn\u2019t like I had a time machine and could go back and fix any of this mess. Justin was still avoiding my eyes, so I took my time studying him. Two years ago, he was already pretty much a man, but I noticed subtle changes that showed he had completely outgrown boyhood. His shoulders seemed wider and his face looked leaner and more defined. Everything else about him was the same. Like the way he ran his hand over his scruff-covered face when he was frustrated or trying to make a point. I was sad the eyebrow ring was gone, but truthfully, its absence only enhanced his looks. With it gone, you were able to appreciate the golden specks in his brown eyes without interruption. My eyes moved from his face, down his arms, and to his hands. His hands were my favorite thing about him. They were large with rough calluses like a man\u2019s hands should be but gentle enough to create beautiful works of art. The idea that he was so creative always enchanted me.</p><p>I forced myself to pull my eyes away from him. It was almost painful to remember how those hands had felt on me.</p><p>12.</p><p>November 2010</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Of course you\u2019ll join us for dinner,\u201d Trish, Justin\u2019s mom, chastised as she hustled around the kitchen, putting the finishing touches on the pasta feast she\u2019d been preparing all day.</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving is a family holiday, Mrs. Avery. It would be tacky if I showed up,\u201d I countered, ignoring the smirk Justin was throwing my way.</p><p>\u201cTrish,\u201d she reminded me.</p><p>\u201cFine. Trish, it\u2019s not necessary for you to feel obligated to invite me to a holiday dinner because a certain manipulator strong-armed you into it,\u201d I said, glaring at Justin.</p><p>\u201cAs if that lightweight could strong-arm anyone,\u201d Hollie, Justin\u2019s precocious ten-year-old sister piped in from her perch at the counter, where she was shredding lettuce for our salad.</p><p>\u201cWho you calling lightweight, short stuff?\u201d Justin demanded, pointing the knife he was using to dice tomatoes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t point that thing at your sister,\u201d Trish admonished, handing me a cucumber to slice. \u201cAnd, sweetie, Hollie is right. Justin didn\u2019t tell me to invite you. We all want you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just seems fast,\u201d I replied. \u201cJustin and I have only been dating for a couple of weeks,\u201d I reminded them. I refrained from mentioning that the last few weeks had been the best weeks of my life. Once I\u2019d let my guard down and agreed to let my misgivings about him go, I quickly realized Justin was different from any other guy I had ever dated. We traded the traditional dates of dinner and a movie for more walks around Puget Sound and afternoons strolling through the Seattle Art Museum. Justin was an attentive date and made sure that he never dominated the conversation. Girls still checked him out wherever we went, but I was able to ignore it. He never returned the attention and instead focused solely on me. It was a heady experience to be treated with such devotion. Any ideas I might have entertained at keeping it casual were long gone. He was becoming like a drug I couldn\u2019t get enough of.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks? That\u2019s like a year by Justin\u2019s standards,\u201d Hollie giggled, ducking as Justin reached over to mess up her hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think Brittni\u2019s track record is any more pristine. She goes through guys like most girls go through hair products.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, what a way to throw me under the bus,\u201d I griped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s every man and woman for themselves,\u201d he teased, dropping a kiss on my lips, despite the fact that his mom and sister were looking on. I flushed, still not used to such open affection in front of others.</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019ll come,\u201d Hollie begged, pushing the serving bowl of lettuce toward me so I could add my sliced cucumbers to the salad. \u201cPlease,\u201d she added with wide eyes.</p><p>I contemplated my options. I could stick to my plan of eating a frozen meal in my dorm room, or I could have a real meal. It seemed like a no-brainer. I just wasn\u2019t sure it was a smart no-brainer. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come,\u201d I caved as the three of them beamed at me.</p><p>\u201cWell played, kid,\u201d Justin said, reaching into his wallet and extracting a five-dollar bill. \u201cI think the puppy-dog eyes sealed the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured those would work. Did you like how they were even watering a little? I was pinching my hand for that effect. I should charge you extra,\u201d Hollie said, grinning at me as she shoved the five-dollar bill into the back pocket of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cYou bribed your sister to talk me into coming over?\u201d I sputtered out, glaring at the guilty duo that had just played me.</p><p>\u201cJust covering my bases,\u201d he answered, dragging me from the counter and leading me toward his small but functional apartment in the basement.</p><p>\u201cDinner will be ready in twenty,\u201d Trish called as Justin closed the basement door behind us.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s going to think we\u2019re coming down here to make out,\u201d I commented as I sat on the small leather sofa in the living room of the basement. I\u2019d been down in his apartment one other time, but Hollie had been excitedly chattering away at my side as she gave me the tour. Justin\u2019s bedroom was at the far end of the large space. The bathroom was beside it and could be accessed through the bedroom or the large living room. A full-size kitchen sat at the other end of the living room with an island that separated the two spaces. Justin had confessed to me that he had yet to use the kitchen. He felt guilty about it, but the kitchen had been his mom\u2019s idea. She had told him when he moved back home that he deserved his own space. My favorite part about his mock apartment was the door that led outside. It wasn\u2019t like I planned on sneaking in or out, but having a separate entrance offered up a small measure of privacy.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s going to think we\u2019re down here doing something, then why hide it?\u201d Justin said, pulling me to my feet. He wrapped his arms around me and lowered his mouth to my neck.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you uncomfortable that she knows what we\u2019re doing?\u201d I asked. It came out as more of a sigh as his lips found the sensitive skin behind my right earlobe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both adults and she respects that. I\u2019m just glad we\u2019re alone,\u201d he said, trailing his lips over my cheek until they settled fully on my own lips. I whimpered with pleasure as his tongue parted my lips. I had made the startling realization on our second date that I was a fan of kissing him. I mean, I absolutely loved kissing him. It had become my favorite pastime, making me feel like a crazed hormone-driven teenager.</p><p>Justin eased us toward the full-sized sofa, never taking his lips from mine. I felt the sofa against the back of my knees and smiled as he slowly lowered me to the cushions below. I pulled him down with me so that his body was flush against mine. With only twenty minutes until his sister came barreling down the stairs to get us for dinner, we were playing with fire. Over the last two weeks, we\u2019d had our share of heavy make-out sessions in his jeep, but that was as far as we\u2019d taken things. The couch, unlike the jeep, had no obstacles, allowing me to feel every inch of him against me. I enjoyed his weight on top of me and I couldn\u2019t help shifting beneath him as he deepened the kiss. He groaned against my lips as our bodies settled fully together. Feeling powerful from the effect I was having on him, I shifted again, grinding my hips against his. Fire spread through me as his body reacted to my movement.</p><p>The sound of Hollie calling our names only seconds before she clamored down the stairs had us springing apart like two guilty teenagers. Justin was busy hiding the sudden bulge in his jeans, while I pulled down my shirt that had somehow crept all the way up to my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d Hollie asked, bouncing onto the couch between us.</p><p>\u201cUh, watching TV?\u201d Justin answered, reaching for a throw pillow and setting it on his lap. I chuckled at the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cHow can you watch TV when it\u2019s not on?\u201d Hollie asked. \u201cI think you were watching Kissing 101,\u201d she added, smirking at us.</p><p>\u201cYou do, do you?\u201d Justin asked, ruffling her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re too smart for your own good. Now beat it, squirt. Tell Mom we\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but hurry. I want Brittni to sit by me at dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cHey, Mom, they said they\u2019ll be up as soon as they finish making out,\u201d she called prior to racing up the stairs before Justin could hit her with a pillow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHaving trouble there?\u201d I joked, looking at his obvious problem the pillow had been covering.</p><p>\u201cAre you offering to help?\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cIf only we had time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTease,\u201d he said, helping me rise from the couch.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who started this. I distinctly remember mentioning we only had twenty minutes. You know what they say about those who play with fire getting burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, and in Hollie\u2019s world, that\u2019s closer to five minutes. Someday we\u2019re not going to have a gearshift to stop us or my kid sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises,\u201d I said, stepping on my tiptoes so I could place my lips on the back of his neck as we headed for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s playing with fire now?\u201d he asked, turning so abruptly I almost fell down the few stairs we had started climbing. He reached out to steady me before dropping a hard kiss that was filled with promise and need on my lips.</p> <p>\u201cCan you two ple-e-e-ease stop kissing so we can eat dinner?\u201d Hollie demanded at the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI need to muzzle her,\u201d Justin mumbled against my lips, making me giggle.</p><p>We could here Trish chastising Hollie to leave us alone. She stomped away from the door, complaining that she didn\u2019t get the big deal about kissing and that she personally found it gross.</p><p>\u201cOne day you won\u2019t,\u201d Trish said as we entered the kitchen, handing Hollie a stack of plates to add to the table. \u201cHopefully that day is way down the road,\u201d she added under her breath, shooting Justin and me a wry look.</p><p>\u201cYears and years,\u201d Justin clarified, looking green at the thought of his little sister lip-locking with anyone.</p><p>\u201cBoy, I pity the first guy who asks Hollie out,\u201d I remarked, carrying drinks to the table.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t drop those,\u201d Justin mocked, making a production of helping me with the glasses.</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at his reminder of my previous clumsiness.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Hollie asked inquisitively.</p><p>Justin grimaced, making Trish and me laugh and only confusing Hollie more.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you pity the boys?\u201d she demanded this time, afraid that she was the butt of the joke.</p><p>\u201cBecause, honey. Your brother is just a wee bit protective over you. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll make the Spanish Inquisition look like a walk in the park,\u201d Trish laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Spanish Inquisition?\u201d Hollie asked. She was easily distracted.</p><p>\u201cIt was the way they handled certain religions back in the fifteenth century. I remember hearing about it in a history lecture years ago, but more notably, it was a Monty Python skit I saw years back, before you or your brothers were even thought of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Monty Py\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go see if Travis is ready for dinner,\u201d Trish interrupted, dropping a quick kiss on top of Hollie\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the play going?\u201d I asked at the mention of Travis as I sat in what had become my normal seat at their dinner table.</p><p>\u201cGood, if the new bounce in his step is any indication,\u201d Trish said, smiling broadly. I had learned on my first visit to their house two weeks ago that Travis had landed the role of Ebenezer Scrooge in his high school\u2019s production of A Christmas Carol.</p><p>\u201cYeah, except he\u2019s taking his role a little seriously,\u201d Justin complained. \u201cHe tried to con me into giving him extra dough so he\u2019d know what it would feel like to have some wealth. Those were his words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, can\u2019t blame a guy for trying,\u201d Travis said, entering the kitchen. \u201cBrittni,\u201d he smiled widely, happily pulling me up for a bear hug. Travis was a hugger. I was slowly adjusting to it. Slowly.</p><p>\u201cHey, Travis,\u201d I said, returning his smile. When Travis was around, you couldn\u2019t help responding to his enthusiasm and personality. \u201cHow goes the showbiz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s tough to be a star, but I\u2019m adjusting to all the fame and paparazzi,\u201d he joked, taking his own seat.</p><p>\u201cOh boy. You better get the contractors out here, Mom. Looks like we\u2019ll need to have the doors widened to fit Travis\u2019s head and ass if he doesn\u2019t stop eating all the bread,\u201d Justin growled, moving the bread from his brother\u2019s reach before he could add a third roll to his plate.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be blamed for being a growing boy,\u201d Travis answered, unfazed by the ribbing. Justin held the bread basket out to me so I could claim my own roll.</p><p>\u201cKey word there being \u2018boy,\u2019\u201d Justin joked. Travis retaliated by throwing a piece of the rolls in question at Justin, who deflected it, where it ended up landing in Hollie\u2019s glass.</p><p>\u201cEw, gross. Can you two please act your age?\u201d she huffed, stomping to the kitchen to get a new drink.</p><p>\u201cBoys, behave,\u201d Trish said, looking up from a stack of papers from school she was grading while we ate.</p><p>I still liked the fact that Trish was a teacher, which is what I wanted to be for as long as I could remember. My friend Tressa said it was because I was born bossy, which was probably true. I liked the idea of teaching others. I wasn\u2019t the most affectionate or easygoing person, but I really did like kids. Even if I did gripe about the ones I worked with at the daycare. It was just the way I was. I put on an air of gruffness, but working with kids was my passion.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d Justin and Travis answered in unison. They both exchanged silent death threats once her head was bent down again.</p><p>Hollie and I laughed at their antics, which made Trish\u2019s head shoot up again as she mockingly glared at both of them. \u201cI mean it, or I\u2019ll put you both on dish detail for a week without the dishwasher.\u201d</p><p>Her words had the desired effect, as both guys instantly grimaced at the idea of a week of hard labor.</p><p>\u201cHarsh, Mom,\u201d Hollie quipped, taking a large bite of her salad.</p><p>\u201cSometimes the dish card is necessary,\u201d Trish laughed, pulling her reading glasses off and placing them on top of the stack of papers. \u201cNow, tell me about your day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolly threatened to cut my braid off if I wouldn\u2019t let her cheat off my paper today,\u201d Hollie piped in while helping herself to a serving of the big bowl of spaghetti at the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel\u2014\u201d Justin started to say as Trish sent him a warning look for his language. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cYou can say \u2018hell.\u2019 Ms. Johnson says it all the time,\u201d Hollie said nonchalantly as she took a hearty bite.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said this charter school would be a good experience for her,\u201d Justin said, shooting his mom a look.</p><p>\u201cIt is a good school. Hollie, what did you do when Molly threatened you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Mr. Davis was right behind her and heard the whole thing. You should have seen her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet. What did Mr. Davis do?\u201d Trish asked, holding up a hand so Justin wouldn\u2019t interrupt again.</p><p>I smiled and patted his leg as he clamped his lips closed.</p><p>\u201cHe sent her to Principal Rhodes. She didn\u2019t return to class, so I\u2019m pretty sure she got suspended, which is too bad since we took the test and she wasn\u2019t there for it.\u201d She grinned mischievously.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good. Now what is this about Ms. Johnson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a couple of kids in my class have been cussing lately. Not me,\u201d she added quickly when everyone pivoted to look at her. \u201cAnyway, Ms. Johnson told us that chances are we were all going to be exposed to swearing and most likely do it ourselves. She made us think of all the swear words we could and she wrote them on the board. The only curse word she wouldn\u2019t write was the F-word because she said that\u2019s just vulgar,\u201d Hollie continued around a bite of her roll. \u201cShe said as long as we use them in context, she was fine with us using them, but if we use them out of context, we have to write a five-hundred-word essay on the origins of swear words. None of the boys want to write the essay, so the cussing has stopped. I guess they were using them wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Trish answered dryly. \u201cSounds like Ms. Johnson knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she sure tricked them,\u201d Hollie said, obviously not fooled by her teacher\u2019s ploy. \u201cAnyways, Justin can say \u2018hell\u2019 because it seemed like he was using it in context, since that was my response when Molly threatened to cut my braid off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your permission, squirt,\u201d Justin replied as the rest of us laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your day?\u201d Trish asked, turning her attention to Travis.</p><p>\u201cIt was good, except I don\u2019t know why girls come to me about clothing or costume questions now that they know I\u2019m gay. It\u2019s not some kind of prerequisite that all gay guys are into fashion and clothes,\u201d he griped.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to stereotypes,\u201d Justin said. \u201cRemember when I was in high school and everyone assumed my friend Mitch would be an excellent basketball player because he was like a six-foot-three giant? He couldn\u2019t run and dribble at the same time if his life depended on it. Hey, even Brittni has been known to put people in stereotypical bubbles,\u201d he added, smirking at me.</p><p>\u201cGuilty,\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Travis asked, looking at me with interest.</p><p>\u201cI assumed that a guy who is tattooed up and was flirting outrageously with two girls at once must be a player,\u201d I answered dryly.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, bro? Two chicks at once? That\u2019s so not cool,\u201d Travis said, polishing off his spaghetti.</p><p>\u201cShame on you, son,\u201d Trish said, clucking her tongue.</p><p>\u201cNot cool at all,\u201d Hollie added, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cHey, put down your pitchforks. What makes you think she\u2019s talking about me?\u201d Justin asked, trying to look innocent as he held up his palms.</p><p>\u201cUm, gee, I don\u2019t know who she could be talking about\u2014duh. Besides, she\u2019s got you on the one thing. You are a terrible flirt,\u201d Travis mocked.</p><p>\u201cSee, like I said,\u201d I crowed triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I have my own family on my side. Thanks for the love,\u201d Justin said, standing up from the table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave mad, just leave,\u201d Travis joked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious,\u201d Justin said, holding out a hand for me.</p><p>\u201cThank you for dinner, Mrs. Avery, I mean, Trish,\u201d I said, standing also.</p><p>\u201cAnytime, Brittni. It\u2019s nice to see Justin with someone who has her own mind,\u201d she answered warmly. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll be seeing you Thursday for Thanksgiving, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked. I wasn\u2019t overly excited about crashing their family holiday.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take no for an answer. Justin will pick you up by noon,\u201d she said, leaving no room for argument.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said, surrendering.</p><p>13.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>1:48 PM</p><p>It was official. They were deliberately toying with us. More than two hours had passed and we were still stuck. Since his last outburst forty-five minutes ago, the only words Justin had spoken were through the elevator phone.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer are we going to have to cool our heels in here while you dick around with this elevator?\u201d</p><p>I could hear the woman\u2019s unruffled voice, assuring him that it was being worked on as quickly as possible. She\u2019d inquired about our health and well-being, and once Justin informed her we were still alive, we got the same advice we\u2019d received for the past two hours\u2014to sit tight.</p><p>Justin slammed down the phone and resumed his stony silence. My iPhone was clinging to life with less than ten percent battery left. I couldn\u2019t decide if my phone dying would be a blessing or a curse. I was driving myself nuts checking the slow-moving time so often. Then again, with nothing but Mr. Stone Wall over there, I might go stir-crazy.</p><p>Unable to handle sitting there doing nothing, I emptied the contents of my oversized bag onto the floor. It had been ages since my purse had a good purge. A bottle of water rolled across the floor, stopping near Justin\u2019s foot. Ignoring his stare, I grabbed the bottle and set it on end so it wouldn\u2019t roll away again. I methodically sorted through months of old movie ticket stubs, receipts, and loose change that for some reason never made it to the small change purse that I also found among the other items. I hit the jackpot when I discovered a mini package of peanut M&amp;Ms one of my students had given me before I left and a handful of peppermints I had snagged from my boss\u2019s office last week. At the bottom of my bag, I also found a couple of ideas that I had jotted down on a Post-it for my friend Ashton. She was relatively new to Woodfalls, but Tressa and I had hit it off with her right away. Her only quirk was the crazy bucket list of things she wanted to do. It seemed odd, but she said it was research for a thesis paper. Tressa and I suspected there was more to it than that. Of course, Tressa\u2019s idea that maybe Ashton was some kind of closet adrenaline junkie was different from my theory. My suspicion was that the list was because of something much more serious. I hoped to God I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhy do girls carry so much shit in their bags?\u201d Justin asked, taking in the piles of stuff I had sorted in front of me.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi. Are you talking to me again?\u201d I asked sarcastically. I was sick of him treating me like a yo-yo. One minute he was cordial enough to hold a conversation with, and the next he was a raving lunatic.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying here, okay?\u201d he said, running his hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, so am I. So if you could hold off using me like a verbal punching bag until I can escape from this hellhole, I\u2019d appreciate it. You\u2019re not the only one who was hurt.\u201d It bothered me that he seemed to forget everything that had transpired.</p><p>His teeth came together with a snap, but he didn\u2019t comment. While he mulled over my words, I continued cleaning out my bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in those little bottles?\u201d he finally asked, eyeing the seven mini bottles of hand sanitizer I had unearthed.</p><p>\u201cHand sanitizer,\u201d I admitted, seeing the proof of my OCD.</p><p>\u201cAnd you need seven bottles, why?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cBeats the heck out of me. I guess I\u2019m always afraid of not having one when I need it, so I buy a new one every time I go to the mall. I guess I have enough.\u201d I smiled, even though it felt slightly forced. I didn\u2019t offer up the fact that I also had a basket of them sitting on the dresser in my room.</p><p>\u201cMint?\u201d I asked, tossing him one of the cellophane-wrapped candies.</p><p>\u201cOld mints from the depths of your purse. What are you, my grandma? Thanks,\u201d he said, pulling off the wrapper and popping the mint into his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, they have like a hundred-year shelf life. How\u2019s the art?\u201d I finally asked, since we seemed to be on a tentative truce.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. I do a lot of freelance stuff. That job at the hospital that you convinced me I should charge for snowballed into more jobs than I could handle. I guess I owe you a thanks,\u201d he said, looking dismayed at the idea of giving me credit for anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it worked out. You\u2019re an amazing artist and should be treated as such.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you? Did you get your degree in elementary education?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019m working part-time at the school in Woodfalls, mostly subbing until a full-time opening becomes available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill scaring the kids?\u201d he asked, making me chuckle that he remembered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s intentional. My boss teases me about the tight ship I run, but I like things orderly. At least elementary-aged kids don\u2019t scare as easily as the kids at the daycare,\u201d I mused, thinking back to the days when he and I had dated. I was working part-time at the daycare on campus and it had become a long-standing joke with my co-workers how the babies all seemed scared of me. It wasn\u2019t like I ever yelled or anything, but I guess a serious tone of voice was just as frightening. Anytime the other teachers lost control of their classes, I was the one they called. Justin and my friends had found the whole thing hilarious and nicknamed me \u201cDrill Sergeant.\u201d The only kid who ever seemed immune to my voice was Justin\u2019s sister, Hollie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky. You seem like you\u2019ve been able to put it out of your mind and move on,\u201d he said in a voice that was hard to distinguish. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was being sarcastic or cordial.</p> <p>For a moment, I considered punching him. A quick punch to the jaw or maybe to the gut. It was awfully presumptuous of him to think I could erase it from my mind. In the beginning, it consumed my every thought. Eventually, time heals, I guess, because the pain tapered off to where I would only think of it a handful of times a day. Now, if I was lucky, I could go a whole day without thinking about it. He was an asshole to think I\u2019d ever be able to forget. Let alone move on.</p><p>14.</p><p>Thanksgiving 2010</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d I said, sinking down on my bed as Justin paced the narrow floor in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change your mind. It\u2019s all Hollie has been talking about. She\u2019s looking forward to seeing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be over there in the next few days. Just not today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not today?\u201d Justin implored, running his hand over his hair in frustration.</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause? What the hell kind of answer is because? Because why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . .\u201d I dragged out. \u201cSpending the holidays with your family seems too fast, too soon. It\u2019s something a couple does when they\u2019ve been dating for a couple of years, not weeks. For God\u2019s sake, we haven\u2019t even made it past third base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird base? Does anyone still use that term?\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cShut up, jerk. You know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s fix that right now,\u201d he answered, sweeping his eyes around my room. Melissa had left the night before to spend the four-day holiday with her folks. She wanted me to come with her, but I was too broke to buy a plane ticket, so I lied and told her I\u2019d be spending the holiday with Justin and his family.</p><p>\u201cGee, how can I resist such a romantic gesture? Besides, your family is expecting you,\u201d I said weakly as he approached me.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re expecting both of us,\u201d he murmured, stepping between my parted legs that were hanging off the side of the bed. His hands gently cupped my face, tipping my head back until our eyes met. Everything inside me came to life as he slowly lowered me back on my bed. He moaned with desire as his lips found my neck. I felt his hand making its way beneath my shirt, sending shudders rippling through my body.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he whispered against my lips.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d was my only answer as I shifted so he could lie fully on top of me. It had been a while since I had been with a guy whose every touch left me yearning for more.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this?\u201d he asked, moving his hand slightly lower so his fingers slipped just inside the band of my jeans.</p><p>I nodded, unable to speak as the sensations from his touch muddled my brain. I wanted his hands everywhere. His callused palm against the sensitive skin of my lower stomach made my body arch in a silent plea for more.</p><p>\u201cBrittni, you keep moving like that and I\u2019m going to skip third base and slide into home,\u201d he said, pulling his lips from mine. I could tell by his glassy-eyed stare that he wanted me as badly as I wanted him.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem, why?\u201d I asked, looping my legs around him so he was intimately pressed against me. My eyes fluttered closed as he crushed his lips to mine. The desire in me raged out of control. I pulled at his clothes, wanting the last barrier gone that separated fooling around from sheer ecstasy. He had his shirt halfway off when a familiar ringtone blared from the pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said, showing me the phone, which displayed \u201cHome\u201d on the Caller ID.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he answered in a strained voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you on your way back?\u201d I could clearly hear his mom thanks to our close proximity.</p><p>\u201cAlmost. Brittni needed to finish a few things,\u201d he answered, grinning devilishly. I pinched his arm and pushed at him, trying to get him to move off me. Even though she couldn\u2019t see us, it felt weird to be getting it on with her on the phone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, but I need you guys to pick up a can of cranberry sauce from the grocery store. You know how your grandpa insists that the canned version is the only good kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Mom. We\u2019re heading out now,\u201d Justin said, finally rising off me.</p><p>\u201cThanks, son. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d he answered, ending the call. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked, looking down at me where I was still sprawled out on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018I\u2019m not going\u2019 did you not understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to. Hollie made you a place card thingy and everything. You wouldn\u2019t want to crush my poor kid sister\u2019s heart, would you?\u201d he asked, reaching a hand down and hauling me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhy does she like me anyway? Most kids hate me,\u201d I said, sliding my feet into my favorite boots.</p><p>\u201cYou sure education is the right career choice for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, ironic, right?\u201d I answered. \u201cBelieve it or not, I enjoy it. I like the idea of teaching our next generation. Technically, kids are not scared of me. They just listen really well when I\u2019m around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could see that. You\u2019ve got that drill sergeant voice nailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your way of telling me I\u2019m bossy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily bossy. I\u2019d say assertive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, that\u2019s just a nice way of saying bossy as hell,\u201d I said, grabbing my bag as we left. I wasn\u2019t as sad as I thought I would be leaving my room behind. Even though I fought the dinner invitation, the idea of being alone on Thanksgiving was a real downer. Who cares if we were mixing up the steps in the relationship? It wasn\u2019t like there was some rule book that said you couldn\u2019t join your boyfriend for a major holiday after only a few weeks of dating.</p><p>\u201cOh, you still have the roof on?\u201d I asked, tamping my disappointment at the fully enclosed jeep.</p><p>\u201cDisappointed?\u201d he asked, opening my door.</p><p>\u201cSort of. It\u2019s cold as hell, but I liked the freedom of no doors or roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only until spring. You\u2019ll appreciate it more when it\u2019s not so frigid.\u201d</p><p>His words hit me like a bucket of water had been dumped on me. Spring was months away. Did he really think with our dating track records that we\u2019d still be together by then? Sure, we were getting along well at the moment, but up until now, my longest relationship was in the eighth grade when Garrett Blinn and I decided we were a couple after a rousing game of Spin the Bottle in Tressa\u2019s basement. We lasted four whole weeks. The first week was bliss as I added his name to every square inch of my notebooks. By week two, I was wishing I had saved a little space for other doodling. By the third week, his wet lips on mine no longer held the same appeal they had during Spin the Bottle, and by the fourth week into our relationship, I was busy plotting different ways to break it off with him. In the end, he wound up with a bloody nose and a busted lip when I punched him for trying to stick his hand down my pants during a make-out session. The tale of how he had acquired his busted lip spread like wildfire through our small school. Needless to say, my next relationship was two years later. After Garrett, I was pretty much a two- to three-week kind of dater. Experience taught me that most guys showed their true colors four weeks in. Considering Justin and I were just shy of three weeks into our relationship, he was probably banking on a fairy tale to think we would make it to spring.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d I answered, deciding now was not the time to get into the logistics of failed dating.</p><p>The grocery store was packed with harried shoppers who were frantically searching for the last few items they needed. Buggies with crying children and women arguing over the last bag of russet potatoes were just a few of the obstacles we had to maneuver around in our search for cranberry sauce. We were about ready to declare the trip a failure when a helpful bag boy found us a dented can behind one of the registers. Justin hurried and paid and we hustled out of the store.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Women get scary when it comes to shopping,\u201d Justin said, hopping into the jeep and slamming the door quickly, as if the insanity of the shoppers were an airborne virus.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not kidding. Life lesson here: Never visit a store on a holiday,\u201d I added, relieved we had made it out alive. \u201cThey were like vultures in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope Grandpa appreciates this,\u201d he said, tossing the bag with the single can inside into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cHe better do backflips when you show it to him,\u201d I added, fastening my seat belt.</p><p>\u201cThat would be funny as shit,\u201d Justin laughed.</p><p>\u201cTruth.\u201d The fact that he had the same dry sense of humor as me was definitely a perk.</p><p>My good mood dissipated when Justin pulled into his overcrowded driveway behind four cars I didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cHow many people did you guys invite?\u201d I asked, slinking down in my seat.</p><p>\u201cRelax, it\u2019s all family,\u201d he said, climbing out of the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cSwell. That helps so much,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHey, Uncle Fred,\u201d Justin warmly greeted a good-looking distinguished gentleman. He appeared to be roughly the age of my mom.</p><p>\u201cJustin, how\u2019s the art?\u201d his uncle replied, pulling Justin in for a massive bear hug.</p><p>\u201cNot bad. How\u2019s the insurance business?\u201d Justin countered.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d his uncle Fred returned, laughing. \u201cAnd who is this lovely lady?\u201d he added, turning to smile at me.</p><p>\u201cThis is my girlfriend, Brittni,\u201d Justin said proudly. He pulled me closely against him like I was a coveted possession. I fought the urge to elbow him for his possessiveness.</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend? That\u2019s terrific. We\u2019d all pretty much given up hope that my nephew here would find a nice young lady,\u201d Fred said, shaking my hand with both of his.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not nice,\u201d I answered.</p><p>He threw his head back and roared with laughter. \u201cYou are my kind of lady,\u201d he said, putting an arm around me and leading me toward the house. Maybe it was the warm way he smiled or the twinkle in his eyes, but my natural instincts to stiffen up from a stranger\u2019s touch never manifested. \u201cSo, how long have you been making my nephew a better man?\u201d he asked, guiding me up the porch steps to the front door.</p><p>\u201cOnly a few weeks,\u201d I answered, laughing uncomfortably. This was what I had been afraid of. By coming to dinner, I was giving the impression that we had a history.</p><p>\u201cA beneficial few weeks, if the grin on my nephew\u2019s face is any indication,\u201d he professed, opening the front door for me.</p><p>The noise inside the house was overwhelming as we stepped into the entryway. Everywhere I looked there were people. An elderly couple sat on the sofa while adults stood around the room chatting. Children of various ages darted through the living room, dining room, and kitchen like they were on a racetrack. Every few seconds one of the adults would tell them to stop running.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, this is Justin\u2019s girl, Brittni,\u201d Fred announced, nudging me into the middle of the chaos. I looked back at the door longingly, feeling like I had been thrown into a shark tank. Just when I thought Fred was a good guy. Suddenly everyone\u2019s conversations became less important as a dozen eyes pivoted to look at me. With a gentle push from Fred, I was introduced to another uncle, whose name escaped me; Fred\u2019s wife, Adriane; and his aunt Holly, who turned out to be Justin\u2019s sister\u2019s namesake, just with a different spelling. The three teenage boys playing the Xbox in the family room with Travis belonged to Fred and Adriane. The four younger kids running around with Hollie belonged to Justin\u2019s aunt Holly and the uncle whose name I couldn\u2019t remember. The adults all seemed nice enough, and the teenage boys were typical teenagers. They eyed me appraisingly before returning to their game. Hollie greeted me by giving my waist a crushing hug before racing back down the hall after her cousins.</p><p>After a few initial questions about my major and where I was from, the other adults quickly returned to their respective conversations. All the comments I had expected about how long we had known each other or how serious we were never surfaced. It wasn\u2019t like they shunned me. They just accepted that I was there without question.</p><p>Justin and I stood around chatting with his grandpa and mother, who both had questions about the job he was doing for the hospital. I was distracted from the conversation by Justin\u2019s uncle, the one whose name I couldn\u2019t remember. He looked like he was watching the football game on TV, but every time my eyes drifted his direction, he was staring at me instead. If his wife hadn\u2019t been sitting two feet from him, I would have said he was checking me out. It was completely creep-fest and grossed me out. His stares didn\u2019t get better during dinner, and I made an effort to try to ignore him as he downed several beers. If the others noticed his behavior, they ignored it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with your creeper uncle?\u201d I asked Justin when we headed down to his apartment with our desserts in hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUncle George?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He was looking at me all through dinner,\u201d I answered, seeing no reason to beat around the bush.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dick,\u201d Justin answered, placing our drinks on the coffee table. \u201cHe lost his job last year and pretty much decided that was his ticket to become a complete deadbeat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize that. Losing a job has to be tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was an ass before that. I think Aunt Holly was on the verge of divorcing him, but then felt bad once he lost his job. Maybe she thought that would be like kicking a man while he\u2019s down or some shit. He drives my mom nuts, and almost everyone else for that matter. I guess every family has to have one. The oddball who annoys everyone.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I knew where he was coming from. Of course, I refrained from mentioning that the oddball in my family was my mother. In her defense, though, she wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as his uncle George. And definitely not creepy. She just made everyone\u2019s business her own. My only other relatives were a distant aunt and uncle who lived in Arizona. They were a lot older than Mom. Mom had been a surprise baby when she came along. Her sister was planning for college and already had one foot out the door when my mom showed up. Over the years, I\u2019d seen them less than a handful of times, mostly due to a death in the family. Although I didn\u2019t see them much, they did make a point of sending me cash every holiday, including Thanksgiving, which always seemed odd, but who was I to argue with free cash.</p><p>\u201cIf he makes you uncomfortable, let me know,\u201d Justin added as he took a bite of the pumpkin pie on his plate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good. I just thought I was imagining it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah, everyone knows he\u2019s a total douche. He\u2019s a lot of fun when he has a couple more beers in him,\u201d he answered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cAt least he\u2019s up there and we\u2019re down here,\u201d I pointed out, not realizing until the words left my mouth how suggestive they sounded.</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Justin answered with a wide smile as he placed his plate on the table and leaned toward me. His intentions were halted by the sound of multiple feet trotting down the stairs with Hollie\u2019s voice calling us.</p><p>\u201cI need to learn to lock that door,\u201d Justin groaned before placing a quick kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cOne of these days . . .\u201d I trailed off, running my hand over his chest as four preteens invaded our quiet place.</p><p>As the day progressed, those few minutes of quiet were the only ones we had. Hollie and her cousins convinced Justin and me to play a game of Monopoly. The game turned out to be one of those marathon games that stretched on for several hours. Hollie took the game seriously and analyzed each move before she made it. Two of the cousins went bankrupt fairly early and made it their mission to create the perfect playlist for our game on Justin\u2019s stereo. We took a break after a few hours to head back upstairs for seconds. Turkey sandwiches, stuffing, and leftover mashed potatoes were loaded up on heavy-duty paper plates that Trish had left out on the counter. Eventually, Monopoly came to a draw when Hollie and Justin owned the majority of the cash and properties. The game was stowed away and blankets and pillows were dragged downstairs and laid out on the floor, while Justin loaded one of the DVDs he had picked up the day before. Shooting me an apologetic look, he maneuvered around the bodies on the floor and crawled onto the couch beside me.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked, scooting closer to him on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cThe movie party. It\u2019s kind of a ritual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re just afraid to be alone,\u201d I whispered, snuggling into his arms.</p><p>He chuckled lightly, tightening his arm around me. \u201cVery afraid,\u201d he breathed into my ear, making my pulse race. His hand trailed down my side, gently tugging my shirt up until my rib cage was exposed. Every nerve inside me seemed to come alive as his fingers brushed across my skin.</p><p>\u201cBe good,\u201d I hissed, trying to control the shudder that rippled through me from his heated touch. I tugged my shirt down and rested my head against his chest. His quiet laughter clued me in that he was well aware of what his touch was doing to me. Feeling all was fair in foreplay, I placed my hand on his knee and smiled with satisfaction when I heard his intake of air in the dark room. I slowly caressed his leg, letting my fingers creep up to his inner thigh before moving back down and then back up again. With each pass, my fingers would move just a little higher. The effect of my touch was evident by the rapid racing of his heart against my ear and the slight bulge that was difficult to hide even in his jeans. His response was enough to make even my own breath come out quick and fast, as if I were sprinting to finish a race. Eventually, Justin had enough of the sweet torture. He removed my hand from his leg and held it firmly in his own hand. I doubted it would douse the desire that crackled like a live wire between us. I closed my eyes, enjoying the feel of his arms around me and the noise of the movie playing in the background. I felt so relaxed I drifted off to sleep.</p><p>15.</p><p>Present Day</p> <p>2:13 PM</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about that Thanksgiving weekend we spent together,\u201d Justin said, changing the subject before I gave in to the impulse to punch him.</p><p>I acknowledged his words by meeting his eyes. I was still pissed at his previous statement, but a small part of my heart melted at his words.</p><p>\u201cThat was the day I started to really fall for you. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, but it shouldn\u2019t have surprised me. After all, Thanksgiving was pretty much the beginning for me too. Our relationship was not the kind of whirlwind love story you read about. It didn\u2019t start with insta-love or even insta-lust. It was a slow build that progressed with each new detail we discovered about each other. Maybe it was our past failures at dating, or maybe we had somehow sensed that our relationship would be different from all the rest. He used to say we worked because I was immune to his powers of flirtation and he was the looseness to my uptightness. He claimed we brought out the best in each other. He was right until he was wrong. Eventually, we would get to the point where we absolutely brought out the worst in each other.</p><p>\u201cIs your aunt Holly still with creeper George?\u201d I asked, pulling my mind from the one place I didn\u2019t want it to go. The place I couldn\u2019t allow it to go.</p><p>\u201cNope. She filed for divorce that following summer. Turns out he was a mean-ass drunk. Aunt Holly could overlook his faults until he turned his fists on her and the kids. He\u2019s on his fifth or sixth stint in rehab. I\u2019ve lost track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s probably wrong to say I\u2019m glad, but I really am. Your aunt deserves way better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. That feeling is unanimous, but I\u2019ll pass your sentiments along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why Thanksgiving? Was it because of that night?\u201d I asked as his eyes bore into mine.</p><p>\u201cThat was a part of it, but it was all the before too,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you fell for me because of my mad Monopoly skills?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cAmong other things,\u201d he answered, grinning wryly.</p><p>That grin. It had always been my downfall. If I pinpointed all my favorite memories that involved him, that grin could be found at each and every one. It held the power to melt my insides, make my pulse quicken, and make certain other areas ache with need. I loved that grin until I hated that grin.</p><p>16.</p><p>Thanksgiving 2010</p><p>I woke up disoriented. I knew I was in Justin\u2019s bed. I was just unsure how I had gotten there when the last thing I remembered was dozing off on the sofa. It was pitch black in his room, but I could feel I wasn\u2019t alone. Reaching out a hand, I tentatively touched Justin\u2019s arm, wondering if he was awake. The mattress shifted as he turned over. I could sense he was now facing me. He didn\u2019t speak as he reached over and gently caressed my cheek. I turned my face so I could place a kiss on the palm of his hand. Excitement raced through me at the thought that we were finally alone. He ran his hand around my head until it was cupping my neck. Holding my head in place, he leaned in close and placed his lips on mine. His lips were soft but sure as they slowly began to seduce me. My desire became stronger with each touch of his tongue and every sigh he elicited from me. As if he knew my body even better than I did, Justin rolled on top of me when the kisses were no longer enough. I could feel just how much he wanted me as he pressed his pelvis against mine, feeling harder than should be possible. My body had a mind of its own as it ground and begged for something more.</p><p>Justin\u2019s hands moved away from my face to the hem of my shirt. Lifting my torso slightly, I helped him remove my shirt and bra. His hands moved up my ribs until they cupped my breasts, causing my breath to labor as he gently rubbed my nipples, which were almost as hard as he was. His lips pulled away from mine. I protested by lacing my hands behind his head to pull him back to me. He chuckled lightly but fought my urges and captured my nipple in his mouth. I arched my back, trembling with desire as he sucked my nipple fully into his mouth. My body no longer belonged to me. I frantically moved against him, trying to ease the fire that was raging uncontrollably through me. Justin\u2019s needs matched my own as he jumped up, tugged off his shirt, and kicked his jeans across the floor. He reached for my jeans and pulled them off my body in one swift movement before dropping hot seductive kisses on my stomach.</p><p>His hands momentarily left my body as he tore open the condom wrapper. Once he had it in place, he knelt between my legs and hooked my right leg over his shoulder so he could place a kiss on the inside of my thigh. My legs trembled with need as I felt him pressed against my opening. With one sure and quick thrust, he was completely buried inside me. His mouth found mine again as he moved inside me. I was already too far gone to hold back the orgasm that ripped through me. I locked my legs around his waist as I rode it out. Justin increased his tempo as he raced toward his own release. With one final thrust, he collapsed on top of me.</p><p>It took several minutes for our breathing to return to normal. Justin remained on top of me. His weight was heavy but still comfortable. Everything about it felt right. Usually after sex I was quick to push the guy away once we finished. My rules had always been set in stone. Once I got what I wanted, my desire would disappear in a flash and I would look for the nearest exit. All my past rules were forgotten with Justin. My hands moved to his back, where I relished the feeling of stroking him on top of me.</p><p>\u201cAm I too heavy?\u201d He broke the silence as he propped himself on one elbow.</p><p>\u201cIs a Mack truck heavy?\u201d I teased. \u201cKidding,\u201d I added, looping my hands around his neck to hold him in place once he tried to lift himself off me.</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of a few things,\u201d he said, placing a kiss on my lips before pulling away. My body felt oddly bereft without his weight on me. Light flooded the room when he flipped on the switch in the bathroom. Feeling self-conscious, I dragged the blanket over me. After a few minutes, he turned the light off, plunging the room back into darkness. I heard the clicking of his bedroom lock before the bed dipped down when he climbed in.</p><p>\u201cI should move to your couch,\u201d I murmured as he tucked me back into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cHell no,\u201d he said, tightening his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cWhat will your mom say?\u201d I asked, feeling like a teenager who was contemplating how to sneak out of her boyfriend\u2019s house without getting caught.</p><p>\u201cBrittni, she\u2019s not going to say anything. I\u2019m an adult. When I moved back home we set up boundaries, and this was one of them. That\u2019s why the basement was redone into an apartment. I respect my mom, but I\u2019m not going to apologize for being a man and desiring the comfort of a woman in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m being silly that I feel like a teenager who\u2019s expecting her boyfriend\u2019s parents to crash in at any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I would say so. Besides, if sex had been that mind-blowing when I was a teenager, I would have been chasing after girls nonstop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you trying to kid? You know you chased them anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I would have put more effort into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was good, though?\u201d I asked groggily as my eyes drifted closed.</p><p>\u201cGood is the understatement of the year.\u201d</p><p>Thumping on the floor above woke us both the next morning. Sunlight streamed into the room from the small window near the ceiling, making everything appear just a little more stark. In the cloak of darkness, being naked didn\u2019t seem nearly as illicit as it did in broad daylight.</p><p>\u201cOh God, your mom is going to hate me,\u201d I mumbled, hiding my head under my pillow.</p><p>\u201cAre you always so dramatic the morning after?\u201d Justin chuckled, pulling the pillow from my face.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never had a morning after,\u201d I confessed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How is that possible?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal. I just usually leave after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is a first for you?\u201d he asked, sounding gleeful.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it go to your head. Once your mom bans me from the house, this will be the last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe of little faith. It\u2019s all good. Now come take a shower with me,\u201d he said, dragging the covers off. I blinked in the light, taking in his naked torso for the first time. Tattoos spanned his entire chest as they wove around his lean muscles. I had never given tattoos much thought, but his were a work of art. Reaching a finger up, I slowly traced the lines covering his toned skin.</p><p>\u201cDo you like them?\u201d he asked in a husky voice.</p><p>\u201cIf I say yes, is it going to inflate your ego more?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBabe, it won\u2019t be anything I haven\u2019t heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass,\u201d I said, swatting his shoulder, which made the sheet slip off me, exposing my chest. His eyes zeroed in on my breasts, making my nipples tighten under his stare.</p><p>\u201cDo you like them?\u201d I asked in a hitched voice, stealing his previous question.</p><p>\u201cVery much so,\u201d he answered, running a thumb over one of them. \u201cCome on. Take a shower with me,\u201d he said, gently tugging on my hand.</p><p>Ignoring my misgivings, I allowed him to lead us to his adjoining bathroom. We were entering new territory here. Showering with a man was definitely a first for me. Justin took it upon himself to show me just how pleasurable it was to be washed from head to toe by strong masculine hands. By the time we were hastily toweling off, we were both anxious to finish what we had started.</p><p>Our second time together was quick and hot. Our releases came seconds apart and left us spent as we collapsed on his bed.</p><p>\u201cHmmm, who knew a shower could be so fun?\u201d I sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTold you,\u201d he said, beaming down at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even want to know how you knew it would be so enjoyable,\u201d I said, giving his shoulder a push so I could get up and get dressed.</p><p>\u201cA gentleman never tells,\u201d he answered, tossing a clean UW shirt my way as I pulled on my jeans from yesterday.</p> <p>\u201cGahhh,\u201d I said, chucking my boot at him, which he easily ducked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get breakfast,\u201d he said, handing my boot back to me. \u201cThere\u2019s a great diner not too far from here, and after that I have a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Unable to stay mad, I finished getting dressed, willing myself not to dwell on his past conquests. We left the house through his private entrance and headed out for the day. The diner turned out to be every bit as good as he said it was, and even though we\u2019d both eaten our weight in food the day before, we were famished from our nighttime and morning activities. We lingered over our meal, trying to one-up each other discussing past holiday disasters. Over a second cup of coffee, I won the contest when I showed him the spiral-looking scar on the palm of my hand. It had taken thirty stitches when I stuck my hand in the sink to remove a steak knife from the garbage disposal that happened to be running at the time.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking? Man, your poor hand,\u201d he said, tracing the scar on the palm of my hand.</p><p>\u201cIt was a total brain-dead moment,\u201d I joked, downing the last of my coffee. \u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d I asked as we shrugged into our jackets.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>His surprise turned out to be an hour-long ferryboat ride to Bremerton. It was a tranquil experience as we stood against the rail, watching the water and taking in the wildlife we passed on the way. Once we arrived, we strolled around window-shopping the quaint shops that sat along the waterway before ending up at the Navy Museum. Finally, we ate a late lunch at a caf\u00e9 on Puget Sound before heading back to the ferryboat for the ride back to the mainland. We decided to stay the rest of the weekend at my dorm since Justin had scored tickets to a Seattle Seahawks game on Sunday. I didn\u2019t admit it, but I was relieved I wouldn\u2019t have to face his mom for at least a few days. Like our shower together, the weekend continued to hold many firsts for me. My first ferryboat ride, my first professional football game, and the first time I spent a solid four days in the company of a male. More astonishing than all the firsts of the weekend was the fact that each day with Justin was as enjoyable as the day before. Our nights were spent wrapped in each other\u2019s arms. That was the weekend I began to fall for the one guy I never expected to.</p><p>17.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>2:41 PM</p><p>\u201cThis is seriously getting ridiculous,\u201d I ranted, stomping my foot in frustration. We were past hour three of being stuck and I was regretting my decision to not use the restroom when I had the chance. Of course, if I had taken the few extra minutes to go to the bathroom, I wouldn\u2019t be stuck on the elevator from hell. That\u2019s the thing with hindsight. You had no way of changing anything. It was just a way of highlighting your mistakes and getting pissed off about it.</p> <p>\u201cI can see your temper is still intact,\u201d Justin observed as I stomped my foot again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a temper.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows skeptically, calling my bluff.</p><p>\u201cFine. Normally, I don\u2019t have a temper,\u201d I ground out, which was partially true. Justin always had the knack of igniting the anger in me. It wasn\u2019t like we fought all the time, but when we did, a temper I never knew I had would emerge.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it. You\u2019re really a closet redhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I have Irish blood in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your job,\u201d he said, changing the subject. \u201cIs teaching as fulfilling as you thought it would be?</p><p>\u201cMy job? Do you really want to know whether I find my work fulfilling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll help pass the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking about work and whether I find it fulfilling would lead some to believe we\u2019re friends,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>He looked uncomfortable with my assessment, obviously not sure he was ready to call that much of a truce. I wasn\u2019t surprised by his reluctance to wave the white flag. If you had told me that morning that Justin and I would be talking cordially to each other, I would have laughed in your face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. I\u2019ve been subbing since I graduated last spring, but a full-time position will be opening up after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you living with your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have a small apartment above the hardware store in Woodfalls. It\u2019s more of a loft than anything else. Kinda reminds me of your apartment in your mom\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did your mom feel about you not living at home?\u201d</p><p>I laughed at his question. He had a good memory. \u201cShe fought it at first, but in the end she didn\u2019t have a choice. We get along much better without her checking to see what I\u2019m doing twenty-four-seven. She\u2019s still meddling all the time and worries about me, but we make it work. Tressa thankfully still takes a lot of heat off me. Mom is so busy wondering who Tressa is corrupting that most times I\u2019m able to skate under the radar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss the city?\u201d he asked, showing how well he knew me again.</p><p>\u201cEvery day, but it\u2019s not as acute as I thought it would be. Tressa was glad to have me back in Woodfalls, and I\u2019ve made a few other friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuy friends?\u201d he asked, stepping into no-man\u2019s-land.</p><p>\u201cReally? Are we talking about my sex life now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. It\u2019s none of my business,\u201d he muttered, looking a little green in the face.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing anyone?\u201d I asked, unable to stop the words even if I had clamped a hand over my mouth.</p><p>After what felt like a full minute had passed, I began to think he wouldn\u2019t answer the question. \u201cI just ended a relationship,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders \u201cYou know me. My track record is the same as it always was. In my defense, it\u2019s not like there are a lot of choices back home,\u201d I answered as he smirked at me. \u201cWhy did you end your relationship?\u201d I asked, not liking the knowing look on his face. It wasn\u2019t like he was some chick whisperer when it came to relationships.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted things from me I wasn\u2019t willing to give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommitment?\u201d I asked. This time it was my turn to smirk.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he snapped before smiling somewhat sheepishly. \u201cOkay, yeah, maybe. It\u2019s not like you have any room to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I did. We might as well face it. We suffer from commitment-a-phobia,\u201d I said, making him chuckle at my terminology. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why we worked,\u201d I mused.</p><p>His chuckles died midway through and his eyes clouded over. \u201cWe didn\u2019t work,\u201d he answered simply.</p><p>I stifled a sigh. Welcome back to no-man\u2019s-land.</p><p>18.</p><p>December 2010</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being irrational,\u201d Justin argued, pacing in front of me with a light drizzle of rain dripping down his face.</p><p>\u201cRight. It\u2019s all my fault. I\u2019m the irrational one,\u201d I yelled, glaring at him with my hands on my hips.</p><p>\u201cYou think you saw something you didn\u2019t see,\u201d he countered, stopping in front of me. \u201cYou can\u2019t break up with me without listening to my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour side? Your side! She was in your goddamn arms. Let me guess. She slipped and just happened to land in your arms with your mouths inches apart. If I wouldn\u2019t have shown up, you would have been lip-locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we wouldn\u2019t have been. She\u2019s an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just found out she got into the master\u2019s program she was hoping for. She was happy and wanted to share it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe certainly did,\u201d I said sarcastically. I sank down on the rain-covered bench in front of my dorm. The fact that it was raining seemed fitting and matched my mood. Dark and brooding. Earlier, my mood had been the exact opposite. Melissa had labeled it as \u201cdownright chipper,\u201d claiming I was a different person now that I was dating Justin. I didn\u2019t even try to argue. She was right. Being in a relationship with Justin had changed my outlook on life. Of course, that was before I saw his arms wrapped around another woman. The arms that I was growing quite partial to were wrapped around a blond girl with legs practically up to her armpits. I wanted to snatch her by that long shiny hair and tie it in knots. Most of all, I wanted to punch Justin to make him hurt as much as he had hurt me, but I did neither of those things. Instead, I stomped away, trudging through the puddles and belittling myself for being so stupid for falling for him. Melissa found me on the bench in front of our building an hour later. My raincoat had kept my clothes relatively dry, but my hair was a mess of dripping curls. Justin arrived ten minutes later. It didn\u2019t take an Einstein to deduce that Melissa was behind his arrival. Twenty minutes after he showed up, we were still arguing.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d Justin said loudly.</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw. She wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want her. I only want you, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me an idiot, you cheating jerk,\u201d I said, surging to my feet as a new wave of anger roared through me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a cheater. If you could get past your narrow-minded prejudiced views, you would see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not narrow-minded or prejudiced,\u201d I shouted, thrusting my balled-up fists into my jacket pockets so I wouldn\u2019t punch him. Two girls from my dorm stopped to stare at us but scurried on when I glared at them.</p><p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019ve assumed from day one that I was a cheater. You are prejudiced. I have never cheated on a girl and I never will. So for the love of God, will you stop expecting me to?\u201d he pleaded, gripping me by my shoulders as if he wanted to shake some sense into me.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if it was the actual words or his pleading tone, but all my anger began to leak away. \u201cOkay,\u201d I finally whispered, sagging beneath his hands.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d he said, tucking me under his arm and leading me out of the rain and into the building.</p><p>\u201cDid we kiss and make up?\u201d Melissa chirped as we entered the room.</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at her in a completely childish way.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean we\u2019re still going to see that new indie band tonight?\u201d she asked, ignoring my childishness.</p><p>\u201cEight o\u2019clock?\u201d Justin asked, looking at me questioningly.</p><p>I nodded, giving him a small smile. All the anger was gone, but embarrassment and confusion had replaced it.</p><p>\u201cSee you then,\u201d he said, placing a tentative kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, shrugging out of my raincoat as he left the room.</p><p>\u201cHow goes it?\u201d Melissa asked once the door had closed behind him.</p><p>I shrugged, flopping back on my bed. \u201cI swear he\u2019ll ruin me. Never in my whole life have I ever shouted at another person like that. He brings out the inner monster in me,\u201d I said, feeling sick now that all the anger was gone.</p><p>\u201cNot anger, passion,\u201d Melissa piped in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel passionately about him,\u201d she said, proud of her diagnosis.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure what I felt was anger,\u201d I said wryly.</p><p>\u201cAnger and passion are basically the same thing. If you truly were angry, you would have walked away. Instead, you faced the problem. You embraced it passionately,\u201d she said insightfully as she stood up and stretched. \u201cNow, I need to take a shower before the person I feel passionately about shows up,\u201d she said, flouncing off to the bathroom.</p><p>I contemplated her words. Was she right? Did I feel passionately about Justin? She had to be wrong. People felt passionately for each other months into a relationship, not after one month. I knew what I had felt in the courtyard when I spotted him with the other girl wrapped around him like some serpent or something. It was jealousy and hurt that waged a battle inside me as I tried to comprehend the scene. For a moment, every insecurity I\u2019d ever felt surfaced. He made me feel that way, whether accidental or not. He made me face the reasons why I tried to avoid relationships.</p><p>I was still on my bed studying the ceiling and contemplating the doom of my sanity when Melissa exited the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her torso. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, taking in my expression.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a weak, nimble-minded female who\u2019s letting some guy lead me around like I\u2019m his bitch or something,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cWhy did you have to introduce me to him? I was fine without some guy clouding the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but think how boring that would be. Cloudy water is good for everyone. It\u2019s the people who have the crystal-clear water who scare the crap out of me. So stop taking everything so seriously and enjoy your swim in this crazy murky water,\u201d she said, grabbing a change of clothes and heading back to the bathroom.</p><p>I watched the door shut behind her and felt slightly better. That was the beauty or at times the horror of living with someone who was all rainbows and unicorns. Maybe she was right. Maybe murky wasn\u2019t bad. So what if I had dived into water that was impossible to see through? Maybe just once I would let myself go.</p><p>Maybe I could put my faith and trust in one person.</p><p>19.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>2:53 PM</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Justin complained, checking his phone for the millionth time.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve covered that,\u201d I said, shifting my position to help ease the numbness that had set in.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m now thinking about food like it\u2019s a lover or something. Like how juicy and delicious a cheeseburger loaded with bacon and all the fixings would be at the moment.\u201d</p><p>My stomach rumbled loudly at his words. \u201cNot nice,\u201d I said, placing a hand on my stomach to quiet the gurgling.</p><p>\u201cOr a large pepperoni pizza with extra cheese,\u201d he continued, ignoring me.</p><p>\u201cNo, a tender steak cooked to perfection with a side salad and a loaded baked potato.\u201d I added my two cents in.</p><p>He groaned at my words. \u201cWith a hot fudge brownie sundae,\u201d he added, looking pained but eager at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gluttons for misery,\u201d I pointed out as my stomach growled its displeasure.</p><p>\u201cWe have to do something to pass the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a deck of cards,\u201d I offered up.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why are you just now mentioning this?\u201d he asked, scooting across the floor until he was sitting less than a foot and a half from me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart stuttered for a fraction of a moment before kicking into warp speed at his close proximity. The tantalizing smell of his cologne, which I had spent the last three hours trying to ignore, swirled around me like a blanket woven from countless memories. It was his scent. It didn\u2019t matter that millions of men probably owned the same cologne. On him it smelled different. I knew this because back in my pain-filled road to recovery, I had made the forty-five-minute drive to the mall outside Woodfalls and purchased a bottle of it. Unable to wait until I got home, I had sprayed my jacket, wanting that small part of him. I was bitterly disappointed that it wasn\u2019t the same. Sitting across from him on the elevator floor, I couldn\u2019t help breathing in, trying to brand the smell to my memory so maybe this time it wouldn\u2019t leave me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to play?\u201d Justin asked, shuffling the cards like he was a blackjack dealer in Vegas.</p><p>\u201cGo Fish,\u201d I teased, laughing outright at his look of dismay.</p> <p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIf I never play another hand of Go Fish, I\u2019ll die a happy person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You don\u2019t like Go Fish,\u201d I commented in a voice laced with false innocence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d feel the same way if you were me. I swear Hollie made me play a million hands the week she was recovering from getting her appendix out when she was seven. Mom threw out all the decks of cards after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you telling me. You always were a great big brother. Travis and Hollie are lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good kids. Well, I guess they\u2019re really not kids anymore. Hollie would have my head if she heard me referring to her in that capacity. I haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of them these past six months,\u201d he said, shuffling the cards again.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t still live at home with them?\u201d I asked, surprised. I just assumed nothing had changed in my absence, which was silly of course. Just because I was no longer there didn\u2019t mean time had stood still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, once Mom married Paul I was no longer needed at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When? Your mom married Paul.\u201d I said the last part as a statement. I\u2019d met Paul only once, since he and Trish had just started seeing each other right before our relationship had gone to crap. He was the new single parent who had moved in next door right after Christmas. Hollie had been ecstatic when she found out he had two kids, including a daughter her age.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right after Christmas last year. Exactly one year after their first date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy,\u201d I muttered, snickering at how clich\u00e9 it seemed.</p><p>\u201cYou never were one to overromanticize things,\u201d Justin commented as a smirk spread across his face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one. If memory serves, you mocked such rituals yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame a guy? I\u2019m not against romantic gestures, but if you\u2019re going to do something, do it right. Go big or go home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyway, once Paul moved in with Brady and Andrea, the house became pretty crowded. Travis took over my basement and I moved out.\u201d</p><p>His words faded as I focused on his previous romantic gestures comment. Go big or go home. He had done that once. One grand romantic gesture that had stolen my heart completely and left me breathless. I wondered if that moment crossed his mind as he told the story of Paul and his mother. Only in my loneliest self-pitying moods did I allow myself to ever think about it.</p><p>20.</p><p>Christmas 2010</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you,\u201d Melissa cried, wrapping me in a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cMel, it\u2019s only three and a half weeks.\u201d I focused on breathing since she had her arms around my neck like a drowning victim.</p><p>\u201cAlmost four weeks,\u201d she sniffled.</p> <p>\u201cOh my. You are very dramatic today. What\u2019s the real issue? Are you sad you\u2019re leaving Rob for the next few weeks?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she wailed.</p><p>At least I had gotten to the root of the problem. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask him to go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to appear needy and clingy,\u201d she replied, sniffing loudly.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I think that ship has sailed,\u201d I told her, pointing to the I Love Rob shrine on the bulletin board above her desk.</p><p>\u201cHey, I like to save everything,\u201d she protested, looking at her board with misty eyes.</p><p>\u201cSweets, you\u2019re a mess. Maybe you should compromise and see if he wants to spend New Year\u2019s with you,\u201d I said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only so cheerful because you get to spend all four weeks with your boyfriend,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cThree and a half weeks,\u201d I corrected, trying not to smile. She was right, though. I was over the moon about spending the next few weeks with Justin without any interference. No studying, no exams, no classes, and no deadlines. My classes over the last few weeks had consumed every waking hour, including the majority of my sleeping hours. Every second was spent preparing for finals. The last exam had ended sixteen hours ago. I celebrated by stumbling across campus in a fog before crashing into my bed for fifteen hours of much-needed sleep. Finally, I no longer resembled a zombie and could be accepted back into humanity. More importantly, I was ready to spend time with Justin. Seeing him for only a handful of hours during the last few weeks had sucked. If I didn\u2019t miss him so much, I might have been concerned at my growing codependency on him. Either way, I was shocked at how well our relationship had been progressing. Since our blowup three weeks ago, we had grown even closer. Now, almost two months into my longest relationship ever, I couldn\u2019t help feeling almost giddy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s too forward?\u201d Melissa asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Asking him to come for New Year\u2019s is the best of both worlds. You\u2019ll get to spend Christmas with your family and New Year\u2019s with your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d she squealed, pulling her phone from her pocket. Her tears dried up as she hastily called Rob. I had done my job.</p><p>Shaking my head at her quick rebound, I headed to the bathroom to get ready before Justin arrived to pick me up. I could hear Melissa\u2019s excited chatter through the door. By the sounds of it, Rob was obviously receptive to her invitation. Pleased with my good deed, I switched on the shower, grabbing the cashmere-scented gel from the Bath &amp; Body Works gift basket Melissa had given me for Christmas. She knows me so well, I thought as I inhaled the heavenly scent.</p><p>By the time I returned, our room was empty. I found a note from Melissa on my desk wishing me a happy holiday and instructing me to text or call if I needed anything. She was sweet. I pulled out my suitcase from under my bed. After many back-and-forth texts, Justin had convinced me to spend the holidays at his house since my building would be closed to students for the break. My original plan was to sublet a room off campus from a friend who was going home for the holidays. It was a win-win situation for her. Spend the holidays at home, while she earned a little spending cash by renting her room for a few weeks. It would have put a strain on my cash surplus, but spending the entire three weeks with Justin and his family bordered on crazy. Eventually, he wore me down. I couldn\u2019t deny I was happy about my decision. Honestly, the idea of rooming with some other poor sap who didn\u2019t have the funds to go home for the holidays held little appeal.</p><p>It took less than an hour to finish packing. Knowing I needed to eat a little crow, I decided to call my mom before Justin arrived to try to make amends for not coming home for the holidays.</p><p>She picked up the phone after one ring, like she had been waiting for my call.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrittni, why did it take this long for you to call me?\u201d she said shortly.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. I just had a lot of loose ends to tie up before they lock this place down,\u201d I said, pacing the floor.</p><p>\u201cSorry enough to fly home to your poor lonely mom?\u201d she sniffed.</p><p>\u201cI would if I could, Mom, but we discussed this, right? I\u2019m seriously behind in some of my classes. If I want to keep my grades up, I need to buckle down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you behind? Have you met someone?\u201d she probed.</p><p>I closed my eyes, counting to five before answering. \u201cNo, Mom, I haven\u2019t met anyone,\u201d I lied. \u201cThe classes I\u2019m taking are just very time-consuming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t work here. Honey, it\u2019s Christmas and I haven\u2019t seen you since summer break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mom, but that would mean me lugging all my textbooks home and all my study materials. I have everything I need here, including the library if I need anything else.\u201d</p><p>I could hear her long sigh of acceptance. I felt guilty lying to her and almost changed my mind.</p><p>\u201cBesides, Mom, I wouldn\u2019t be any fun holed up in my room the whole time. I\u2019d just wind up feeling guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would understand,\u201d she said halfheartedly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t, and I wouldn\u2019t blame you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best if I just stay here.\u201d She remained silent for a moment. I couldn\u2019t tell if she was crying or just trying to think of something else to say to try to convince me to come. \u201cLook, Mom. It\u2019s not like college will last forever. Maybe I can come home for spring break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo maybes about it. You will come home for spring break,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI guess maybe I could go see Suzie and Steve in Arizona,\u201d she finally conceded.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a great idea. Why don\u2019t you give Suzie a call now?\u201d I said, relieved we had reached a compromise.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay all alone during the holiday? I feel bad at the idea of my baby alone on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Mom. I\u2019ll be so brain-fried from schoolwork I probably won\u2019t even notice. If I get lonely, I\u2019ll see if a few of the other students sticking around want to see a movie or something,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. Now call Suzie,\u201d I ordered.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I expect calls from you nightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I warned.</p><p>\u201cFine. Every couple of days, so I know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I love you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, sweetie. Be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d I said, ending the call. I felt guilty for lying about Justin, but that was a subject I didn\u2019t have the time or patience to tackle right now.</p><p>By the time Justin arrived, I was lying on my bed trying to read. Unfortunately, the effects of talking to my mom tended to linger for a while, making it hard to concentrate.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he commented. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be done with books for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this kind of book,\u201d I said, holding up the racy cover for him to see.</p><p>\u201cHey now. Maybe I need to borrow that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s appropriate for your virgin eyes. It\u2019s pretty steamy,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cWell, bring it along anyway. There may be some stuff in there I can use.\u201d</p><p>Justin hauled my bags into the hallway while I gave my room the once-over to make sure I had everything I needed. The building was eerily quiet as we made our way down to the first floor.</p><p>\u201cMan, it\u2019s like a ghost town here,\u201d Justin commented, holding the entryway door open for me.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think Melissa and I were the last to leave. It was like the school announced the building had the bubonic plague or something with the way everyone scattered after exams ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your mom still mad you decided not to come home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think she bought my excuse that I needed to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I would have helped buy your plane ticket so you could have gone home,\u201d Justin said, stowing my suitcase in the back of the jeep.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the money. Mom would have bought my ticket if I had asked. It\u2019s just\u2014when I made the decision to attend UW, I didn\u2019t want to fly home for every break. I went last year, but you heard how much she and I aggravated each other. It\u2019s better to save the six hundred dollars for a plane ticket and we can video chat on the phone instead. Besides, I kinda got the vibe after talking to her a little while ago that she\u2019s thinking of flying to Arizona to see my aunt and uncle,\u201d I said, fastening my seat belt. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for her if she does. I think a few weeks away from Woodfalls is just what she needs.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t be nearly as bad as you make her sound,\u201d Justin chuckled as we headed out of the city.</p><p>\u201cWell, her nicknames are: Creeper, Stalker, Enquirer, Lurker, Peeping Pam, and many more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeeping Pam? That one\u2019s pretty funny,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that one is courtesy of Tressa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a girl I want to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one-of-a-kind, that\u2019s for sure. So, how was your humanities exam?\u201d I asked, changing the subject. Just the mention of Tressa made me feel terribly homesick. Facebook and texting didn\u2019t suffice when it came to best friends.</p><p>\u201cLike seagulls were pecking my eyeballs out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Rucker is such a windbag. We spent months taking notes on every dribble of crap that left his mouth since he warned us at the beginning of the term that notes were the key to success in his class. I spent hours with my study group going over all that crap, and would you believe only two questions out of fifty were in our notes? Two! Who does that?\u201d Justin said, holding up two fingers in frustration.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. Do you think you failed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope not. If I have to take an extra semester of humanities, I\u2019ll jump off a ferryboat and hope another one runs me over,\u201d he said, shuddering at the thought. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I did okay on all of mine. I might have screwed up some of the equations in statistics, but seriously, they were ridiculous. I\u2019ll eat my entire textbook the day I actually use any of that kind of math,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI plan on teaching third grade, for crap\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least they\u2019re behind us now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTruth. Is Hollie excited about Christmas?\u201d I asked, pulling the conversation away from school.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea. She\u2019s channeling Tigger at the moment, bouncing around everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTigger?\u201d I asked confused.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You know, from Winnie the Pooh,\u201d he said at my puzzled expression. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who Tigger is?\u201d he asked, like I\u2019d just told him I didn\u2019t know who the president was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t a big Winnie the Pooh person when I was little,\u201d I confessed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you had to have watched it at least once.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m having a stroke,\u201d he said, placing his hand on his heart.</p><p>\u201cDramatic much?\u201d I quizzed at his antics.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just in shock. How could your mom let this happen? Next, you\u2019ll tell me you didn\u2019t watch Sesame Street either.\u201d</p><p>I looked out my window so he wouldn\u2019t see my lips quirking.</p><p>\u201cShut up. No Sesame Street either?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d I answered. \u201cTressa and I were into other cartoons,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me it wasn\u2019t SpongeBob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not SpongeBob,\u201d I hem-hawed.</p><p>\u201cSpill it,\u201d he demanded, tickling my leg until I gasped out the answer.</p><p>\u201cFine. We were Johnny Bravo and Batman Beyond fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Those were the shows I watched.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably not for the same reasons as us,\u201d I said.</p><p>He looked at me questioningly as he pulled into the driveway beside Trish\u2019s minivan.</p><p>\u201cWe sort of watched them because we thought Johnny Bravo and Bruce Wayne were cute,\u201d I muttered, grabbing my bag and hopping from the jeep.</p><p>\u201cHa, and you call me the flirt,\u201d he teased, grabbing my suitcase and leading me to the stairs to his apartment.</p><p>\u201cYou are a flirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrittni,\u201d Hollie squealed, barreling down the basement stairs as we entered Justin\u2019s apartment. She threw her arms around my waist, making me stagger to keep my balance.</p><p>\u201cHollie, what did I tell you?\u201d Justin chastised.</p><p>\u201cThat I have to knock before I come down here,\u201d Hollie answered petulantly.</p> <p>\u201cKnock and what else?\u201d he asked, placing my suitcase on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cAnd wait until you answer,\u201d she added reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cExactly. If I were in a regular apartment, you wouldn\u2019t be able to barge in anytime you want. I like seeing you every day, but you have to respect my privacy. Now, go back upstairs and knock,\u201d he said, steering her toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cSheesh, it\u2019s not like you two were lip-locked or anything,\u201d she muttered, stomping up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cTough love?\u201d I asked, turning to Justin.</p><p>\u201cI just want her to know her boundaries. I don\u2019t want to have to worry about her interrupting us all the time for the next three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly do you think she\u2019ll be interrupting?\u201d I teased, wrapping my arms around him and placing a kiss on his neck. \u201cMaybe this?\u201d I added, running the tip of my tongue along his jaw. \u201cOr this?\u201d I asked, trailing my lips to his ear and gently tugging on his earlobe with my teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou are evil and need to be punished,\u201d he growled, dragging me against his pelvis to emphasize his point. I moaned my approval as I felt his enthusiasm against my stomach. \u201cYour punishment will have to wait, though,\u201d he said, dropping a quick kiss on my lips as Hollie pounded on the basement door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding you to that,\u201d I taunted, trailing him up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d Justin said, giving her a one-armed hug. She was busy mixing a bowl of chocolate chip cookie dough.</p><p>\u201cSon, Brittni,\u201d Trish greeted us. Her voice seemed slightly strained when she said my name.</p><p>\u201cYum, cookie dough,\u201d Justin said, scooping some of the dough from the side of the bowl with his finger.</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d Hollie piped in, taking the time to grab a spoon for her own stolen bite. \u201cCan Justin and I bring the decorations down now?\u201d she asked with puppy-dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cAs long as your bedroom is clean,\u201d Trish answered, spooning the cookie dough onto a cookie sheet.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Hollie claimed. She jumped up and down with excitement and grabbed Justin\u2019s hand to drag him from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d I asked, rising from the bar stool I was perched on.</p><p>\u201cNo, we got it. Sit and relax. I bet Mom would even be willing to share her coffee,\u201d he said, indicating the coffeepot on the counter.</p><p>\u201cCups are in the cabinet over the microwave,\u201d Trish said shortly.</p><p>Feeling uncomfortable, I walked around the counter and grabbed a large mug. Awkward silence filled the room as I doctored up my coffee to my taste preference before heading back to my seat.</p><p>Trish kept her eyes on the task at hand, while I contemplated broaching the subject that was most likely bothering her. Finally, after several minutes had passed, I decided to take the plunge. It was like removing a Band-Aid. If you did it slowly, it hurt way more than one quick pull.</p><p>\u201cUm, Trish,\u201d I started, wondering if I should have fallen back on formality and used her last name instead.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said finally, looking troubled.</p><p>\u201cAre you upset that I\u2019m staying here for Christmas break?\u201d I asked, pulling the Band-Aid off in one swift motion.</p><p>She waited several heartbeats before answering. \u201cI\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m just having a hard time accepting the fact that my baby is old enough to have a live-in girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just temporary,\u201d I answered weakly.</p><p>\u201cI know, dear. I also know that you\u2019re both adults. It just seems a bit seedy that I\u2019m allowing my son to sleep with his girlfriend under my roof,\u201d she huffed out, looking relieved that she was finally able to get it off her chest.</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I slept on the couch?\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear, that\u2019s not necessary. I keep reminding myself that if Justin were in his own apartment, he would be free to have whomever he wants over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it makes you uncomfortable,\u201d I said sincerely. \u201cI can still rent a room off campus,\u201d I volunteered.</p><p>\u201cHoney, that\u2019s not necessary. I\u2019m just acting like an old fuddy-duddy. Who would have ever thought I\u2019d turn into my mother?\u201d she said, chuckling ruefully. \u201cJust tell me you two are being safe. I\u2019m definitely not ready to be a grandma yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d I said, shifting uncomfortably in my seat. Safe sex wasn\u2019t high on the list of things I wanted to talk about with a parental figure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask,\u201d she said, flashing a genuine smile.</p><p>Hollie and Justin entered the kitchen, halting any further sex conversation. Their arms were loaded with clear plastic tubs filled with Christmas decorations. The three of us spent the rest of the day decorating while Trish baked enough cookies to feed an army, filling the house with a sinfully mouthwatering aroma. By the time darkness fell, the house looked like an elf had puked up the North Pole everywhere. Hollie kept up her usual steady stream of chatter, clamming up only when Travis threatened to buy her a muzzle as a Christmas gift.</p><p>It was almost midnight before Justin and I finally found ourselves alone in his apartment.</p><p>\u201cAlone as last,\u201d he said, sitting on the edge of his bed. He grabbed my hand and maneuvered me until I was standing between his legs. \u201cI\u2019ve been fantasizing about this all day,\u201d he added, deftly unfastening the buttons of my shirt.</p><p>\u201cDo tell,\u201d I said, placing my hands on his shoulders since my legs felt unusually weak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long two weeks. I think we need to move in together before we have to take exams next time,\u201d he said, placing his lips right below my belly button.</p><p>\u201cThat ought to go over well with your mom,\u201d I murmured, gripping his shoulders harder as his lips left a fiery trail across my abdomen.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked as I crawled on top of his lap to straddle him.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I was pretty sure his mom wanted our earlier conversation to stay between us.</p><p>\u201cJust think how nice it would be to do this in between studying,\u201d Justin said, gripping my hips in his hands as he moved against me.</p><p>\u201cIt would definitely make math just a little easier to digest,\u201d I said. I reached a hand down to stroke him through his jeans.</p><p>He moaned loudly, straining against my hand as his lips found mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Two weeks is way too long,\u201d I said, pushing his shoulders back until we were both lying on his bed.</p><p>\u201cNever again,\u201d he answered, capturing my lips.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d I agreed as we removed the rest of our clothing. He flipped me over in one fluid movement until I was beneath him. I sighed with pleasure as I felt him seeking the wetness between my legs, bringing our bodies together.</p><p>21.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>3:11 PM</p><p>\u201cHit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Justin asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Now, hit me,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your funeral,\u201d he said, raising his hand.</p><p>I slammed my eyes shut, unable to look.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-three,\u201d he crowed loudly, making me groan with frustration.</p><p>Opening my eyes, I looked down at the three cards in front of me with dismay. Damn, he was right.</p><p>\u201cYou jinxed me,\u201d I complained as he snatched up the peppermint candy I had bet.</p><p>\u201cNot everyone can play blackjack like me,\u201d he bragged, scooping up the cards.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that. Let me deal,\u201d I said, holding my hand out for the deck of cards.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you promise not to weep as I continue to rack up the wins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised this elevator is big enough for your ego,\u201d I observed as he reached over to hand me the cards. My hand grazed his, making my heart stutter. For two years I\u2019d willed myself to forget how his touch felt. I told myself that I\u2019d romanticized it, that all we\u2019d shared was a typical college fling. Now, as I looked down at our hands apprehensively touching, a flood of memories washed over me. There was a time when that same hand had skimmed over my body, cherishing it like a work of art.</p><p>I looked at Justin with confusion, wondering why he didn\u2019t pull away. He\u2019d once proclaimed for the world to hear that he would rather cut off his own hand and feed it to an alligator than touch me again. Without looking up, Justin moved his pinkie minutely to stroke mine. I sat without moving a muscle as the forgotten playing cards slowly cascaded from my hand. He laced his fingers through mine, looking as thunderstruck as I felt. My grip instinctively closed around his like a clam claiming a piece of sand.</p><p>\u201cHow could you do that to us?\u201d Justin asked raggedly, finally meeting my eyes. \u201cWhy do I still want you after everything you did?\u201d he added harshly, tightening his grip around my hand until it was almost painful.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer his question. I could not speak for him. I was having a hard enough time sorting through my own feelings.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I finally answered.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d he said with disgust. He released my hand abruptly and scooted back to his side of the elevator. I watched with grief as he dropped his face to his hands. We had done this to each other. We took and took until we were stretched so thin that we became brittle and eventually shattered.</p><p>22.</p><p>New Year\u2019s Eve 2010</p><p>\u201cOh, Brittni, you look beautiful,\u201d Hollie breathed as I put the final touches on my appearance.</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you, sweets,\u201d I said, giving her a squirt of my favorite perfume.</p><p>\u201cI love your dress. The material is so silky smooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. You helped pick it out,\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI know, but it looks even better fully accessorized,\u201d she said, indicating the matching shoes and my hair, which was styled on top of my head in a mess of curls.</p><p>\u201cJustin is going to flip when he sees you,\u201d she added, flopping down on Justin\u2019s bed while I added a few essentials to the small beaded evening bag I\u2019d splurged on.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d better. I spent a month\u2019s salary on this getup,\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could go,\u201d Hollie said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cOne day soon we\u2019ll take you somewhere special, okay?\u201d I said, giving her a quick hug before joining Justin in his living room.</p><p>Justin was in the process of sending a text when I entered the room. I smiled when he looked up and gaped at me. Hollie giggled behind me.</p><p>\u201cI think that means he likes it,\u201d she said, skipping toward the stairs. \u201cHave fun,\u201d she called behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing,\u201d Justin said, standing up to join me.</p><p>\u201cYou like?\u201d I pirouetted around so he could get the full effect of the dress.</p><p>\u201cVery much. Makes me second-guess my decision to take you out tonight,\u201d he answered, placing his warm lips on mine.</p><p>\u201cToo late for that, buddy. This dress cost a small fortune and demands to be seen,\u201d I said, stepping out of his embrace. \u201cAlthough looking at you should make me rethink that. Girls will be dropping their panties wherever we go tonight when they see you in this suit,\u201d I added, running my hand over the smooth material of his charcoal-colored blazer. I felt no jealousy, though. Somewhere along the way I realized that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Truly believing that made all the difference in the world.</p><p>\u201cI only want one pair of panties dropped tonight,\u201d he said, tugging me back into his arms for another hard kiss. \u201cLet\u2019s do this before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked while Justin helped gather my dress into the jeep.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cYes, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he answered, pulling out of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I pretended to sulk, even though in reality I was touched he was going to so much trouble to make tonight a surprise. \u201cI can\u2019t believe classes start next week,\u201d I complained.</p><p>\u201cAt least we still have a week. Besides, before we know it, it\u2019ll be summer break. Did you tell your mom you decided to stay in Seattle for the summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no,\u201d I answered evasively, shifting in my seat.</p><p>\u201cChicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I just need to catch her on a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck when you finally do it. That\u2019s if you still want to?\u201d he asked, looking uncertain.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a little fast, and I\u2019m scared about what your mom will think,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cI already told her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her?\u201d I asked incredulously. \u201cWhat did you say? What did she say?\u201d I fired at him in a rush.</p><p>\u201cI told her that I asked you to move in with me during the summer. I asked her if that was going to be a problem.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said it was my decision to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say it was too soon? That we were making a mistake?\u201d I asked, admitting my own fears.</p> <p>\u201cI know you think it\u2019s fast, but by summer you\u2019ll feel differently,\u201d he reassured me, patting my leg.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d I asked. I already had butterflies filling my belly and it was months away.</p><p>\u201cBecause, after the last few weeks together, I know I want that all the time. I like having you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you get sick of me? What if I get sick of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll cross that bridge if it happens. Have you gotten sick of me these past few weeks?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, no, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re like in the honeymoon stage,\u201d I answered, regretting my words instantly.</p><p>\u201cHoneymoon? Who\u2019s rushing things now?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. It\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he said, pulling into a parking garage. \u201cWe have to hike a little to get there, but parking near the restaurant is almost nonexistent. This parking garage is as close as we will get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I answered, looking down at my delicate heels. They looked cute, but walking in them more than a few steps would turn them into medieval torture devices.</p><p>Justin offered me his arm as we left the garage and headed across the street.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked as I stumbled for the third time in less than two minutes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, except these damn heels hate me,\u201d I said, glaring down at the traitors on my feet.</p><p>\u201cCan you make it? The restaurant is less than a block away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I may have to murder the maker of these shoes, but I\u2019ll make it. As long as you promise to visit me in prison, we\u2019re good to go. Of course, I\u2019m sure some butch chick will make me her bitch within the first day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomicide of uncomfortable shoemakers is accepted, not that I wouldn\u2019t be interested in seeing you with another girl,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a guy,\u201d I said, swinging at him with my hand. I almost biffed it for the fourth time. It seemed the heels wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until I was a smear on the pavement.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d he chuckled, stopping in front of the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cPink Door? Oh yeah, I\u2019ve heard of this place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLive music, romance. It\u2019s the perfect destination for a New Year\u2019s Eve date,\u201d he said, guiding me into the restaurant.</p><p>We stepped inside and the first thing I saw was a woman swinging from a trapeze hanging from the ceiling. There was light jazz music coming from a band onstage. Taking in my surroundings, I was glad I had gone the extra distance on my appearance. Everyone seemed to be dressed to the nines to celebrate the evening.</p><p>Justin approached the hostess, who found our reservation and signaled another girl to show us to our table.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d I commented, removing my jacket and placing it on the back of my chair.</p><p>\u201cA buddy of mine came here a couple months ago for his girlfriend\u2019s birthday. He said the food is really good.\u201d</p><p>His friend\u2019s assessment proved to be an understatement. Every dish that was brought out seemed to top the one before it. The ambiance of the restaurant was just as intoxicating. The interior was cute and chic. I felt like I was in a bistro in Paris or something.</p><p>\u201cThat was incredible,\u201d I said as we slowly strolled back to the parking garage. Slow being the key word since my shoes weren\u2019t done tormenting me. By the time we made it to the jeep, I was cursing my shoes with every step.</p><p>Justin was chuckling as he helped tuck me into the jeep before climbing in himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I asked, pulling off my shoes to rub my sore feet.</p><p>\u201cYou. Your temper is downright cute. I\u2019m not even sure a frat boy cusses as much as you just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, swearing is my downfall. I try to curb it, but when my body parts are screaming in agony, it gets the best of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo apologies necessary. I admire the fact that you were able to make it as far as you did,\u201d he said, pulling in front of the art gallery at UW where I had first agreed to go out with him. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cYou missed school so much you had to return during break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the evening\u2019s festivities,\u201d he said, climbing from the vehicle and coming to my side. \u201cHere, put your arms around my neck.\u201d</p><p>Following his orders, I placed my arms around his neck as he swooped me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWait, you can\u2019t carry me. I\u2019m too heavy,\u201d I protested as he carried me effortlessly to the front of the building.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You weigh nothing,\u201d he said, pulling me tightly against his chest as he unlocked the front door of the building with a set of keys he pulled from his suit pocket. \u201cNow, the wooden planks I use for my artwork, they\u2019re heavy,\u201d he stated, placing me down once we were inside the building.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to get in trouble for being in here?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cMr. Smith knows I\u2019m here. That\u2019s how I got these,\u201d he said, dangling the keys.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so. I feel I should point out that it would be a huge bummer if I got kicked out of UW and had to return home with my head hung in shame,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNever fear, it\u2019s all cool. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the fox to the hen,\u201d I mumbled. I trailed behind him toward the only source of light on the far side of the large room.</p><p>He laughed and linked his fingers through mine. We were still ten feet or so away when the painting on the wall came into focus. The familiar face staring back at me stopped me in my tracks. Stepping closer, I studied the painting intently. It was me, but it wasn\u2019t. It was far too beautiful to be me. I mean, I felt I was cute, but never beautiful, not like this. Justin had taken every feature about myself that I saw as a flaw and somehow made them appear beautiful, almost exotic.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I whispered, tracing a finger over the image as I fought to keep my tears at bay.</p><p>\u201cI did the outline the day we went to the aquarium. You were so beautiful seeing the fish for the first time. You took my breath away. I wasn\u2019t sure I would be able to capture it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is how you saw me?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis is how I see you. This is how everyone sees you. I\u2019m not sure where this low self-image you have came from, but trust me. You are the only one who sees it,\u201d he clarified, turning me to face him. \u201cI love you, Brittni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Wait. You love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, crushing his lips to mine. He loved me. He thought I was beautiful. Me. He loved me.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I said as the truth roared from me like a freight train. I wasn\u2019t sure when it happened, but somewhere along the way he had captured my heart.</p><p>23.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>3:27 PM</p><p>\u201cI hate that your touch still affects me,\u201d Justin admitted after a few minutes had passed.</p><p>\u201cJoin the club. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing cartwheels here,\u201d I muttered, slowly picking up the cards we had dropped.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to understand what I\u2019m going through here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re going through?\u201d I shook my head at his arrogance. \u201cYou think you somehow hold the market on hate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no reason to hate me,\u201d he said, shaking with barely suppressed rage.</p><p>\u201cReally? What about the fact that you left me and refused to listen? That you never considered my feelings or how hard it was on me. I hate to break it to you, but you betrayed me long before I betrayed you. So get off your high horse. Contrary to what you believe, the world does not revolve around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not cheat on you with Shelly,\u201d he said, jumping to his feet so he could pace again. \u201cI told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you mean?\u201d he yelled.</p><p>I cringed as his voice vibrated off every corner of the small enclosed space.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about my heart,\u201d I said, surging to my feet. I stood directly in front of him with rage cloaking us like a blanket. \u201cYou betrayed my heart. You left me broken and alone in front of everyone,\u201d I added, jabbing him in the chest with my finger. \u201cYou left me alone holding all the shattered pieces,\u201d I whispered as the dam holding my sobs at bay finally crumbled.</p><p>24.</p><p>February 2011</p><p>\u201cBrittni, you\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Melissa said, nudging my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said groggily, squinting in the bright daylight streaming through the window above our desks.</p><p>\u201cI said you\u2019re going to be late. Don\u2019t you have biology at ten?\u201d she asked, pulling on her jacket while she crammed her feet into the cute pair of flats she had gotten for Christmas.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered, placing the pillow over my eyes to block out the unwanted light.</p><p>\u201cWell, unless you get your ass in gear, you\u2019re going to miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I mumbled. My heavy eyes tried enticing me to stay in my nice comfortable bed for the rest of the day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine forty-five. Unless you\u2019re skipping for the second time this week, you have to get up now,\u201d she said, pulling the pillow off my face.</p><p>\u201cNine forty-five?\u201d I repeated, trying to make sense of the time in my head, which seemed to be in permanent foggy mode lately.</p><p>\u201cYes, so get up,\u201d she said, grabbing her shoulder bag.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d I snipped, dragging my legs around so I was sitting up. The room spun slightly, making me feel queasy.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Melissa asked with her hand on the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just a little light-headed. I didn\u2019t eat much yesterday. I think I have a dumb stomach bug,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stay in bed. You look like hell,\u201d Melissa replied, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the compliment. Philips would have my head. We\u2019re covering mitosis phases versus meiosis phases this week. She\u2019s hinted that they\u2019ll be important facts to know for the midterm.\u201d I struggled to pull on my favorite yoga pants at the same time that I was yanking my UW hooded sweatshirt over my head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if you\u2019re sick,\u201d Melissa said, taking in my lethargic movements.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Once I finish biology, I\u2019ll come back here and go to bed,\u201d I said as I shoved my hair into a clip to secure it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a date with Justin tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s studying with some guys from his humanities class tonight. His teacher is being a complete asshat,\u201d I said, grabbing my bag and following her out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard horror stories about that guy. Thank God we steered clear of him,\u201d Melissa said before we parted ways. \u201cMake sure you go back to bed after class,\u201d she added sternly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d I teased, feeling slightly better now that I was moving around.</p><p>\u201cGood girl, and if you\u2019re lucky, maybe I\u2019ll bring you some soup tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Mia\u2019s Diner?\u201d I asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait and see. Now go before you make both of us late,\u201d she said, shooing me off.</p><p>Heeding her warning, I increased my pace, although my body wasn\u2019t happy about it, but at least I reached biology with two minutes to spare. Five minutes later, I was wishing I\u2019d just stayed in bed. To add insult to injury, I discovered that Professor Philips wouldn\u2019t be teaching today when one of the research assistants who had previously covered her class came strolling in. The worst part was he had a heavy foreign accent that no one seemed to be able to understand. You could hear multiple grumbles throughout the room as he hooked up his laptop to the overhead screen at the front of the classroom. The best you could do was write down as much information as possible from his PowerPoint presentation and hope that Professor Philips would cover the topic again on another day. I did my best to keep up, but the minutes trickled by at an alarmingly slow rate as I imagined my warm bed back in my room.</p><p>\u201cWhat a joke,\u201d Stan, one of my friends, said as we walked out of the building together after class. \u201cI know he\u2019s speaking English, but I\u2019ll be damned if I understood five words of what he said in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d I said. \u201cI got \u2018Hello, class,\u2019 but everything after that sounded like gibberish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go grab some coffee? I have an inordinate amount of time left before my next class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I think I\u2019m fighting off some kind of bug. It was all I could do to drag my ass out of bed for this joke of a class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. I hope you feel better,\u201d he said, backing away before he could catch any of my germs.</p><p>I told him thanks, although I was tempted to lick his face or something, the big baby. The walk back to my dorm seemed endless as the last of my energy surplus melted away. By the time I stumbled back to my room, I didn\u2019t even bother to remove my clothes. Before I succumbed to sleep, I sent Justin a text telling him I was sick and that I would call him later when I woke. He replied quickly, telling me to rest and drink plenty of fluids.</p><p>Later turned into the next morning as I woke up after nearly twenty hours of sleep. I felt marginally better and relieved that the queasy stomach that had been plaguing me for the last week or so seemed to have disappeared.</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s finally awake,\u201d Melissa said, placing a hand on my forehead. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little better. My stomach isn\u2019t as bad.\u201d I checked my phone to see several text messages and missed calls from Justin.</p><p>\u201cI already told him you weren\u2019t feeling well and that you were crashing,\u201d Melissa said when she saw my reaction to my phone.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll call him in a few minutes. I need to get moving.\u201d</p><p>Tuesdays and Thursdays were the two days that I worked at the daycare since I had no classes. Melissa tried to talk me into calling in sick so I wouldn\u2019t expose the kids to my germs.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I got those germs?\u201d I pointed out, pulling on my last clean pair of pants, which happened to be another pair of yoga pants. I badly needed a trip to the laundry.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. Maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been so sickly these last few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s days, not weeks,\u201d I chastised, pulling on my boots. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWeeks,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cYou\u2019ve been complaining about feeling puny since the last week of January. Valentine\u2019s Day is on Monday. I know my math skills are shaky, but I can read a calendar, and that means you\u2019ve felt bad for more than two weeks. Maybe you\u2019re anemic,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I answered, grabbing my purse.</p><p>\u201cYou should visit the clinic,\u201d she said as I headed for the door.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, flashing a fake smile as I closed the door behind me.</p><p>The smile faded before the door had closed completely behind me. Two weeks? Could she be right? Two weeks of sickness and five and a half weeks since my last period. For a week and a half I had been trying in vain to ignore the fact that for the first time in my life I was late. It couldn\u2019t be possible. I was a Period Clock. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew something was wrong. I pushed it to the far recesses of my brain and buried it beneath mundane school-related junk, but suddenly the truth hit me like a brick wall, making me gasp for air. I detoured from my usual route to the daycare and sank down on one of the benches along the way. A lack of air made my vision blur and my stomach turn. Leaning forward, I placed my head between my knees. My world was falling apart at the seams.</p><p>After a few minutes of trying to calm my breathing, I was finally able to lift my head. The analytical part of my brain told me I needed to get up and go to work. That I needed to restore my life to some semblance of normalcy until it was ready to digest the news I had been avoiding. At the moment, I could not deal with the fact that my body no longer belonged to me alone.</p><p>Staggering to my feet, I gripped the back of the bench until the last of the light-headedness completely faded. I began the short hike to work, knowing that once I made it there I would be too busy to think about anything else. With each step I took, the band of despair that was encircling my chest loosened slightly so I was able to breathe a little bit easier.</p><p>Breathe, step, breathe, step, breathe.</p> <p>Seemingly meaningless words when taken out of the context of this moment, but for now they served their purpose as they rolled through my head.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Step.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Step.</p><p>Breathe.</p> <p>I plastered a smile on my face as I greeted the kind elderly receptionist who sat at the entrance of the daycare. Fellow teachers called out their own greetings as I made my way to the lounge and the locker where I stored my belongings. I returned their greetings, keeping the same brittle smile firmly in place. If they saw through my fa\u00e7ade, they refrained from commenting.</p><p>Once I hit the classroom where I co-taught four-year-olds, my smile became a little less brittle and almost appeared normal if you didn\u2019t know any better. The letter Q and number twenty became my best friends for the day as I worked one-on-one with each student. The monotony of the assignment allowed me to shut down the bothersome side of my brain. \u201cDraw a circle and add a tail,\u201d I instructed one student after another. I learned to love those words. After all sixteen of the students made their attempt at a capital Q, I moved to watching them count out twenty Goldfish crackers. Once their counting challenge was accomplished, I would hand them a cup so they could munch on their reward. The morning passed quickly and before I knew it, I was folding mats and stowing blankets and pillows in cubbies after naptime. Every task was completed with my mind occupied only on what I was doing. For a moment, a second, a minute, I convinced myself nothing was wrong.</p><p>Leaving the distractions of work behind allowed the dormant thoughts to once again rear their ugly heads. In order to make it back to the dorm, I focused again on what I could control.</p><p>Breathe. Step. Breathe. Step.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Brittni. You still look terrible,\u201d Melissa stated as I staggered into our room.</p><p>I ignored her observation. What did it matter if I looked like hell or felt like hell? Did any of that matter when I was living in hell? Collapsing on my bed, I kicked off my boots and dragged my comforter over my head with one goal: to block out the world. I could hear Melissa asking if I was still sick. I gave her a grunt of confirmation, wanting to be left alone. She went into motherly mode again, giving me advice on what I needed to do. Ready for her to hush, I agreed to go to the campus clinic the next day even though I had no intention of doing it. I didn\u2019t need a doctor to tell me I was pregnant. Peeing on a stick would make it official. I wasn\u2019t ready to make it official.</p><p>During the next few days, I forced myself to pretend everything was okay so Melissa would get off my back. I canceled two dates with Justin, claiming I wanted to catch up on schoolwork. My days took on a surreal feeling as I went through the motions of being a normal person. It began to feel like I was acting in a play that only paused to take an intermission when I was finally able to succumb to sleep. Through it all, I continued to hope I would get my period, putting my fears to rest. Each night I went to bed bitterly disappointed.</p><p>25.</p> <p>Present Day</p><p>3:55 PM</p><p>Turning away from Justin, I sank down to the elevator floor, exhausted that we were back where we had started. I brushed away the tears from my eyes. It\u2019s not like they could rewind time or change the past, and they certainly couldn\u2019t undo the harsh words.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me,\u201d Justin accused.</p><p>\u201cIt was my body,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. It was my baby too.\u201d</p><p>I cringed at the word. Baby. I never allowed myself to think of it that way. It was the only way to ease the pain. Hearing him say it now was like a sword being rammed through my chest.</p><p>We were entering territory I had not forged into. Not with Melissa when she begged me to tell Justin everything. Not with Justin, who refused to hear my side when I needed support. And definitely not with my mom, who could never have handled the truth. Only one person knew all the sordid details. Tressa had met me at the airport more than two years ago and, with one look at me, detoured to the airport bar, where she ordered us several drinks in a row. Somehow we avoided being carded. Maybe the bartender, who was also a woman, could sense the grief I was experiencing. Maybe it would have been obvious to anyone. Either way, I was grateful. With the alcohol coursing through my bloodstream, my tongue loosened and my tears fell hot and fast as I poured my heart out to my best friend. She listened as I explained how Justin had ripped my guts out in front of everyone. How he\u2019d refused to listen. At times Tressa\u2019s face twisted with anger, but through it all she held my hand, giving me what I needed, someone to hear my side. As the last words left my mouth, I vowed to never utter them again. The pain was too unbearable. Tressa offered the support I needed with no judgment. She was loyal to the core, even offering to fly to Seattle to make Justin suffer.</p><p>Now, two years later, Justin and I were stuck together in this elevator, like two dogs forced to fight each other in some illegal backyard brawl. I couldn\u2019t fault him for his anger any more than I could fault myself for the choices I had made. I could have pushed harder two years ago, forcing him to hear me. Even through all his resistance, I could have provided evidence that would have explained everything. At the time, I\u2019d been so hurt by how quickly he had turned on me that I couldn\u2019t find the will to do any more than walk away with the small amount of dignity I had left. Maybe if things hadn\u2019t gotten so screwed up, so ugly, they could have been different. We would never know that outcome, though.</p><p>26.</p><p>February 2011</p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with your chicken?\u201d Justin asked, looking at the mangled uneaten mess on my plate.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just not hungry,\u201d I said shortly. I was afraid if I said more, the secret I was holding would leak from my mouth, and I wasn\u2019t ready to tell him. I was still trying to come to grips with the situation myself. A situation that had been confirmed in the bathroom just a few hours before Justin picked me up. The pee stick delivered the news in seconds. For whatever reason, I thought it would take longer. Instead, I glared at the offending stick, which had instantly stolen any last bit of denial I had left.</p><p>\u201cAre you done? I really have to pee,\u201d Stephanie, from the room we shared the communal bathroom with, called through the door.</p><p>\u201cYeah, give me a sec,\u201d I answered, washing my hands after hastily wrapping the test stick in toilet paper. Before exiting the bathroom, I unlocked the door adjacent to Stephanie\u2019s room so she could get in. I was already exiting the door to my room when she called out a greeting. I pretended I didn\u2019t hear her, not sure I could stomach a conversation centering on who was hooking up with who. I liked Stephanie a lot, and most days her idle chitchat was entertaining. She had a way of spinning every story into a mock standup comedy act. It was all in good fun and everyone found it worth bragging about when she decided to add you into her act. At the moment, though, laughing was not on my agenda.</p><p>\u201cI can order you something else,\u201d Justin asked, sounding aggravated.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m really not that hungry,\u201d I answered. I wasn\u2019t surprised he was losing patience with me. My end of our conversations over the past week had been reduced to one-word answers. I told myself I was waiting to tell him the truth until I knew for sure. Now that the life-changing stick had verified the news, I couldn\u2019t find the courage to speak up. He was obviously confused over my sudden standoffishness and broken dates, but I couldn\u2019t seem to bring myself to fix it.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been in the mood to talk either. What\u2019s with you lately?\u201d he probed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, you\u2019ve been pretty self-involved for days now. Is this your way of telling me you want out of this relationship? Because if that\u2019s the case, all you have to do is say the word,\u201d he said, expressionless.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I stewed. \u201cAre you trying to break up with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asked nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cIs it what you want?\u201d I asked, throwing his words back at him. The nausea that plagued my body swirled inside me until it lodged in my throat.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not here to force you to stay in a relationship if you\u2019ve lost interest. Last week you broke all our dates, claiming to be sick or busy. This week, every time we\u2019re together, you\u2019ve got a vacant look on your face. Obviously, I\u2019m boring you. If that\u2019s the case, there are plenty of other chicks I can hook up with.\u201d</p><p>His words made me feel like I was being dragged under water with no way to return to the surface. How had we gotten to this point so quickly? I had been moody and a little vacant recently, I got that. Was that really all it took for him to throw in the towel? How could he handle the responsibility of a pregnancy when he couldn\u2019t handle a week of not being the center of attention?</p><p>\u201cHook up? Did you really just say that to me?\u201d I asked. I didn\u2019t care that my voice carried across the restaurant. He had pushed the wrong button and was being unfair. I was trying to deal with a life-changing event and he was thinking about who he could hook up with next. I clenched my fist, wanting to punch the snarky look right off his face.</p><p>\u201cChill,\u201d Justin said in a lower voice, looking uncomfortably at the other patrons sitting near us.</p><p>\u201cChill? You want me to chill? How about you chill,\u201d I said, picking up my glass of water and throwing it in his face. The other diners chuckled at the free show, but I paid no attention. \u201cYou go hook up with those other girls. I need nothing from you anymore,\u201d I said as my voice shook with rage and hurt.</p><p>I was halfway home before the tears finally made it past the rage and into sorrow. As they poured down my cheeks with no end in sight, everything inside me turned to burned ash. Why should I be so surprised that it would end this way? Justin wasn\u2019t the type to stick to a relationship. Hell, neither was I. Could I really blame him for getting bored with me, especially after my behavior these last few weeks? We were both anticommitment.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Brittni. What happened to you?\u201d Melissa jumped up as I burst into our room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been crying,\u201d she stated, unsure how to handle this anomaly.</p><p>I nodded, sinking down on my bed. Scooting back, I picked up my pillow and clutched it against my chest, hoping it would help the pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Melissa asked, joining me on my bed. \u201cDid you and Justin have a fight?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again. I wasn\u2019t sure I would be able to talk around the new wave of tears I was trying to keep from flowing.</p><p>Melissa patted my hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cBy morning, I bet he\u2019ll be calling you, wanting to make up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe broke up and I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d I said in a rush as tears coursed down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cPregnant?\u201d Melissa whispered, looking horrified.</p><p>I nodded through my tears, relieved to finally confess to someone.</p><p>\u201cAnd that asshole dumped you when you told him?\u201d she asked disgusted, snatching up her cell phone. \u201cRob is going to kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to tell him about the baby,\u201d I said, stalling her hands before she could text Rob. \u201cThings fell apart before I could tell him, and now it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrittni, you have to tell him. He\u2019ll change his mind. I know he\u2019ll stick with you through this.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her incredulously. She had to be kidding. \u201cMelissa, he couldn\u2019t even stick it out because I wasn\u2019t quite myself lately. He was ready to call it quits because of a few broken dates and my moodiness this week. What in God\u2019s name makes you think he\u2019d stick with me over the next nine months and all the decisions we\u2019d have to make afterward? He threw away what we had when it was no longer fun for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to find out, honey. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be able to hide it,\u201d she said, patting my hand.</p><p>I looked at her without saying anything as mixed thoughts continued to race around my head.</p><p>\u201cBrittni?\u201d she asked, taking in my silence. \u201cAre you going to have it?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t answer her. I had no idea how I\u2019d ended up here. I didn\u2019t believe in abortion, but it wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d thought I would ever have to face. My views had always been black or white. If you were dumb enough to get pregnant, then you sucked it up and had the baby. If you couldn\u2019t handle the responsibility, there were thousands of couples out there dying to adopt. Suddenly, nothing appeared black and white anymore. Everything was gray and cloudy with no right answer. If I decided to have the baby, it would come after my junior year started. There was no way I could attend classes. I would lose my scholarship and everything else I had worked for, but the alternative made me ill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll support you no matter what you decide,\u201d Melissa said, placing an arm around my shaking shoulders. I wasn\u2019t even aware I was sobbing until I felt her arm around me.</p><p>Melissa sat up with me the entire night as I alternated between tears and staring off into space. She was uncharacteristically quiet with none of her usual glee anywhere to be found. My bleakness seemed to have sucked everything out of us both.</p><p>By the next morning I had no more tears left to cry. I moved lethargically through the day from a lack of sleep. Melissa\u2019s promise that Justin would come to his senses never surfaced. My phone remained silent as one day trickled into two and then bled into three days.</p> <p>Melissa stopped asking if I\u2019d heard from him by the end of the second day. I made her promise not to tell Rob, which I knew was selfish. Rob was Justin\u2019s best friend. By forcing her silence, I was making her compromise her own relationship. She never complained, even though I could see it was wearing on her judging by her lack of typical enthusiasm.</p><p>A full week after Justin and I broke up, I finally went to a walk-in clinic. I took a bus to the other side of town so no one would know me. The doctor was kind and understanding as she confirmed what I already knew. She gave me literature on my diet and sample packs of prenatal vitamins that she said were important for the baby. Discussing it with a doctor made everything seem much more real. My head spun as she continued on about stretch marks and birthing plans and the delivery. Through it all, I nodded like I was listening, but my mind was elsewhere. When I was ready to leave, she gave me a list of doctors to choose from that all took my insurance. Thrusting everything she handed me into my bag, I thanked her and fled from the clinic.</p><p>It took several blocks before I was able to digest everything the doctor had mentioned. It all seemed so final, like I had no choices. I began to feel caged in. Pulling my phone out, I reluctantly typed the one thing I never thought I would into the search engine. The map indicated the planned pregnancy clinic was two miles away. During the walk, I didn\u2019t allow myself to think about where I was headed. Instead, I filled my head with mundane thoughts as if this were any other day.</p><p>When I finally arrived at my destination, I stared at the nondescript building in front of me with morbid fascination. It was a far cry from what I would have pictured. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I had been expecting a seedy, drab building that could only be accessed through an equally dark and dreary alleyway. Not a place that could have housed something as normal as a real estate office. As a matter of fact, I checked the address one last time to make sure I was in the right spot. Pulling the door open, I nearly gasped when I saw the crowded waiting area. At least everyone inside seemed to have the same idea of remaining as inconspicuous as possible. I kept my eyes averted as I approached the long counter with one small window.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the middle-aged woman beyond the glass asked without looking up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to speak with someone,\u201d I said nervously.</p><p>\u201cSign in and we\u2019ll call you back in a while,\u201d she replied as she continued to type on her computer. \u201cMake sure you have payment ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I stammered, unsure of what I was doing here. I wasn\u2019t ready for this yet. I\u2019d just needed to make sure there were other options. \u201cCan I just have a pamphlet or something?\u201d I asked, finally able to form a coherent sentence.</p><p>\u201cOn the far wall between the bathrooms is all the literature you\u2019ll need,\u201d she said, still not looking up.</p><p>Thanking her for her limited help, I made my way to the wall of brochures. Without bothering to read any of their titles, I shoved one of each into my purse, not caring whether they were about STDs, safe sex, or options beyond abortion. The safe sex literature seemed a little like hindsight considering that if anyone in this room had practiced safe sex, none of us would be here now. Cramming the last of the brochures into my bag, I hurried from the building like a bank robber fleeing the scene of a crime. The anxiety I felt haunted me for several blocks as I moved as fast as my legs could muster. I wanted as much distance between the abortion clinic and me as possible. One thing I learned was that returning would be nearly impossible.</p><p>27.</p> <p>Present Day</p><p>4:17 PM</p><p>\u201cDid you ever consider the possibility that I would want to know?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d I sighed, pulling my bag to my lap. I held it tightly as if it could shield me from his questions.</p><p>\u201cBut you decided my opinion wasn\u2019t important enough, or maybe you knew I would talk you out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to tell you. That last date we had, when you accused me of being vacant, I\u2019d just taken the pregnancy test. I was going to tell you and then you were suddenly breaking up with me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes met his without flinching. I had provided one of the pieces from the puzzle of confusion. I could see him mentally sliding it into place. Because I knew him as well as I did, the remorse hidden behind his handsome features was evident, even if for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou had plenty of time to tell me after that day,\u201d he said stubbornly, not wanting to own up to his part in the blame game.</p> <p>\u201cReally? When exactly would that have been? The week after you broke up with me and never even bothered to call? I know you can\u2019t possibly be talking about Jacob\u2019s beer-pong party, where you spent half the night with Shelly sitting in your lap with her tongue crammed down your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call because I was fucking torn up. Your sudden disinterest in me felt like someone had reached into my chest and pulled out my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boo-hoo. So you didn\u2019t even bother trying to call? It had to be just about you, right? I wasn\u2019t disinterested. I was freaking out because I was pregnant, you moron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he stated quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have mattered. You should have stood by me. We\u2019d been dating for three months. You told me you loved me,\u201d I said, hating the way my voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you were getting ready to dump me. I was trying to save face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go. All you cared about was yourself. Are you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, the relationship thing was still new to me. Just like you. I was scared that you seemed to hold all the power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of it changes anything. You wanted to know why I never told you; well, now you see. You took yourself out of the equation the moment you tried to \u2018save face,\u2019\u201d I said, throwing his words back at him.</p><p>28.</p><p>March 2011</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Melissa asked, holding up the stack of brochures I\u2019d cleaned out of my bag after a week of ignoring them.</p><p>\u201cJust some stuff I picked up,\u201d I answered, taking them from her and shoving them in my bag.</p><p>Melissa looked troubled as she continued to study me. \u201cBrittni, what are you going to do? Are you going to get an abortion?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to answer her question. For almost a week I\u2019d been able to pretend everything was okay. I just needed time to sort through my feelings, and by ignoring the pamphlets I was almost successful. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mel. It\u2019s too much for me to think about right now,\u201d I answered, shoving my books into my bag for my afternoon classes.</p><p>\u201cYou have to make a decision soon, otherwise you won\u2019t have a decision to make,\u201d she logically pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI know. I have a few weeks to make up my mind. I just need a little more time,\u201d I said, ignoring her doubtful look as I headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d she muttered, looking unhappy.</p><p>Her words repeated themselves on a continuous loop in my head. I knew she was right. A decision had to be made. The idea of returning to the cold forbidding abortion clinic made my stomach turn. I just needed more time.</p><p>Classes passed much as they had for the last month. I meticulously took notes in each of them, since it was the only thing that seemed to distract my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brittni, wait up,\u201d a masculine voice called out as I headed back to my dorm later that afternoon.</p><p>Turning around, I saw Jacob Miller hurrying toward me.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re fast,\u201d he said, jogging over to me. \u201cHot date?\u201d</p><p>An ironic bubble of laughter erupted out of me in one quick gasp. \u201cHot date? Not unless you consider math equations hot,\u201d I answered, holding up my book.</p><p>Jacob laughed along with me before swallowing hard. \u201cI kinda heard through the rumor mill that you and Justin Avery called it quits.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened as I willed myself not to react to hearing Justin\u2019s name. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you and Justin knew each other,\u201d I commented, digging my nails into my hand so I would remain focused.</p><p>\u201cSure, we all go back. Anyway, I\u2019m throwing a party tonight and wanted to know if you\u2019d come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not really in the party mood,\u201d I hedged.</p><p>\u201cCome on. It\u2019ll do you good to let off some steam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to start dating again,\u201d I interjected, trying to let him down easy.</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s cool. You can come hang out.\u201d</p><p>I racked my brain for another excuse but came up empty. Partying was the last thing on my mind, but the idea of submerging myself in a loud environment had its perks. \u201cOkay, maybe I\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo maybes. Say you\u2019ll be there,\u201d Jacob persisted.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll be there for sure. Here, plug your address into my phone,\u201d I said, handing my cell over.</p><p>He grinned happily. I felt a twinge of guilt that he thought he stood a chance, but I\u2019d been honest with him. What else could I do?</p><p>\u201cSee you at eight,\u201d he said, handing my phone back before heading in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I answered, although I was lying. I was already second-guessing my impulsiveness. I had no business going to a party in my current state.</p><p>The rest of my afternoon was spent weighing the pros and cons of going to the party. One moment, I would decide not to go, and five minutes later, I would rationalize that although I was pregnant, that didn\u2019t mean I was dead. It was only after Melissa showed up to our room and accidentally let it slip that Justin had a date that I finally made up my mind. She apologized profusely for telling me, but I reassured her it was fine. It was just clarification that he wasn\u2019t there for me and probably never would be.</p><p>With my mind now made up, I grabbed my clothes and headed to the bathroom to get ready for Jacob\u2019s party. I was in the shower when Melissa knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I called out.</p><p>\u201cHey, so Rob and I are going to see that new scary movie that\u2019s supposed to be pretty decent. Do you want to go with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019m going to a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d she asked, sounding pleased.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You know Jacob Miller? It\u2019s his party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. You\u2019ve been cooped up in our room for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t felt like getting out much,\u201d I said, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Rob can set you up . . .\u201d She trailed off as I pulled the shower curtain aside to reveal my incredulous look.</p><p>\u201cUm, Mel, have you forgotten that I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, looking sheepish. \u201cI\u2019m such a ditz sometimes. I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could,\u201d I said wistfully, closing the shower curtain.</p><p>I could hear Melissa muttering under her breath about being an airhead before she closed the bathroom door behind her.</p><p>By the time I was finished in the bathroom, Melissa was already gone. I found another of her famous sticky notes on my dresser, apologizing for her \u201cairheadiness.\u201d I laughed at her made-up word. Despite everything going on in my life at the moment, I had to love Melissa. She was the one constant that kept me grounded. I didn\u2019t know what I would have done if I didn\u2019t have her to lean on.</p><p>Grabbing a pen, I scrawled a short return message, telling her not to be a dork, that I loved her \u201cairheadiness\u201d and all. I lugged my heavy book bag off the floor and dug around inside, trying to find my wallet. The pamphlets I had collected from the clinics made it damn near impossible to find anything, so I pulled them out. Sorting through them, I tossed anything dealing with STDs and safe sex into the trash can. In the end, I only kept three: one that provided a breakdown of the nine months of pregnancy, one that discussed adoption, and one about abortion. I couldn\u2019t help grimacing at the captions and pictures of the pregnancy pamphlet. I wasn\u2019t a wimp, but the idea of pushing a watermelon-sized human out of my body didn\u2019t sit well. The one picture that really twisted my guts into knots showed a glowing woman holding her newborn baby in her arms. For weeks I\u2019d refused to think about what was actually happening in my body and what I would have if I went through all nine months of pregnancy. Looking at the picture of the mother holding her baby, everything suddenly got real. In seven and a half months, that could be me. The idea frightened me to the core, but a small part of me couldn\u2019t help feeling awestruck at the idea. My life would never be the same if I kept the baby. Everything I had worked for would change in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Next, I opened the pamphlet dealing with adoption. It was nothing but testimonials by couples who claimed my child could be the miracle they so desperately wanted. I studied their faces critically. I could go that route. I could make a difference in someone\u2019s life. Maybe I could work it out with the school and not lose my scholarship. If I took summer classes, I could lighten my load in the fall when the baby would be due. It was at least worth checking into.</p><p>Feeling more in control than I had in weeks, I placed the pregnancy and abortion pamphlets in my bag. I debated pitching the abortion pamphlet but instead tossed it on my desk. I wasn\u2019t completely sure which route I would choose, and I could at least read over it when I got home.</p><p>I headed out for the party, ready to escape all the heavy decisions that seemed to be saturating the room. The walk to Jacob\u2019s apartment off campus was relatively short, and the place was easy enough to find by the noise level throbbing out of the building. I felt sympathetic to any of his neighbors who weren\u2019t invited to the party, although judging by the number of people littered throughout the hallway and into his apartment, it looked like the whole building was there.</p><p>Loud music made the floor beneath my feet vibrate as I looked around for Jacob. Pushing into his apartment through the wall of bodies was almost overwhelming. Someone I didn\u2019t even know handed me a red Solo cup filled to the brim with beer. My stomach turned as the smell of the beer wafted up. Trying not to breathe through my nose, I handed the cup to a willing stranger, who sucked it down like a parched survivor on a deserted island. To avoid any other alcohol handouts, I shoved my hands in my jacket pockets as I continued in vain to search for Jacob. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you in my sex education class?\u201d some guy slurred in my face. He grinned at me, obviously pleased with what he thought was a clever pickup line. Of course, all his charm left when he clutched my arm so he could remain upright.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I said, prying his fingers away from my bicep. I turned my back on him as I heard him use the same line on another girl, who giggled.</p><p>A new wave of bodies entered the apartment, making it harder to move. I was already beginning to regret my rash decision to attend the party. I hated tight spaces and I was beginning to reach my limit. A few of the faces around me looked vaguely familiar, but in truth, I really didn\u2019t know anyone here. Inching toward the door, I decided maybe I\u2019d crash Rob and Melissa\u2019s date since I wasn\u2019t in the mood to return to the dorm. I was scanning the room one last time for Jacob so I could tell him I was leaving when my eyes landed on a couple on the far side of the room.</p> <p>My heart stuttered as I took in the leggy blonde perched on the lap of the only guy to whom I had ever said I love you. I wanted to look away and yet, my eyes refused to move. I watched as Justin ran his hand up the back of her shirt, urging her closer so he could claim her lips. Stomach bile churned its way up my throat as I watched them play tonsil hockey for the world to see. No longer able to be in the same vicinity with him, I backed toward the door, not caring who I bumped along the way. My eyes never left the train wreck in front of me. It was as if I were witnessing a crime that I couldn\u2019t look away from. I was almost home free when the inevitable happened.</p><p>Maybe he sensed my presence, or maybe God just felt I needed to suffer a little more.</p><p>I was almost out the door when Justin broke the kiss and looked my way. Dozens of memories flooded me as my eyes clashed with the guy who had stolen my heart so completely. A flash of something I couldn\u2019t discern crossed his face before it was replaced by the cocky grin that had always driven me nuts. He wrapped his arms tightly around the leggy blonde, making it clear I had been replaced.</p><p>Flashing him a brittle smile to show I didn\u2019t care, I left the apartment without a backward glance. Each step I took was painful, like I was walking across broken pieces of my own heart.</p><p>I made my way through the crowd in the hallway, toward the stairs that led to the first floor. My mind was on autopilot as I willed back my tears. Crying in front of a bunch of strangers was not an option. The stairs were almost as busy as the hallway and I had to push past several jocks who were blocking the way. I was halfway down when they decided to show off their testosterone and started shoving each other. Before I could react, someone stumbled into me, making me pitch forward. Drunken hands reached out to steady me, but they grasped uselessly at thin air as the force of the shove sent me the rest of the way down the stairs.</p> <p>I hit the pavement hard, feeling all the pain to match. Several people gasped while more laughed as I landed in a heap at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, you totally fell down the stairs,\u201d a girl said, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d I muttered, sitting up embarrassed. Was there no end to my shame? I straightened my legs, fighting a string of curses as they protested. \u201cGreat,\u201d I said, grimacing at the holes in the knees of my jeans. From the few lights around the apartment building, I could see both knees were glossy with blood.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d the same girl asked, reaching a hand down to help me up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d I answered, grunting with pain when my scraped hand made contact with hers.</p><p>\u201cDo you need to go the hospital?\u201d she asked, looking concerned.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Thanks for helping me up since the asshole who pushed me down the stairs doesn\u2019t seem to care,\u201d I said in the direction of the offending idiot, who was still screwing around with his buddies.</p><p>\u201cGrant pushed you? What a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks for your help,\u201d I added as I started to shuffle away.</p><p>\u201cHey, wait. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I reassured her, even though each step I took made everything hurt. My knees seemed to have taken the brunt of my fall, but my left side felt tender to the touch, cluing me that I must have landed there also. Reflecting back on my fall at least got me home without any thoughts of Justin. It was only after I had maneuvered out of my ripped jeans and took stock of the large bruise on my left side that I finally allowed Justin to enter my mind again. I stepped into a hot shower, letting the water cascade over my stinging raw skin. Everything ran through my mind at once. Justin, the baby inside me, and the decisions I needed to make. My earlier optimism had faded and I was once again indecisive about what I wanted to do.</p><p>Switching off the water, I grabbed my towel and was in the process of drying when a sharp pain speared across my abdomen, making me gasp in pain. I clutched my stomach, and a moment later the pain was gone as fast as it had come on. For the first time since my fall, I thought about the baby. I rubbed my hand possessively over my stomach, which had only recently started to bulge. Nothing noticeable when my clothes were on, but something I could feel when I tried to button my jeans, which had gotten a little snug. I sat on the toilet seat lid for several moments, making sure the pain was truly gone and not coming back. After several pain-free minutes had passed, I carefully pulled on my yoga pants and shrugged into an oversized sweatshirt. Limping out of the bathroom, I climbed onto my bed and pulled my comforter up to my chin, placing my hands on my belly as if I could protect the fetus from any more harm.</p><p>Before I fell asleep, I reflected on what this sudden possessiveness meant for the life inside me. Did it mean I had ruled out abortion? Was I committing to carry the baby for another seven months? My hands on my belly made it clear I was already starting to care. I wondered if that was a good thing. Maybe I had waited too long to make my decision. I drifted asleep to the mental picture of a baby swaddled in blankets and cradled in my arms.</p><p>My thoughts carried through to my dreams, as they were filled with images of me carrying the baby to term and preparing for birth. In the dream I could sense my excitement as I lay in a hospital bed awaiting the baby\u2019s arrival. The scene abruptly changed and I was no longer in the same bed. Instead, I was on a sterile table with a doctor telling me they would take care of my problem. I tried to fight him, telling him I had changed my mind and wanted to have the baby. He ignored my pleas as two burly guys stepped in to restrain me. The doctor disappeared between my covered legs. I screamed in agony as his hands reached inside me.</p> <p>I woke screaming with cramps seizing my belly. Groaning in pain, I wrapped my arms around my stomach, instinctively knowing what was happening. The dampness between my legs was the only verification I needed. Fear ripped through me as I flipped on the light so Melissa could help me.</p><p>My heart dropped when I discovered Melissa\u2019s bed was empty. Not wanting to attract any attention, I reached for my phone and dialed the number for a cab company rather than call 911. The pain was steady and cramps continued to rip across my stomach as I struggled to gather my belongings. Shrugging into my heavy jacket, I headed out of my room to wait for the cab that would take me to the hospital.</p><p>The hours I spent at the hospital passed in a blur. A sympathetic doctor confirmed I had lost the baby. I watched with dry eyes as they gave me a local anesthetic and then performed a D&amp;C to remove any remaining tissue. That was how they referred to it. Tissue. As if the thing that had thrown my world completely out of whack had been nothing more than that. My eyes burned from the tears I refused to shed. After the procedure, I was placed in a curtained-off area where I could be observed for the next few hours until they released me.</p><p>I received a text around noon from Melissa, asking where I was, while a nurse checked me over one last time. I typed a hasty message telling her I was with the doctor. She fired back immediately asking if I was okay. The nurse was in the process of telling me what to expect over the next few days as my body adjusted to the loss of the baby. My phone chirped again, signaling another message from Melissa.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s my friend,\u201d I said as the nurse paused her instructions. I typed out a quick answer to Melissa, not even paying attention to what I had typed. The nurse waited while I finished and then continued giving me the list of things to watch for.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to text your friend and tell her you need a ride home,\u201d she said kindly as I listened to her instructions in a daze.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll call a cab. My friend doesn\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d rather you had someone with you for the next twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll meet me at my dorm,\u201d I promised, gathering my belongings.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she said skeptically.</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d I said, ready to leave. The knot in my throat from holding back my tears was to the point of becoming painful. An orderly wheeled me outside and helped me into the waiting cab. I needed to make it home and then I could cry. I was scared that if I started now, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop as I thought about how empty my body suddenly felt.</p><p>29.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>4:30 PM</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I was a chump,\u201d Justin admitted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t deserve to know you were pregnant. I should have had a say in some of the decisions. I know it\u2019s your body, and in the end you get the final say, but it was my baby too. I should have known about it before you got an abortion.\u201d</p><p>I felt his pain. I\u2019d lived with it for two years. I should have forced him to listen when I had the chance, but I let pride dictate my actions. I walked away, allowing Justin to believe the worst about me. Maybe I felt it was justice for me to bear the brunt of his accusations since I had contemplated abortion in the first place. It was only after I lost the baby that I realized I could never have gone through with it. I lost something I never realized I wanted until it was gone. Melissa had been heartbroken from the role she had played in the mix-up. She begged me to let her tell him the truth, but I swore her to secrecy. I told her if she cared for me, she would let it go.</p><p>Over the tough weeks following the miscarriage, Melissa continued to badger me to tell him the truth, but in the end, I tucked my tail between my legs and ran. Not only from my own pain, but from the destruction I had caused others.</p><p>30.</p><p>March 2011</p><p>Melissa was waiting outside when the cab dropped me off at my dorm. Clouds had moved in while I spent the morning at the hospital and a steady drizzle of moisture was falling from the sky. It seemed fitting that the sky appeared to be weeping.</p><p>\u201cI would have gone with you,\u201d Melissa greeted me as she helped me into our room, dripping wet.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I asked through chattering teeth as I worked to pull my wet clothes off so I could replace them with something dry.</p><p>\u201cI said I would have gone with you,\u201d she repeated, sounding hurt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You weren\u2019t here,\u201d I pointed out, climbing under my blankets.</p><p>\u201cYou could have waited for me,\u201d she accused, sounding a little miffed.</p><p>\u201cUm, no, I really couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to tell me you couldn\u2019t have scheduled it for a time when I could go with you?\u201d she said in a thick voice.</p><p>\u201cSchedule what?\u201d I began to understand. \u201cMelissa, I didn\u2019t get an abortion. Didn\u2019t you read my messages?\u201d I said, pulling out my phone to show her the text messages I sent.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. You said you were with the doctor in the first text, and in the second you said you weren\u2019t pregnant anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just assumed I . . .\u201d I cut myself off as I looked at my phone and saw she was right. Tears filled my eyes. \u201cWhen I typed the last message the nurse had been in the process of telling me what to expect after the miscarriage. You get that? My miscarriage. I was still kind of in a daze at the time. I wasn\u2019t really paying attention to what I was typing,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How?\u201d Melissa asked in a rush as she began to cry.</p><p>My tears made it difficult to answer.</p><p>\u201cI was knocked down the stairs at Jacob\u2019s party. I thought it was just my knees that got hurt,\u201d I told her, lifting the blanket to show her my legs, which the hospital had bandaged for me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Who the hell knocked you down a flight of stairs?\u201d she asked enraged.</p><p>\u201cSome asshat I don\u2019t even know,\u201d I answered. Melissa never left my side as I let my grief pour out. \u201cI just want to put it all behind me now,\u201d I sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m glad no one else knows. I\u2019m not sure I can handle being the subject of gossip and sympathy.\u201d</p><p>Melissa looked uncomfortable at my words.</p><p>\u201cYou told Rob,\u201d I said, knowing her well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Brittni. I was upset when I thought you went to get an abortion on your own. I thought you didn\u2019t need me,\u201d she said as she began to cry again.</p><p>\u201cOf course I need you. I was scared to death when I woke up and knew I was losing the baby and you weren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>She wailed harder at my words. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I betrayed your secret. I\u2019m the worst friend ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a second. Melissa, you\u2019re not saying what I think you are, right? Please tell me you didn\u2019t tell Rob I got an abortion.\u201d</p><p>She rushed to my side and grabbed my hand. \u201cI was upset. I called him without thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were upset? What about me? Oh my God, Melissa. Did he tell Justin?\u201d I asked, jerking my hand away.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe promised me he wouldn\u2019t say anything. Just to be sure, I\u2019ll call him and tell him I was wrong. I will fix everything, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you won\u2019t. Don\u2019t call anyone, don\u2019t fix anything. This is between me and Justin. When I want him to know, I will tell him. No one else,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Whatever you want. Please just forgive me,\u201d she pleaded, reaching for my hand again.</p><p>\u201cI do forgive you,\u201d I assured her, knowing part of this was my fault. \u201cJust please don\u2019t say anything to anyone, especially Justin. I would hate it if he felt responsible. I want to try to move on.\u201d</p><p>Melissa linked her fingers with mine, providing much-needed comfort.</p><p>\u201cThe irony is I pretty much decided last night I was going through with the pregnancy,\u201d I said as exhaustion from the last twelve hours caught up with me. I fell asleep with Melissa\u2019s head on my shoulder and my hand resting on my now-flat stomach.</p><p>I stayed in bed the rest of the weekend, and by Monday I was feeling marginally better. My body seemed to be bouncing back quicker than my state of mind. I was still feeling weak and gimping around with my road-rashed knees, but I knew missing class wasn\u2019t an option. Finals were just over a month away and I needed to ace all of them if I wanted to keep my GPA in my comfort zone. Melissa volunteered to walk me to my classes, but I declined her offer. I loved her dearly, but after a day and a half of her hovering over me, I needed a break. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was on my way to Smith Hall when a familiar voice called my name. I took a deep breath before turning to face Justin. Our eyes met and I was shocked at the hatred reflected in them.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I asked, worried that maybe his father had done something. \u201cIs it your dad?\u201d I asked, reaching out a hand to comfort him without thinking.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me, you lying selfish bitch,\u201d he said, shaking with rage. He jerked away like I was poisonous.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d I asked. If anyone should be angry at the other person, it should be me.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he shouted, drawing attention from everyone in the vicinity.</p><p>\u201cRob told you about the baby,\u201d I said as more of a statement. \u201cJustin, you don\u2019t understand. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Rob told me,\u201d he said, interrupting me. \u201cHow could you keep this from me?\u201d he snarled as the onlookers crowded around so they wouldn\u2019t miss a single detail.</p><p>\u201cWhose fault was that? You were acting like such an asshole, you never gave me the chance,\u201d I yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you were around. You were too busy hooking up with Shelly to care about the mess you left behind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hook up with Shelly. I took her to one party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, a party where you had your tongue crammed halfway down her throat.\u201d</p><p>He looked momentarily shocked at my words. \u201cSo I kissed another girl. That sure as hell doesn\u2019t give you the right to do something like this without telling me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? Last time I checked, you\u2019re not my father, and you have no right to tell me what I can or can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it concerns my baby, I deserve the right to know. What kind of selfish person aborts her baby without telling the father? How dare you take that right from me, you fucking bitch.\u201d</p><p>I recoiled at his words as everyone around us seemed to gasp at once. From the corner of my eye, I could see people snapping pictures with their phones. I\u2019m sure we were quickly reaching the timelines of every Facebook page on campus. My cheeks felt hot as I searched for the words to set him straight, but all I could focus on was the judgment on everyone\u2019s faces.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my body and my choice,\u201d I lashed out, ignoring the whispers and comments of the students around us.</p><p>\u201cYou are a heartless bitch,\u201d he said, with acid dripping from every word. \u201cIf I never lay eyes on you again, it will be too soon.\u201d</p><p>I acknowledged his words by turning my back on him and heading toward my dorm. It took all the strength I had to keep myself upright, walking past every stare and snicker until I was out of Justin\u2019s sight. My actions had caused a sea of hurt and misunderstandings. I could have set him straight and defended myself, but his eyes held me back. When I looked in them, I saw nothing but anger and hate. The kind of hate that is incapable of understanding. His intention today was clear. He was the judge and jury together, and I was already guilty in those eyes.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Melissa was devastated that Rob had spilled my secret to Justin. She begged me to let her set them both straight. I refused her pleas. I used guilt as a weapon, telling her the only way she could make it up to me was if she never mentioned the truth to either of them. I knew by the look on her face it was a low blow, but I stuck to my guns. She tried to wear me down over the next few weeks as my name rapidly circulated around school. Stares and whispers followed me everywhere I went, making it impossible to put the whole thing behind me. As the weeks progressed, my body recovered, but my will was completely broken. I was anxious for spring classes to end so I could leave. Without telling Melissa, I took the appropriate measures to transfer to a college closer to home for my junior and senior years. I wanted to leave everything behind and go where no one knew the half-truth about what happened.</p><p>31.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>4:37 PM</p> <p>\u201cI never got an abortion,\u201d I admitted. It was a relief to finally have the words out there.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Justin asked, jerking his head up.</p><p>\u201cI said, I didn\u2019t get an abortion. I lost the baby that night I saw you and Shelly together. Someone pushed me down the stairs at Jacob\u2019s apartment complex and I lost the baby,\u201d I said, willing my voice not to break. I had already cried so many times over the past two years that it seemed impossible that mentioning the baby would tear me up again.</p><p>He looked like he could vomit. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cIn the beginning I was going to tell you about the baby, and then everything seemed to fall apart. I was so scared, and I thought you had moved on. I figured it would muck things up even further if I told you before I made up my mind,\u201d I answered, standing up so I wouldn\u2019t feel so vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let me publicly shame you like that? Were you trying to be some kind of martyr?\u201d He stood also, sounding angrier than before.</p><p>\u201cGod, do you ever think before you speak?\u201d I snapped. \u201cSince you\u2019re so into the inquisition here, let me fire a few questions your way. Do you think it\u2019s possible that I was completely freaked out over the entire situation? Because you know, pregnancy can do that to a girl. What do you think my frame of mind was when I walked into a crowded room to find you with another woman? Then you shot me that fucking shit-ass grin when you saw me, and don\u2019t try to deny it. We both know what the hell you were doing. As for the public shaming, I had just gotten over a miscarriage, so I\u2019m sorry if I wasn\u2019t prepared to do battle with you in a public forum. I didn\u2019t say anything because you fucking screamed like a lunatic, announcing to everyone that I had aborted our baby. You think at that point I wanted to give you the satisfaction of knowing the truth when you had ripped my heart out and stomped on it in front of everyone? I lost our baby in a painful miscarriage, but even if I had done the awful thing you accused me of, yelling it across campus would still have been wrong. You should have come to me,\u201d I said, exhaling the last bit of breath from my tirade.</p><p>Justin stood in silence, recovering from the bomb I had dropped on him.</p><p>\u201cI was mad,\u201d he said quietly as his shoulders drooped.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I was hurt,\u201d I countered. \u201cNot only that, I had to leave to get away from what you did. You turned me into the martyr, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have handled it better,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that because you now know all the facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it. I\u2019ve known for years what I did was wrong. Hell, I knew while I was doing it, but I was like a rogue wave out of control.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I could understand that part.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me later? Why did you allow me to continue to think the worst of you?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, thinking about the question before I answered it. \u201cI guess at the time I felt like I deserved it. Abortion was one of the options I considered. When you were yelling at me, it almost made everything a little bit better. I was so sad after the miscarriage. You yelling at me shifted the pain away from the loss of the baby to something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were sad?\u201d he asked, joining me on my side of the elevator.</p><p>\u201cIt broke my heart when I lost our baby,\u201d I said thickly. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how badly I wanted it until I lost it,\u201d I answered as one lone tear trickled down my cheek.</p><p>Justin reached out tentatively and captured the tear with his thumb. \u201cYou wanted our baby?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, transfixed on his hand, which slowly moved away from my face.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t touch me,\u201d I whispered. I wasn\u2019t ready for physical contact after everything we had exposed.</p><p>He nodded and dropped his hand but remained standing in front of me. I could see the questions on his face, and I mentally prepared myself for them. Stepping away from him, I sank back down to the floor as the rest of the adrenaline left me. Instead of heading back to the opposite side of the elevator, Justin slid down the wall so he was sitting right beside me.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me everything,\u201d he said after we had sat in silence for several minutes.</p><p>His words opened a floodgate in me and for the next forty-five minutes I confessed everything. Some of it brought back raw emotions and I had to knuckle away a steady stream of tears. Halfway through, he reached over to hold my hand, ignoring my request that he couldn\u2019t touch me. I described how awful the miscarriage was, not sugarcoating anything. At times, his grip on my hand tightened to where it was almost painful, and yet through it all he never released it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you wait so long to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured it wouldn\u2019t make a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake a difference? Brittni, do you know how hard it was for me to hate you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made it look pretty easy,\u201d I answered dryly as he let out a low chuckle.</p><p>\u201cHating you made the fact that you didn\u2019t trust me less painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did trust you at first, but then I was scared after you broke up with me. Everything was so confusing and you weren\u2019t making it any easier. You were being such an a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI was being an asshole,\u201d he sighed, rubbing his hand across his head. \u201cI let my insecurities get the best of me and I threw our relationship away. Why did I have to be such a jackass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were confused. I was acting like a complete zombie.\u201d I found myself comforting him.</p><p>\u201cSo what? You had every reason to be a zombie. I confirmed all your fears by dropping you the second things changed. No wonder you hate me so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you. You were the love of my life, the father of my unborn child. I couldn\u2019t have hated you if I tried. Believe me, I did try. My friend Tressa had to step up and hate you enough for both of us,\u201d I joked through a watery smile.</p><p>\u201cOne day I\u2019ll have to thank her for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor hating you?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cFor being there for you when I wasn\u2019t. For being your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s pretty fantastic in that category. I\u2019ve been lucky that way. Melissa and Rob are pretty fantastic too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know all the bonehead things I\u2019ve done?\u201d Justin grimaced.</p><p>\u201cMelissa does. She was never supposed to tell Rob, but I suspect he knows, considering he tried to get us together today,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t knock some sense into me,\u201d Justin said as the floor beneath us shuddered slightly before starting to move. \u201cHot damn, we\u2019re moving,\u201d he said, surging to his feet and pulling me in for an excited hug.</p><p>Though my excitement matched his, I couldn\u2019t help stiffening in his arms, unsure of how to react. A lot of shit had gone down between us in the nearly six hours we\u2019d been stuck together. Just because we\u2019d cleared the air didn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t have a whole lot of baggage and past hurt bogging us down.</p><p>Whether he felt my resistance or sensed the doors getting ready to open, Justin abruptly dropped his arms as the doors parted to reveal a crowd of people, including Melissa and Rob.</p><p>Melissa rushed forward and gave me a tight hug. \u201cDo you want to kill Rob? I could hold him down so you can at least get a good sock in,\u201d she whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, I just have to use the bathroom really bad,\u201d I said, dragging her along with me.</p><p>\u201cIn Rob\u2019s defense, he didn\u2019t know you two would somehow end up on the same elevator, let alone an elevator that would break down,\u201d Melissa chattered away as I hurried to one of the stalls. \u201cWas it awful? I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Melissa continued.</p><p>Knowing Melissa as well as I did, I knew no comment was necessary at the moment. I stayed in my stall longer than needed so I could gather my mixed emotions. Having spent the last six hours with Justin with no more secrets between us made me feel jittery like I\u2019d consumed heavy doses of caffeine in a short amount of time.</p><p>\u201cBrittni, are you okay?\u201d Melissa asked, standing right outside my stall door.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I muttered, opening the door. \u201cSo, how did you find out I was here anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob fessed up when the building operator called and told him his two visitors were stuck in the elevator. After the first hour, he called me, figuring I\u2019d need to protect him from you once the elevator started moving again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d he do it, Mel? Did he think forcing Justin and me to have lunch together would suddenly right everything between us?\u201d I asked, washing my hands.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s been pretty upset since I told him what really happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, you swore you\u2019d never tell,\u201d I chastised her, placing my hands on my hips.</p><p>\u201cAu contraire, my dear. I swore I\u2019d keep your secret as long as he was my boyfriend. As soon as Rob proposed, he no longer fit in that category.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re going with the technicality clause?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cLook, I was never comfortable keeping it a secret,\u201d she said, placing her own hands on her shapely hips. \u201cI did it at the time because I felt so damn bad about my part in everything that went down. It was a bad situation. But just so you know, I never agreed with the idea of you bearing the brunt of it. What Justin did to you in the courtyard was a shitty thing and wouldn\u2019t have happened without my big mouth. I needed Rob to know the truth,\u201d she added defensively.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I said, smiling at her astonished look.</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought you would be ready to kill Rob and me by the time you made it off the elevator. I remember you hated elevators and was sick that you were cooped up in one for hours, with your ex no less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, it got hairy there for a while, but I worked it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Justin? Did he give you the silent treatment the whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWe kinda worked some things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Melissa squealed, making me cringe as a couple of women looked our way.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d I said as the bathroom door opened. \u201cWe did, but let\u2019s not make a big deal about it. I\u2019m not even sure where we go from here. Maybe we\u2019ll be friends, maybe not, but at least we don\u2019t hate each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. I\u2019m so excited,\u201d she said, bouncing up and down.</p><p>\u201cMel, chill,\u201d I ordered as we headed out of the bathroom together.</p><p>We found the guys waiting for us in the lobby. \u201cSo, we kinda thought we\u2019d skip visiting my office and maybe grab some grub,\u201d Rob said, eyeing me sheepishly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Melissa teased, wrapping an arm around Rob, who was still eyeing me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me,\u201d I answered, throwing Rob a bone. I\u2019m sure the hours he spent wondering what the inside of that elevator would look like when it opened was punishment enough.</p><p>\u201cI was dying,\u201d Rob said, holding his hand on his chest. \u201cLet\u2019s head out.</p> <p>\u201cYou let him off easy,\u201d Justin whispered out of the side of his mouth as he walked beside me.</p><p>\u201cI distinctly remember hearing someone threaten to kick his ass as soon as we were free from our steel cage. I guess my eyes are playing tricks on me because he looks pretty unscathed at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m biding my time,\u201d Justin replied, flashing me his trademark grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m parked over here, guys,\u201d Rob called, standing beside a silver SUV that screamed adult.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d want to sit up front,\u201d he told Justin, slapping him on the back.</p> <p>\u201cSure, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Justin said, shooting me a look before climbing into the front seat of the vehicle.</p><p>The ride to the restaurant was loud as Rob and Melissa peppered us with questions about our confined time together on the elevator. Strangely, Justin stayed as closemouthed about what had transpired as I did. After a few minutes of trying, they both graciously surrendered as Melissa launched into a detailed description of the engagement party the next night.</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to keep it fun, so we decided to do a themed karaoke party,\u201d Melissa gushed, ignoring the look Justin and I exchanged as I tried not to snicker.</p><p>\u201cUm, karaoke?\u201d I asked, wondering if Melissa had missed the memo where karaoke was no longer cool.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ms. Doubting Thomas, karaoke. I know it\u2019s not the fad anymore, which is why I want to do it. I\u2019m going to help it make a comeback. The kicker is that everyone has to pick a song that best describes Rob and me. Right, babe?\u201d she said, looking at Rob for approval.</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he said, shooting her the same indulgent smile over his shoulder that I remembered from two years ago. I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or applaud the fact that Melissa still had him hooked so completely.</p> <p>\u201cKaraoke,\u201d I repeated, trying to wrap my brain around the idea as Rob pulled into a crowded parking lot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I called ahead,\u201d Rob reassured us as we piled out of the car.</p><p>\u201cGood man,\u201d Justin said, falling in step with me as we headed into the restaurant together.</p><p>I tried to sort through how I felt about Justin no longer looking at or talking to me with animosity. For a brief moment, I could almost make myself believe we were all together back at school on a double date. In reality, though, nothing was the same, and I was setting myself up by trying to remember the old days. As we made our way to our table, I maneuvered myself so Melissa and Rob were on either side of me, hoping the buffer would help clear the rest of my mind. What I hadn\u2019t counted on was that Justin would be sitting directly across from me. Throughout the meal, I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes from finding his time and time again. Each time I looked, he was watching me with the same hooded expression that was hard for me to decipher.</p><p>Being thrown off by what his looks meant put me in constant catch-up mode on the conversation. After having to ask Melissa to repeat herself three times, I finally lied and said that the trauma of being trapped all day had obviously frazzled my brain. I would rather bite out my tongue than confess what the real issue was, especially when I didn\u2019t know myself. I was having a hard time figuring out if Justin was being cordial because Rob and Melissa were there or because he\u2019d finally forgiven me and was ready to be friends. If it was the latter, I was unsure how that made me feel. Did I want his friendship? That was the question. That and whether I had forgiven him for the part he\u2019d played.</p><p>Regardless, I was able to get through the meal without mishap. Dinner stretched into drinks that helped mellow my frazzled nerves. By the time Rob drove back to his office so Melissa and Justin could pick up their cars, I felt much more in control. I was able to relax as I climbed into the car with Melissa after giving Rob a hug and shooting Justin a smile.</p><p>32.</p><p>Present Day</p> <p>I woke the next morning in my hotel room, feeling better than I had in two years. Lying in bed, I allowed myself the luxury of enjoying the moment. Maybe now, once and for all, I could finally put the past behind me. I knew I\u2019d never forget about the baby, but maybe I could let go of some of the grief.</p><p>My phone chimed, letting me know I had a text message. I smiled when I saw it was from Tressa, yelling at me for not returning all her texts from the previous day. Instead of trying to text all the drama from the day before, I dialed her number. It took more than an hour to fill her in on everything that had transpired. She huffed and cursed her way through how Rob had tricked me but laughed hysterically when she heard about the elevator getting stuck. She grew quiet as I explained everything that had gone down with Justin.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d she asked when I finally ran out of steam.</p><p>\u201cRelieved, but I still feel like a Mack truck ran over my chest. You know how I hate to talk about everything that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still a total asshole for what he did to you. He\u2019s lucky I never flew there. Otherwise, he\u2019d be dickless now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s different now. Harder, I guess. I think the whole situation changed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re different too. He made you go through a tough-ass situation all alone,\u201d Tressa snipped, not ready to give up her grudge against him.</p><p>\u201cI know. Believe me, I let that be known. Now, tell me what\u2019s going on there. How did Ashton\u2019s first date go with Panty Dropper?\u201d</p><p>Tressa laughed at my question. \u201cJust put it this way, luck has not been on their side. The first night they went out, Mr. Hot Voice ended up in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I laughed as Tressa filled me in on all the details surrounding our friend Ashton\u2019s disastrous attempts at a one-night stand. Tears of mirth rolled down my face when she told me about Ashton taking a nosedive on her bedroom floor right before her date. Then he walked in on her with her panty-covered butt in the air.</p><p>\u201cPoor Ashton,\u201d I said, wiping the tears from my cheeks from laughing so hard. \u201cI wish I were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You\u2019re too busy shacking up with your ex to miss us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shacking up with him,\u201d I denied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time. The hard edge you used to have when you talked about him is missing from your voice. Just don\u2019t let the asshole hurt you again, or I\u2019ll overcome my fear of flying and drown him in the Pungent Sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuget Sound,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You knew what I meant, and you catch my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but you have nothing to worry about. The only thing that happened yesterday is that Justin and I finally have no secrets and now we can move on. Who knows, maybe we can even be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTranslation of \u2018friends\u2019 for you: He\u2019s so dreamy. Translation of \u2018friends\u2019 for him: I can\u2019t wait to stick it in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be crude, and you\u2019re so wrong,\u201d I denied.</p><p>\u201cJust be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Trust me, nothing is going to happen.</p><p>Tressa mumbled something I couldn\u2019t quite catch but loosely sounded like I needed a hard smack to the side of the head.</p><p>I ignored her mumblings and told her to text me updates on Ashton and Panty Dropper before hanging up. Checking the time on my phone, I cringed when I realized I had less than half an hour until Melissa would be arriving to pick me up. I hastily plugged my cell into the charger, since talking to Tressa had drained the battery. I was applying my makeup ten minutes later when a knock at my door told me Melissa was early. \u201cShit,\u201d I said, wrapping one of the minuscule towels from the bathroom around my torso before heading to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little early,\u201d I griped as I pulled open the door. It wasn\u2019t Melissa. Justin\u2019s broad frame was standing in front of me. Yelping with dismay, I clutched what little towel there was before glancing down to make sure it was covering all the appropriate areas. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I stuttered out.</p><p>\u201cMelissa got called in to work for some paperwork fiasco, so I volunteered to pick you up so we can meet her and Rob for lunch,\u201d he answered, entering my room without waiting for an invitation. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d he asked, sitting on the edge of my bed.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure,\u201d I answered, trying not to sound flustered, even though he was sitting on my bed. For some reason, it felt oddly intimate. Old memories, I\u2019m sure. \u201cI just have to get dressed,\u201d I answered, pawing through my suitcase in a mad attempt to find something that would cover me better than my towel.</p><p>\u201cI figured. Towels are so out in the fashion industry,\u201d he teased.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to respond. Sure, during dinner last night I\u2019d seen him open up more, showing me that some of the guy I once knew was still there, but I chalked it up to the fact that Rob and Melissa had been there as a buffer. He wasn\u2019t flirty like the old Justin, but he was at least friendly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I said, clutching my clothes in front of me and backing up to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cNo hurry. We still have a while until we have to meet Melissa and Rob,\u201d he answered.</p><p>I sagged against the door once it was closed. Having Justin in my room was enough to send my blood pressure through the roof.</p><p>I pulled on my panties and jeans with jittery fingers, telling myself it was fine that he was here. Once my pants were in place, I felt a little more comfortable now that I wasn\u2019t completely naked. That is, until I reached for my bra, only to realize I\u2019d left it in my suitcase. Biting back a groan of frustration, I weighed my alternatives. I could walk out there in my jeans with the towel wrapped around my chest or I could put on my shirt and walk out to get my bra. Neither option seemed ideal. Knowing Justin as well as I used to, he would definitely think this was a \u201ccheck me out\u201d ploy. I was screwed either way.</p><p>After a full two minutes of weighing the pros and cons, I decided to go with option B. Of course, it was only after I was pulling on my shirt that I realized I had grabbed a fitted T-shirt that hugged my curves. Sighing at the look I was sporting, I left the bathroom with my arms crossed over my chest as I tried to keep the front of my body angled away from Justin.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just about ready,\u201d I said, not wanting to make a further spectacle of myself by sprinting the last few feet to my open suitcase, where my bra was dangling halfway out. I maneuvered my body so the suitcase was no longer in Justin\u2019s line of vision. Reaching a hand out, I snatched the offending undergarment into my hand, which turned out to be a bad idea since it was snagged on something in my suitcase. My hard tug made it come free with a loud snapping sound as it whacked me in the face.</p><p>I silently mumbled a string of curses, trying to control my watering eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay there?\u201d Justin asked, sounding like he was trying to suppress laughter. It was at that moment I looked up from my suitcase and met Justin\u2019s reflective stare in the mirror. His eyes were filled with merriment as I clutched the bra in my closed fist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I answered, ignoring the fact that I was now sporting a welt on my forehead. I tried to remain aloof as I kept my chin up and stalked to the bathroom with my lips twitching. Closing the door behind me, I could hear Justin\u2019s chuckles and I couldn\u2019t help laughing at myself. I finished getting ready and before I knew it, we were leaving the room together. My heart skipped when he led me past the elevators toward the flight of stairs. Usually, I requested a ground-floor room, but the hotel had been almost completely booked at the time I checked in. Last night I had gladly hoofed it up the four floors to my room. Seeing Justin bypass the elevators played with my emotions.</p><p>We took our time walking down the stairs, exchanging the typical pleasantries. It felt awkward considering our history, but it was better than fighting. We exhausted the topic of weather after the first flight of stairs and Rob and Melissa\u2019s engagement party the rest of the way down.</p><p>Everything stood still for me as Justin stopped in front of an achingly familiar vehicle.</p><p>\u201cYour jeep,\u201d my voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cI figured since there was a break in the rain, I\u2019d celebrate by taking off the roof and doors. I hope you don\u2019t mind?\u201d he asked. Based on the small smile on his face, he knew I would approve.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, climbing into the vehicle. I kept my face neutral, although emotionally I was soaring.</p><p>Justin cranked the jeep, and it was as loud as I remembered. Within minutes, we were able to leave the city behind. The wind whipped around, stinging my face with familiarity. I was enjoying the ride so much it took ten minutes before I thought to question our destination.</p><p>\u201cI figured we\u2019d take the scenic route,\u201d Justin yelled over the wind.</p><p>It felt like taking a trip to the past. My mind became flooded with memories and images of the good times we had shared. We were half an hour out of the city when Justin pulled onto an embankment and whipped a U-turn. The tires spun out on the gravel before gripping the road, taking us back in the direction we\u2019d just come from. I didn\u2019t comment, figuring he was a bit turned around. Thirty minutes later, he pulled into the parking lot of a restaurant less than a block from my hotel.</p><p>\u201cScenic route, huh?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was scenic for me,\u201d he answered softly.</p><p>Pulling down the visor, I inspected my reflection, startled by how happy I looked. It had been a long time. Two years, to be exact. I remembered my conversation with Tressa and wondered if I was setting myself up for heartache.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d Melissa greeted us outside the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cWe took the long way,\u201d I said, nodding toward Justin.</p><p>Melissa returned a questioning look before speaking up. \u201cOh, well, come on. Rob\u2019s already inside.\u201d</p><p>We found Rob sitting at a booth and before I could react, Melissa slid in next to him. I stood for a moment, eyeing the empty side of the booth across from them.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to slide in first?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>\u201cHuh, oh yeah,\u201d I giggled, trying to play off the awkwardness as a joke. I could handle this. We had just ridden next to each other in his jeep. Of course, we had bucket seats with a gearstick separating us, but technically it was the same thing, right? I could almost picture Tressa snorting at my reasoning.</p><p>\u201cIs everything ready for tonight?\u201d Justin asked, draping his arm along the back of our booth. I shifted in my seat, rubbing the goose bumps that had popped up along my arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think so. Brittni and I have an appointment set at the salon while you guys do all the heavy setup,\u201d Melissa bragged.</p><p>\u201cOh, so let me get this straight, we get the grunt work while you two get pampered?\u201d Rob mocked.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight, but you\u2019ll reap the benefits when my nails and hair are all pretty,\u201d she said, running her fingers seductively over his bicep.</p> <p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d Rob answered, dipping a tortilla chip into the salsa the waitress had set down.</p><p>\u201cOh brother,\u201d I muttered, rolling my eyes dramatically.</p><p>Justin laughed outright.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Melissa asked confused.</p><p>\u201cYou getting out of work by insinuating your nails will somehow benefit Rob,\u201d I answered.</p> <p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019d rather lug around tables and chairs all afternoon?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHell no, but I\u2019m not too shy to tell the guys flat-out they\u2019re doing the grunt work.\u201d I smirked, dipping my own chip.</p><p>Justin and Rob both laughed, while Melissa looked insulted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be on my side here. Not three against one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, Mels,\u201d I answered, patting her hand.</p><p>After the waitress took our orders, the conversation floated from one topic to the next. We discussed our jobs, or job-in-waiting in my case. Melissa had lucked out and found a job as an assistant to an assistant.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t get a permanent spot at your school in Woodfalls?\u201d Rob asked me.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to commute to whatever school I can find a position at, or just move there. Hopefully it\u2019s a moot point since one of the older teachers is supposed to be retiring soon and her position is basically mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the grade you want?\u201d Melissa asked, digging into her enchilada.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take what I can get initially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer. Maybe you should move back here. I know Melissa would love to have her best friend closer,\u201d Rob commented.</p><p>Without looking at Justin, I was well aware that the statement had stopped him in midbite. Melissa looked at Rob with a mixture of horror and exasperation as her eyes darted between Justin and me.</p><p>\u201cHon, stop kicking me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m suggesting something ridiculous. Justin and Brittni are no longer enemies, so why shouldn\u2019t she move back to Seattle?\u201d he asked, seeing nothing wrong with his logic.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have a life back home, Rob. I can\u2019t just up and leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you have the job you want and a home you like to go to every night?\u201d he quizzed.</p><p>\u201cWell, not yet, but there are other things in Woodfalls,\u201d I said, very much aware that Justin and Melissa had given up all pretenses of eating while Rob drilled me.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Rob asked, unconcerned, as he took a big bite of his taco.</p><p>\u201cMy mom and friends, for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you and your mom are close now?\u201d His ploy for nonchalance was broken when Melissa kicked him hard enough for all of us to hear.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not dumb, so you can stop kicking him, Melissa, before you do permanent damage,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible for me to pack up and move across the country right now just because Justin no longer thinks I\u2019m Satan\u2019s mistress,\u201d I added. It sounded harsher than I intended, but Rob had forced me into a defensive posture. Justin\u2019s only response was to start eating again.</p><p>Melissa looked like she wanted to comment but said nothing. An awkward silence settled over our table that lasted through the rest of the meal. I felt bad that I had ruined the mood, but Rob had backed me into a corner. Relieved when the check came, I was the first to slide out of the booth after we paid.</p><p>Once we were outside, I waited by Melissa\u2019s car while she kissed Rob good-bye. I had the distinct feeling she was still ribbing him for drilling me by the way they both glanced my way. I acted ignorant while I checked my phone for missed messages. I had several texts from Tressa with more Ashton updates. I was smiling as I read them when Melissa joined me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked as we climbed in her car.</p><p>\u201cMy friend Ashton is having a string of bad luck with this guy she\u2019s dating,\u201d I answered, filling her in on poor Ashton\u2019s mishaps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Rob back there,\u201d she finally said after I finished.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I know my life isn\u2019t going the way I thought it would be at this point, but I don\u2019t want it rubbed in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh honey, he wasn\u2019t rubbing your face in it. We all just want you back for selfish reasons. I know you have a new life back home, but I\u2019ve really missed you. Rob is just trying to make me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Things aren\u2019t as easy as they were when we were in college. We have to weigh every decision we make now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true,\u201d Melissa said, pulling into the parking lot of a very posh-looking day spa.</p><p>\u201cWow, extravagant much?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cHey, you only get to celebrate your engagement once,\u201d she pointed out as we walked up the discreet path that was hidden from the road with high hedges. \u201cNow, no more blah talk. It\u2019s time for some of the finest pampering you\u2019ll ever get.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, I had to agree with her. I was waxed, buffed, and polished, and practically glowed by the time we were done. Melissa drove me back to my hotel and promised to be back in an hour to pick me up for the party. I opened my garment bag in my room and extracted the black cocktail dress I had bought specifically for the engagement party. Tressa had helped pick it out. At the time, we both had one goal: Get a dress that would make Justin regret ever walking away. Of course, things were different after being stuck in the elevator together, and I couldn\u2019t help wondering now if the dress was too much. It wasn\u2019t too short since it fell at my knees, but it definitely hugged and accentuated my body in the most flattering way possible. Pulling the dress on, I wished the open back weren\u2019t quite so revealing, but I had no other options. Especially since in our juvenile thinking, Tressa and I had also shunned the idea of adding a shawl, feeling it would take away from the dress. After touching up my makeup and redoing my hair in a twist, I slipped on my black two-inch heels and was ready to go. I grabbed my small handbag and left the safety of my room behind before I could change my mind.</p><p>I waited in the lobby, deflecting the attention of two businessmen who looked old enough to be my father when Melissa pulled up. Saying my good-byes to the two creepers, I hastily left before either of them could hit on me again.</p><p>\u201cMaking plans for later?\u201d Melissa teased as I climbed into the car. \u201cYou look amazing,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d I said, taking in her pale pink dress that complemented her blond hair and blue eyes. \u201cCan you believe that? One of them even had on a wedding ring. Seriously? Men can be pigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth,\u201d Melissa said, pulling away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cSo, where\u2019s your party being held?\u201d I asked, feeling like a complete ass that I just now thought to ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in an old warehouse that they refaced last year. It\u2019s now the happening place to have parties. Rob does business for the owner, so we were able to get it for a steal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome,\u201d I said, watching the sights out the window as we drove. It was hard not to think about how much I loved and missed this city. Even though I had thrown a wrench in Rob\u2019s questioning earlier, I had been unable to shake his words. Two years ago, I let something drive me away from the one place that had totally resonated with me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Melissa asked, pulling into a dirt lot behind a large industrial warehouse.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like a warehouse,\u201d I said, climbing from the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a baby. The transformation is on the inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding. It looks great.\u201d</p><p>Melissa nodded, leading me to the oversized door that was standing wide open. We entered the dim space together and I was instantly taken. The interior was rugged and chic at the same time. There was a stage set back in the far corner of the building. A large glazed concrete dance floor sat directly in front of it, bordered with high tables and plush bar stools. The floor surrounding the dance area was a rich dark wood that had been polished to a high shine. The opposite side of the building held low couches grouped together to form intimate seating areas away from the music. The overall feel of the space screamed classy. What drew me in the most were the interior walls. I marveled at the intricate artwork painted across the entire room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s phenomenal, huh?\u201d Melissa asked, following my gaze along the painted wall. Her question left no doubt that Justin was the artist behind the masterpiece I was viewing.</p><p>\u201cHe always has been,\u201d I answered, turning as the guys entered through a set of swinging doors that were hidden on the far side of the room.</p><p>Rob let out a low whistle when he saw Melissa. \u201cBabe, you look great,\u201d he said, taking her hand and pulling her in for a long kiss.</p><p>\u201cSo, the grunt labor was worth it while I got beautified?\u201d I heard her murmur as he sealed his lips to hers again.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Justin said to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I answered, feeling my face blush. It had been so long since he looked at me this way, and yet it felt like not a single day had passed. \u201cYou don\u2019t look half bad yourself,\u201d I answered, taking in the well-cut suit he was wearing.</p><p>\u201cThis old thing?\u201d he joked, leading me to the bar, where several cocktail waitresses were making last-minute preparations.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cOld, my foot,\u201d I said, looking up at him with a smile that faltered when I saw the pained expression on his face. I immediately regretted dropping my guard. We were forging a tentative friendship, but it seemed we had a long road ahead.</p><p>I turned away to gather myself while I asked the bartender for my favorite cocktail, hoping to settle my nerves.</p><p>I could hear Justin clearing his throat like he had a tickle before he broke the silence. \u201cIs that dress backless?\u201d he choked out.</p><p>Accepting my drink from the bartender, I raised it to my lips, which were curved in a satisfied smile. Any doubts I might have had about the dress were put to rest. \u201cIs that wrong?\u201d I replied, taking another sip of my drink.</p><p>\u201cDepends how many guys you\u2019re trying to send to the hospital for heart failure tonight,\u201d he said, ordering a scotch neat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty modest,\u201d I pointed out, turning to look at him.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you call modest, I\u2019d love to see your version of pretentious,\u201d he stated, taking a long drink.</p><p>\u201cAre you hitting on me?\u201d I asked as the alcohol loosened my tongue. We were both playing with fire, but I didn\u2019t care. The truce we had established the day before seemed to give us the permission to pick up where we left off two years ago, before our relationship had gone to hell.</p><p>\u201cWould that be a problem?\u201d he asked, taking my elbow and guiding me toward one of the intimate seating sections.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I answered honestly, lowering myself to one of the sofas. \u201cPeople will probably think we\u2019re crazy, and my friend Tressa would most likely have serious issues with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you care what they think?\u201d he asked quietly, taking another drink of his scotch.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just looking out for me. Especially Tressa. She knows how rough these last two years have been.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, contemplating my words. I couldn\u2019t help wondering if my candidness would scare him off. For a brief moment, I panicked and wished I could retract what I had said, but rightfully, secrets and misunderstandings had torn us apart before. It was time to put those days behind us and start with honesty.</p><p>He raised his drink to his lips, downing the rest of the contents while never taking his eyes off mine. In that moment, he made it clear he wouldn\u2019t be scared off. A shiver of anticipation raced through me.</p><p>33.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>Thirty minutes later, I was standing with Rob and Melissa as their guests began to arrive. More than a few of them I recognized from UW. Thankfully, even though they looked surprised to see me, they focused their attention on the engaged couple. I was amazed at how quickly the room filled with people.</p><p>Taking to the role of proper hosts, Melissa and Rob circulated the building, making sure they mingled with everyone. I had lost Justin in the crowd shortly after everyone started to show up and told myself it was probably for the best. We were playing a risky game, and taking time to figure things out was the smart thing to do. With that in mind, I forced myself to mingle with a few people I had been friendly with at UW. I was in the process of catching up with a few girls from school when a set of skinny arms crushed me into a hug.</p><p>\u201cBrittni,\u201d the hugger squealed with adolescent glee.</p><p>\u201cHollie, you\u2019re all grown up,\u201d I said, taking in the preteen in front of me, who was at least a head taller. \u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she answered, twirling around so I could admire the full skirt. \u201cI\u2019m so excited you\u2019re here. Come see Mom and Trav,\u201d she said, pulling me away.</p><p>I threw an apologetic look at my old friends as Hollie dragged me across the room. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were going to be here,\u201d I told her, happily sliding an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cRob had to invite us. Mom\u2019s been like a second parent to him almost his whole life. She wouldn\u2019t have tolerated a non-invite,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>I grinned at her logic. That sounded like the Trish I remembered. My grin spread to a full-fledged smile when Travis spotted me and squealed much like Hollie had. His hug was every bit as exuberant, and I found myself returning it fondly. It dawned on me at that moment that except for the drunken hug my friend Ashton had given me a few days prior to my Seattle trip, it had been two years since anyone had really hugged me. I forgot how much I had grown to like the hugs from this particular family.</p><p>\u201cTravis, you look absolutely dashing. How does it feel to be a college man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d he said, smiling broadly.</p><p>\u201cBrittni, it\u2019s so good to see you,\u201d Trish said as Travis finally released me.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Trish,\u201d I said, stepping in to give her a tentative hug. She surprised me by pulling me in tightly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered in my ear before releasing me. Tears shone brightly in her eyes and I knew Justin had told her about the baby.</p><p>\u201cHe told you?\u201d I asked as Hollie and Travis rushed over to talk to someone else they knew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe came over last night to talk. I always wondered what drove you two apart. I never realized,\u201d she trailed off. \u201cHad I known, I would have helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he never told you. I assumed all of you would hate me like he had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I would have never judged you,\u201d she said sympathetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry my son let his pride get the better of him. I could skin him for outing you in front of everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe told you about that too?\u201d I asked, shocked that he had been so honest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not proud of his actions, but believe me when I tell you, he\u2019s suffered also. The whole situation changed him from the young man he used to be. I know that\u2019s little consolation for the pain you went through, but I wanted you to know he suffered too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he did,\u201d I said, fighting the wave of sadness that engulfed me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s learned from his mistakes, and I think he\u2019s a better man for it,\u201d she said as the subject of our conversation approached.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d Justin greeted her with a hug. \u201cPaul\u2019s over by the bar and wants to know if you want a fruity drink or a glass of wine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, decisions, decisions,\u201d she laughed, shooting me a warm smile. \u201cI hope to see you again before you have to head back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two look like you were having a heart-to-heart,\u201d he said, handing me another drink.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to tell her. I would have kept my mouth shut,\u201d I told him, sipping my drink as we settled at one of the high tables.</p><p>He chuckled darkly. \u201cI know, but it was long past time she knew the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom still doesn\u2019t know,\u201d I fessed up.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? The Queen of Knowing Everything never found out?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at his description. \u201cShe obviously knows something happened, but I let her believe it was just a bad breakup. I know I\u2019m her daughter, but I couldn\u2019t trust her enough not to tell everyone. I didn\u2019t want Woodfalls to be a repeat of what happened here.\u201d</p><p>He looked pensive as he digested my words. Instead of commenting, he changed the subject. The conversation flowed easily between us as we caught up on the last two years. We steered clear of any more baby talk, focusing instead on Justin\u2019s rapidly growing clientele and my desire to secure a full-time position. After a while, Travis and Hollie joined us with Paul\u2019s two kids, Brady and Andrea. Brady was as talkative as Hollie and Travis. They all rambled on about everything from meeting me the first time to how Trish had met Paul. Eventually everyone left our table when Travis saw someone he knew from school and Brady got sick of our \u201cboring conversation,\u201d as he put it.</p><p>Justin was called onstage to make a speech about the engagement of Rob and Melissa. He charmed the guests with his humorous insights on marriage and where he saw Rob and Melissa in twenty years. His portrayal of them forty years older was sidesplitting and had everyone in tears from laughing. He then cued the DJ and everyone roared with laughter as he started an awful off-key rendition of Katy Perry\u2019s song \u201cFirework.\u201d The crowd cheered and groaned with approval as Rob made a production of having Justin removed from the stage by the two bouncers.</p><p>Another friend took Justin\u2019s spot, singing some old boy band song. The crowd cheered him along, making up their own words as they went. Next, a girl we knew from college took a turn, singing a love song that actually sounded halfway decent. I had to give her credit.</p><p>\u201cLooks like your karaoke is a big hit,\u201d I told Melissa as she joined our table.</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d she said, smiling at the line of people waiting for a turn on the microphone. \u201cIt was cool that Justin kicked it off for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was pretty hysterical. His speech was hilarious too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I think he nailed Rob dead-on, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be that peppy at sixty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please. You\u2019ll be the spryest chick in the retirement home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it,\u201d she laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll be right there with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll practically be a youngster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re only a few weeks younger than me. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten your birthday is next week. I plan on taking you out before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s not like I took you out for yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you were halfway across the country. Now if you move back, I\u2019ll force you to take me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving back?\u201d Hollie interrupted. I didn\u2019t realize she was standing behind me.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetie,\u201d I answered, glaring at Melissa, who mouthed, Sorry. I had my suspicions that she\u2019d done it on purpose, but she left to talk at another table before I could grill her for it.</p><p>\u201cAw, why? We\u2019ve all missed you. Especially Justin. He\u2019s been a total downer since you left,\u201d Hollie piped in as Justin rejoined us.</p><p>\u201cGiving away all my secrets, squirt?\u201d he asked, reaching out to muss her hair, which made her shriek with panic. She backed away from the table with Andrea in tow.</p><p>\u201cGreat speech,\u201d I told him as he climbed onto the stool next to mine. I pretended I didn\u2019t notice his leg resting intimately against mine.</p><p>\u201cIt was fun,\u201d he chuckled, signaling the waitress for another round of drinks. \u201cWhat about my song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing, inspiring . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwful,\u201d I laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t quit your day job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d he asked, chuckling loudly.</p><p>\u201cJust a bit,\u201d I said, holding up two fingers to emphasize my point.</p><p>He put a hand over his heart dramatically. \u201cI\u2019m wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I said, taking a sip from the drink the waitress placed in front of me. I could feel the effects of the alcohol as we sat together talking. I wasn\u2019t drunk, but I had a definite buzz. Between the liquor and the fact that Justin\u2019s leg was still pressed against mine, my senses were on hyperdrive. The music was loud, so we were forced to lean in close as we talked. Everyone else faded into the background as we sat in our own private world.</p><p>Eventually, our bubble of privacy was breached when Trish and Paul brought the kids over to say their good-byes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how big Hollie and Travis have gotten,\u201d I observed as we watched them head out the door.</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. Every time I see them, they both look an inch taller,\u201d he agreed, resting his hand on top of mine. A moment of intensity crackled between us. Looking up from our hands, we gazed into each other\u2019s eyes and the past no longer mattered. I no longer cared who had hurt whom, or who had been wronged. All I cared about was the warm familiarity of his touch. My fingers curled around his hand, holding on tightly.</p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d he asked, using the pad of his thumb to stroke the outside of my hand.</p><p>My only answer was a nod as I watched his thumb with fascination. Everything inside me hummed to life. Slowly, he seduced my hand with his touch, running his thumb over each curve. Desire coursed through my veins and my breathing became labored. Finally, unable to handle watching his thumb any longer, I looked up to see that his intensity matched my own.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get out of here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I contemplated his words for the briefest of moments. I knew what he was asking. If I said yes, there would be no going back. This tentative friendship thing, which really was a joke, would be revealed for what it truly was. Justin and I could never just be friends. If I slept with him, we would be lovers with baggage. Even though I knew it might be a mistake, I nodded, unable to deny my body what it craved.</p><p>We said our good-byes to Melissa and Rob, who saw right through the excuse that I was tired and he was just giving me a ride to my hotel. I gave Melissa a quick hug and promised to call in the morning. I pretended not to notice her happy grin and whispers of excitement to Rob as we left.</p><p>Justin placed his hand on my naked back, guiding me toward the parking lot. Any doubts I might have had were laid to rest. An ache spread through me from his touch. I wanted him. No, I needed him.</p><p>During the drive back to my hotel, the only time his hand wasn\u2019t on me was when he was shifting gears. By the time he pulled into the parking lot, I was completely coiled up with suppressed arousal that was ready to explode. He walked around to my side of the jeep, opening the door to help me climb down. We stared at each other for a moment before he dropped his lips to mine. I pulled him close, wanting him more than I had ever wanted anything.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he murmured, pulling away.</p><p>I sighed with impatience, which made him chuckle.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he reassured me, leading me through the lobby of the hotel. We reached the dreaded elevators with some of my passion muted as I contemplated telling him I would take the stairs.</p><p>Sensing my unease, he tightened his hold on me. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he said, dropping a kiss on my head as the doors slid open.</p><p>Indecision crowded my senses as I eyed the steel box. I had already spent enough time in an elevator to last a lifetime as far as I was concerned. Pushing past my resistance, Justin guided me through the sliding doors, pushing the button for my floor with his free hand. The doors began to slide closed and before I could panic, he turned my body to face him. He dropped a kiss on me, shifting all my focus from the dreaded elevator ride to a passion-filled thirty seconds of pleasure. He lifted me up so I could wrap my legs around his waist. The sensation of being held in his arms left me shuddering with need. I wanted him now. I didn\u2019t care that we were in an elevator and that someone could be waiting on our floor to get on when the doors opened.</p><p>\u201cSee, that ride wasn\u2019t bad, was it?\u201d he asked, lowering me as the elevator doors opened.</p><p>\u201cNot bad at all,\u201d I answered. It was definitely one way to make me forget my fear. \u201cOf course, I hope you don\u2019t mind me dragging you on every elevator ride I take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would definitely make life more interesting,\u201d he said, sliding my key card into the slot on the door. The bed jumped right into view as we walked into the room. Were we really going to do this? Could anything good come from it, with the obvious exception of hot sex?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d he asked. I guess my face couldn\u2019t hide my hesitance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared of how much I want this,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>His troubled look disappeared as he swept me up in his arms and closed the door behind us with his foot. His lips devoured mine and I feverishly returned his kisses, wanting it all. He stood me up at the foot of the bed with my back to him, placing his hands on my hips. I could feel him pressed against my bottom, hard and ready as his mouth trailed over every inch of my back. After a moment, I was unable to stand the torture any longer. I twisted around, taking matters into my own hands. He moaned with pleasure as I deeply kissed his neck just inside his unbuttoned collar. His hands moved up my arms, hooking the straps of my dress before gently guiding it down my body to pool at my feet. Justin\u2019s clothing quickly followed and he laid me down on the bed. The intensity became almost too much to bear. By the time Justin rolled on a condom, an entire day of anticipation had reached a boiling point. My body vibrated with pleasure as he settled between my legs before entering me with one powerful plunge. The familiarity of the moment made me want to weep as my body adjusted to his. He dropped his lips to my neck, holding still as he slowly rediscovered my body. I moved restlessly beneath him, feeling my release approaching. As I moaned against his mouth, he matched my pace with his movements, reaching a climax seconds after mine.</p><p>He collapsed on top of me as we both tried to catch our breath. Exhausted, I closed my eyes, enjoying the feel of him still buried in me. After a few moments, he lifted himself off me and covered me with the blanket before heading to the bathroom to clean up. I wondered what his intentions were now. Would he leave and act like none of this had happened? Would he even say anything? My worst expectations appeared to be true when he returned from the bathroom and picked up his clothes.</p><p>I shifted my expression to appear nonchalant. I would not show my hurt. Technically, I had no reason to be hurt. No promises were offered and no illusions were given.</p><p>I was searching my brain for something to say when he surprised me by draping his clothes over the back of the chair and adding my dress to the pile. A moment later, he rejoined me in bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d I asked, unable to help myself as he flipped off the bedroom light.</p><p>\u201cIs that okay?\u201d he asked, climbing under the blanket with me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. His arm reached around, dragging me flush against his body.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I don\u2019t think I could leave if you asked me to,\u201d he murmured in my ear.</p><p>34.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>Early the next morning, Justin tenderly made love to me as the sun was slowly coming up over the horizon. It was breathtakingly beautiful and I had to bite my lip to keep from crying. Whereas last night had been all about unbridled heat, this morning was about what our bodies remembered about each other. It took every ounce of self-control in me to not declare my love for him.</p><p>Afterward, when we were lying in each other\u2019s arms, Justin broke the silence. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Monday,\u201d I answered, running my fingers across his palm. \u201cI\u2019m here for a week so Melissa and I can catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see you again?\u201d he asked, lacing his fingers with mine.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like that. When do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about now?\u201d</p><p>I laughed at his words. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m currently between jobs. I just finished the warehouse venue from last night and have a private job starting next Wednesday. Which means, I\u2019m pretty much free as a bird for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it wise for us to do this?\u201d I asked, trying to be the voice of reason.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re consenting adults with no relationship attachments dictating what we can and can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, should we be doing this with our history? Shouldn\u2019t this be wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-o-o, but I know it should,\u201d I answered honestly.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d he asked, tightening his arms around me.</p><p>I nodded, though I was afraid of what his question might be.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought of me at all in the last two years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I answered, unsure where he was going with this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd was it all bad, or did you think about the good stuff too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. What about you? Wait, never mind.\u201d We both knew what his answer would be. It was no secret how much he had hated me just two days ago.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kicker. I wanted to hate you, and at times I did, but there was always something inside me fighting for you. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense. You know how I said I ended a relationship recently?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, I lied when I said it was commitment issues. The more accurate description would be she wasn\u2019t you. Despite loathing you at times, I couldn\u2019t help comparing every damn woman I\u2019ve dated the last two years to you. Now that I have you in my arms, I\u2019m positive that\u2019s where you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>I digested his words before accepting them. I was no different. Yes, we had ripped each other\u2019s hearts out, but I could never get past the good times we\u2019d shared. \u201cHow can this even work, though?\u201d I asked. \u201cI leave in four days. I have a life back home that I can\u2019t just walk away from,\u201d I stated, even though a persistent little voice in the back of my head told me I could if I wanted to.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get to it. I\u2019m not going to ask you to give everything up for me again,\u201d he replied, kissing the back of my neck.</p><p>The morning melted away as we remained in bed, wrapped together. We eventually fell back asleep for a while in the afternoon before waking and making love again. It was as if our bodies knew we were on borrowed time and they were trying to get their fill. By evening we were both hungry enough to venture out for real food. We hit one of my favorite caf\u00e9s from college life before strolling along Puget Sound, talking the entire time. It was amazing how quickly we fell back to our old patterns. Two years of maturity had us talking about different issues than what was relevant back then. Adulthood and responsibilities had a way of making a person look at certain issues differently. Suddenly jobs with insurance and how much we would have to pay in taxes made us wish we could run back home. I was thrilled to learn that Justin had proven his father wrong and not only was making a living off his art, but found it profitable.</p> <p>\u201cI bet that irks the shit out of him,\u201d I commented as we headed back to my hotel.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty much MIA now. Ever since Mom got remarried we don\u2019t see a whole lot of him.\u201d</p><p>Justin tried to hide it, but I could tell it bothered him. His father might be a prick, but he was still his dad. \u201cMaybe one of these days he\u2019ll come around,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be holding my breath. Besides, it\u2019s not like I hold the market on bad fathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. He could be a complete absentee like mine. It\u2019s been years since Mom and I have heard from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis loss,\u201d Justin reassured me, patting my hand.</p> <p>Like him, I shrugged with indifference. I\u2019d given up on having a father figure in my life years ago when the letters I had sent begging him to come to my eighth birthday party went unanswered. After that, I pretty much crossed him off my list. I hardly remembered him enough to miss him anyway.</p><p>I changed the subject as we were pulling into the parking lot of my hotel. Justin followed me up to my room. That became our routine during the next few days. We\u2019d go to bed together each night and spend the days rediscovering the city. As my time in Seattle ticked by, I began preparing myself for the inevitable heartache of leaving. We spent Friday with Melissa and Rob on a boat the guys had rented for the day. Saturday we hung with Justin\u2019s family, and by Sunday, I was sick at the idea that I\u2019d be leaving the next morning. I made a spur-of-the-moment decision when Justin was in the shower to surprise him and change my flight to Wednesday morning. I figured I could leave before he had to start his new job.</p><p>Justin was thrilled that we had two bonus days together and we decided to keep it secret so the two days could be all ours. Feeling like we had been given a gift, we celebrated by staying in bed all day Sunday. We felt as if we\u2019d been given a stay of execution.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Justin was still sleeping when I woke before dawn on Monday morning. I studied his features in the dim light. He looked younger and more relaxed, like the boy he was two years ago. The love I felt for that boy had been buried so deeply below the hurt that I thought it was gone. In two days, I would be leaving him again and I was scared of the pain that would come along with it. I knew there was a way to avoid it, I just didn\u2019t know if I was brave enough to make that decision.</p><p>Deciding to let him sleep, I climbed quietly from the bed and snuck into the bathroom to shower. Steam was just beginning to fill the small room when I heard the door open. Seconds later, Justin joined me, and neither of us spoke as he pulled me into his arms, covering my mouth with his. We made love under the hot water cascading down our bodies. It felt bittersweet\u2014like a good-bye. I knew Justin wanted me to stay, but he would not pressure me, not the way things ended before. He would let me go if that was the decision I made.</p><p>Over the next two days, neither of us brought up the subject of me staying. Instead, Justin made it his goal to take me to all of our old favorite haunts in Seattle. I chuckled as we sipped coffee at the caf\u00e9 on campus where we had first met and he reminded me of how snotty I had been.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you thought you were God\u2019s gift to women,\u201d I said, defending myself between giggles.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, thought?\u201d he teased, winking at me. My stomach fluttered. Even after two years, he couldn\u2019t help being a flirt.</p><p>\u201cHa, we better slide over a second table so your ego has a place to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it. You wanted me. Even at that moment,\u201d he said, pulling me in close for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cMore than I was willing to admit,\u201d I finally confessed.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d he crowed, pumping his fist in the air.</p><p>\u201cOh lord. Don\u2019t make me regret telling you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret,\u201d he said, slinging his arm across my shoulders as we strolled away from the caf\u00e9. He leaned in and placed his lips close to my ear. \u201cI thought you were the most beautiful woman I had ever seen when you gave me a piece of your mind that day. I fell for you hook, line, and sinker. I had to force myself not to follow you like a lovesick puppy when you stomped away.\u201d His words made my heart clench.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just because you wanted to get in my pants,\u201d I said, keeping the conversation playful. I couldn\u2019t afford to let myself dwell on our impending separation.</p><p>\u201cWell, that too,\u201d he laughed, placing a soft kiss on my temple.</p><p>I tried laughing with him, but it was a forced effort.</p><p>We kept things light as we soaked up the last of our remaining time together. I could tell it was difficult for us both when Wednesday showed up like an unwanted bill that was due immediately.</p><p> Justin drove me to the airport that morning. We could try to act differently, but the mood was somber. I stared blindly out the window, not paying attention to the passing landscape.</p><p> My heart felt like a brick with each mile. I had no idea how I could walk away from him again. We were both silent as he pulled his jeep into the parking garage and unloaded my bags. I gripped his free hand as we walked inside, not ready to let go.</p><p>Eventually, we hit the security checkpoint and he could no longer accompany me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you tonight,\u201d he said, cupping my face.</p><p>I nodded as my eyes began to well up. I felt like I needed to say something more</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here\u2014whatever you decide,\u201d he said reassuringly, pulling me into his arms. It was as if he could read my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never regret this week,\u201d I murmured, burying my head in his chest.</p><p>\u201cNeither will I,\u201d he answered, stroking my back.</p><p>Unable to stand the pain any longer, I tipped my head back and captured his lips before turning and walking away. I told myself I wouldn\u2019t look back. That it would only make it hurt more, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. He was standing off to the side, watching me. It threatened to bring me to my knees, but I blew him a kiss. With each step after that, I had to fight the urge to turn and run back to him. This was the second time I\u2019d walked away from him and the finality of it was crushing.</p><p>35.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>Woodfalls was covered in an unseasonably early blanket of snow when I drove my car down Main Street past my apartment. I was mentally and physically exhausted from my trip and would have liked nothing more than to curl up in a ball on my bed, but I knew Tressa would kill me if I didn\u2019t come by to see her first.</p><p>I pulled into her driveway and couldn\u2019t help smiling at the small obscene snowman on the front lawn. The carrot nose had been moved down below his belly, obviously the handiwork of Tressa\u2019s thirteen-year-old brother, Chris, and most likely his partner in crime, John. Putting my car in park, I climbed from my car, smiling again when I noticed the backside of the snowman resembled a nude person.</p><p>Without bothering to ring the doorbell, I opened the front door to Tressa\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cBrittni, you\u2019re back,\u201d Stephenie, Tressa\u2019s mom, greeted me, looking up from the blanket she was crocheting.</p><p>\u201cI just got in. Is Tressa in her room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She missed you while you were gone,\u201d she answered.</p><p>I nodded but didn\u2019t answer as I took the stairs two at a time up to Tressa\u2019s room. Without knocking, I pushed open the door.</p><p>\u201cBlack, I like,\u201d I said, taking in her recently dyed hair.</p><p>\u201cI felt like shaking things up. You know, get some tongues wagging here in Deadfalls,\u201d she said in her typical sarcastic tone. \u201cI thought you were coming home Sunday,\u201d she added, opening the bottle of black nail polish that was lying next to her knee.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, sugar lips,\u201d I answered, picking up a bottle of purple polish.</p><p>\u201cAww, shucks, are we dating?\u201d she asked, batting her thick eyelashes at me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel about eating peaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw, don\u2019t be crude,\u201d I said, smiling halfheartedly.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit. Did Mr. Ass Face show his true colors again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snipped.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d she said, knowingly. \u201cI told you he\u2019d win you back. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re in love with him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and I\u2019m Mother Theresa,\u201d Tressa said dismissively.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what I am. I\u2019m still trying to figure things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure out what? Either you\u2019re into him or you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged without saying another word, wishing it was that simple.</p><p> We spent the next half hour catching up. She told me about the nightmare date she\u2019d gone on over the weekend. I loved Tressa to death, but her taste in guys was atrocious. Somehow, she was a magnet for assholes. Behind the tough exterior she liked to portray, she had crazy insecurities where guys were concerned. I personally blamed her ex-boyfriend, Jackson. He\u2019d basically stripped away her confidence during the several years they had dated. I was convinced it was his own insecurities that made him feel the need to belittle Tressa. The guy was a total momma\u2019s boy. He made Tressa second-guess her appeal.</p><p>Once we had exhausted Tressa\u2019s disastrous date, she tried to bring up Justin again. I brushed off her questions, claiming to be tired as I rose from her bed. Truthfully, it was a subject I had to work out on my own. I knew what the look on her face meant when her eyebrows came together, but she dropped the issue. I threw her a quick kiss good-bye before fleeing from the room.</p><p>Five minutes later, I pulled behind Mr. James\u2019s hardware store, where I rented the small apartment above. Hauling my suitcases from the trunk of my car, I trekked through the snow to the wooden staircase. By the time I made it to my one-room flat, I was both physically and mentally exhausted. I dropped onto my pull-out couch that also served as my bed. I couldn\u2019t help thinking how bleak it suddenly seemed. Just a week ago, I was satisfied with my life. I was ready to finish the last of my intern hours so I could officially become a teacher. Now, what I was missing was glaringly obvious.</p><p>I decided I\u2019d better call my mom. If word spread\u2014and it would\u2014that I was home and I hadn\u2019t called her, shit would hit the fan.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom. I just wanted you to know I made it back okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Brittni. You should have stopped by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mom. I\u2019m sorry, but I was too tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on over and rest here. You can tell me about your trip, and I\u2019ll make you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, Mom. I really am too tired to leave.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzed, indicating I had another call. As I looked at the Caller ID, my first genuine smile of the day spread across my face.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, I have to go, okay? I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey. Make sure you call me. Bye.\u201d</p><p>I tapped the screen to take the incoming call. \u201cHi,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, you made it back?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a little while ago. I miss you.\u201d The words slipped out before I could retract them.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too, sweet stuff. More than should be humanly possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I asked despairingly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to take it one day at a time. We\u2019ll talk on the phone every day, and in three weeks, when I finish this job, I\u2019ll come see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. I mean, I already bought my ticket, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d he admitted hesitantly. \u201cBrittni? Is that cool?\u201d he asked again, breaking the silence when I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cHeck yeah,\u201d I finally replied, letting him off the hook. \u201cWere you worried there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t screw with me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I was just teasing,\u201d I said. For the next hour, we continued chatting about nothing in particular. It was a double-edged sword. I loved hearing his voice, but it made the distance between us even more obvious. He promised to call the next evening before hanging up.</p><p>The next day turned out to be a huge bore, since I no longer had classes and wasn\u2019t needed at the school. I drove the few short blocks to Mom\u2019s house for dinner. I was thankful to have something to occupy my time.</p><p>\u201cYou look rough,\u201d she greeted me as I walked into the kitchen, where she was finishing a pot of chili.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks, Mom,\u201d I said dryly, grabbing a handful of crackers from the package on the counter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust making an observation. I guess your \u2018conference\u2019 was pretty tedious,\u201d she stated, letting me know she had seen through my excuse.</p><p>I sighed. I was no longer sure why I had felt the need to keep her in the dark on every aspect of my life. \u201cI went to Seattle for a friend\u2019s engagement,\u201d I said, throwing it out there.</p><p>\u201cAnd to see the boy who broke your heart two years ago,\u201d she said, stirring the pot.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you two fix what was broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know it was something broken and not just a typical breakup?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHow did I know? Honey, I don\u2019t get my nosey nicknames by sitting back and cooling my heels. I knew the moment you came home all broken inside that some boy had done that to you. Only love can break a gal\u2019s spirit like that. I waited for you to come to me and tell me. I figured you\u2019d get around to it when you were ready,\u201d she said, pulling two bowls from the cabinet.</p><p>\u201cYou never said anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I know how much you value your privacy. I know my runaway tongue embarrasses you, but it\u2019s who I am. I figured I owed it to you not to pry this time.\u201d</p><p>I felt so ashamed. For years I\u2019d kept her in the dark, punishing her for who she is. I gave her an awkward hug. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom. I never meant to make you feel bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey. I know we\u2019re different, but I want you to know that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I said, sinking down at the bar with my bowl of chili in hand.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your trip and why it made you unhappy.\u201d</p><p>I decided to go back to the very beginning. I filled her in on everything from meeting Justin at the caf\u00e9 to spending Thanksgiving with him that year to the first time he told me he loved me. Our untouched chili cooled as I told her about the pregnancy and then the miscarriage. I was surprised when tears rolled down her cheeks and she reached out to grasp my hand. I even told her how Justin had outed me for an abortion I never had. Finally I moved to my recent visit to Seattle. Through my whole confession, my normally talkative mom remained silent. She gave me a hug that didn\u2019t feel nearly as awkward as the first one before reheating our chili.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey, but I\u2019m confident you and your young man will figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d I asked surprised.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you may be my flesh and blood, but you and I are as different as night and day. You see something you want and you go after it, no matter how scary it may seem.\u201d</p><p>I mulled over her words as we both ate our chili in silence. In retrospect, I knew she was right. I was never one to not rise to a challenge. Only once had I ever let a situation beat me down. Feeling lighthearted, I headed home so I could be there when Justin called. I had no sooner sat down on my couch when my cell phone rang. I greeted him much the same way I had the night before, by declaring how much I missed him. Thankfully he seemed equally miserable, so I didn\u2019t feel nearly as codependent as I thought. We talked for several hours, neither of us wanting to hang up. The rest of my week pretty much followed the same pattern with the exception of subbing a couple of days at the elementary school and the high school. The highlights of my days were the text messages Justin would send me and our nightly calls.</p><p>Two weeks after returning home, I finally got a call from Ms. Miller, officially offering me Mrs. Duncan\u2019s full-time position when she retired at Christmas break. The feeling of excitement that I was so sure would come when I finally secured a full-time position never manifested. I was appreciative but hated that there was yet another thing to tie me to Woodfalls. That night when I talked to Justin, I could tell by the lack of enthusiasm in his voice that he felt the same. He then delivered the blow that his trip would have to be delayed since his client had commissioned him for another job. I tried to interject cheer into my voice as I congratulated him, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. This was why long-distance relationships were impossible.</p><p>The next morning I felt marginally better when I woke to a text from Justin. I sent a return message and a few seconds later my phone rang.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I greeted him. \u201cSorry about last night. I just miss you so damn much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too. I\u2019m sorry about my trip being delayed,\u201d he sighed. I knew without even seeing him that he was rubbing a hand over his head.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Maybe I can come for Christmas,\u201d I said, not sure if I was being too forward.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, sounding more excited than I\u2019d heard him in the last few days.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said as the idea took hold. \u201cI don\u2019t start until after Christmas break, so I\u2019ll have those two weeks off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be amazing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think so too,\u201d I said happily, not dwelling on the fact that Christmas was still months away. We talked for a few more minutes before he had to return to work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later tonight,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cYou better,\u201d I threatened. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, I love you,\u201d he shocked me by saying just before he hung up the phone. Glancing at the phone in my hand, I wondered if I\u2019d heard him right. We had both avoided saying the words. It got to the point where I wondered if we would ever be able to say them again. Sitting there with his words still swirling around my head, I knew without a shadow of a doubt that I loved him too. I always had and always would. I belonged with him. He was the love of my life.</p><p>Looking around my empty apartment, I realized that all the things I thought were tying me to Woodfalls merely needed to be untied. Grabbing my keys, I tore out of my apartment. Five minutes later, I was running up the stairs to Tressa\u2019s room, glad she had no classes.</p><p>She was in the middle of typing something on her computer when I burst through her bedroom door. \u201cWell, it\u2019s about damn time,\u201d she greeted me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, momentarily confused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving, right?\u201d she asked, setting her computer to the side.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How? Did you tap my phone?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, you turd. I can tell by your face. You\u2019ve been a Debbie Downer for the last two weeks, and suddenly you burst into my room like you just won the lottery. It took you long enough to decide,\u201d she added, glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cYou knew. How did you know when I didn\u2019t even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please. You talk about Seattle like it\u2019s your mother ship, and Justin like he\u2019s your alien lover or something. I can\u2019t believe you waited this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaited this long?\u201d I asked. \u201cI thought you would think I was a total ass for moving across the country for some guy who broke my heart. Not to mention, I have no idea how I\u2019m going to tell my mom or Ms. Miller, who finally offered me the job yesterday. I\u2019ll be leaving a lot behind,\u201d I added defensively.</p><p>\u201cYour mom will recover, and Ms. Miller will have to hire someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrittni, seriously? I\u2019ve known you\u2019d be leaving since you got home. I\u2019ve had two weeks to adjust to the idea. I\u2019ll miss you like a pussycat misses her tomcat, but I get it. Dicks before chicks,\u201d she smirked, tossing a pillow at me.</p><p>\u201cGah, you\u2019re so crude,\u201d I stated, returning her smile. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay? Maybe you should move to Seattle with me.\u201d</p><p>She snorted loudly. \u201cI could never leave Deadfalls. It\u2019s in my blood. I know I make fun of it, but I love this old town. I\u2019m going to miss your twat-face though, and you better not forget about me,\u201d she said. She stood and gave me a ferocious hug.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said, squeezing her tight.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>I left my best friend behind a few minutes later after she promised to box up my belongings for me. My next stop was the school, where I turned down the job offer. With a few hours to kill, I went home and packed everything I could into my car, knowing Tressa would send me the rest. I contacted my landlord, Mr. James, and thanked him for renting me his loft. By four o\u2019clock, I was ready to go with only one other person left to tell. I was just pulling into the driveway of the house I\u2019d spent the first eighteen years of my life in when my mom pulled into the driveway next to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think I wouldn\u2019t be the last to know,\u201d she said, looking at my carload of belongings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom. I wanted to wait until you got off work to break the news to you,\u201d I said, following her into the house with a lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cHe knows I\u2019ll hunt him down if he breaks your heart again, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t tolerate sporadic visits like when you were in college, you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d I said, grinning with relief that she was willing to let me go. I had been so sure it would be a battle, but I was right, the strings just needed to be untied.</p><p>\u201cAnd I wish you would wait until morning to go, but I can tell by the determined look on your face there\u2019s no talking you out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d I confirmed, giving her a hard hug that she returned wholeheartedly. \u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she said, walking me to my car. \u201cYou better call as soon as you stop for the night, and no driving past eleven, since that\u2019s when the drunks hit the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d I agreed, giving her a quick kiss on the cheek before climbing into my car.</p><p>Maybe it was the finality of leaving, but backing out of the driveway, I suddenly felt more love for my mom than I ever had. Not because she was letting me go, but because she had always accepted me for who I was. Finally, I realized I owed her that in return. The GPS indicated my destination was thousands of miles away, but I didn\u2019t care because I knew I was going home. The sign telling me to visit Woodfalls again soon came into sight, and I laughed openly when I drove past it.</p><p>36.</p><p>Present Day</p><p>I was a hundred miles into my trip when Justin called. Wanting to keep my news secret, I lied and told him I was on my way to the city to see a movie with Tressa. It killed me not to tell him the truth, but I bit my tongue. Heeding my mom\u2019s warning, I pulled into the parking lot of a hotel at around eleven o\u2019clock. I made sure to call to let her know I was off the road. I was so amped I could hardly sleep, and by six the next morning, I was back on the road. My car ate up each mile as if it sensed my hurry. The only time I stopped was to fill up on gas, make quick bathroom breaks, and to hit a drive-through. The day passed quickly and by eleven that night, after twenty-four hours of driving time, I was more than halfway there. I was giddy with excitement, knowing that soon I would be back in Justin\u2019s arms.</p><p>I looked at my phone after I checked into my hotel room, feeling guilty that I had let his nightly call go to voice mail. I was afraid I couldn\u2019t trust myself not to blurt out the truth. Listening to the voice mail made me feel even worse. He sounded lonely, but the result would be worth it. I sent him a text message saying I was sorry I missed his call and that I would talk to him tomorrow. Sleep came easier than it had the night before. As excited as I was, I guess all the driving had me exhausted. Even the buzz I maintained all day from sucking down one Red Bull after another was long gone. I lay down on the bed, intending to rest my eyes for a minute before showering. Before I knew it, I was awakened by the jingle of my cell phone sitting on the bed next to me. Luckily I had remembered to set the alarm before I crashed. I still had on the same clothes from the day before, but I felt surprisingly refreshed. After a quick shower, I hit the road before the sun came up.</p><p>By the time I made it to my next hotel stop that evening at eleven, I was less than five hundred miles away from Seattle. I couldn\u2019t believe how many miles I had covered in the past three days. The god of road trips must also be on my side because I had managed to avoid highway patrols and state troopers the entire way, which was good considering I hadn\u2019t exactly been paying attention to the posted speed limits. I spent a few minutes talking to Justin on the phone before giving him the excuse that I was feeling a little under the weather to get off the phone. I felt like a kid in a toy store, eager to get what I wanted. Tomorrow I would claim my prize.</p><p>The next day I was less than fifty miles away when Justin called, and I couldn\u2019t decide if I should answer. Choosing to wait one more hour for the big surprise, I let it go to voice mail again. I was pulling into the parking lot of his building when he called again. Gleefully, I answered the phone this time.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said, climbing from my car.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. You\u2019ve been hard to reach,\u201d he said, sounding stressed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s been a crazy couple of days,\u201d I answered, climbing the steps to his condo.</p><p>\u201cAnything I can help with?\u201d he asked as I located his door.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said, raising my fist to knock on his door. \u201cI\u2019m wondering about what you said to me the other night,\u201d I added, knocking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about that. Just a sec, someone\u2019s at the door,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you were serious about the love part?\u201d I asked into the receiver, grinning broadly at him. He looked like he might pass out before gathering himself.</p><p>\u201cHell yes,\u201d he answered, dragging me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, because I love you too,\u201d I said, seconds before our lips came together.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cYou ready, babe?\u201d I called, closing my suitcase.</p><p>\u201cJust about,\u201d Justin said, looking up from the painting he was working on.</p><p>\u201cUm, hon, you know we have to leave for the airport in twenty minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just wanted to finish this,\u201d he said, turning the painting so I could see. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I whispered, taking in the painting of the land we had purchased that week. It would be several years before we could afford to build the house of our dreams on it, but for now at least, the land was ours.</p><p>\u201cYou can see yourself growing old here?\u201d Justin asked, sliding his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise to mow all that grass,\u201d I teased, looking down at the ring sparkling on my finger.</p><p>Justin had proposed on a clich\u00e9 date, despite his vows not to. I had to admit though, it made for a memorable New Year\u2019s Eve. At least he bucked the traditional route of a romantic dinner with onlookers. Instead, he popped the question just as the clock struck midnight beneath the stars while we sat in his jeep. Even though it was the middle of winter, he had removed the roof and doors for me and filled the jeep with heavy blankets. Wine and fine cuisine was traded for steaming cups of coffee and pizza from our favorite place. In the parking lot of Olympic Sculpture Park, with the stars shining down, I had just declared it the perfect way to spend New Year\u2019s when Justin handed me a cup of coffee with something taped to the side. I had laughed with glee when I saw it was a ring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, admiring the ring on my finger, I couldn\u2019t believe how much my life had changed since leaving Woodfalls. I was engaged. I loved the school I was working at. Things had managed to come together after all.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Justin asked, pulling me back to the present.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I can\u2019t wait to see everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have your mom\u2019s gift?\u201d Justin asked, locking the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cYep, it\u2019s packed in my suitcase,\u201d I said, following behind him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll like it?\u201d he commented, loading up our bags.</p><p>\u201cI told you a hundred times while you were painting it. You are a brilliant artist. Of course she is going to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, brilliant might be a strong word. Masterful works though,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s the ego I know and love.\u201d</p><p>The five-hour plane ride passed quicker than I expected, and before I knew it, we were driving past the Welcome to Woodfalls sign. I guided Justin down Main Street to Mom\u2019s house. She had insisted we stay with her while we were in town. I conceded graciously, since our relationship had changed so much these past six months. It was ironic that I had fought the trip to Seattle for Melissa and Rob\u2019s engagement party, and in the end it had changed so many aspects of my life.</p><p>Mom was outside doing some gardening when we pulled into the driveway. I climbed from the vehicle and gave her a big hug, surprised at how happy I was to see her. Justin stepped in to give her a hearty hug when I was done. They had met at Christmas when she decided to fly to Seattle to see us. For weeks before her visit, I had stressed over spending the holidays with her and Justin\u2019s family together, but all my fears were silly. She took to his family as quickly as I had, and they all loved her. Observing her outside Woodfalls, I realized I had always viewed her too harshly. She was just overly friendly with everyone. She liked to know what was going on. That was my mom.</p><p>\u201cBrittni, honey, you look lovely,\u201d she said warmly. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see your young man has shaped up,\u201d she added, looking sternly at Justin.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he answered, winking at her. His wink had the same effect on her as it did every other woman. I couldn\u2019t help smiling as she giggled.</p><p>\u201cHow is everyone?\u201d I asked, knowing I\u2019d get a full report. Justin smiled at me as she launched into a detailed description of everything I had missed. For once, I didn\u2019t mind it at all. It felt like home, and before I knew it, it was time to change and leave for the Annual Woodfalls Spring Fling. Every spring, the residents of Woodfalls would gather for a nighttime dance under the stars to celebrate the end of winter. Sometimes Mother Nature would throw a monkey wrench in the festivities by dumping a late-season snowfall, but this year she had graced us with a mild evening. I was stepping into my dress when Justin joined me. I couldn\u2019t help admiring him as he stood before me dressed in slacks and a short-sleeve button-up shirt. His tattoos were visible down his arms. For just a moment, I forgot about our plans and considered spending the evening wrapped in those arms.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like me to zip you up?\u201d he asked, turning me so my back was facing him. I sighed with pleasure as his lips trailed across my neck before zipping me.</p><p>\u201cYou look delectable,\u201d he said wickedly, placing another kiss on my neck.</p><p>\u201cHmmm, so do you,\u201d I answered, tilting my head back so he could have my lips.</p><p>He obliged without hesitation. I pressed closer, feeling intoxicated from his touch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better go,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a tease,\u201d I complained.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be mad if you missed this,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>Mom rode with us to the dance. We chatted the entire time, pausing only to give Justin directions to Jessup Park where the Spring Fling was being held. As he pulled into the gravel parking lot, I gasped in delight at the fairy-tale sight before our eyes. Many of the trees along the lake had been wrapped with thousands of twinkling lights, while white Japanese lanterns hung from the branches of other trees, swaying gently in the breeze. A large dance floor had been placed near the lake with dozens of tables and chairs scattered about. The residents of Woodfalls had gone all out.</p> <p> \u201cBrittni,\u201d a loud voice boomed. I turned to greet my best friend.</p><p>\u201cTressa,\u201d I mimicked her, throwing my arms around her. \u201cTressa, this is my fianc\u00e9, Justin. Justin, this is my best friend, Tressa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still owe you a knee in the nuts,\u201d Tressa greeted him.</p><p>\u201cTressa,\u201d I chastised, chuckling, despite myself.</p><p>\u201cWould a punch to the arm work?\u201d Justin asked, turning so his arm was close to her.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d she said, hauling off and punching with all her might.</p><p>I had to hand it to Justin, he barely grunted. I knew from past experience that Tressa\u2019s sucker punches hurt.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d she said, smiling at him. \u201cYou ever hurt my girl like that again and it\u2019ll be a knee to the crotch, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fair,\u201d Justin said, draping an around my shoulders. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath. I don\u2019t make the same mistake twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear.\u201d She glared at him in her typical way to let him know she was serious before turning to me. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe this, but the city council finally decided to spring for a DJ this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I replied. Woodfalls was steeped in tradition, which meant we were usually stuck with the musical stylings of the Johnson siblings each year. It wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if they actually knew any songs from our generation.</p><p>\u201cI know, right? I almost shit myself when I heard.\u201d She was interrupted by her mom calling her to help carry a cake to the buffet table. \u201cOh, hell. I\u2019ll be back when I\u2019m done being Cinderella,\u201d she complained before heading off.</p><p> \u201cSo, yeah, that\u2019s Tressa,\u201d I said, smiling wryly.</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d he said as another car pulled in.</p><p> \u201cHey, that\u2019s Trent James,\u201d I said, watching him climb out of the car. He looked like something right out of a computer lab. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Trent?\u201d I greeted him.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Brittni,\u201d Trent answered, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. \u201cIs Tressa here?\u201d he asked, glancing around nervously.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s over by the gazebo,\u201d I said, smirking as he looked flustered. \u201cDo you want me to call her over here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll talk to her later,\u201d he said, scurrying off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all that about?\u201d Justin said, taking in my smirk.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing. Trent\u2019s had a crush on Tressa forever, but she claims he\u2019s too nerdy for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we join your friends?\u201d he asked, linking his fingers through mine.</p><p>\u201cYou looking for more punishment?\u201d I teased. \u201cWoodfalls residents are an acquired taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, I was pretty sure he wanted to eat his words. He\u2019d been patted on the back, lectured, smothered in hugs and kisses, and even threatened again by Tressa, just for good measure.</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d I giggled as we slowly circled the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re by my side, I\u2019m good,\u201d he said, dipping his head down to place a warm kiss on my neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never leaving again,\u201d I said, admiring the diamond ring that sparkled on my hand. </p> </body></html>"]
