The guy in the dirty gray T-shirt and ripped sweatpants?</p><p>That\u2019s me, Drew Evans.</p><p>I\u2019m not usually like this. I mean, that really isn\u2019t me.</p> <p>In real life, I\u2019m well-groomed, my chin is clean-shaven, and my black hair is slicked back at the sides in a way I\u2019ve been told makes me look dangerous but professional. My suits are handmade. I wear shoes that cost more than your rent.</p><p>My apartment? Yeah, the one I\u2019m in right now. The shades are drawn, and the furniture glows with a bluish hue from the television. The tables and floor are littered with beer bottles, pizza boxes, and empty ice cream tubs.</p><p>That\u2019s not my real apartment. The one I usually live in is spotless; I have a girl come by twice a week. And it has every modern convenience, every big-boy toy you can think of: surround sound, satellite speakers, and a big-screen plasma that would make any man fall on his knees and beg for more. The decor is modern\u2014lots of black and stainless steel\u2014and anyone who enters knows a man lives there.</p><p>So, like I said\u2014what you\u2019re seeing right now isn\u2019t the real me. I have the flu.</p><p>Influenza.</p> <p>Have you ever noticed some of the worst sicknesses in history have a lyrical sound to them? Words like malaria, diarrhea, cholera. Do you think they do that on purpose? To make it a nice way to say you feel like something that dropped out of your dog\u2019s ass?</p><p>Influenza. Has a nice ring to it, if you say it enough.</p><p>At least I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what I have. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been holed up in my apartment the last seven days. That\u2019s why I turned my phone off, why I\u2019ve gotten off the couch only to use the bathroom or to bring in the food I order from the delivery guy.</p><p>How long does the flu last anyway? Ten days? A month? Mine started a week ago. My alarm went off at five a.m., like always. But instead of rising from the bed to go to the office where I\u2019m a star, I threw the clock across the room, smashing it to kingdom come.</p><p>It was annoying anyway. Stupid clock. Stupid beep-beep-beeping.</p><p>I rolled over and went back to sleep. When I did eventually drag my ass out of bed, I felt weak and nauseous. My chest ached; my head hurt. See\u2014the flu, right? I couldn\u2019t sleep any more, so I planted myself here, on my trusty couch. It was so comfortable I decided to stay right here. All week. Watching Will Ferrell\u2019s greatest hits on the plasma.</p> <p>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\u2019s on right now. I\u2019ve watched it three times today, but I haven\u2019t laughed yet. Not once. Maybe the fourth time\u2019s the charm, huh?</p><p>Now there\u2019s a pounding at my door.</p><p>Frigging doorman. What the hell is he here for? He\u2019s going to be sorry when he gets my Christmas tip this year, you can bet your ass.</p><p>I ignore the pounding, though it comes again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>\u201cDrew! Drew, I know you\u2019re in there! Open the goddamn door!\u201d</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>It\u2019s The Bitch. Otherwise known as my sister, Alexandra.</p> <p>When I say the word bitch I mean it in the most affectionate way possible, I swear. But it\u2019s what she is. Demanding, opinionated, relentless. I\u2019m going to kill my doorman.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t open this door, Drew, I\u2019m calling the police to break it down, I swear to God!\u201d</p><p>See what I mean?</p><p>I grasp the pillow that\u2019s been resting on my lap since the flu started. I push my face into it and inhale deeply. It smells like vanilla and lavender. Crisp and clean and addictive.</p><p>\u201cDrew! Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I pull the pillow over my head. Not because it smells like...her...but to block out the pounding that continues at my door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking out my phone! I\u2019m dialing!\u201d Alexandra\u2019s voice is whiny with warning, and I know she\u2019s not screwing around.</p><p>I sigh deeply and force myself to get up from the couch. The walk to the door takes time; each step of my stiff, aching legs is an effort.</p><p>Frigging flu.</p><p>I open the door and brace myself for the wrath of The Bitch. She\u2019s holding the latest iPhone up to her ear with one perfectly manicured hand. Her blond hair is pulled back in a simple but elegant knot, and a dark green purse hangs from her shoulder, the same shade as her skirt\u2014Lexi\u2019s all about the matching.</p><p>Behind her, looking appropriately contrite in a wrinkled navy suit, is my best friend and coworker, Matthew Fisher.</p><p>I forgive you, Doorman. It\u2019s Matthew who must die.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d Alexandra yells in horror. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>I told you this isn\u2019t the real me.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer her. I don\u2019t have the energy. I just leave the door open and fall face first onto my couch. It\u2019s soft and warm, but firm.</p><p>I love you, couch\u2014have I ever told you that? Well, I\u2019m telling you now.</p><p>Though my eyes are buried in the pillow, I sense Alexandra and Matthew walking slowly into the apartment. I imagine the shock on their faces at its condition. I peek out from my cocoon and see that my mind\u2019s eye was spot on.</p><p>\u201cDrew?\u201d I hear her ask, but this time there\u2019s concern woven throughout the one short syllable.</p><p>Then she\u2019s pissed again. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Matthew, why didn\u2019t you call me sooner? How could you let this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him, Lex!\u201d Matthew says quickly. See\u2014he\u2019s afraid of The Bitch too. \u201cI came every day. He wouldn\u2019t open the door for me.\u201d</p><p>I sense the couch dip as she sits beside me. \u201cDrew?\u201d she says softly. I feel her hand run gently through the back of my hair. \u201cHoney?\u201d</p><p>Her voice is so achingly worried, she reminds me of my mother. When I was a boy and sick at home, Mom would come in my room with hot chocolate and soup on a tray. She would kiss my forehead to see if it still burned with fever. She always made me feel better. The memory and Alexandra\u2019s similar actions bring moisture to my closed eyes.</p><p>Am I a mess or what?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Alexandra.\u201d I tell her, though I\u2019m not sure if she hears me. My voice is lost in the sweet-scented pillow. \u201cI have the flu.\u201d</p><p>I hear the opening of a pizza box and a groan as the stench of rotting cheese and sausage drifts from the container. \u201cNot exactly the diet of someone with the flu, Little Brother.\u201d</p><p>I hear further shuffling of beer bottles and garbage, and I know she\u2019s starting to straighten the mess up. I\u2019m not the only neat freak in my family.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s just wrong!\u201d She inhales sharply, and, judging by the stink that joins the putrid pizza aroma, I\u2019m thinking she just opened a three-day-old ice cream container that wasn\u2019t as empty as I\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cDrew.\u201d She shakes my shoulders gently. I give in and sit up, rubbing the exhaustion from my eyes as I do. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d she begs. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What happened?\u201d</p><p>As I look at the troubled expression of my big bitch of a sister, I\u2019m thrown twenty-two years back in time. I\u2019m six years old and my hamster, Mr. Wuzzles, has just died. And just like that day, the painful truth is ripped from my lungs.</p><p>\u201cIt finally happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve been wishing on me all these years,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI fell in love.\u201d</p><p>I look up to see the smile form. It\u2019s what she\u2019s always wanted for me. She\u2019s been married to Steven forever, has been in love with him for even longer. So she\u2019s never agreed with the way I live my life and can\u2019t wait for me to settle down. To find someone to take care of me, the way she takes care of Steven. The way our mother still takes care of our dad.</p><p>But I told her it would never happen\u2014it wasn\u2019t what I wanted. Why bring a book to the library? Why bring sand to the beach? Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free?</p><p>Are you starting to see the picture here?</p><p>So, I see her beginning to smile when, in a small voice that I don\u2019t even recognize, I say, \u201cShe\u2019s marrying someone else. She didn\u2019t...she didn\u2019t want me, Lex.\u201d</p><p>Sympathy spreads across my sister\u2019s face, like jam on bread. And then determination. Because Alexandra is a fixer. She can unclog drains, patch dented walls, and remove stains from any rug. I already know what\u2019s going through her head at this moment: if her baby brother is busted, she\u2019ll just put him right back together again.</p><p>I wish it were that easy. But I don\u2019t think all the Krazy Glue in the world is going to piece my heart back together again.</p><p>Did I mention I\u2019m a bit of a poet too?</p><p>\u201cOkay. We can fix this, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Do I know my sister or what?</p><p>\u201cYou go take a long, hot shower. I\u2019ll clean up this disaster. Then, we\u2019re going out. The three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go out.\u201d Hasn\u2019t she been listening? \u201cI have the flu.\u201d</p><p>She smiles compassionately. \u201cYou need a good, hot meal. You need a shower. You\u2019ll feel better then.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s right. God knows what I\u2019ve been doing for the last seven days hasn\u2019t made me feel any better. I shrug and get up to do as she says. Like a four-year-old with his wooby, I bring my prized pillow with me.</p><p>On my way to the bathroom, I can\u2019t help but think of how it all happened. I had a good life once. A perfect life. And then it all got shot to shit.</p><p>Oh\u2014you want to know how? You want to hear my sob story? Okay, then. It all started a few months ago, on a normal Saturday night.</p><p>Well, normal for me anyway.</p><p>Four months earlier</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah. That\u2019s good. Yeah, like that.\u201d</p><p>See that guy\u2014black suit, devilishly handsome? Yeah, the guy getting the bl*w j*b from the luscious redhead in the bathroom stall? That\u2019s me. The real me. MBF: Me Before Flu.</p><p>\u201cJesus, baby, I\u2019m gonna come.\u201d</p><p>Let\u2019s freeze-frame here for a second.</p><p>For those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel, or any other generic endearment? Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking he\u2019s so into you, he\u2019s already thinking up pet names.</p><p>It\u2019s because he can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t care to remember your actual name.</p><p>And no girl wants to be called by the wrong name when she\u2019s on her knees giving you head in the men\u2019s room. So, just to be safe, I went with baby.</p><p>Her real name? Does it matter?</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby, I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>She removes her mouth with a pop and catches like a major leaguer as I jizz in her hand. Afterward, I move to the sink to clean up and zip up. Redhead looks at me with a smile as she rinses with a travel-sized bottle of mouthwash from her bag.</p><p>Charming.</p><p>\u201cHow about a drink?\u201d she asks, in what I\u2019m sure she thinks is a sultry voice.</p><p>But here\u2019s a fact for you\u2014once I\u2019m done, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not the kind of guy who rides the same rollercoaster twice. Once is enough, and then the thrill is gone and so is the interest.</p><p>But, my mother did raise me to be a gentleman. \u201cSure, sweetheart. You go find a table, I\u2019ll get us something from the bar.\u201d Redhead put in quite an effort sucking me off, after all. She\u2019s earned herself a drink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After leaving the bathroom, she heads for a table, and I go toward the oh-so-crowded bar. I did mention it was Saturday night, right? And this is REM. No, not R.E.M.\u2014rem, like REM sleep, as in when you dream. Get it?</p><p>It\u2019s the hottest club in New York City. Well, at least tonight it is. By next week it will be some other club. But the location doesn\u2019t matter. The script is always the same. Every weekend my friends and I come here together but leave separately\u2014and never alone.</p><p>Don\u2019t look at me like that. I\u2019m not a bad guy. I don\u2019t lie; I don\u2019t sandbag women with flowery words about a future together and love at first sight. I\u2019m a straight shooter. I\u2019m looking for a good time\u2014for one night\u2014and I tell them so. That\u2019s better than ninety percent of the other guys in here, believe me. And most of the girls in here are looking for the same thing I am.</p><p>Okay, maybe that\u2019s not exactly true. But I can\u2019t help it if they see me, f**k me, and suddenly want to bear my children. That\u2019s not my problem. Like I said, I tell them how it is, give them a good time and then the cab fare home. Thank you, good night. Don\u2019t call me, \u2019cause I sure as shit won\u2019t be calling you.</p> <p>Finally getting through the crowd to the bar, I order two drinks. I take a moment to watch the writhing, twisting bodies melt into each other on the dance floor as the music vibrates all around.</p><p>And then I see her, fifteen feet from where I\u2019m standing, waiting patiently but looking a bit uneasy amongst the arm-raising, money-waving, alcohol-craving herd trying to get the bartender\u2019s attention.</p><p>I told you I\u2019m poetic, right? The truth is, I wasn\u2019t always. Not until this moment. She\u2019s magnificent\u2014angelic\u2014gorgeous. Pick a word, any f**king word. The bottom line is, for a moment, I forget how to breathe.</p><p>Her hair is long and dark and shines even in the dim light of the club. She\u2019s wearing a red backless dress\u2014sexy but classy\u2014that accentuates every perfectly toned curve. Her mouth is full and lush, with lips begging to be ravished.</p><p>And her eyes. Sweet f**king Christ. Her eyes are large and round and endlessly dark. I imagine those eyes looking up at me as she takes my c*ck into her hot little mouth. The appendage in question immediately stirs to life at the thought. I have to have her.</p> <p>I quickly make my way over, deciding then and there that she is the lucky woman who\u2019ll have the pleasure of my company for the remainder of the night. And what a pleasure I intend to make it.</p><p>Arriving just as she\u2019s opening her mouth to order a drink, I intervene with, \u201cThe lady will have...\u201d I look her over to surmise what she would be drinking. This is a talent of mine. Some people are beer drinkers, some scotch and soda, some an aged wine, others are brandy or sweet champagne. And I can always tell who\u2019s what\u2014always. \u201c...a Veramonte Merlot, 2003.\u201d</p><p>She turns to me with a raised brow, and her eyes appraise me from head to toe. Deciding I\u2019m not a loser, she says, \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI see my reputation precedes me. Yes, I am. And you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She blushes. Actually turns frigging pink in the cheeks and looks away. Who blushes any more? It\u2019s goddamn adorable.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you say we find someplace more comfortable...and private? So we can get to know each other better?\u201d</p> <p>Without missing a beat, she says, \u201cI\u2019m here with friends. We\u2019re celebrating. I don\u2019t usually come to places like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we celebrating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got my MBA and start a new job on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What a coincidence. I\u2019m a finance guy myself. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of my firm? Evans, Reinhart and Fisher?\u201d We\u2019re the hottest boutique investment bank in the city, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019s duly impressed.</p><p>Let\u2019s just pause here again, shall we?</p><p>Did you see the rounding of this gorgeous woman\u2019s mouth when I told her where I am employed? Did you see the widening of her eyes? That should have told me something.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t notice at the time\u2014I was too busy checking out her tits. They\u2019re perfect, by the way. Smaller than what I usually go for, no more than a handful. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, a handful\u2019s all you need.</p><p>My point is, remember that look of surprise\u2014that will make sense later on. Now, back to the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWe have so much in common,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re both in business, we both like a good red...I think we owe it to ourselves to see where this could go tonight.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. It\u2019s a magical sound.</p><p>Now I should explain one thing here. With any other woman, on any other night, I\u2019d be in a cab by now, with my hand up her dress and my mouth making her moan. No question. For me, this is working for it. And strangely enough, it\u2019s kind of a turn-on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Drew, by the way.\u201d I hold out my hand. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>She holds up her hand. \u201cEngaged.\u201d</p><p>Undeterred, I take her hand and kiss her knuckle, grazing it ever so slightly with my tongue. I see my reluctant beauty try to suppress a shiver, and I know, despite her words, I\u2019m getting to her.</p><p>See, I\u2019m not the type who really listens to what people say. I look at how they say it. You can learn a lot about someone if you just take the time to watch the way they move, the shift of their eyes, the rise and fall of their voice.</p><p>Doe Eyes may be telling me no...but her body? Her body\u2019s screaming, Yes, yes, f**k me on the bar. In the span of three minutes, she\u2019s told me why she\u2019s here, what she does for a living, and allowed me to fondle her hand. Those are not the actions of a woman who is not interested\u2014those are the actions of a woman who does not want to be interested.</p><p>And I can definitely work with that.</p><p>I\u2019m about to comment on her engagement ring; the diamond is so small that even on close inspection, it can\u2019t be located. But I don\u2019t want to offend her. She said she\u2019s just graduated. I have friends who had to put themselves through business school, and the loans can be crushing.</p><p>So I go for a different tactic\u2014honesty. \u201cEven better. You don\u2019t do places like this? I don\u2019t do relationships. We\u2019re a perfect fit. We should explore this connection further, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She laughs again, and our drinks arrive. She picks hers up. \u201cThank you for the drink. I should get back to my friends now. It\u2019s been a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I give her a wicked smile, unable to help myself. \u201cBaby, if you let me take you out of here, I\u2019ll give the word pleasure a whole new meaning.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head with a smile, as if she\u2019s indulging a petulant child. Then she calls over her shoulder as she walks away, \u201cHave a good night, Mr. Evans.\u201d</p><p>Like I said, I am typically an observant man. Sherlock Holmes and I, we could hang out. But I\u2019m so enraptured by the view of that sweet ass, I miss it at first.</p><p>Did you notice? Did you catch the little detail that passed me by?</p><p>That\u2019s right. She called me \u201cMr. Evans\u201d\u2014but I never told her my last name. Remember that too.</p><p>For the moment, I let the dark-haired mystery woman retreat. I intend to give her some slack, then reel her in\u2014hook, line, and sinker. I plan to pursue her the rest of the night if I have to.</p><p>She\u2019s just that frigging hot.</p><p>But then Redhead\u2014yep the one from the men\u2019s room\u2014finds me. \u201cThere you are! I thought I lost you.\u201d She pushes her body up against my side and rubs my arm intimately. \u201cHow about we go to my place? It\u2019s just around the corner.\u201d</p><p>Ah, thanks\u2014but no thanks. Redhead has quickly become a fading memory. My sights are set on better, more intriguing prospects. I\u2019m about to tell her so when another redhead appears beside her.</p><p>\u201cThis is my sister, Mandy. I told her all about you. She thought the three of us could...you know...have a good time.\u201d</p><p>I turn my gaze on Redhead\u2019s sister\u2014her twin, actually. And just like that, my plans change. I know, I know...I said I don\u2019t ride the same coaster twice. But twin coasters?</p><p>Let me tell you, no man would pass up a ride like that.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>HAVE I MENTIONED that I love my job?</p><p>If my firm were Major League Baseball, I\u2019d be MVP. I\u2019m a partner at one of the top investment banks in New York City, specializing in media and technology. Yes, yes, my father and his two closest friends started the firm. But that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t bust my ass to get where I am\u2014because I did. It also doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t eat, breathe, and sleep work to earn the reputation I have, because I do.</p><p>What does an I-banker do, you ask? Well, you know in Pretty Woman, when Richard Gere tells Julia Roberts that his company buys up other ones and sells them off piece by piece? I\u2019m the guy who helps him do that. I negotiate the deals, draw up the contracts, manage due diligence, draft credit agreements, and many other things I\u2019m sure you have no interest hearing about.</p><p>Now you\u2019re probably asking yourself why a guy like me is quoting a chick flick like Pretty Woman?</p><p>The answer is simple: Growing up, my mother forced \u201cfamily movie night\u201d on her young children every single week. The Bitch got to choose the featured presentation every other week. She went through this whole Julia Roberts obsession and forced it down my throat for, like, a year. I could recite the goddamn thing verbatim. Though I have to admit\u2014Richard Gere. He\u2019s f**king cool.</p><p>Now back to my job.</p><p>The best part about it is the high I feel when I close a deal, a really good deal. It\u2019s like getting blackjack in a Vegas casino. It\u2019s like being picked by Jenna Jameson to be in her next porno. There is nothing\u2014and I mean nothing\u2014better.</p><p>I do the prospecting for my clients, recommend what moves they should make. I know which companies are dying to be bought and which ones need a hostile takeover. I\u2019m the one with the inside information about which media mogul is ready to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge because he spent too much of the company\u2019s profits on high-priced hookers.</p><p>Competition for clients is fierce. You have to entice them, make them want you, make them believe no one else can do for them what you can. It\u2019s kind of like getting laid. But instead of getting a piece of ass at the end of the day, I get a big, fat check. I make money for myself and my clients\u2014lots of it.</p><p>The sons of my father\u2019s partners also work here, Matthew Fisher and Steven Reinhart. Yes, that Steven\u2014The Bitch\u2019s husband. Like our fathers, the three of us grew up together, went to school together, and now work at the firm together. The old men leave the real work to us. They check in from time to time, to feel like they\u2019re still running things, and then head on out to the country club to get in an afternoon game of golf.</p><p>Matthew and Steven are good at the job too\u2014don\u2019t get me wrong. But I\u2019m the star. I\u2019m the shark. I\u2019m the one clients ask for and drowning companies fear. They know it and so do I.</p><p>Monday morning I\u2019m in my office at nine a.m., same as always. My secretary\u2014the smoking little blond with the nice rack\u2014is already there, ready with my schedule for the day, my messages from the weekend, and the best damn cup of coffee in the tri-state area. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, I haven\u2019t f**ked her.</p><p>Not that I wouldn\u2019t love to. Trust me, if she didn\u2019t work for me, I\u2019d hit that harder than Mohammed Ali.</p><p>But I have rules\u2014standards, you might say. One of them is no screwing around at the office. I don\u2019t shit where I eat, I don\u2019t f**k where I work. Never mind the sexual harassment issues it would bring up; it\u2019s just not good business. It\u2019s unprofessional.</p><p>So, because Erin is the only woman besides my blood relatives that I have platonic interactions with, she is also the only member of the opposite sex I\u2019ve ever considered a friend. We have a great working relationship. Erin is simply...awesome.</p> <p>That\u2019s another reason I wouldn\u2019t screw her even if she were spread-eagle on the desk begging for it. Believe it or not, a good secretary\u2014a really good one\u2014is hard to find. I\u2019ve had girls work for me who were dumber than a whole bucket of dirt. I\u2019ve had others who thought they could make it by just working on their backs, if you know what I mean. Those are the girls I want to meet in a bar on a Saturday night\u2014not the kind I want answering my phones Monday morning.</p><p>So now that you have a little insight? Let\u2019s go back to my descent into hell.</p><p>\u201cI moved your one o\u2019clock lunch with Mecha back to a four o\u2019clock meeting,\u201d Erin tells me as she hands me a stack of messages.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Mecha Communications is a multibillion-dollar media conglomerate. I\u2019ve been working on their acquisition of a Spanish-speaking cable network for months, and the CEO, Radolpho Scucini, is always more receptive on a full stomach.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She hands me a folder. \u201cToday\u2014lunch in the conference room. Your father\u2019s introducing the new associate. You know how he is about these things.\u201d</p><p>You ever see A Christmas Carol? Of course you have\u2014some version of it\u2019s on some channel, somewhere, every day before Christmas. Well, you know when the Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge back in time to when he was young and happy? And he had that boss, Fezziwig, the fat guy who threw the big parties? Yeah, that guy. That\u2019s my father.</p><p>My dad loves this company and sees all his employees as extended family. He looks for any excuse to throw an office party. Birthday parties, baby showers, Thanksgiving luncheons, President\u2019s Day buffets, Columbus Day dinners...need I go on?</p><p>It\u2019s a miracle any actual work gets accomplished.</p><p>And Christmas? Forget about it. My father\u2019s Christmas parties are legendary. Everybody goes home shitfaced. Some people don\u2019t go home at all. Last year we caught ten employees from a rival bank trying to sneak in, just because the soir\u00e9e is that frigging fantastic. And it\u2019s all done to achieve the atmosphere\u2014the vibe\u2014my father wants in this firm.</p> <p>He loves his employees, and they love him right back. Devotion, loyalty\u2014we\u2019ve got it in spades. That\u2019s part of what makes us the best. Because the people who work here would pretty much sell their firstborn for my old man.</p><p>Still, there are days\u2014days like today, when I need the time to romance a client\u2014that his celebrations can be a royal pain in the ass. But it is what it is.</p><p>My Monday morning is packed, so I get to my desk and start working. Then, before I can blink, it\u2019s one o\u2019clock and I\u2019m heading to the conference room. I spot a familiar head of bright orange hair attached to a short stocky-framed body. That would be Jack O\u2019Shay. Jack started at the firm about six years ago, the same year I did. He\u2019s a good guy and frequent weekend comrade. Next to him is Matthew, talking animatedly as he pushes a large hand through his sandy-colored hair.</p><p>I grab my food from the buffet and join them just as Matthew is recounting his Saturday night. \u201cSo then she breaks out handcuffs and a whip. A f**king whip! I thought I was going to lose it right there, I swear to Christ. I mean...she went to a convent...actually studied to be a goddamn nun, man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, the quiet ones are always into the kinky shit,\u201d Jack adds with a laugh.</p><p>Matthew turns his hazel eyes to Steven and tells him, \u201cSeriously, dude. You gotta come out with us. Just once, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>I smirk at that because I know exactly what\u2019s coming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, have you met my wife?\u201d Steven asks, his brow wrinkled in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a bitch,\u201d Jack ribs him. \u201cTell her you\u2019re going to play cards or something. Live a little.\u201d</p><p>Steven takes off his glasses and wipes the lenses with a napkin as he appears to consider the idea.</p><p>\u201cRiiiight. And when she finds out\u2014and Alexandra will definitely find out, I assure you\u2014she\u2019ll serve me my balls on a silver platter. With a nice garlic butter dipping sauce on the side and a good Chianti.\u201d</p><p>He makes a slurping sound \u00e0 la Hannibal Lecter that has me laughing my ass off.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he gloats, replacing his spectacles and stretching his hands over his head, \u201cI got filet mignon at home, boys. I\u2019m not interested in Sloppy Joes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPussy,\u201d Matthew coughs out, while Jack shakes his head at my brother-in-law and says, \u201cEven a nice filet gets old if you eat it every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot,\u201d Steven defends suggestively, \u201cif you cook it a different way every time. My baby knows how to keep my meals spicy.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand up and plead, \u201cPlease. Please just stop there.\u201d There are just some visuals I don\u2019t want in my head. Ever.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Drew? I saw you leave with those twins. Were they real redheads?\u201d Jack asks me.</p><p>I feel the satisfied smile stretch over my lips. \u201cOh yeah. They were real.\u201d And then I go on to describe my wild Saturday night in vivid, delicious detail.</p><p>Okay, let\u2019s just stop right now because I can see that judgmental look on your face. And I can hear your high-pitched disapproval too: What a jerk. He had sex with a girl\u2014well, in this case, two girls\u2014and now he\u2019s telling his friends all about it. That\u2019s sooo disrespectful.</p><p>First of all, if a chick wants me to respect her, she needs to act like someone worth respecting. Second, I\u2019m not trying to be a dick; I\u2019m just being a guy. And all guys talk to their friends about sex.</p><p>Let me repeat that in case you missed it:</p><p>ALL GUYS TALK TO THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT SEX.</p><p>If a guy tells you he doesn\u2019t? Dump him, because he\u2019s lying to you.</p><p>And another thing\u2014I\u2019ve heard my sister and her little friends have their chats too. Some of the things that came out of their mouths could\u2019ve made Larry f**king Flynt blush. So don\u2019t act like women don\u2019t talk just as much as us guys do...because I know for a fact they do.</p><p>After expounding on the finer points of my weekend, the talk at the table turns to football and the effectiveness of Manning\u2019s offense. In the background, I hear my father\u2019s voice as he stands at the front of the room, detailing the grand accomplishments of the newest associate, whose file I didn\u2019t bother opening this morning. Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, first in her class, interned with Credit Suisse, blah...blah...blah.</p><p>The chatter fades away as my thoughts turn to the part of my Saturday night that I didn\u2019t bother telling my friends about: the interaction with one brunette goddess, to be exact. I can still see those dark round eyes so clearly in my head. That luscious mouth, the luminous hair that could not have possibly been as soft as it looked.</p><p>It isn\u2019t the first time her image has popped into my head, unbidden, in the last day and a half. In fact, it seems like every hour a picture of some part of her comes to me, and I find myself imagining what happened to her. Or, more to the point, what could have happened if I had stuck around and gone after her.</p><p>It\u2019s strange. I\u2019m not one to reminisce about the randoms I meet during my weekend adventures. Usually, they fade from my thoughts the moment I escape their bed. But there was just something about her. Maybe it\u2019s because she turned me down. Maybe it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t get her name. Or maybe it was that sweetly toned ass that made me want to grab on and never let go.</p><p>As the images in my mind turn to focus on that particular feature, a familiar stirring begins in the southern region, if you catch my drift. I mentally shake myself. I haven\u2019t gotten a spontaneous hard-on since I was twelve. What\u2019s up with that?</p><p>Looks like I\u2019m going to have to call that hottie who slipped me her number in the coffeehouse this morning. Normally I reserve those kinds of activities for weekends, but apparently my dick would like to make an exception.</p><p>By this time, I\u2019ve made it toward the front of the room, in line for the customary handshake of welcome given to all new employees. As I near the head of the line, my father spots me and comes over to greet me with an affectionate slap on the back.</p><p>\u201cGlad you made it, Drew. This new girl has some real potential. I want you to personally take her under your wing, help her get her feet wet. You do that, Son, and I guarantee you she\u2019ll take off and do us all proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Dad. No problem.\u201d</p><p>Great. Like I don\u2019t have my own work to take care of. Now I have to hold a newbie\u2019s hand as she navigates the dark, scary world of Corporate America. That\u2019s just perfect.</p><p>Thanks, Dad.</p><p>Finally, my turn has come. Her back is to me as I step up. I take in her sleek dark hair pulled into a low bun, her tiny, petite frame. My eyes drift down her back as she speaks to someone in front of her. On instinct they fall to her ass and...wait.</p><p>Wait one goddamn minute.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen that ass before.</p><p>No f**king way.</p><p>She turns around.</p><p>Way.</p><p>The smile on her face broadens as her eyes connect with mine. Endless, shining eyes that I didn\u2019t remember dreaming about till just now. She raises a brow of recognition and holds out her hand. \u201cMr. Evans.\u201d</p><p>I feel my mouth open and close, but no words come out. The shock of seeing her again\u2014here of all places\u2014must have momentarily frozen the part of my brain that controls speech. As the synapses start to function once more, I hear my father saying, \u201c...Brooks. Katherine Brooks. She\u2019s going places, Son, and with your help she\u2019ll be taking us with her.\u201d</p><p>Katherine Brooks.</p><p>The girl from the bar. The girl who I let get away. The girl whose mouth I\u2019m still desperate to feel around my cock.</p><p>And she works here. In my office, where I have sworn to never...ever...screw around. Her warm, soft hand slides perfectly into mine, and two thoughts enter my head simultaneously.</p><p>The first is: God hates me. The second is: I have been a naughty, naughty boy for most of my life, and this is my payback. And you know what they say about payback, right?</p><p>Yep. She\u2019s one hairy bitch.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>I AM ALL ABOUT SELF-DETERMINATION. Will. Control. I determine my path in life. I decide my failures and successes. Screw fate. Destiny can kiss my ass. If I want something badly enough, I can have it. If I focus, sacrifice, there is nothing I can\u2019t do.</p><p>What is the point of my posturing, you ask? Why do I sound like the featured speaker at a self-help convention? What exactly am I trying to say?</p><p>In a nutshell: I control my dick. My dick does not control me. At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling myself for the last hour and a half. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>See me there, at my desk, mumbling like a goddamn schizophrenic off his meds?</p><p>That\u2019s me reminding myself of the tenets, the sacred beliefs that have gotten me this far in life. The ones that have made me an uncontested success in the bedroom and in the office. The ones that have never failed me before. The ones that I am dying to throw out the f**king window. All because of the woman in the office down the hall.</p><p>Katherine Everyone-Calls-Me-Kate Brooks.</p><p>Talk about a frigging curveball.</p> <p>The way I see it, I could still go for the gold. Technically speaking, I didn\u2019t meet Kate at work; I met her in a bar. That means she could forgo the label of \u201ccoworker\u201d and retain the \u201crandom hook-up\u201d status with which she was originally designated.</p><p>What? I\u2019m a businessman; it\u2019s my job to find loopholes.</p><p>So, in theory at least, I could definitely nail her and not undermine my own personal laws of nature. The problem with that strategy, of course, is what happens after.</p><p>The longing glances, the hopeful eyes, the pathetic attempts to make me jealous. The supposedly \u201caccidental\u201d meetings, the questions about my plans, the seemingly casual walks past my office door. All of which would inevitably escalate into disturbing semi-stalkerish behavior.</p><p>Some women can handle a one-night stand. Others can\u2019t. And I have definitely been on the wrong end of those who can\u2019t.</p> <p>It ain\u2019t pretty.</p><p>So, you see, no matter how badly I want to, no matter how hard the little head is trying to lead me down that road, it\u2019s not the kind of thing I want to bring into my place of business. My sanctuary\u2014my second home.</p><p>It\u2019s not going to happen. Period.</p><p>That\u2019s it. End of discussion.</p><p>Case closed.</p><p>Kate Brooks is officially scratched off my list of potentials. She is forbidden, untouchable, a no-way-never. Right next to my friends\u2019 ex-girlfriends, the boss\u2019s daughter, and my sister\u2019s best friends.</p> <p>Well, that last category is a bit of a gray area. When I was eighteen, Alexandra\u2019s best friend, Cheryl Phillips, spent the summer at our house. God bless her\u2014that girl had a mouth like a Hoover vacuum. Lucky for me, The Bitch never learned of her friend\u2019s two a.m. visits to my room. There would have been hell to pay\u2014I\u2019m talking fire-and-brimstone-of-apocalyptic-proportions hell\u2014if she had.</p><p>Anyway, where was I?</p><p>Oh, right. I was explaining that I have come to the unequivocal decision that Kate Brooks\u2019s ass is one that I, sadly, am never going to tap. And I\u2019m okay with that. Really.</p><p>And I almost believe myself.</p><p>Right up until she shows up at my door.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing glasses. The dark-rimmed kind. The female version of Clark Kent\u2019s. They would be geeky-looking and unattractive on most women. But not her. On the bridge of that tiny nose, framing those long-lashed beauties, with her hair swept up in that slightly loosened bun, they are nothing short of full-out sexy.</p><p>As she starts to speak, my mind is suddenly filled with every hot-teacher fantasy I\u2019ve ever had. They\u2019re playing out in my mind right next to the ones about the seemingly sexually repressed librarian who\u2019s really a leather-wearing, handcuff-bearing nymphomaniac.</p> <p>While all this is going on in my head, she\u2019s still talking.</p><p>What the f**k is she saying?</p><p>I close my eyes to stop myself from staring at her glistening lips. So I can actually process the words coming out of her mouth:</p><p>\u201c...father said you could help me with it.\u201d She stops and looks at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was distracted. You want to sit down and run that by me again?\u201d I ask, my voice never betraying the horniness inside me.</p><p>Once again, to the ladies out there\u2014here\u2019s a fact for you: Men pretty much have sex on the brain twenty-four-seven. The exact figure is like every 5.2 seconds or some shit like that.</p><p>The point is, when you ask, \u201cWhat do you want for dinner?\u201d we\u2019re thinking about screwing you on the kitchen counter. When you\u2019re telling us about the sappy film you watched with your girlfriends last week, we\u2019re thinking about the porno we saw on cable last night. When you show us the designer shoes you bought on sale, we\u2019re thinking how nice they would look on our shoulders.</p><p>I just thought you\u2019d want to know. Don\u2019t shoot the messenger.</p><p>It\u2019s a curse, really.</p><p>Personally, I blame Adam. Now there was a guy who had the world by the balls. Walking around nak*d, a hot chick to satisfy his every whim. I sure hope that apple was tasty, \u2019cause he really f**ked it up for the rest of us. Now we have to work for it. Or, in my case, try desperately not to want it.</p><p>She sits in the chair across from my desk and crosses her legs.</p><p>Don\u2019t look at the legs. Don\u2019t look at the legs.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>They\u2019re toned, tan, and smooth-looking as silk. I lick my lips and force my eyes to hers.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she begins again, \u201cI\u2019ve been working up a portfolio on a programming company, Genesis. Have you heard of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely,\u201d I answer, looking down at the papers on my desk to stem the flow of indecent images the sound of her voice calls forth from my deviant mind.</p><p>I am a bad, bad boy. Think Kate will punish me if I tell her how bad I am?</p><p>I know. I know. I just can\u2019t help myself.</p><p>\u201cThey posted three million EBIT last quarter,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know it\u2019s not earth shattering, but it shows they have a solid base. They\u2019re still small, but that\u2019s part of what has made them good. Their programmers are young and hungry. Rumor has it, they\u2019ve got ideas that will make the Wii look more like an Atari. And they have the brains to make them happen. What they don\u2019t have is the capital.\u201d</p><p>She stands and leans over my desk to pass me a folder. I\u2019m assailed with a sweet but flowery scent. It\u2019s delectable, alluring\u2014not like the grandma whose perfume practically chokes you to death when she walks by you at the post office.</p><p>I have the urge to sink my face into her hair and inhale deeply.</p><p>But I resist and open the folder instead.</p><p>\u201cI showed what I have to Mr. Evans...uh, your father, and he told me to run it by you. He thought one of your clients\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlphacom.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cRight. He thought Alphacom would be interested.\u201d</p><p>I look over the work she\u2019s done so far. It\u2019s good. Detailed and informative but focused. Slowly, my brain\u2014the one above my shoulders, anyway\u2014starts to shift gears. If there\u2019s one topic that has any hope of derailing me from thoughts about sex, it\u2019s work. A good deal. I can definitely smell potential here.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t smell as delicious as Kate Brooks, but it\u2019s close.</p><p>\u201cThis is good, Kate. Very good. I could definitely sell this to Seanson. He\u2019s Alphacom\u2019s CEO.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow just a bit. \u201cBut, you\u2019ll keep me on board, right?\u201d</p><p>I smirk, \u201cOf course. Do I look like the type who needs to steal other people\u2019s proposals?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and smiles. This time, I just can\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, Mr. Evans. I didn\u2019t mean to imply...it\u2019s just...you know...first day.\u201d</p><p>I motion for her to sit back down, and she does. \u201cWell, I\u2019d say from the looks of this, you\u2019re having one hell of a first day. And, please, it\u2019s Drew.\u201d</p><p>She nods. I lean back in my chair appraising her. My eyes rake over her from head to toe in a completely unprofessional manner. I know it. But I just can\u2019t seem to make myself give a damn.</p><p>\u201cSo...celebrating a new job, huh?\u201d I ask, referring to her comment at REM on Saturday.</p><p>She bites her lip, and my slacks tighten as I stir and harden\u2014again. If this keeps up, I\u2019m going to have one hell of a case of blue balls when I get home.</p><p>\u201cYes. New job.\u201d She shrugs, then says, \u201cI guessed who you were when you told me your name and the name of your firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of me?\u201d I ask, truly curious.</p><p>\u201cSure. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many in this field who haven\u2019t read about Evans, Reinhart and Fisher\u2019s golden boy in Business Weekly...or Page Six for that matter.\u201d</p><p>Her last words refer to the gossip columns on whose pages I frequently appear.</p><p>\u201cIf the only reason you blew me off is because I work here,\u201d I say, \u201cI can have my resignation on my father\u2019s desk within the hour.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and then, with a faint blush coloring her cheeks, replies, \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t the only reason.\u201d She holds up her hand to remind me of the almost-invisible engagement ring. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you glad now that I turned you down? I mean, it would have been pretty awkward if something had happened between us. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>My face is completely serious as I tell her, \u201cWould\u2019ve been worth it.\u201d</p><p>She raises her brows in doubt. \u201cEven though I\u2019m working under you now?\u201d</p><p>Now, come on\u2014she walked right into that one, and she knows it. Working under me? How in the hell am I supposed to ignore that?</p><p>Yet I merely c*ck an eyebrow, and she shakes her head and chuckles again.</p><p>With a feral smile, I ask her, \u201cI\u2019m not making you uncomfortable, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all. But do you treat all your employees this way? Because I have to tell you, you\u2019re leaving yourself wide open for a lawsuit.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help the smile that comes to my lips. She\u2019s such a surprise. Sharp. Quick. I have to think before I speak to her. I like it.</p><p>I like her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t treat all my employees this way. Ever. Only one, who I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about since Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so maybe I wasn\u2019t thinking about her when the twins were double-teaming me. But it\u2019s at least partly true.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible,\u201d she says in a way that tells me she thinks I\u2019m cute.</p><p>I\u2019m a lot of things, baby. Cute isn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>\u201cI see something I want, and I go after it. I\u2019m used to getting what I want.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ll never hear a truer statement about me than that. But let\u2019s put things on hold for a minute here, okay? So I can give you the full picture.</p><p>See, my mother, Anne, always wanted a big family\u2014five, maybe six kids. But Alexandra is six years older than me. Six years may not seem like a lot to you, but to my mother it was a lifetime. The way the story goes, after Alexandra, my mother couldn\u2019t get pregnant again\u2014and it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying. \u201cSecondary infertility,\u201d they called it. When my sister was four, my mother had pretty much given up hope of ever having any more kids.</p><p>And then guess what? I came along.</p><p>Surprise.</p><p>I was her miracle baby. Her precious angel from God. Her granted wish. Her answered prayer. And she wasn\u2019t the only one who thought so. My father was thrilled, just as grateful to have another child\u2014and a son at that. And Alexandra\u2014this was the pre-Bitch years\u2014was ecstatic to finally have a baby brother.</p><p>I was what my family had wanted and waited five years for. I was the little prince. I could do no wrong. There was nothing I wanted that I couldn\u2019t have. I was the most handsome, the most brilliant. There was no one kinder, none sweeter than me. I was loved beyond words\u2014doted on and catered to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, if you think I\u2019m arrogant? Selfish? Spoiled? You\u2019re probably right. But don\u2019t hold it against me. It\u2019s not my fault. I am a product of how I was raised.</p><p>Now that that\u2019s out of the way\u2014back to my office. This next part is big.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think you should know, I want you, Kate.\u201d</p><p>See the flush on her cheeks, the slight surprise on her face? See how her face turns serious, and she meets my eyes and then looks down at the floor?</p> <p>I\u2019m getting to her. She wants me too. She\u2019s fighting it. But it\u2019s there. I could have her. I could lead her right where she is dying to go.</p><p>The knowledge makes me swallow a groan as the guy downstairs reacts with a vengeance. I want to walk up to her and kiss her until she can\u2019t stand. I want to slide my tongue between those ripe lips until her knees give out from under her. I want to pick her up, wrap her legs around my waist, lean her up against the wall and...</p><p>\u201cHey, Drew. There\u2019s a traffic jam on Fifty-Third. If you want to make your four o\u2019clock, you should get going.\u201d</p><p>Thank you, Erin. Way to kill the moment. Awesome secretary\u2014horrible timing.</p><p>Kate gets up from her chair, her shoulders stiff, her back straight. She inches toward the door and refuses to look me in the eyes. \u201cSo, thanks for your time, Mr. Evans. You...ah...let me know when you want me.\u201d</p> <p>I raise my brows suggestively at her words. I love that she\u2019s flustered\u2014and that I\u2019m the one who did it to her.</p><p>Still avoiding eye contact, she grimaces slightly. \u201cAbout Alphacom and Genesis. Let me know what I should do...what you want me to do...what...oh, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Before she\u2019s out the door, my voice stops her. \u201cKate?\u201d</p><p>She turns to me, her eyes questioning.</p><p>I point to myself. \u201cIt\u2019s Drew.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. Recovering herself. Her natural confidence finding its way back into her eyes.</p> <p>Then she meets my gaze full on. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll see you later, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019s out the door, I say only to myself, \u201cOh, yes. Yes, you will.\u201d</p><p>As I check my briefcase to leave for my meeting, I realize this attraction\u2014no, that\u2019s not a strong enough word\u2014this need that I have for Kate Brooks isn\u2019t just going to go away. I can try and fight it, but I\u2019m only a man, for God\u2019s sake. Left unresolved, my desire for her could turn my office, the place I love, into a torture chamber of sexual frustration.</p><p>I can\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>So, I have three options: I can quit. I could get Kate to quit. Or I can entice her to share one profoundly pleasurable night with me. Get it out of both of our systems\u2014consequences be damned.</p><p>Guess which one I\u2019m going to pick?</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>TURNS OUT I DIDN\u2019T GET BLUE BALLS after all. I met up with the coffee house girl that night. She\u2019s a yoga instructor.</p> <p>Nice.</p><p>What? Come on, don\u2019t be like that. I want Kate, no question. But don\u2019t expect me to act like a monk until it happens. The thing women don\u2019t understand is that a guy can want one woman and still f**k another one. Hell, a guy could love a woman and still f**k ten others. It\u2019s just the way it is.</p><p>Sex is a release. Purely physical. That\u2019s all. At least to men it is.</p><p>Okay, okay\u2014calm down\u2014don\u2019t start throwing shoes at me or something.</p><p>At least to this man it is. Better?</p><p>Maybe you\u2019ll understand my point of view if I put it this way. You brush your teeth, right? Well, suppose your favorite toothpaste is Aquafresh. But the store is out. All they have is Colgate. What are you going to do? You\u2019re going to use the Colgate, right?</p><p>You may want to brush with Aquafresh, but when all is said and done, you use what you have to keep those pearly whites clean. See my way of thinking? Good.</p><p>Now, back to my tale of heartache and pain.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seduced a woman before.</p><p>Shocking, I know.</p><p>Let me clarify. I\u2019ve never had to seduce a woman before, not in the typical sense. Usually, it just takes a look, a wink, a smile. A friendly greeting, maybe a drink or two. After that, the only verbal exchange involves short one-word phrases like harder, more, lower...you get the point.</p><p>So the whole conversing-a-woman-into-bed concept is pretty new to me, I\u2019ll admit. But I\u2019m not worried. Why not, you ask?</p><p>Because I play chess.</p><p>Chess is a game of strategy, planning. Of thinking two steps ahead of your next move. Of guiding your opponent right where you need them to be.</p><p>For the two weeks following her first day, dealing with Kate, for me, is exactly like playing chess. A few suggestive words, some innocent but seductive caresses. I won\u2019t bore you with details of every conversation. I\u2019ll just say that things are progressing nicely; everything is going according to plan.</p><p>I figure it\u2019ll take another week\u2014two tops\u2014till I\u2019m able to claim that golden treasure between her creamy thighs. I already know how it will play out. I\u2019ve spent hours in fact, imagining it, fantasizing about it.</p><p>Want to hear it?</p><p>It will happen in my office, one night when we\u2019re both working late\u2014the only ones left. She\u2019ll be tired, stiff. I\u2019ll offer to rub her neck, and she\u2019ll let me. Then I\u2019ll lean down and kiss her, starting at her shoulder, trailing up her neck, tasting her skin with my tongue. Finally, our lips will meet. And it will be hot\u2014f**king scorching. And she\u2019ll forget all about the reasons why we shouldn\u2019t: our mutual place of work, her stupid fianc\u00e9. The only thing she\u2019ll be thinking of is me and the things my expert hands will be doing to her.</p><p>I have a couch in my office. It\u2019s suede\u2014not leather. Does suede stain? Hope not. Because that\u2019s where we\u2019ll end up\u2014on that sorrowfully underused couch.</p><p>Now let me ask you this: Have you seen those commercials that say how life can change in an instant?</p><p>Yes, yes, I\u2019m going somewhere with this\u2014just bear with me.</p><p>You know the ones I\u2019m talking about, don\u2019t you? Where the happy family is driving down Main Street on a bright sunny day and then...BAM. Head-on collision with a semi. And daddy goes flying out the window because he didn\u2019t have his seat belt buckled.</p><p>They\u2019re designed to scare the shit out of us. And they do. But the fact remains they are also chock-full of truth. Our goals, our priorities can change instantaneously\u2014usually when we least expect it.</p><p>So, after two weeks of strategizing and fantasizing, I\u2019m sure that Kate Brooks will be my next one-nighter. I can\u2019t remember wanting someone as much as I want her. I\u2019ve definitely never waited for a woman as long as I\u2019ve waited for her. But the point is, for me, it\u2019s a done deal\u2014a foregone conclusion\u2014not an if but simply a when.</p><p>And then, on Monday afternoon, my father calls me into his office.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Son. There\u2019s some business I\u2019d like to discuss.\u201d</p><p>My father often calls me in here to talk about things he\u2019s not yet ready to share with the rest of the staff. \u201cI just got off the phone with Saul Anderson. He\u2019s looking to diversify. He\u2019s coming to the city next month to shop around for ideas.\u201d</p><p>Saul Anderson is a media tycoon. Big money\u2014the kind of guy that makes Rupert Murdoch look like a peon. Got a napkin? \u2019Cause I think I\u2019m drooling.</p><p>\u201cNext month? Okay, I can work with that. No problem.\u201d I feel the excitement pumping in my veins. This is how a shark must feel after somebody dumps a great big bucket of bloody chum in the water. It\u2019s a rush.</p><p>\u201cDrew...\u201d my father interrupts, but my mind\u2019s too busy whirling with ideas to hear him.</p><p>\u201cAny clue what he\u2019s looking to get into? I mean the possibilities are pretty endless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon...\u201d my father tries again.</p><p>You can see it coming, can\u2019t you?</p><p>Yet I ramble on, \u201cCable stations are cash cows. Social media\u2019s in the toilet right now, so we could pick up some real bargains. Film production is always a safe bet, and that would cut down on the overhead when they replay on his own network.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew, I\u2019m going to give the account to Kate Brooks.\u201d</p><p>Hold the f**king phone. Care to repeat that for me?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good, Drew. I\u2019m telling you, she\u2019s damn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been here for two weeks!\u201d</p><p>Dogs are territorial. You know that, right? That\u2019s why at the park they seem to have a never-ending supply of piss, which they insist on stopping every four seconds to spread around. It\u2019s because they believe it\u2019s their park. And they want the other dogs to know it, to know that they were there first. It\u2019s the nonverbal way of pretty much saying, \u201cFuck off\u2014find your own park.\u201d</p><p>Men are the same way.</p><p>Not that I\u2019m going to piss a circle around my desk or anything, but this firm is mine. I\u2019ve nurtured these clients since they were tiny corporations. I\u2019ve watched, like a proud papa, as they grew to sturdy conglomerates. I\u2019ve wined them, I\u2019ve dined them. I\u2019ve put in hour after hour, years of sleepless nights. My job isn\u2019t just what I do\u2014it\u2019s who I am. And I will be damned if Kate Brooks is going to walk her ass in here and take that away from me.</p><p>No matter how fine an ass it might be.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d my father says, \u201cand have you seen some of the stuff she\u2019s come up with in these two weeks? She\u2019s the first one in and the last one to leave\u2014every day. She\u2019s fresh and thinks outside the box. She\u2019s come up with some of the most innovative investments I\u2019ve ever seen. My instincts are telling me to give her the ball and see what she\u2019ll do with it.\u201d</p><p>What are the early warning signs for dementia, exactly?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll frigging fumble\u2014that\u2019s what she\u2019ll do!\u201d I yell. But I know from experience dramatics will get me nowhere with my father, so I pinch my nose to try and calm down. \u201cOkay, Dad, I hear what you\u2019re saying. But Saul Anderson is not a client you pass someone off to just to see if they can cut it. He\u2019s someone you give to your best and brightest. Someone you know can take him all the way to the end zone. And that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Isn\u2019t it? I wonder as uncertainty clouds his features.</p><p>As my father\u2019s silence stretches on, my stomach twists in my gut. It\u2019s not that I have a daddy complex or anything, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t enjoy the pride my father takes in my performance at the office. I\u2019m his right-hand man. His go-to guy. When we\u2019re down by two with five left on the clock, you can bet your ass I\u2019m the only one John Evans will pass the ball to.</p><p>Or at least I used to be.</p><p>I\u2019m accustomed to having his undivided confidence. The fact that confidence seems to be wavering is...well...it f**king hurts.</p><p>\u201cTell you what.\u201d He sighs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a month. Come up with a presentation. Have Kate do the same. Whoever can knock my socks off gets a crack at Anderson.\u201d</p><p>I should be insulted, really. What he\u2019s asking is the equivalent of telling an Oscar winner he\u2019s got to audition to play a frigging extra. But I don\u2019t argue. I\u2019m too busy planning my next move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, you see what I was saying about life?</p><p>Just like that, Kate Brooks has changed from a woman I couldn\u2019t wait to do the nasty dance with to someone I can\u2019t wait to crush under my boot. My adversary. My competition. My enemy.</p><p>It\u2019s not her fault. I know. Now ask me if I care.</p><p>Nope\u2014not even a little.</p><p>In full-out combat mode, I return to headquarters\u2014otherwise known as my office. I give Erin a few orders and work the rest of the afternoon. Around six o\u2019clock, I have Erin call Kate into my office.</p><p>Always keep the home-field advantage. Play on your own turf. Remember that.</p><p>She comes in and sits down, her expression unreadable.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Drew?\u201d</p><p>Her hair is down, framing her face in a long glossy curtain. For a second, I imagine what it would feel like tickling my chest, draping across my thighs.</p><p>I shake my head. Focus, Evans, focus.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a dark burgundy suit with matching heels. Kate is into the high heels. I think because she\u2019s naturally petite, the height advantage they give makes her feel more confident at the office.</p><p>Guys love heels. We associate them with all kinds of fantastic sexual positions. If you want a man to notice you, you cannot go wrong with a pair of shiny four-inch stilettos, I swear.</p><p>As my eyes continue to roam over her from head to toe, a problem, shall we say, arises. Although my mind recognizes that Kate Brooks is now my rival, apparently my c*ck hasn\u2019t gotten the memo.</p><p>And he, judging from his reaction, still wants to make friends.</p><p>So I picture Miss Gurgle, my fifth grade science teacher, in my mind. She was a beast of a woman. A retired female wrestler\u2014not the bikini kind. She had a mole on her right cheek that was so big, we were sure it was the head of a twin that hadn\u2019t separated in the womb. It was disgusting but strangely hypnotic at the same time\u2014you couldn\u2019t help but stare at it. It jiggled when she spoke, like a bowl full of Jell-O.</p><p>I shudder slightly, but it does the trick. All\u2019s clear down below.</p><p>\u201cSaul Anderson is coming to the city next month,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>Her brows rise. \u201cSaul Anderson? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d I tell her, all business. No more pleasure for her. \u201cMy father would like you to put together a mock presentation. A run-through, as if you were really going to pitch a client. He thinks it would be good practice for you.\u201d</p><p>I know, I know...you think I\u2019m a scumbag. I\u2019m not even giving her a fair chance. Well, get over it. This is business. And in business\u2014like war\u2014all is fair.</p><p>I expect her to be excited. I expect her to be grateful. She isn\u2019t either of these.</p><p>Her lips press together in a tight line, and her expression turns serious. \u201cPractice, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not a big deal; don\u2019t put yourself out. Just throw something together for him. A hypothetical.\u201d</p> <p>She folds her arms in front of her chest and tilts her head to the side. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting, Drew. Considering your father just told me he hasn\u2019t decided who\u2019s getting Anderson yet. That it would come down to you or me, whoever put together the more impressive strategy. The way he explained it, it sounds like a very big deal.\u201d</p><p>Uh oh.</p><p>When I was twelve, Matthew and I snagged a Hustler magazine from a convenience store. My father caught me with it in my room before I\u2019d had the chance to hide it under my mattress. The look on my face at this moment is very similar to the one I wore then.</p><p>Busted.</p><p>\u201cPlaying a little dirty, are we?\u201d she asks, her eyes narrow with suspicion.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself, sweetheart. Anderson\u2019s coming to me. My father\u2019s just throwing you a bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019ve had your lips attached to his ass since you started. I\u2019m surprised he can still stand up straight. He figures this will get you off his back for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Always strike first\u2014remember that too. The team who scores first? They\u2019re almost always the team who wins. Look it up if you don\u2019t believe me.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m trying to shake her confidence. Yes, I\u2019m trying to throw her off her game.</p><p>Sue me.</p><p>I told you my history. I told you how I grew up. I never had to share my toys; I don\u2019t plan on sharing my clients.</p><p>Ask any four-year-old\u2014sharing sucks.</p><p>When she speaks, her tone is lethal, sharp as a f**king machete. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to work together, Drew, I think we should get a few things straight. I\u2019m not your sweetheart. My name is Kate\u2014Katherine. Use it. And I\u2019m not a kiss-ass. I don\u2019t have to be. My work speaks for itself. My intelligence, my determination\u2014that\u2019s what got your father to notice me. And obviously he thinks you\u2019re a bit lacking in those departments since he\u2019s considering me for Anderson.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Certainly goes right for the jugular, doesn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cAnd I know women probably fall all over themselves to get your attention and one of your charming smiles,\u201d she continues, \u201cbut that\u2019s not going to happen with me. I don\u2019t plan on being one of your groupies or a notch on your bedpost, so you can save your lines, your smile, and your bullshit for someone else.\u201d</p><p>She rises to her feet and rests her hands on the edge of my desk, leaning over.</p><p>Hey, you know if I just sit up a little bit more, I could see right down her blouse. I love that spot on a woman. That valley just between her\u2014</p><p>Stop it!</p><p>Mentally, I slap myself. And she goes on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re used to being number one around here. You\u2019re used to being daddy\u2019s special little man. Well, there\u2019s a new player in town. Deal with it. I\u2019ve worked damn hard to get this job, and I plan on making a name for myself. You don\u2019t like sharing the spotlight? Too bad. You can either make room for me at the table, or I\u2019ll step on you when you get in my way. Either way, you can bet your ass I\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>She turns to go but then looks back at me, her lips curved into a saccharine smile. \u201cOh, and I would say good luck with Anderson, but I won\u2019t bother. All the luck in Ireland isn\u2019t going to help you. Saul Anderson is mine...sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she turns and stalks out of my office, right past Matthew and Jack, who stand in my doorway open-mouthed.</p><p>\u201cWell...damn,\u201d Matthew says.</p><p>\u201cOkay, is anyone else turned on right now?\u201d Jack asks. \u201cSeriously, I got wood here \u2019cause that\u2014\u201d he points in the direction Kate just went \u201c\u2014that was f**king hot.\u201d</p><p>It was hot. Kate Brooks is a beautiful woman. But when she\u2019s pissed off, she\u2019s spectacular.</p><p>Steven walks in with a cup of coffee in his hand. Seeing the looks on our faces, he asks, \u201cWhat? What\u2019d I miss?\u201d</p><p>Matthew all too happily tells him, \u201cDrew is losing his touch. He just got verbally bitch-slapped. By a girl.\u201d</p><p>Steven nods grimly and says, \u201cWelcome to my world, man.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the Three Stooges. My attention is still focused on the challenge Kate just threw down. The testosterone pumping through my body screams for victory. Not just a win, but a shutout\u2014nothing short of a full, uncontested knockout will do.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>AND SO IT BEGAN\u2014the Olympic Games of investment banking. I\u2019d like to say it was a mature contest between two professional and highly intelligent colleagues. I\u2019d like to say it was friendly.</p><p>I\u2019d like to...but I won\u2019t. \u2019Cause I\u2019d be lying.</p><p>Remember my father\u2019s comment? The one about Kate being the first one in the office and the last to leave? It stuck in my mind that whole night.</p><p>See, getting Anderson wasn\u2019t just about putting on the best presentation, coming up with the best ideas. That\u2019s what Kate thought\u2014but I knew better. The man is my father, after all; we share the same DNA. It was also about reward. Who was more dedicated. Who had earned it. And I was determined to show my father that I was that \u201cwho.\u201d</p><p>So, the next day I come in an hour early. Later that morning when Kate arrives, I don\u2019t look up from my desk, but I feel it when she walks past my door.</p><p>See the look on her face? The slight pause in her step as she sees me? The scowl that comes when she realizes she\u2019s the second to come in? See the steel in her eyes?</p><p>Obviously, I\u2019m not the only one playing for keeps.</p><p>On Wednesday, then, I arrive at the same time to find Kate typing away at her desk. She looks up when she sees me. She smiles cheerily. And waves.</p><p>I. Don\u2019t. Think. So.</p><p>The day after that, I come in another half-hour earlier...and so on. Are you seeing the pattern here? By the time the next Friday rolls around, I find myself walking up to the front of the building at four thirty.</p><p>Four-f**king-thirty!</p><p>It\u2019s still dark. And as I get to the door of the building, guess who I see across from me, arriving at the exact same time?</p><p>Kate.</p><p>Can you hear the hiss in my voice? I hope you can. We stand there looking each other in the eyes, clutching our extra-large caffeine-filled double-mocha cappuccinos in our hands.</p><p>Kind of reminds you of one of those old westerns, doesn\u2019t it? You know the ones I\u2019m talking about\u2014where the two guys walk down the empty street at high noon for a shootout. If you listen hard, you can probably hear the lonely call of a vulture in the background.</p><p>At the same moment, Kate and I drop our beverages and make a mad dash for the door. In the lobby, she pushes the elevator button furiously while I head for the stairs. Genius that I am, I figure I can take them three at a time. I\u2019m almost six-feet\u2014long legs. The only problem with this, of course, is that my office is on the fortieth floor.</p><p>Idiot.</p><p>As I finally reach our floor, panting and sweating, I see Kate leisurely leaning against her office door, coat off, a glass of water in hand. She offers it to me, along with that breathtaking smile of hers.</p><p>It makes me want to kiss her and strangle her at the same time. I\u2019ve never been into S&amp;M. But I\u2019m beginning to see its benefits.</p><p>\u201cHere you go. You look like you could use this, Drew.\u201d She hands me the glass and flounces away. \u201cHave a nice day.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>Sure, I\u2019ll do that.</p><p>\u2019Cause it\u2019s just starting out great so far.</p><p>I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve mentioned this before, but I\u2019ll go over it again just so we\u2019re clear. For me, work trumps sex. Every time. Always.</p><p>Except for Saturday nights. Saturday is club night. Guy night. Hook-up-with-gorgeous-girls-and-screw-their-brains-out night. Despite my renewed diligence at work as I vie against Kate for Anderson, my Saturday night does not change. It is sacred.</p><p>What? Do you want me to go frigging insane? All work and no play makes Drew a cranky boy.</p><p>So, that Saturday night I meet a brunette divorcee at a bar called Rendezvous. I\u2019ve found myself gravitating toward brunettes for the last couple weeks.</p><p>You don\u2019t need to be Sigmund Freud to figure that one out.</p><p>Anyway, it\u2019s a great night. Divorced women have a lot of pent-up anger\u2014a lot of buried frustration\u2014which never fails to translate into a good, long, hard fuck. It\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m looking for and just what I need. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But, for some reason, the next day I\u2019m still tense. Edgy.</p><p>It\u2019s like I\u2019d asked the waitress for a beer, and she brought me a soda. Like I ate a sandwich when what I really wanted was a nice juicy steak. I\u2019m full. But far from satisfied.</p><p>At the time, I don\u2019t know why I feel like that. But I bet you do, don\u2019t you?</p><p>To do my job properly, I need books\u2014lots of them. The laws, codes, and regulations involved in what I do are detailed and change frequently.</p> <p>Luckily for me, my firm has the most extensive collection of pertinent reference materials in the city. Well, except for maybe the city library. But have you seen that place? It\u2019s like a frigging castle. It takes forever to find out where something should be, and when you do, it\u2019s most likely checked out already. My firm\u2019s private library is much more convenient.</p><p>So, Tuesday afternoon, I\u2019m at my desk working with one of the aforementioned references when who should grace me with her presence?</p><p>Yep\u2014the lovely Kate Brooks. She is looking particularly delicious today.</p><p>Her voice is hesitant. \u201cHey, Drew? I was looking for this year\u2019s Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, and it\u2019s not in the library. Do you have it by any chance?\u201d She bites her lip in the adorable way she does whenever she\u2019s nervous.</p><p>The book in question is actually sitting right on my desk. And I\u2019m just about done with it. I could be the better man\u2014the bigger person\u2014and give it to her.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t really think I\u2019m going to do that, do you? Have you learned nothing from our past conversations?</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do have it, actually,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cOh, great. When do you think you\u2019ll be finished with it?\u201d</p><p>I look to the ceiling, seemingly deep in thought. \u201cNot sure. Four...maybe five...weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeeks?\u201d she asks, gazing down at me.</p><p>Can you tell she\u2019s annoyed?</p> <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking. If I want to eventually\u2014after the whole Anderson thing is over\u2014do the horizontal tango with Kate, why don\u2019t I try being just a little bit nicer to her? And you\u2019re right. That does make sense.</p><p>But the Anderson thing isn\u2019t over yet. And as I\u2019ve said before\u2014this, my friends, is war. I\u2019m talking DEFCON-one, gloves-off, I\u2019ll-knock-you-down-even-if-you-are-a-girl war.</p><p>You wouldn\u2019t give a bullet to a sniper who\u2019s got his gun aimed at your forehead, would you?</p><p>Plus, Kate is too damn hot when she\u2019s angry for me to pass up a chance to see her fired up again, just for my own twisted pleasure. I look her up and down appreciatively as I speak, before giving her my patented boyish smile that almost all women are helpless against.</p><p>Kate, of course, not being one of those women. Figures.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose if you ask nicely...and throw in a shoulder rub while you\u2019re at it...I might be persuaded to give it to you now.\u201d</p><p>The truth is, I would never demand anything that resembled a sexual favor in exchange for something work-related. I\u2019m a lot of things. A bottom-feeding scumbag like that isn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>But that last comment could definitely be construed as flat-out, old-school sexual harassment. And if Kate ever told my father I\u2019d said that to her? Jesus H. Christ, he would fire me faster than you could say, \u201cUp shit creek without a paddle.\u201d Then he\u2019d most likely knock me on my ass for good measure.</p> <p>I\u2019m walking one high f**king tightrope here. Yet, though the possibility exists, I\u2019m 99.9 percent sure that Kate won\u2019t rat me out. She\u2019s too much like me. She wants to win. She wants to beat me. And she wants to do it all on her own.</p><p>She puts her hands on her h*ps and opens her mouth to rip into me\u2014most likely to describe just where I can shove my book, I\u2019d guess. I lean back with an amused smile, eagerly anticipating the explosion...that never comes.</p><p>She tilts her head to the side, closes her mouth, and says, \u201cYou know what? Never mind.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she walks out the door.</p><p>Huh.</p><p>Kind of anticlimactic, don\u2019t you think? I thought so too.</p><p>Wait for it.</p><p>A few hours later, I\u2019m down in the library looking for an enormous reference titled Commercial and Investment Banking and the International Credit and Capital Markets. All of Harry Potter would fit into one chapter of this sucker. I scan the stacks for where it should be\u2014but it\u2019s not there.</p><p>Somebody else must have it.</p><p>I turn my attention to a much smaller, but just as important, volume called Investment Management Regulation, Seventh Edition. Only to find that it, too, is missing.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I don\u2019t believe in coincidences. I take the elevator back to the fortieth floor and march purposefully through Kate\u2019s open door.</p><p>I don\u2019t see her right away.</p><p>That\u2019s because stacked on and around her desk, in neat skyscraper-high columns, are books. About three dozen of them.</p><p>For a moment, I freeze, my mouth open and my eyes wide with shock. Then, inanely, I wonder how the hell she got them all up here. Kate weighs a buck-ten at best. There\u2019s got to be several hundred pounds of pages in this room.</p><p>It\u2019s then that her shiny dark head emerges over the horizon. And, once again, she smiles. Like a cat with a mouthful of bird.</p><p>I hate cats. They\u2019re kind of evil-looking, don\u2019t you think? Like they\u2019re just waiting for you to fall asleep so they can smother you with their fur or piss in your ear.</p><p>\u201cHi, Drew. Did you need something?\u201d she asks me with phony benevolence.</p><p>Her fingers tap rhythmically on two gigantic hardcovers. \u201cYou know...help? Advice? Directions to the public library?\u201d</p><p>I swallow my response. And frown at her. \u201cNo. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay, great. Bye-bye, now.\u201d And with that, she disappears back down behind the literary mountain.</p><p>Brooks\u2014two.</p><p>Evans\u2014zip.</p><p>After that, things get nasty.</p><p>I\u2019m ashamed to say that both Kate and I sink to new lows in professional sabotage. It never actually wanders over to the realm of the illegal. But it\u2019s definitely close.</p><p>One day I come in to find all the cables missing from my computer. It doesn\u2019t do any lasting damage, but I have to wait an hour-and-a-half for the IT guy to show up and reconnect it.</p><p>The next day, Kate comes in to discover that \u201csomeone\u201d has switched all the labels on her disks and files. Nothing was erased, mind you. But she pretty much has to look through every single one if she wants to find the documents she needs.</p><p>A few days after that at a staff meeting, I \u201caccidentally\u201d spill a glass of water on some information Kate has compiled for my father. Something that probably took her five or so hours to put together.</p><p>\u201cOops. Sorry,\u201d I say, letting the smirk on my face tell her how very unsorry I am.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mr. Evans,\u201d she assures my father as she wipes up the mess. \u201cI have another copy in my office.\u201d</p><p>How very Boy-Scoutish of her, don\u2019t you think?</p><p>Later\u2014about halfway through the same meeting\u2014do you know what she does?</p><p>She f**king kicks me! In the shin, under the table.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d I groan, and my hands fist reflexively.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, Drew?\u201d my father asks.</p><p>I can only nod and squeak, \u201cSomething in my throat.\u201d I cough dramatically.</p><p>See, I\u2019m not about to go crying to Daddy either. But sweet Christ it hurt. You ever been kicked in the shin by a four-inch pointy shoe? For a man, there is only one area that\u2019s more painful to be kicked.</p><p>And that is a place that dare not speak its name.</p><p>After the throbbing in my leg dies down a bit, I hide my hand behind some upturned papers while my father\u2019s speaking. Then I flip Kate the finger. Immature, I know, but apparently we\u2019re now both functioning at the preschool level, so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s okay.</p><p>Kate sneers at me. Then she mouths, You wish.</p><p>Well\u2014she\u2019s got me there, now doesn\u2019t she?</p><p>We\u2019re in the home stretch. A month of mortal combat has passed, and tomorrow is my father\u2019s deadline. It\u2019s around eleven o\u2019clock, and Kate and I are the only ones left in the building.</p><p>I\u2019ve had this fantasy a hundred times. Though, I have to say, it\u2019s never included us in our respective offices, glaring at each other across the hallway\u2014accompanied by the occasional obscene hand gesture.</p><p>I glance over and see her reviewing her charts. What is she thinking? Is this the Stone Age? Who the hell uses poster board anymore? Anderson is definitely mine.</p><p>I\u2019m just putting the finishing touches on my own impressive PowerPoint presentation when Matthew walks into my office. He\u2019s heading to the bars. Never mind that it\u2019s a Wednesday night; that\u2019s just Matthew. A few short weeks ago, that was me too.</p><p>He looks at me for the longest time, saying nothing. Then he sits on the edge of my desk and says, \u201cDude, just f**king do it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I ask, my fingers never pausing over the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cHave you looked at yourself lately? You need to just walk over there and get it done.\u201d</p><p>And now he\u2019s annoying me. \u201cMatthew, what the hell are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>But all he comes back with is, \u201cYou ever see War of the Roses? Is that how you want to end up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have work to do. I don\u2019t have time for this right now.\u201d</p><p>He throws his hands up. \u201cFine. I tried. When we find you two in the lobby under the fallen chandelier, I\u2019ll tell your mother I frigging tried.\u201d</p><p>I stop typing. \u201cWhat the f**k do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean you and Kate. It\u2019s obvious you have a thing for her.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at her office when he says her name. She doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cYeah, I do have \u2018a thing\u2019 for her. An extreme dislike of her. We can\u2019t stand each other. She\u2019s a pill. I wouldn\u2019t f**k her with a ten-foot dildo.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that\u2019s not true. I\u2019d so f**k her. But I wouldn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Yeah\u2014you\u2019re right. That\u2019s not true either.</p><p>Matthew sits in the chair across from my desk. I can feel him staring at me again. Then he sighs. And says, like it\u2019s supposed to be some awe-inspiring revelation, \u201cSally Jansen.\u201d</p><p>I look at him blankly.</p><p>Who?</p><p>\u201cSally Jansen,\u201d he says again, then clarifies, \u201cThird grade.\u201d</p><p>The picture of a small girl with light brown pigtails and thick glasses comes to mind.</p><p>I nod. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was the first girl I ever loved.\u201d</p><p>Wait. What?</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you used to call her Smelly Sally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nods solemnly. \u201cYes, I did. And I loved her.\u201d</p><p>Still confused.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you get, like, the entire third grade to call her Smelly Sally?\u201d</p><p>He nods again and, trying to sound sage, says, \u201cLove makes you do some stupid shit.\u201d</p><p>I guess so, because...</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she have to leave early twice a week to go to a therapist because you ragged on her so much?\u201d</p><p>He ponders this a moment. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true. You know, there\u2019s a fine line between love and hate, Drew.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd didn\u2019t Sally Jansen switch schools later that year because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, the point here, man, is that I liked the girl. Loved her. I thought she was awesome. But I couldn\u2019t deal with those feelings. I didn\u2019t know how to express them the right way.\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s not usually this in touch with his feminine side.</p><p>\u201cSo you picked on her instead?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cSadly, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this has to do with Kate and me because...?\u201d</p><p>He pauses a beat and then gives me...the look. The slight shake of his head, the grimace of sad disappointment. That look right there is worse than a mother\u2019s guilt, I swear.</p><p>He stands, slaps me on the arms, and says, \u201cYou\u2019re a smart guy, Andrew. You\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d And with that, he leaves.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, I know what Matthew was trying to say. I get it, all right. And I\u2019m telling you\u2014straight up\u2014he\u2019s crazy.</p> <p>I don\u2019t spar with Kate because I like her. I do it because her existence is screwing with the trajectory of my career. She\u2019s a nuisance. A fly in my soup. A pain in my ass. As aching as that mother of a bee sting I got on my left cheek at summer camp when I was eleven.</p><p>Sure, she\u2019d be a great lay. I\u2019d ride the Kate Brooks Express any time. But it would never be anything more than a good screw. That\u2019s all, folks.</p><p>What? Why are you looking at me like that? You don\u2019t believe me?</p><p>Then you\u2019re as crazy as Matthew.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>PRESSURE\u2019S A FUNNY THING. It makes some people snap. Like the MIT student who decides to take out half the student body with a long-range rifle because he got a B-plus on a final. It makes some people choke. Two words: Jorge Posada. Enough said. Pressure makes some people fall. Crumble. Freeze.</p> <p>I am not one of those people. I thrive on pressure. It propels me, drives me to succeed. It is my element. Like a fish in water.</p><p>I get to work the next day bright and early. Dressed to kill with my game face on.</p><p>It\u2019s go time.</p><p>Kate and I arrive at my father\u2019s office door at nine a.m. on the dot. I can\u2019t help but check her out. She looks good. Confident. Excited. Apparently she reacts to stress the same way I do.</p><p>My father explains that Saul Anderson called to say he would be coming to town ahead of schedule. As in tomorrow night.</p><p>Lots of businessmen do this. Push meetings up at the last minute. It\u2019s a test. To see if you\u2019re prepared. To see if you can handle the unexpected. Lucky for me\u2014I am and I can.</p><p>And then we begin. I insist on ladies first.</p><p>I watch Kate\u2019s presentation like a kid watches a gift under the tree on Christmas Eve. She doesn\u2019t know that, of course. My face is the very definition of bored indifference. On the inside, though, I can\u2019t wait to see what she\u2019s got.</p> <p>And I\u2019m not disappointed. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said this\u2014I\u2019ll deny it until death\u2014but Kate Brooks is pretty f**king incredible. Almost as good as me.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>She\u2019s direct, clear, and persuasive as hell. The investment plans she lays out are unique and imaginative. And destined to make a shitload of money. Her only weakness is that she\u2019s new. She doesn\u2019t have the connections to necessarily make what she\u2019s proposing happen. Like I\u2019ve said before, part of this business\u2014a big part\u2014is having the inside track. The hidden info and dirty secrets that outsiders can\u2019t get to. So although Kate\u2019s ideas are strong, they\u2019re not altogether viable. Not a slam-dunk.</p><p>Then it\u2019s my turn.</p><p>My proposals, on the other hand, are rock f**king solid. The companies and investments I outline are well known and secure. Granted, my projected profits aren\u2019t as high as Kate\u2019s, but they\u2019re certain. Dependable. Safe.</p><p>Once I\u2019m done, I sit beside Kate on the couch. See us there? Kate\u2019s hands are folded neatly in her lap, her back straight, a sure, satisfied smile on her lips. I lean back on the couch, my stance relaxed, my own confident smile a mirror image of hers.</p><p>For those of you out there who think I\u2019m a shit heel? Watch carefully. You\u2019re going to love this part.</p><p>My father clears his throat, and I can read the excited gleam in his eyes. He rubs his hands together and smiles. \u201cI knew my instincts were right on this one. I can\u2019t tell you how impressed I am with what you\u2019ve come up with. And I think it\u2019s obvious who should move forward with Anderson.\u201d</p><p>Simultaneously, Kate and I smirk at each other, gloating triumph written all over our faces.</p><p>Wait for it...</p><p>\u201cBoth of you.\u201d</p><p>Irony\u2019s really a bite in the ass, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Our eyes turn to my father, and the grins drop from our faces faster than an Acme safe in a Road Runner cartoon. Our shocked voices speak at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your artistic flair for investing, Kate, and your concrete know-how, Drew, you two will be perfect together. An unbeatable team. You can both work on the account. When he signs with us, you can share him\u2014the workload and the bonuses\u2014fifty-fifty.\u201d</p><p>Share him?</p><p>Share him?</p><p>Has the old man lost his freaking mind? Would I ask him to share something he\u2019s worked his ass off for? Would he let someone else drive his 1962 cherry Mustang convertible? Would he open his bedroom door and let some other guy screw his wife?</p><p>Okay, that was too far. I take it back\u2014considering his wife is my mother. Forget I ever referred to my mother and screwing in the same sentence. That\u2019s just...wrong. On so many levels.</p><p>But for the love of God, tell me you see my point.</p><p>My father must have finally looked at our faces, because he asks, \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem, is it?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to tell him what a major goddamn problem it is. But Kate beats me to the punch.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Evans, of course not. No problem at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d He claps his hands together and stands. \u201cI\u2019ve got tee off in an hour, so I\u2019ll leave you two to it. You\u2019ve got until tomorrow night to coordinate your proposals. Anderson will be at La Fontana at seven.\u201d</p><p>And then he looks me dead in the face. \u201cI know you won\u2019t let me down, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re sixty, when a parent uses your full name, it pretty much sucks all the argument right out of you.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he\u2019s out the door. Leaving Kate and I sitting on the couch, our expressions dazed, like survivors of a nuclear blast.</p><p>\u201c\u2018No, Mr. Evans, of course not,\u2019\u201d I whine. \u201cCould you be any more of a kiss-ass?\u201d</p><p>She hisses, \u201cShut up, Andrew.\u201d Then she sighs. \u201cWhat the hell are we supposed to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you could do the noble thing and bow out.\u201d Yeah\u2014like that\u2019ll happen.</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cActually my dreams involve you bending over something...not bowing.\u201d</p><p>She makes a disgusted sound. \u201cCould you be any more of a pig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kidding. Why do you have to be so f**king serious all the time? You should learn how to take a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take a joke,\u201d she tells me, sounding insulted.</p><p>\u201cYeah? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s not being delivered by a childish jackass who thinks he\u2019s God\u2019s gift to women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not childish.\u201d</p><p>God\u2019s gift on the other hand? My record speaks for itself.</p><p>\u201cOh, bite me.\u201d</p><p>I wish.</p><p>\u201cNice comeback, Kate. Very mature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a...an Alexandra.\u201d</p><p>She pauses a second and looks at me blankly. \u201cWhat the hell does that even mean?\u201d</p><p>Think about it. It will come to you.</p><p>I rub my hand down my face. \u201cOkay, look, this is getting us nowhere fast. We\u2019re screwed. We both still want Anderson, and the only way we\u2019re going to get him is if we somehow get our shit together. We\u2019ve got...thirty hours to do that. Are you in or not?\u201d</p><p>Her lips come together in flat-out determination.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me in my office in twenty minutes, and we\u2019ll get to work.\u201d</p><p>I expect her to argue with me. I expect her to ask why we have to meet in my office\u2014why we can\u2019t work in her office\u2014like a nagging housewife. But she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>She just says, \u201cOkay.\u201d And leaves the room to get the rest of her things.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised.</p><p>Maybe this won\u2019t be as bad as I thought.</p><p>\u201cThat is the stupidest f**king idea I have ever heard!\u201d</p><p>Nope, it\u2019s much worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve researched Anderson. He\u2019s the old-fashioned type. He\u2019s not going to want to go blind staring at your laptop all night. He\u2019s going to want something concrete, tangible. Something he can take home. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll give him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a multibillion-dollar business meeting\u2014not a fifth grade science fair. I\u2019m not walking in there with frigging poster board!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s after midnight. We\u2019ve been in my office for a little over twelve hours. Except for these few minute details, every aspect of our presentation has been banged out, negotiated, compromised.</p><p>I feel like I just bartered a goddamn peace treaty.</p><p>By now, Kate has released her hair and lost her shoes. My tie is off, the top two buttons of my shirt open. Our appearance could make things feel friendly\u2014intimate\u2014like an all-night study session in college.</p><p>If we weren\u2019t trying to rip each other\u2019s throats open, of course.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit if you agree or not. I\u2019m right about this. I\u2019m bringing the poster board.\u201d</p><p>I give in. I\u2019m too tired to fight about paper. \u201cFine. Just\u2014shrink it down.\u201d</p><p>We ordered food a few hours ago and worked through dinner. I had pasta with chicken, while Kate preferred a turkey club with fries on the side. Much as I hate to admit it, I\u2019m impressed. Obviously, she doesn\u2019t subscribe to the \u201cI can only eat salads in front of the opposite sex\u201d rule of thumb a lot of chicks swear by. Who gave women that idea? Like a guy\u2019s going to say to his friend, \u201cDude, she was one fugly chick, but once I saw her chomping that romaine, I just had to nail her.\u201d</p><p>No man wants to f**k a skeleton\u2014and nibbling crackers and water like a prisoner of war at dinner isn\u2019t attractive. It just makes us think about what a cranky bitch you\u2019re going to be later on because you\u2019re starving. If a guy\u2019s into you? A cheeseburger deluxe is not going to scare him away. And if he\u2019s not? Ingesting all the greens on Peter Cottontail\u2019s farm isn\u2019t going to change that, trust me.</p><p>Now back to the battle royal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing the talking,\u201d I tell her firmly.</p><p>\u201cNo, no way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are my ideas, and I\u2019m presenting them!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s purposely trying to make me nuts. She\u2019s deliberately trying to drive me off the deep end. She\u2019s probably hoping I\u2019ll throw myself out the window, just to get away from the annoyance that is her. Then she\u2019ll have Anderson all to herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, her evil little scheme isn\u2019t going to work. I\u2019m going to stay calm. I\u2019m going to count to ten. I won\u2019t let Kate get to me.</p><p>\u201cSaul Anderson,\u201d I say, \u201cis an old-fashioned businessman\u2014you just said it yourself. He\u2019s going to want to talk to another business man, not someone he sees as a glorified secretary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the most sexist comment I\u2019ve ever heard. You\u2019re disgusting!\u201d</p><p>Calm goes straight out the window and down about forty stories.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I thought that way\u2014I said he thinks that way! Fucking Christ Almighty!\u201d</p><p>And it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019re packing in your pants or which way you roll. A pecker, a cooch, or both\u2014it\u2019s all the same to me. As long as you get the job done right, that\u2019s all that matters. But Kate seems determined to think the worst of me.</p><p>I push my hands through my hair in an effort to vent some of the frustration that makes me want to shake the shit out of her.</p><p>\u201cLook, this is the way it is. Trying to pretend certain biases don\u2019t exist won\u2019t make them go away. We have a better shot at signing Anderson if I do the talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no! I don\u2019t care what you think. Absolutely not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so f**king stubborn. You\u2019re like a menopausal pissed-off mule!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stubborn! I\u2019m stubborn? Well, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have to be if you weren\u2019t King of the Control Freaks!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right about the control thing. But what can I say? I like things done the right way\u2014my way. I won\u2019t apologize for that. Especially not to Ms. Stick Up Her Ass.</p><p>\u201cAt least I know when to back off\u2014unlike you. You walk around like an uptight overachiever on crystal meth!\u201d</p><p>By this time, we\u2019re both on our feet, less than a foot apart facing each other. Without her heels, I have a major height advantage, but Kate doesn\u2019t seem intimidated.</p><p>She pokes me in the chest as she argues, \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me. I am not uptight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, please. I\u2019ve never seen someone who needs to get laid as badly as you do. I don\u2019t know what the hell your fianc\u00e9 is doing with you. But whatever it is? He\u2019s not doing it right.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opens, forming a big ole O at my little dig against her betrothed. Out of the corner of my eye, I see her hand come up, ready to slap me across the face.</p><p>This is not the first time a woman has tried to slap me. You\u2019re not surprised, are you?</p><p>Like a pro, I catch her wrist before she makes contact with my cheek and hold her arm down at her side. \u201cGee, Kate, for a woman who claims she doesn\u2019t want to screw me, you\u2019re certainly eager to make this physical.\u201d</p><p>Her other hand comes up to try and slap me from the other side, but I block her again and am now securely holding both her hands at her hips. I smirk. \u201cGotta do better than that, baby, if you want a piece of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d she yells in my face.</p><p>\u201cI hate you more!\u201d I shout.</p><p>Admittedly, not my wittiest comeback\u2014but it was the best I could manage under the circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the last word she gets out.</p><p>Before my mouth descends on hers.</p><p>And our lips crash together.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>I\u2019VE KISSED HUNDREDS OF GIRLS. No\u2014make that thousands. I only really remember a handful of them. But this kiss? This is one I won\u2019t forget any time soon.</p><p>She tastes...Jesus, I\u2019ve never done drugs, but I imagine this is what that first snort of coc**ne feels like, that first shot of her**ne. Goddamn addictive.</p><p>Our lips clash and move over one another, angry and wet.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop touching her. My hands are everywhere: her face, her hair, down her back, grasping at her hips. Pulling her closer, desperate to feel more of her\u2014wanting her to feel exactly what she\u2019s doing to me.</p><p>Needing air, I rip my mouth from hers and attack her neck. I feast on her, like a starving man. And that\u2019s exactly what I am\u2014ravenous\u2014for her. I inhale as I lick, suck, and nibble my way from her jaw to her ear.</p><p>She\u2019s whimpering incoherently, but I get the idea. The sound of her voice, wild and sexy, makes me groan. And her scent. Sweet Christ, she smells like...flowers and sugar. Like one of those decorative confectionary roses on the top of a cake.</p><p>Fucking delicious.</p><p>And her hands aren\u2019t idle either. She grasps my biceps, and the heat of her hands seeps through my dress shirt. She scrapes her nails down my back and dips her fingers below the waist of my slacks, first grazing then cupping my ass.</p><p>I\u2019m dying. I\u2019m burning. My blood is liquid f**king fire, and I feel like we\u2019re going to go up in smoke before we ever make it to the couch. Kate gasps as I draw her earlobe into my mouth and dance across the flesh below it with my tongue.</p><p>\u201cDrew? Drew, what are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I moan in a rough voice. \u201cJust...don\u2019t stop touching me.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t.</p><p>And I\u2019m back at her mouth. Plunging my tongue into her, sliding it against hers in the same way I\u2019m dying to slide my c*ck into her wet, welcoming body. I feel her h*ps push forward against mine. And any blood left in my body descends, making me harder than I\u2019ve ever been in my life.</p><p>Weeks of want and frustration are coursing through me. I\u2019ve brushed with Colgate for far too long\u2014and it\u2019s tasted like shit.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much I want this? Want you? God, Kate...I\u2019ve f**king dreamed about this...begged for it. You make me...ah, I can\u2019t get...enough of you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands are on my chest now, rubbing, scratching, moving down my abs, until one brushes against the front of my pants and I hiss in pure agonizing pleasure. Before I can inhale, she\u2019s stroking my dick through my pants, and I thrust forward. Any semblance of control or finesse is gone.</p><p>My hands come up to her br**sts, and she arches her back to bring them closer. I squeeze, and she moans again. I skim across where I know her n**ples are, frustrated by her blouse and bra. I want to tug and pinch those beauties until they\u2019re two sharp peaks. Her mouth is on my neck, kissing, and I raise my chin.</p><p>It\u2019s never been like this. I\u2019ve never been like this. I\u2019ve never felt so much for any woman, no matter that it\u2019s a mixture of anger and lust.</p><p>\u201cDrew...Drew, I can\u2019t do this. I love Billy,\u201d she pants.</p><p>Her confession doesn\u2019t affect me like you\u2019d think it would. Mostly because she still has one hand on my c*ck when she says it. Her actions speak the complete opposite of her voice. Hands and h*ps that are pulling me closer, stroking me, pleading for more.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, Kate. Fine. Love Billy. Marry Billy. Just please...God...please just f**k me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m saying. Don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m making sense. One thought and one only drums in my head like a primal melody:</p><p>More.</p><p>I bring my chin down, wanting to taste her mouth again. But instead of her lips...I make contact with her palm. I open my eyes to find her hand covering my mouth, blocking me. Her chest is heaving, rising and falling in brisk, rapid pants.</p><p>And then I see her eyes. And I feel like I just took a wrecking ball to the chest. Because her eyes are wide with panic...and confusion. I try to say her name, but it\u2019s muffled by her hand.</p><p>I hear a sob in her voice as she says, \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Drew. I\u2019m sorry. Billy...this job...this is my life. My whole life. I...I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s trembling. And suddenly, my need, my lust, and my still-raging hard-on are all pushed to the backburner, behind the overwhelming desire to comfort her. To tell her it\u2019s okay. Everything will be all right.</p><p>Anything. I\u2019ll say anything to take that look off her face.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t give me the chance. The moment she takes her hand off my mouth, she runs out the door. And she\u2019s gone before I can draw a breath. I should go after her. I should tell her it\u2019s okay that she put the brakes on. That this hasn\u2019t\u2014and won\u2019t\u2014change anything. Though that\u2019s one big fat lie, and we both know it, don\u2019t we?</p><p>But I don\u2019t follow Kate. And the reason is simple: Have you ever tried to run with a boner staring up at you?</p><p>No?</p><p>Well, it\u2019s damn near impossible.</p><p>I collapse onto the couch and rest my head back. Looking up at the ceiling, I pinch the bridge of my nose with my fingers. How is it that something as simple as sex just became so frigging complicated? I don\u2019t know either.</p><p>Christ, I\u2019m so hard. I want to cry\u2014I\u2019ll admit it. I\u2019m not ashamed. I want to weep from the throbbing ache in my groin that will have no relief. The idea of going out and finding a substitute for Kate never even enters my head. Because my dick knows what my brain is just starting to admit.</p><p>There is no substitute for Kate Brooks. Not for me. Not now.</p><p>I look down at the tent in my lap. The one that shows no indication of going down any time soon.</p><p>It\u2019s going to be a long, long night.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>THE NEXT DAY, Kate doesn\u2019t come into the office until eleven o\u2019clock. I don\u2019t need to tell you that this is unusual for her.</p><p>She\u2019s avoiding me. I know this because I\u2019ve done it myself on more than one occasion. Discreetly sneaking over to the other side of the club when I happen to vaguely recognize one of my previous hook-ups. But to actually be on the receiving end of this? It sucks.</p><p>I don\u2019t get the privilege of speaking with her until two, when she comes striding into my office\u2014looking drop-dead gorgeous. Her hair is pinned up in what Alexandra would call a French twist. She\u2019s wearing a black dress that flows out slightly at the knee, with matching high heels and a black blazer.</p><p>She puts a small stack of poster board on my desk, her charts and graphs shrunk down to notebook-size like we agreed. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re right. You should lead with Anderson. I\u2019ll be second chair.\u201d</p><p>She talks like nothing ever happened. Like she wasn\u2019t quivering in my arms and setting me on fire with her hands in this very office just a few short hours ago. She\u2019s all business. Completely unaffected. And it pisses me off.</p><p>Badly.</p><p>Indifference is not exactly a reaction I\u2019m used to from women. Frankly, it\u2019s a little hard to take.</p><p>I feel my jaw clench as I tell her, \u201cGood. That\u2019s the best way to go.\u201d</p><p>Now, if you haven\u2019t guessed, I\u2019m not the touchy-feely type. I\u2019m not one to talk my feelings to death like some New Age, meditating freak of nature. But I expected something from her. Some acknowledgement of what happened last night\u2014of the attraction that\u2019s still pulling at both of us. I thought she would be the one to bring it up.</p><p>She\u2019s a woman, after all.</p><p>When all I get is silence, I can\u2019t help but push. \u201cKate, about last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cuts me off. \u201cLast night was a mistake. It will not happen again.\u201d</p><p>Do you know anything about child psychology? No? Well here\u2019s a lesson for you. If you tell a kid they can\u2019t do something, guess what\u2019s the first thing they\u2019re going to try and do the minute you\u2019re not looking? Exactly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Men are the same way. It\u2019s so going to happen again.

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another like it in the English language that says so much while actually saying so little. How many wives have told their husbands, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d when they really mean, \u201cI want to cut your balls off with a butcher knife\u201d? How many men have told their girlfriends, \u201cYou look fine,\u201d when they really mean, \u201cYou need to go back to the gym and work out\u2014a lot.\u201d It\u2019s the universal way of saying we\u2019re just peachy\u2014when we\u2019re really anything but.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I repeat, looking down at the papers on my desk.</p><p>And then she\u2019s out the door, and I spend the next ten minutes staring after her, replaying last night over and over in my mind.</p><p>Hey, you know another word that can mean the opposite of what it\u2019s supposed to?</p> <p>Fucked.</p><p>Which is exactly what I\u2019m going to be if I don\u2019t get my head out of my ass and back in the game by seven o\u2019clock tonight.</p><p>Our dinner meeting is well under way. Although I\u2019ve done a lot of the talking, it\u2019s Kate that has Saul Anderson completely charmed. If I wasn\u2019t in such a pissy mood, I\u2019d admit that she\u2019s working this meeting like a pro. But I am, so I\u2019m not telling anyone but you.</p><p>She laughs at some story Anderson just finished telling before he excuses himself to go to the john. I take a drink of my wine, wishing it was whiskey.</p><p>Kate turns to me, freshman excitement dancing in her eyes. \u201cSo this is going really well, isn\u2019t it? I mean, I definitely think he\u2019s interested, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cDepends on what you\u2019re trying to sell him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m selling us\u2014our proposal, our investment firm.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m being a prick\u2014yes, I know.</p><p>\u201cReally? \u2019Cause it seems like you\u2019re offering him something else entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kate. You went to Wharton. I think you can figure out exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been completely professional...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be more subtle if you ripped open your blouse and shoved your tits in his face.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was uncalled for. And I actually consider apologizing.</p> <p>But before I can form the words, ice-cold liquid seeps through my pants and into my crotch. From the glass of water Kate just poured into my lap.</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king crazy?\u201d I whisper harshly, trying not to make a scene as I jump up and wipe at the stain with a napkin.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right here?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Anderson. He\u2019s back and looking from me to Kate. I shrug awkwardly as Kate smiles and tells him, \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s that word again. See what I mean?</p><p>\u201cDrew just had a little mishap with his water glass. You know boys\u2014can\u2019t take them anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Anderson laughs and sits back down, while I weigh my chances for an acquittal. The one I\u2019ll need after I strangle Kate Brooks.</p><p>An hour later, we\u2019re waiting for coffee and dessert. Kate has left the table. I\u2019m thinking her bladder must have been seconds from rupturing for her to actually leave me alone with Anderson.</p><p>He observes me for a moment and then says, \u201cI like what I\u2019ve seen here tonight, Drew. Very impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Saul.\u201d</p><p>In business, always use first names. It\u2019s not disrespectful. It shows that you\u2019re an equal\u2014in the same league. That\u2019s huge.</p><p>\u201cAnd based on what you\u2019ve shown me, I\u2019m ready to give Evans, Reinhart and Fisher my business.\u201d</p><p>Yes! Break out the champagne, baby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear that. I think this deal is going to be very profitable for both\u2014that is, all of us.\u201d Can\u2019t forget Kate, right? As if she would let me. \u201cYou can put your complete confidence in Kate and me. We won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>He fingers his crystal glass. \u201cRight. About that. Before I sign, I have only one contingency.\u201d</p><p>This kind of thing happens all the time. Not a big deal.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, Saul. I\u2019m sure we can provide whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to hear that. So, why don\u2019t you have that darling girl of yours\u2014Kate\u2014bring the contracts by my place tonight, around midnight.\u201d He hands me a business card, and I feel like there\u2019s a boulder in my stomach.</p><p>Can you feel it too?</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s where I\u2019m staying. You have her bring the papers...alone.\u201d</p><p>You know on TV when there\u2019s one of those awkward, shocking moments and all you hear are the crickets in the background?</p><p>Well chirp-f**king-chirp. This is one of those moments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure you do, Drew. You know how it is. When a man\u2019s working late and needs a little...comfort. A distraction.\u201d</p><p>How about my foot up your ass, Saul? How\u2019d that be for distraction?</p><p>\u201cAnd that girl of yours is one prime piece. My business will bring your firm millions in revenue. And that\u2019s not including the additional clients you\u2019ll get once word gets around that I\u2019m with you. I\u2019d say a little after-hours servicing is a small price to pay, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He makes sense\u2014in a sick, perverted, registered-sex-offender kind of way. But do you think that matters? Hell no. I stand up. I\u2019m afraid of what I\u2019ll do if I have to look at his smug, shit-eating grin another minute.</p><p>I throw a dozen bills on the table and tell him, \u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of business we\u2019re in. If that\u2019s the sort of deal you\u2019re looking for, Forty-Second Street is about ten blocks that way. I\u2019m no pimp, and Katherine Brooks is certainly not a whore. This meeting is over.\u201d</p><p>Aren\u2019t you proud of me? I am. Though what I just said was in no way satisfying, it was professional\u2014dignified. I kept it together. I didn\u2019t even call him the ass-licking, dick-bag piece of steaming dog shit that I think he is. Go me.</p><p>I walk toward the bar area in the next room, and I\u2019m fuming. Can you see the steam coming out of my ears? No? Well, obviously you\u2019re not looking hard enough. That guy\u2019s got some set of balls. To f**king suggest that Kate...Kate is more than just a pretty face. She\u2019s brilliant. And funny. And\u2014okay, maybe she\u2019s not nice, but I\u2019m sure she could be if she didn\u2019t hate my guts. In any case, she deserves better\u2014more respect\u2014than what she just got. So much more.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see her, walking past the bar on her way back from the restroom. She spots me and walks over, a smile spread across her face.</p><p>\u201cSo? How\u2019d it go? He\u2019s with us, isn\u2019t he? I knew it, Drew! I knew the minute we showed him our projections he was done. And I know working together hasn\u2019t been the easiest thing, but I think your father was right. We do make a pretty good team, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. I look down at her hand on my arm and then back up into those sweet, innocent eyes, and...I just can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t tell her.</p><p>\u201cI blew it, Kate. Anderson\u2019s not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean? What happened?\u201d</p><p>I stare at my nine-hundred-dollar shoes. \u201cI screwed up. Can we just get out of here?\u201d</p><p>When I look back up, her face is a mask of confused sympathy. Here I just told her that I blew the account\u2014our account\u2014and there\u2019s not a trace of anger in her expression. God, I\u2019m such an a**hole.</p><p>\u201cWell, let me talk to him. Maybe I can fix this.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me at least try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, wait...\u201d But she\u2019s already walking away, toward the table where Anderson still sits.</p><p>You ever been on the freeway, stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic? And when you finally get to the head of the line, you realize the backup is because of an accident? Maybe not a bad one\u2014maybe just a fender bender that\u2019s already been moved to the side of the road. And all that traffic\u2014all that wasted time\u2014is because every driver who passes the scene has to slow down and take a look.</p><p>It\u2019s ridiculous, isn\u2019t it? And you swear that when you pass by, you\u2019re not going to look\u2014just on principle alone. But when you get there, and you\u2019re driving past the dented doors and flashing lights and smashed bumpers, what do you do?</p><p>You slow down and look. You didn\u2019t want to, but you can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s morbid. Absurd. But that\u2019s human nature for you. Watching Kate walk up to Anderson feels just like looking at the aftermath of an accident. And no matter how much I want to\u2014I just can\u2019t look away.</p><p>She stands next to his chair, a perfect, professional smile on her lips. If you look closely, you\u2019ll see the moment when what he\u2019s asking for registers in her mind. See how her smile freezes? Her brow wrinkles slightly because she can\u2019t actually believe he\u2019s suggesting what he is. And then she\u2019s stiff and unsure. Should she tell him to go f**k a duck? Should she laugh it off or politely refuse? While the wheels are turning in Kate\u2019s head, Anderson takes his finger\u2014can you see the slime dripping off it?\u2014and trails it slowly down her bare arm.</p><p>And that\u2019s it. I snap out of my stupor. And I see red. Bright, neon, Technicolor red.</p><p>You ever see A Christmas Story? You know toward the end when Ralphie beats the ever-loving shit out of the bully? I hope to God you\u2019ve seen it. Because then you\u2019ll know exactly what I mean when I say I\u2019m about to go real f**king Ralphie on this son of a bitch.</p><p>I walk over and put myself in front of Kate. \u201cTouch her again and I\u2019m going to throw you through that windowpane. They\u2019ll be picking pieces of you up off Fifty-Forth for days.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. Sounds like the Crypt Keeper, doesn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Son.\u201d</p><p>Son? Is this dipshit for real?</p><p>\u201cYou know something, Drew. I like you.\u201d</p><p>Now there is a concept that scares the piss out of me.</p><p>\u201cI need a man like you around,\u201d he continues. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s not afraid to speak his mind. To tell me what he really thinks. It seems as though my...contingency isn\u2019t going to be met. But I\u2019m going to sign with you and your firm anyway. What do you think of that?\u201d He leans back in his chair and takes a sip of his wine. Completely confident in the fact that I will disregard anything he\u2019s said or done for the chance to get my hands on his money.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say a great big no to that, Saul. See, we have this company policy: we don\u2019t deal with limp-dick, Viagra-popping, dirtbag motherfuckers who try to use their position to coerce women\u2014young enough to be their daughters\u2014into bed. Go peddle your shit somewhere else. We aren\u2019t buying.\u201d</p><p>Our stares are locked on one another like two wolves on the Discovery Channel when he says, \u201cThink carefully, Son. You\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think the only mistake I\u2019ve made is wasting our time here with you. That\u2019s something I don\u2019t plan on doing a second longer. We\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>And then I turn to Kate and tell her softly, \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>With my hand on her lower back, we walk to the coat-check room. I hold her coat for her and help her into it. With my hands on her shoulders, I ask, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look back at me, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>Right. And we all know what that means, don\u2019t we?</p><p>For many men, their car is equivalent to the perfect woman. We can build her to look exactly how we want, we can ride her hard and she won\u2019t complain, and we can easily trade her in when a newer, younger model comes along. It\u2019s pretty much the ideal relationship.</p><p>I drive an Aston Martin V12. There\u2019s not many things in this world that I love, but my car is one of them. I got her after I closed my first deal. She\u2019s a beauty. She\u2019s my baby. Not that you would know that by the way I\u2019m driving at the moment. It\u2019s the typical pissed-off guy mode of driving. A death grip on the steering wheel, hard turns, fast stops, a smack on the horn at the slightest provocation. I don\u2019t think about how my attitude might be interpreted by Kate, until her small voice comes from the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I glance quickly at her, \u201cYou\u2019re sorry for what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never meant to send out those kinds of signals, Drew. I would never come on to a client. I didn\u2019t realize that...\u201d</p><p>Christ.</p><p>Why do women always do this? Why are they so eager to blame themselves when someone treats them like shit? A guy would take a cheese grater to his tongue before admitting he screwed up.</p><p>When we were sixteen, Matthew was dating Melissa Sayber. One day while he was in the shower, Melissa went through his sock drawer and found notes from the two other girls he was banging at the same time. She went apeshit. But you know what? By the time Matthew was done talking to her\u2014after he flushed the evidence\u2014not only did he convince her that she had read the notes wrong, but she was apologizing to him for going through his stuff. Unbelievable, right?</p><p>I pull over to the side of the road and turn to face her. \u201cListen to me, Kate\u2014you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said, about my blouse...and his face...\u201d</p> <p>Great. She thinks she was asking for it because that\u2019s what I f**king told her. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was being an a**hole. I didn\u2019t mean it. I was just trying to get a rise out of you. Look, in this business some guys are just power-high pricks. They\u2019re used to getting whatever they ask for, women included.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to see the similarities between Saul Anderson and myself. But they\u2019re kind of hard to miss. Listening to him tonight made me feel...shitty...about how I\u2019ve treated Kate the last few weeks. My father wanted me to help her, mentor her. Instead I let my c*ck and my overactive sense of competition lead the way.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a gorgeous woman. This won\u2019t be the last time something like this happens. You have to have a thick skin. You can\u2019t let anyone rattle your confidence. You were perfect at that meeting. Really. Should\u2019ve been a home run.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a small smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I turn back onto the road, and we drive in silence. Until she says, \u201cGod I could use a drink right now.\u201d</p><p>Her comment throws me. It seems like such an un-Kate thing to say. She\u2019s a straight arrow. No nonsense. The kind of girl who hardly drinks, doesn\u2019t eat trans fats, and vacuums behind the couch three times a week. It\u2019s then that I realize that although the woman next to me occupies a permanent space in my thoughts, I really don\u2019t know much about her. Not any more than I did when I first approached her all those weeks ago at REM.</p><p>It\u2019s an even bigger shock when I admit to myself that I want to.</p> <p>At this juncture in my life, my idea of getting to know a woman consists of finding out if she likes it slow and sweet or hard and dirty\u2014top, bottom, or from behind. But the interactions I\u2019ve had with Kate are different from any other woman. She\u2019s different.</p><p>She\u2019s like a Rubik\u2019s Cube. So frustrating at times that you want to toss it out the goddamn window. But you don\u2019t. You can\u2019t. You\u2019re compelled to keep playing with it until you figure it out.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cWell, yeah. It\u2019s been a rough night\u2014a rough few weeks, actually.\u201d</p><p>I smile and shift my baby into fifth gear. \u201cI know just the place.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t plan on plying her with alcohol until she gives up the goodies. But...if she happens to get wasted and rips my clothes off in the alley behind the bar, don\u2019t expect me to beat her off with a stick either.</p><p>All kidding aside, this is a new beginning for Kate and me. A fresh start. I\u2019ll be a perfect gentleman. Scout\u2019s honor.</p><p>Then again, I never was a Boy Scout.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cFIRST TIME YOU GOT DRUNK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen. Just before a school dance. My parents were out of town, and my date, Jennifer Brewster, thought it\u2019d be mature to have a vodka and orange juice. But all I could find was rum. So we had rum and orange juice. We ended up puking our guts out behind the gym. To this day, I can\u2019t smell rum without wanting to hurl. First kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy Wilkens. Sixth grade, at the movies. He put his arm around me and stuck his tongue down my throat. I had no idea what was happening.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re playing First and Ten. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this drinking game, I\u2019ll explain. One person asks about a first\u2014your first trip to Disneyland, the first time you got laid, doesn\u2019t matter. And the other person has to tell about that first. If they haven\u2019t done it for the first time yet\u2014or won\u2019t answer\u2014they have to drink their shot. Then they have to tell you something they have done at least ten times. Which one of us suggested this game? I\u2019ve already missed five firsts. I have no clue.</p><p>\u201cFirst time you fell in love?\u201d</p><p>Make that six. I pick up my vodka and toss it back.</p><p>We\u2019re in a darkened corner of a small local bar named Howie\u2019s. It\u2019s a low-key place, kind of like Cheers. The patrons are laid-back, easygoing. Not the slick, couture-wearing Manhattanites with whom I typically spend my weekend nights. I like it here, though. Except for the karaoke. Whoever invented karaoke is evil. They should be shot between the eyes with a dull bullet.</p><p>Kate cocks her head to the side, appraising me. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been in love?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cLove is for suckers, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cCynical much? So you don\u2019t believe love is real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say that. My parents have been happily married for thirty-six years. My sister loves her husband, and he worships her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, \u201cI just don\u2019t see the point. It\u2019s a whole lot of work and not much payoff. Your odds of making it for even a few years are only fifty-fifty at best. Too complicated for my tastes.\u201d</p><p>I prefer simple and straightforward. I work, I fuck, I eat, I sleep, on Sundays I have brunch with my mother and play basketball with the guys. Effortless. Easy.</p><p>Kate sits back in her chair. \u201cMy mother used to say, \u2018If it\u2019s not difficult, it\u2019s not worth it.\u2019 Besides, don\u2019t you get...lonely?\u201d</p><p>On cue, a busty shot girl comes to our table and leans over with her hand on my shoulder and her cl**vage in my face. \u201cYou need anything else, cutie?\u201d</p><p>That pretty much answers Kate\u2019s question, huh?</p><p>\u201cSure, honey. Could you bring us another round?\u201d</p><p>As the waitress moves away, Kate\u2019s eyes meet mine before rolling to the ceiling. \u201cAnyway. Give me your ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had sex with more than ten women in one week.\u201d</p><p>Cancun. Spring Break 2004. Mexico is awesome.</p><p>\u201cUck. Is that supposed to impress me?\u201d</p><p>I grin proudly. \u201cIt impresses most women.\u201d I lean forward and lower my voice as I rub my thumb slowly against hers. \u201cThen again, you\u2019re not most women, are you?\u201d</p><p>She licks her lips, her eyes on mine. \u201cAre you flirting with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Shot Girl brings our drinks. I crack my knuckles. I\u2019m up. Time to get...intimate.</p><p>\u201cFirst bl*w j*b?\u201d</p><p>I tried. I held out for as long as I could. I couldn\u2019t resist any longer.</p><p>The smile drops from Kate\u2019s face. \u201cYou have serious issues. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Borrowing some peer pressure from The Breakfast Club, I goad, \u201cCome on, Claire\u2014just answer a simple question.\u201d</p><p>Kate picks up her drink and knocks it back impressively.</p><p>I am both shocked and appalled. \u201cYou\u2019ve never given a bl*w j*b?\u201d</p><p>Please, God, don\u2019t let Kate be one of those women. You know the ones I mean\u2014cold, unadventurous, the ones who just don\u2019t do that. The ones who insist on making love, which means f**king in the missionary position only. They\u2019re the reason men like Elliot Spitzer and Bill Clinton risk the destruction of their political careers, \u2019cause they\u2019re just that desperate for a happy ending.</p><p>She flinches as the vodka burns down her throat. \u201cBilly doesn\u2019t like...or*l s*x. He doesn\u2019t like to give it, I mean.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s got to be drunk. There\u2019s no way in holy hell that Kate would be telling me this were she not completely and utterly shitfaced. She hides it well, don\u2019t you think? But she still hasn\u2019t answered my question.</p><p>As for her fianc\u00e9\u2014he\u2019s a p**sy. No pun intended. My mother always told me, \u201cAnyone worth doing, is worth doing well.\u201d Okay, she didn\u2019t actually say those exact words, but you get the picture. If I\u2019m not eager to go down on a chick, then I\u2019m not screwing her. Sorry if that\u2019s crude, but that\u2019s just how it is.</p><p>And this is Kate we\u2019re talking about here. I\u2019d eat her for breakfast every day of the week and twice on Sunday. And I can\u2019t think of a single man I know who would disagree with me.</p><p>Billy is a total f**king idiot.</p><p>\u201cSo, since he\u2019s never...you know. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that I should do it to him. So, no...I\u2019ve never...\u201d</p><p>She can\u2019t even say it. I have to help her out. \u201cGiven head? Sucked him off? Been tea-bagged? Blown his balls and his mind?\u201d</p><p>She covers her face and giggles. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the most adorable thing I\u2019ve ever seen. She takes her hands off her face and blows out a breath. \u201cMoving on. My ten. I\u2019ve been with Billy for over ten years.\u201d</p><p>I choke on my beer. \u201cTen years?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cAlmost eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you started dating when you were...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>So, if I\u2019m hearing her correctly, what she\u2019s most likely saying is no man has ever gone down on her? Don\u2019t mean to beat a dead horse, but I just can\u2019t wrap my mind around this. That\u2019s what she\u2019s saying, right? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could cry. What a f**king sin. Spare the karaoke guy\u2014save the bullet for Kate\u2019s boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout seven years. He asked me the week before I left for college.\u201d</p><p>Those two sentences tell me exactly what kind of man shithead Billy happens to be. Insecure, jealous, clingy. He knew his girl was out of his league, that she was going places and would most likely leave him in the dust. So what does he do? He asks her to marry him, pretty much trapping her before she knew any better.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the ring is so...you know...small. But it doesn\u2019t matter to me. Billy worked for six months to get me this ring. Bussing tables, mowing lawns, killing himself. This tiny stone means more to me than the biggest rock at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>And those few sentences tell me exactly what kind of woman Kate Brooks is too. A lot of Manhattan women are all about flash\u2014the brand of the car, the name on the bag, the size of the ring. Superficial. Empty. I should know; I\u2019ve slept with most of them. But Kate is the real deal. Genuine. She\u2019s all about quality, not quantity.</p><p>She reminds me of my sister, actually. Even with all the money we grew up with, Alexandra doesn\u2019t really give a rat\u2019s ass about labels or what other people think. That\u2019s how she ended up with a guy like Steven. He and Alexandra started dating in high school, when he was a sophomore and she was a senior. That maneuver made him a legend at St. Mary\u2019s Prep. To this day, his name is invoked in her hallowed halls with reverence.</p><p>What\u2019s that? Yes, I went to Catholic school. You\u2019re surprised? You shouldn\u2019t be. My profanity has a certain religious flavor that can only be learned through a lifetime of Catholic education. Jesus H. Christ...Goddamn it...Jesus, Mary, and Joseph...f**king Christ Almighty...holy f**king shit\u2014and that\u2019s just what we heard from the priests. Don\u2019t get me started on the nuns.</p><p>Anyway\u2014where was I? That\u2019s right, Steven and Alexandra.</p> <p>Steven is not the most handsome guy, nor the most suave. He\u2019s not a player; he never was. Then how did he manage to bag a prize like my sister, you ask?</p><p>Confidence.</p><p>Steven never doubted himself. Never thought for a second that he wasn\u2019t good enough for The Bitch. He refused to be intimidated. He always exuded that quiet self-assurance that women are attracted to. Because he knew that no one could ever love my sister the way he did. So when Alexandra left for college years before Steven could join her, did he worry? Hell no. He wasn\u2019t afraid to let her go. Because he knew with absolute certainty that one day she would come back. To him.</p><p>Obviously Billy Dickhead Warren wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>Two hours later, Kate and I are certifiably drunk. See us there? Staring at the stage, sipping our beers with those glazed looks on our faces. You can learn a lot about a person when they\u2019re drunk, and I have learned a boatload about Kate. When she drinks\u2014she\u2019s a talker.</p><p>Think she\u2019s a screamer too? Never mind; that part comes later.</p> <p>Kate\u2019s hometown is Greenville, Ohio. Mom still lives there, running the western-themed diner her family owns. It sounds like a real middle-America type of place. The kind where the locals eat breakfast before work and teenagers congregate after a football game. Kate waitressed there during her high school years. She didn\u2019t mention a dad, though, and I didn\u2019t ask. And despite being Valedictorian, Kate used to be quite the wild child. That explains why she holds her liquor so well. Apparently, she and the shithead spent their youth breaking into roller-skating rinks after hours, shoplifting, and singing in a band together.</p><p>Oh yeah, that\u2019s what the donkey dick still does for a living. He\u2019s a musician. You know what that means, right?</p><p>Yep\u2014unemployed.</p><p>Why is Kate still with this loser? That\u2019s the million-dollar question, kids. I\u2019m not a snob. I don\u2019t care if you pump gas or run the register at Mickey-f**king-D\u2019s. If you\u2019re a man, you work\u2014you don\u2019t leech off your girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cKaraoke sucks,\u201d I grunt as the blond transvestite at the microphone finishes the song \u201cI Will Survive.\u201d</p><p>Kate tilts her head to the side. \u201cShe\u2019s...he\u2019s...not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my ears are bleeding.\u201d I motion to the other comatose faces around the bar. \u201cAnd they\u2019re dying a slow death.\u201d</p><p>Kate sips her beer. \u201cIt\u2019s just the wrong song for this kind of place. The right one would wake them up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re nuts.\u201d</p><p>She slurs just a little, \u201cBetcha\u2019 I could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Not unless you plan on doing a singing striptease.\u201d</p><p>And that, boys and girls, is a show I would give my left nut to see.</p><p>She takes my cell phone off the table and wags her finger at me. \u201cNo pictures. Can\u2019t have any evidence.\u201d Then she gets up and walks on stage. Hear the groans of pain from my bar-mates as the music begins?</p><p>But then she starts to sing:</p><p>I don\u2019t stand a chance</p><p>When you look at me that way</p><p>I\u2019ll do anything you want me to</p><p>Anything for you</p><p>And I\u2019ll shout it for the whole world to know</p><p>Oh, honey, that\u2019s what you do to me</p><p>And I don\u2019t mind at all</p><p>Good freaking God.</p><p>Her voice is deep, and perfect, and arousing. Like a phone-sex worker at one of those nine-hundred numbers. It floats around the room and washes over me like...like verbal foreplay. My body reacts instantly to the sound. I\u2019m as hard as a f**king rock.</p><p>You know I\u2019m not a girl who cares to see</p><p>Or gives a damn what anyone thinks of me</p><p>I go down hard, I stand my ground</p><p>But whenever you come around</p><p>I\u2019m helpless</p><p>Baby, I don\u2019t stand a chance</p><p>Every time you look at me that way</p><p>It brings me to my knees</p><p>She starts swaying her h*ps in time to the music, and I imagine how perfect she would look on her knees. I can\u2019t take my eyes off of her. She\u2019s mesmerizing...hypnotic.</p><p>And I\u2019m changing, never thought I\u2019d be like this</p><p>But you showed me a better way</p><p>I\u2019ll do anything for your kiss</p><p>In all my days I\u2019ve never seen</p><p>A man who means everything to me</p><p>I can leave everything else in the dust</p><p>But it\u2019s you I just can\u2019t give up</p><p>She has the full attention of every man in the place. But her eyes...those stunning onyx eyes...are looking right at me.</p><p>And it makes me feel like a god.</p><p>I\u2019ve never let anyone get this close to me before</p><p>Distance keeps me safe and keeps me sane</p><p>But now you\u2019ve got my heart twisted with yours</p><p>Better than it\u2019s ever been, there\u2019s a lot to lose</p><p>But even so much more to win</p><p>Oh, baby...</p><p>She tosses her hair back, and I picture her doing just that as she rides me with long and hard strokes. Jesus. I\u2019ve gotten lap dances from some of the best strippers in the city, and I\u2019ve never come in my pants\u2014not once. But that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do if this song doesn\u2019t end real f**king soon.</p><p>I feel so helpless</p><p>When you look at me that way</p><p>I\u2019ll do anything for you</p><p>Only for you</p><p>The bar erupts into hoots and whistles and clapping hands as Kate walks off the stage. Sounds like a frigging rodeo. She smiles giddily as she walks toward me. I stand up, and she stops just inches away.</p><p>She looks up at me and raises one brow. \u201cTold you I could wake them up.\u201d</p><p>I softly say, \u201cThat was...you...are amazing.\u201d</p><p>I want to kiss her. More than I want to f**king breathe. Images of last night flash in my mind. Of how goddamn good she felt in my arms. I need to kiss her. The smile slowly slides off her face, and I know she needs it too. I push a strand of her hair back behind her ear and lean in...</p><p>And the shrill scream of her cell phone comes between us.</p><p>Kate blinks like she\u2019s waking up from a trance and picks up her phone. \u201cH\u2014Hello?\u201d She flinches and pulls the phone from her ear to gain some distance from the shouting voice on the other end. \u201cNo...Billy, I didn\u2019t forget. I just had a difficult evening. No...yes...I\u2019m at a bar called Howie\u2019s. It\u2019s on...\u201d She stares at her phone a moment, and I\u2019m guessing the dipshit just hung up on her. Her eyes are completely sober now.</p><p>\u201cI have to go outside. Billy\u2019s coming to pick me up.\u201d</p><p>Won\u2019t this be a treat? I get to meet a walking, talking a**hole. It\u2019ll be like Freak Night at the carnival.</p><p>While we wait outside on the sidewalk, Kate turns to me. \u201cWhat are we going to say to your father?\u201d</p><p>And there\u2019s the question I\u2019ve avoided asking myself all night. The old man\u2019s a stand-up guy\u2014chivalrous. Traditional. I\u2019d like to think he\u2019d be proud of my defending Kate\u2019s honor. But he\u2019s also a businessman. And the truth is, I could have defended Kate and still signed Anderson. It\u2019s what I should have done. It\u2019s what I would have done had it been anyone but her on the negotiating table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. No, we\u2019re a team, remember? We both lost this client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who went off on the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m the one who didn\u2019t stop you. Now, I appreciate what you did for me, Drew, really. You were pretty magnificent, actually.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s just the vodka, but her words make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t need a white knight,\u201d she goes on. \u201cI\u2019m a big girl, and I can certainly handle whatever your father may dish out. We\u2019ll talk to him together on Monday morning. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>This clinches it: Kate Brooks is one incredible woman.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s then that a black Thunderbird roars down the street and stops in front of us. Yes\u2014I said Thunderbird. Can you say Totally Eighties Weekend? A guy with an average build and light brown hair gets out of it.</p><p>Is it just me, or does he look like a douchebag to you too? The old-fashioned kind. Your grandma\u2019s vinegar-and-water type of douche.</p><p>With a frown, he zeros in on Kate before looking me over. And then he looks even more pissed. Maybe dumbass isn\u2019t as stupid as I thought; he recognizes competition when he sees it.</p><p>He comes around and opens the passenger door for Kate. She sighs and gives me a tight smile. Then she takes two steps toward the car and trips on a crack in the sidewalk. I move to catch her, but Needle Dick is closer and beats me to it. He holds her at arm\u2019s length, the anger on his face turning to disgust.</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king wasted?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t really appreciate his tone. Someone needs to teach him some f**king manners.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start, Billy. I\u2019ve had a bad night,\u201d Kate tells him.</p><p>\u201cA bad night? Really? As in having the biggest gig of your life and your girlfriend not showing up? Was it that bad, Kate?\u201d</p><p>Gig? Did he really just say gig? She actually sleeps with this moron? You have got to be kidding me.</p><p>She pulls out of his grasp. \u201cYou know what...\u201d She starts off strong\u2014and then deflates. \u201cJust...let\u2019s go home.\u201d She gets in the car and Bitch Boy slams it closed behind her. He glares at me as he walks around to the driver\u2019s side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kate rolls down the window. \u201cGoodnight, Drew. And thanks...for everything.\u201d</p><p>I give her a smile despite my growing desire to smash her fianc\u00e9\u2019s face in. \u201cAny time.\u201d</p><p>And the Thunderbird roars away. Leaving me, for the second night in a row, aching for Kate Brooks. I rub my hand down my face as a voice comes from behind me.</p><p>\u201cHey, cutie. I just got off. Want to get off with me?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s Shot Girl. She\u2019s decent-looking\u2014nothing to write home about\u2014but she\u2019s there. And after seeing Kate take off with the spineless weasel she\u2019s marrying, I refuse to spend the rest of the evening alone.</p><p>\u201cSure, baby. I\u2019ll get us a cab.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a lousy lay. Some advice: Being as still and silent as a corpse when a guy is f**king you will never be remembered as a stellar sexual experience.</p><p>The other reason it sucks is because I can\u2019t get Kate out of my head. I keep comparing Shot Girl to her, and the former, of course, comes up disappointingly short.</p><p>You think I\u2019m a sleazeball for saying that? Come on\u2014are you going to tell me you never imagined that it was Brad Pitt sticking it to you instead of your beer-bellied husband? That\u2019s what I thought.</p> <p>Still think I\u2019m a scumbag? Then you\u2019re in luck. I\u2019ll be getting just what you think I deserve very soon.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>MY FATHER WAS NOT PLEASED with how I handled the Anderson situation. I\u2019d been rash, unprofessional, blah, blah, blah. And because of my seniority, he held me more accountable for losing the client than Kate.</p><p>But the fact that I was on the shit list at the office for a while didn\u2019t hit me as hard you\u2019d think. Mostly because I have no regrets over how I\u2019d reacted. If I had it to do all over again, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. So, maybe my father was disappointed in me, but to tell you the truth, by the time he got done reaming me out, I was pretty f**king disappointed in him too.</p><p>Also, in the four weeks following that disastrous meeting, things between Kate and I have continued to evolve. We still trade punches at work, but they\u2019re more jabs to the chest, meant to sting, rather than right hooks to the jaw, designed to knock each other on our respective asses. We share ideas, help each other out. My father was right about that, at least. Kate and I complement each other, balance each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Somewhere along the line, she\u2019s become more to me than just a set of legs I want to crawl between. More than a pair of pants I desperately want to get down.</p> <p>Now she\u2019s Kate\u2014a friend. A friend who causes my dick to stand at attention every time she walks into the room, but that\u2019s my cross to bear, I guess. Because as much as I still want her, and as sure as I am a part of her wants me, Kate is just not the cheating kind.</p><p>At least not the kind who could live with herself afterward.</p><p>Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking: But what happened? How did a self-assured, handsome, wickedly charming young man like myself become the flu-infected, sloppy shut-in you first met?</p><p>We\u2019re getting there\u2014trust me.</p><p>To show you the whole picture, there are a few more players you need to meet in the shit-pit soap opera that is now my life. You\u2019ve seen Dirtbag Warren. He\u2019ll be back later, unfortunately.</p><p>And now you\u2019ll meet Dee-Dee Warren. She\u2019s the jackass\u2019s cousin. But you shouldn\u2019t hold that against her. She\u2019s also Kate\u2019s best friend. I\u2019ll show you.</p><p>\u201cI saw you talking to the brunette with the nice rack. You go back to her place?\u201d Matthew asks me. He, Jack, and I are having lunch at a diner a few blocks from the office. We\u2019re discussing our most recent Saturday night.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t make it that far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I smirk, remembering what an exhibitionist the girl had been. \u201cI mean that cab will never be the same again. And I think we scarred the driver for life.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re such a f**king dog, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I saved doggie-style for when we were actually inside her apartment.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t give me that look again. We\u2019ve been over this.</p><p>Guys. Sex. Talk.</p><p>Besides, despite the wild eagerness of Taxi Girl, the sex was sub-par. She wasn\u2019t even Colgate. She was more like some generic brand of toothpaste they stock in low-grade hotel rooms whose name you can\u2019t even remember after you brush with it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kate,\u201d Matthew says, looking behind me. I didn\u2019t see her approach us.</p><p>We\u2019ll stop here for just a moment. This is important.</p><p>See the look on her face? The thin line of her lips? The slight wrinkle of her brow? She heard what I said. And she doesn\u2019t look too happy about it, does she? I missed this the first time around, but you should make a note of it. This moment will come back to bite me in the ass later on.</p><p>I turn to look at her. Her expression is now blank and passive.</p><p>\u201cYou want to join us?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I just finished having lunch with a friend, actually.\u201d</p><p>And up walks her friend. She\u2019s wearing ankle-high black boots, black tights that are ripped at strategic places up and down her legs, a miniscule skirt, a strapless hot-pink top, and a short knitted gray sweater. Her hair is long, strawberry-blond, and wavy, her lips a shiny red, and her quick amber eyes look us over beneath a curtain of thick dark lashes.</p><p>She\u2019s...interesting. I wouldn\u2019t say pretty, but striking in a sexy street-fashion kind of way.</p><p>\u201cMatthew Fisher, Jack O\u2019Shay, Drew Evans, this is Dee-Dee Warren.\u201d</p><p>On hearing my name, Dee-Dee\u2019s eyes turn sharply in my direction. It feels like she\u2019s analyzing me\u2014sort of how a guy would look at a car engine right before he busts it up.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Drew? I\u2019ve heard about you.\u201d</p><p>Kate told her friend about me? Interesting.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? What\u2019ve you heard?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI could tell you, but then I\u2019d have to kill you.\u201d She points her finger at me. \u201cYou just keep on being nice to my Katie-girl here. You know, if you\u2019d like to keep your balls attached to your pecker, that is.\u201d</p><p>Although her tone is light, I get the distinct impression Dee-Dee isn\u2019t f**king around.</p><p>I smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to show her how nice I can be. She keeps turning me down.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles. Then Matthew interjects smoothly, \u201cSo, Dee-Dee...is that short for something? Donna, Deborah?\u201d</p><p>Kate grins mischievously. \u201cDelores. It\u2019s a family name\u2014her grandmother\u2019s. She hates it.\u201d</p><p>Delores gives Kate the stink-eye.</p><p>Shifting into pick-up mode, Matthew replies, \u201cDelores is a gorgeous name, for a gorgeous girl. Plus, it rhymes with clitoris...and I really know my way around them. Big fan.\u201d</p><p>Delores smiles slowly at Matthew and runs one finger across her lower lip. Then, she turns to the rest of us and says, \u201cAnyhoo. I have to jet, gotta get to work. Nice meeting you, boys.\u201d She hugs Kate and throws Matthew a wink as she walks away.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got to get to work?\u201d I ask. \u201cI thought the strip clubs didn\u2019t open until four.\u201d</p><p>Kate just smiles. \u201cDee\u2019s not a stripper. She just dresses like that to throw people off. So they\u2019re shocked when they find out what she really does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she do?\u201d Matthew asks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a rocket scientist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re f**king with us.\u201d Jack voices what all three of us are thinking.</p><p>\u201cAfraid not. Delores is a chemist. One of her clients is NASA. Her lab works on improving the efficiency of the fuel they use in the space shuttles.\u201d She shudders. \u201cDee-Dee Warren with access to highly explosive substances...it\u2019s something I try to not think about every day.\u201d</p><p>After a beat, Matthew speaks up. \u201cBrooks, you\u2019ve got to hook me up. I\u2019m a nice guy. Let me take your friend out. She won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Kate thinks a moment. \u201cOkay. Sure. You seem like Dee\u2019s type.\u201d She hands him a business card. \u201cBut I have to warn you. She\u2019s the love-\u2019em-and-leave-\u2019em-with-bruises type of girl. If you\u2019re looking for a good time for a night or two, then definitely call her. If you\u2019re looking for anything deeper than that, I\u2019d stay away.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re speechless. And then Matthew rises from the table, walks up to Kate and kisses her on the cheek. I suddenly have the urge to put my hand down his throat and rip his tonsils out.</p><p>Is that wrong?</p><p>\u201cYou...are my new best friend,\u201d he tells her.</p><p>Kate misreads the scowl on my face. \u201cDon\u2019t pout, Drew. It\u2019s not my fault your friends like me better than you.\u201d</p><p>She means Steven too. A few days ago, he was frantically trying to find the perfect place to take The Bitch for their wedding anniversary. Apparently, Kate\u2019s neighbor is the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 at Chez, the most exclusive restaurant in the city. She was able to get him a table for that evening.</p><p>Alexandra must have done things to Steven that night that I don\u2019t even want to contemplate. Because ever since, Steven Reinhart would happily take a bullet to the chest for Kate Brooks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the boobs,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIf I had a set like yours, they\u2019d like me better too.\u201d</p><p>A few weeks ago, that comment would have pissed her off. Now she just shakes her head and laughs.</p><p>The night before Thanksgiving is officially the biggest bar night of the year. Everyone goes out. Everyone is looking for a good time. Usually, Matthew, Jack, and I start the night at my father\u2019s day-before-Thanksgiving office party and work our way out to the clubs afterward. It\u2019s tradition.</p><p>So you can imagine my surprise when I enter the large conference room and see Matthew\u2019s arm around the woman who I can only assume is his date for the evening\u2014Delores Warren. Since he met her two and a half weeks ago, Matthew\u2019s been MIA on the weekends, and I\u2019m starting to suspect why. I\u2019ll have to talk to him tomorrow.</p><p>Beside them are my father and Kate.</p><p>And for the second time in my life, Kate Brooks leaves me breathless. She\u2019s wearing a deep burgundy dress that hugs her in all the right places and strappy heeled shoes that send my imagination spinning into X-rated territory. Her hair falls around her shoulders in soft shining waves. My hand twitches to touch it as I walk toward her.</p><p>Then someone in the middle of the room moves\u2014and I see that she\u2019s not alone.</p><p>Fuck me.</p><p>Everyone brings their significant others to these kinds of things. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the dickwad is here. He pulls at the tie of his suit like a frigging ten-year-old, obviously uncomfortable in it. Pussy.</p><p>I button the jacket of my own perfectly tailored Armani and make my way over.</p><p>\u201cDrew!\u201d my father greets me. Though things between him and me had been tense for a few days, they\u2019d quickly gone back to normal. He never can stay pissed at me for long.</p><p>Look at this face. Could you?</p><p>\u201cI was just telling Mr. Warren,\u201d he says, \u201cabout that deal Kate closed last week. How lucky we are to have her.\u201d</p><p>Have her? The word lucky doesn\u2019t even come close.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all an act,\u201d Delores teases. \u201cBeneath her corporate suit and that good-girl persona beats the heart of a true rebel. I could tell you stories about Katie that would put hair on your eyeballs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kate turns stern eyes on her friend. \u201cThank you, Dee.

Now.</p><p>Words fly out of my mouth like well-aimed bullets: \u201cThat\u2019s right. You were quite the little delinquent back in the day, weren\u2019t you Kate? Dad, did you know she used to sing in a band? That\u2019s how you supported yourself through business school, right? Guess it beats pole dancing.\u201d</p> <p>She chokes on her drink. Gentleman that I am, I hand her a napkin.</p><p>\u201cAnd Billy here, that\u2019s what he still does. You\u2019re a musician, right?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me like I\u2019m a pile of dog crap that he just stepped in. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, tell us Billy, are you like a Bret Michaels kind of rocker? Or more of a Vanilla Ice?\u201d See how his jaw clenches? How his eyes narrow? Bring it, Monkey Boy. Please.</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you grab your accordion, or whatever you play, and pop up on stage? There\u2019s a lot of money floating around this room. Maybe you could book a wedding. Or a bar mitzvah.\u201d</p><p>Almost there.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play those types of venues.\u201d</p><p>This should do it.</p><p>\u201cWow. In this economy, I didn\u2019t think the poor and jobless could be so picky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you piece of\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBilly, honey, could you get me another drink from the bar? I\u2019m almost done with this one.\u201d Kate pulls on his arm, cutting off what I\u2019m sure would have been a brilliant retort.</p><p>Are you feeling the sarcasm?</p><p>And then she turns toward me, and she doesn\u2019t sound nearly as friendly. \u201cDrew, I just remembered I have some documents to give you about the Genesis account. They\u2019re in my office. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t move. I don\u2019t answer her. My eyes are still locked in a staring contest with Shit For Brains.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a party, Kate,\u201d my father says, clueless. \u201cYou should save the work for Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll just take a minute,\u201d she tells him with a smile\u2014before grabbing my arm and dragging me away.</p><p>Once we\u2019re in her office, Kate slams the door behind us. I straighten my sleeves, then smile benevolently. \u201cIf you wanted to be alone with me that badly, all you had to do was ask.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t appreciate my humor. \u201cWhat are you doing, Drew?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you insulting Billy? Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to come here tonight?\u201d</p><p>Poor Billy. Stuck in a room with the big bad successful bankers.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you frigging bring him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an a**hole.\u201d</p><p>She looks up sharply. \u201cBilly and I have been through a lot together. You don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s not good enough for you. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop trying to embarrass him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just pointing out the facts. If the truth embarrasses your boyfriend, then that\u2019s his problem, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a jealously thing?\u201d</p><p>For the record? I have never been jealous a day in my life. Just because when I see them together I can\u2019t decide if I want to puke or punch his f**king lights out\u2014she calls that jealousy?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you have this thing for me, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wait one goddamn minute. Let\u2019s back the f**k up, shall we?</p><p>\u201cI have a thing for you? I\u2019m sorry, was it my hand grabbing your crotch in my office a couple months back? Because I remember it the other way around.\u201d</p><p>And now she\u2019s pissed. \u201cYou\u2019re such a bastard sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then we\u2019re a perfect fit, \u2019cause you\u2019re a first-class bitch most of the time.\u201d</p><p>Fire dances in her eyes as she raises her half-filled glass.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you f**king dare. You throw that drink at me, I\u2019m not responsible for what I do after.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll give you a minute to guess what she does...</p><p>Yep. She threw the drink at me.</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit!\u201d I grab the tissues from her desk and wipe my dripping face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of your random sluts! Don\u2019t you ever talk to me like that again.\u201d</p><p>My face is dry, but my shirt and jacket are still soaked. I throw the tissues down. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m leaving anyway. I have a date to get to.\u201d</p><p>She scoffs, \u201cA date? Wouldn\u2019t a date involve actual conversation? Don\u2019t you mean you have a quick f**k to get to?\u201d</p><p>I close my hands around her waist and pull her in. In a low voice I tell her, \u201cMy f**ks are never quick\u2014they\u2019re long and thorough. And you should be careful, Kate. Now you\u2019re the one who sounds jealous.\u201d</p><p>Her palms are flat against my chest, and my face is just inches from hers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d I tell her quickly.</p><p>And then we\u2019re at it again\u2014my mouth, her lips\u2014joined hot and heavy. My hands are buried in her hair, cradling her head. Her hands grip the front of my shirt, holding me close.</p><p>I know what you\u2019re thinking. And, yes, apparently arguing for Kate and me is akin to foreplay. It seems to get us both all charged up. I just hope we get to come before we kill each other.</p><p>Just when things are starting to get good, there\u2019s a pounding on the door. Kate either doesn\u2019t hear it or she, like me, doesn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>\u201cKate? Kate, you in there?\u201d</p><p>The cocksucker\u2019s voice cuts through the lust that has us stuck together like glue. Kate pulls away. She stares at me a minute, her eyes guilty, her fingers resting on the lips I just tasted.</p><p>You know what? Screw this. Do I look like a goddamn yoyo to you? I don\u2019t play games with people\u2014I don\u2019t appreciate being played with. If Kate can\u2019t decide what she wants, I\u2019ll decide for her. Stick a fork in me; I\u2019m f**king done.</p><p>I step up to the door and open it wide, giving Shithead plenty of room as he walks in.</p><p>Then I smile. \u201cYou can have her now. I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>And I don\u2019t even think about looking back as I walk out.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>THANKSGIVING IS HELD AT MY PARENTS\u2019 COUNTRY HOUSE upstate every year. It\u2019s always a small family affair. There\u2019s my parents, of course. You\u2019ve met my father. My mother is an older, shorter version of Alexandra. For all her strong feminist beliefs\u2014she\u2019d been a top-notch attorney before motherhood lured her away\u2014she loves playing the happy homemaker. After she and my father hit the big-time financially, she also dedicated herself to various charitable organizations. It\u2019s what she still does with most of her time now that Alexandra and I have flown the nest.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Steven\u2019s father, George Reinhart. Picture Steven thirty years from now with thinning hair and a serious case of crow\u2019s feet. Mrs. Reinhart passed away when we were teenagers. To my knowledge, George hasn\u2019t been out on a single date since. He spends a lot of time at work, quietly crunching numbers in his office. He\u2019s a great guy.</p><p>And that brings us to the Fishers, Matthew\u2019s parents. Can\u2019t wait for you to see them. They\u2019re a f**king riot. Frank and Estelle Fisher are the most mellow people I\u2019ve ever met.</p><p>They\u2019re almost catatonic.</p><p>Imagine Ward and June Cleaver after they\u2019ve smoked a giant bong of marijuana. That\u2019s Frank and Estelle. You\u2019d think Matthew\u2019s parents would be a little more high-strung, wouldn\u2019t you? I have a theory. They had Matthew later in life, and I think he sucked out any energy they had left\u2014like a parasite.</p><p>Topping off the mix is Matthew, Steven, Alexandra, and myself.</p><p>Oh\u2014and of course the other woman in my life. I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t mentioned her before. She is the only female to ever truly hold my heart in her hand. I am her slave. She asks, and I do.</p><p>Gladly.</p><p>Her name is Mackenzie. She\u2019s got long blond hair and the biggest blue eyes you\u2019ll ever see. She\u2019s almost four. See her there? On the other end of the seesaw I\u2019m currently riding.</p><p>\u201cSo, Mackenzie, have you decided what you want to be when you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I wanna be a princess. And I wanna marry a prince and live in a castle.\u201d</p><p>I need to talk to my sister. Disney is dangerous. Corrosive brainwashing bullshit, if you ask me.</p><p>\u201cOr, you could go into real estate. Then you could buy the castle yourself and you won\u2019t need the prince.\u201d</p><p>She thinks I\u2019m funny. She laughs.</p><p>\u201cUncle Drew. How\u2019s I gonna have a baby wit no prince?\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got plenty of time for babies. After you get your masters in business or your medical degree. Oh, or you can be a CEO and start a daycare at your office. Then you can bring your babies to work with you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma don\u2019t go to a office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma sold herself short, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>My sister was a brilliant trial attorney. She could have gone all the way to the Supreme Court. Seriously. She was that good.</p><p>Alexandra worked throughout her entire pregnancy and had a nanny all lined up. Then she held Mackenzie in her arms for the first time. She told the nanny the same day her services wouldn\u2019t be needed. Not that I blame her. I couldn\u2019t imagine a more important job than making sure my perfect niece grows up happy and healthy.</p><p>\u201cUncle Drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs you gonna die alone?\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on dying for a long time, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma says you gonna die alone. She tol\u2019 Daddy that you gonna die and it be days till a cleanin\u2019 lady find your rottin\u2019 corpse.\u201d</p><p>Lovely. Thank you, Alexandra.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019s a corpse, Uncle Drew?\u201d</p><p>Wow.</p><p>I\u2019m saved from having to answer when I see Matthew walking down the back steps into the yard.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie, look who\u2019s here!\u201d She hops off the seesaw and flings herself into Matthew\u2019s open arms.</p><p>Before you ask, the answer is no\u2014when she is older, my little darling will never hook up with a guy like me. She\u2019ll be too smart for that. I\u2019ll make sure of it. Guess that makes me a hypocrite, huh? That\u2019s okay. I can live with that.</p><p>Matthew puts Mackenzie down and walks over. \u201cHey, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go out early last night?\u201d he asks me. \u201cYou never came back to the party.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMy head wasn\u2019t in it. I hit the gym and went to bed.\u201d</p><p>The truth is I spent three hours pounding the hell out of the punching bag, imagining all the while that it was Billy Warren\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou hung out with that Delores chick?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cHer, Kate, and Billy.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat guy licks ass.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie walks over to us and holds up a glass jar half-filled with dollar bills. I slide a dollar into it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiots annoy me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mackenzie holds up the jar again, and in goes another dollar.</p><p>The jar?</p><p>It was invented by my sister, who apparently thinks my language is too harsh for her offspring. It\u2019s the Bad Word Jar. Every time someone\u2014usually me\u2014swears, they have to pay a dollar. At this rate, that thing is going to put Mackenzie through college.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with you and Delores?\u201d</p> <p>He smiles. \u201cWe\u2019re hanging out. She\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>Usually Matthew is more forthcoming with the details. It\u2019s not like I get off on his stories, but you have to understand, Matthew and I have been friends since birth. That means every kiss, every breast, every hand job, bl*w j*b, pearl necklace, and lay has been shared and discussed.</p><p>And now he\u2019s stonewalling me. What\u2019s up with that?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve nailed her?\u201d</p><p>He frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Drew.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m confused. \u201cThen what\u2019s it like, Matthew? You haven\u2019t hung out in over two weeks. I can understand you being too p**sy-whipped to come out if you\u2019re getting some. But if not, what\u2019s the deal?\u201d</p><p>He smiles in a nostalgic, remembering-a-happy-moment kind of way. \u201cShe\u2019s just...different. It\u2019s hard to explain. We talk, you know? And I\u2019m always kind of thinking about her. It\u2019s like the minute I drop her off, I can\u2019t wait to see her again. She just...amazes me. I wish you knew what I meant.\u201d</p><p>And the scary thing is\u2014I know exactly what he means.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in dangerous territory, man. You see what Steven goes through. This path leads to the Dark Side. We always said we wouldn\u2019t go there. You sure about this?\u201d</p><p>Matthew smiles, and in his best Darth Vader voice tells me, \u201cYou don\u2019t know the power of the Dark Side.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s dinnertime. My mother makes a big show of bringing out the turkey, and everyone oohs and ahhs before my father carves it up. That\u2019s right\u2014Norman f**king Rockwell\u2019s got nothing on us.</p> <p>As bowls are passed and plates are filled, my mom says, \u201cDrew, honey, I\u2019m going to pack you up a big bag of leftovers. I don\u2019t even want to think about how you\u2019re eating in that apartment with no one to cook a decent meal. And I\u2019ll put dates on the containers so you\u2019ll know when to throw it out. The last time I looked in your refrigerator, it was like some sort of science experiment was growing in there.\u201d</p><p>Yes\u2014my mommy loves me. Told you so.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Matthew and Steven make loud, wet kissy noises at me. With both hands, I flip each of them the bird. Beside me I see Mackenzie looking at her fingers trying to copy the move. I quickly put my hand over hers and shake my head. I show her Mr. Spock\u2019s Vulcan salute instead.</p><p>After we say grace, I announce, \u201cI think Mackenzie should come live with me.\u201d</p><p>No one reacts. No one looks up. No one pauses. I\u2019ve made this suggestion several times since my niece was born.</p><p>Alexandra says, \u201cThe turkey\u2019s delicious, Mom. Very juicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello? I\u2019m serious here. She needs a positive female role model.\u201d</p><p>That gets The Bitch\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat the hell am I?\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie slides the jar toward her mother, and in goes a dollar. We all bring small bills to the table on holidays now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stay-at-home mom. Which is very commendable, don\u2019t get me wrong. But she should be exposed to career women too. And for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can\u2019t even remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a frigging break.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how much I owe after that little speech. I pass Mackenzie a ten. Did I say that jar would put her through college? I meant law school. I\u2019m going to need to hit an ATM soon.</p><p>Steven joins in. \u201cI think Alexandra is the perfect role model for our daughter. There\u2019s no one better.\u201d</p><p>Steven is a beaten man. And Matthew wants to join his club.</p><p>Unreal.</p><p>Alexandra smiles at him. \u201cThank you, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dear.\u201d</p><p>Matthew and I start coughing, \u201cWhipped...brown nose.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie looks at us suspiciously, unsure if we need to pay up or not.</p><p>Alexandra scowls.</p><p>I continue, \u201cI should bring her to the office with me. She should meet Kate, don\u2019t you think, Dad?\u201d</p><p>My mother asks quickly, \u201cWho\u2019s Kate?\u201d</p><p>My father answers between bites, \u201cKatherine Brooks, new employee. Brilliant girl. And quite the firecracker. She gave Drew a run for his money when she first started.\u201d</p><p>My mother looks at me with glittering, hopeful eyes. The way Paula Deen looks at a tub of lard, imagining the delicacy just waiting to be made. \u201cWell, this Kate sounds like a lovely young lady, Drew. Maybe you should have her over to the house for dinner.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cWe work together, Mom. She\u2019s engaged. To a jackass, but that\u2019s another story.\u201d</p><p>Another dollar bites the dust.</p><p>My sister interjects, \u201cI think Mom\u2019s just surprised to actually hear you refer to a woman by name. Usually it\u2019s \u2018the waitress with the nice butt\u2019 or \u2018the blonde with the big boobs.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Though her observation is accurate, I ignore it. \u201cThe point is, she\u2019s a terrific example for Mackenzie of how much a woman can accomplish.\u201d Despite her terrible taste in men. \u201cI\u2019d be...I think we\u2019d all be really proud if she grew up to be half the professional Kate is.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra looks surprised by my statement. Then she smiles warmly. \u201cMackenzie and I can take a trip into the city next week. We\u2019ll get together with you for lunch and meet the illustrious Kate Brooks.\u201d</p><p>We eat in silence for a few minutes, and then Alexandra says, \u201cThat reminds me. Matthew, could you escort me to a charity dinner the second Saturday in December? Steven is going to be out of town.\u201d She looks toward me. \u201cI would ask my darling brother to do it, but we all know he spends his Saturday nights with the city slu\u2014\u201d she glances at her daughter \u201c\u2014undesirables.\u201d</p><p>Before Matthew can answer, Mackenzie puts her two cents in. \u201cI don\u2019t think Uncle Matthew can come, Momma. He been too busy bein\u2019 p**sy whipped. Wha\u2019s p**sy whipped, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words leave her angelic little lips, a horrendous chain reaction is set off:</p><p>Matthew chokes on the black olive in his mouth, which flies out and nails Steven right in the eye.</p><p>Steven doubles over, holding his eye and yelling, \u201cI\u2019m hit! I\u2019m hit!\u201d and then goes on about how the salt from the olive juice is eating away at his cornea.</p><p>My father starts coughing. George stands up and begins pounding on his back while asking no one in particular if he should perform the Heimlich.</p><p>Estelle knocks over her glass of red wine, which quickly seeps into my mother\u2019s lace tablecloth. She makes no move to clean up the mess, but instead chants, \u201cOh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.\u201d</p><p>My mother runs around the dining room like a chicken with its head cut off, searching for non-cloth napkins to wipe up the stain, all the while assuring Estelle that everything\u2019s fine.</p><p>And Frank...well...Frank just keeps eating.</p><p>While the chaos continues around us, Alexandra\u2019s death-ray glare never wavers from Matthew and me. After squirming under it for about thirty seconds, Matthew caves. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, Alexandra. I swear to Christ it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>Chicken shit.</p><p>Thanks, Matthew. Way to leave my ass blowing in the wind. Remind me never to go to war with him as my wingman.</p><p>But as The Bitch glower is turned full force on me alone, I forgive him. I feel like at any moment I\u2019ll be reduced to a smoking pile of Drew ash on the chair. I dig deep and give her the sweetest Baby Brother smile I can manage.</p><p>Take a look. Is it working?</p><p>I\u2019m so f**king dead.</p><p>See, there\u2019s one thing about Bitch Justice you should know. It\u2019s swift and merciless. You won\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming; all you can be certain of is that it will come. And when it does, it will be painful. Very, very painful.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>ON MONDAY MORNING, I\u2019m in the conference room waiting for the staff meeting to start. Everyone\u2019s here. Everyone, that is, except Kate. My father glances at his watch. He\u2019s got an early tee-off this morning, and I know he\u2019s eager to get there. I scratch behind my ear.</p><p>Where the hell is she?</p><p>Finally, Kate comes barreling in with her coat still on and a bunch of folders falling out of her hands. She looks...terrible. I mean, she\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019s always beautiful. But take it from someone who\u2019s watched her closely\u2014Kate is having a bad day. See how pale she is? And when the hell did those dark circles crawl under her eyes? Her hair\u2019s thrown up in a messy bun, which would be sexy as hell if she didn\u2019t look so...ill.</p><p>She smiles nervously at my father. \u201cSorry, Mr. Evans. It\u2019s been a morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Kate. We\u2019re just getting started.\u201d</p><p>As my father rattles off his announcements, I don\u2019t take my eyes off her. She doesn\u2019t look at me once.</p><p>\u201cKate, do you have those projections for Pharmatab?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the deal my father was talking to the ass-muncher about at the office party. The one Kate closed last week. She looks up, her big brown eyes making her look all the more like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have them.</p><p>\u201cAhh...they\u2019re...um...\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and announce, \u201cI have them. Kate gave them to me last week to look over. But I left it on my desk at home. I\u2019ll get it to you ASAP, Dad.\u201d My father nods, and she closes her eyes in relief.</p><p>After the meeting is over, everyone slowly files out, and I walk up beside Kate. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She looks down at the folders in her hands and adjusts the coat on her arm. \u201cThank you for what you did in there, Drew. It was really decent of you.\u201d</p><p>I know what I said the other day\u2014that I was finished with her. I didn\u2019t mean it. I was talking out of my ass, blowing off some sexually frustrated steam. You know that. Think Kate knows? Think she gives a damn?</p><p>\u201cI have to do the decent thing once in a while. Just to keep you on your toes.\u201d I give her a small smile that she doesn\u2019t return.</p><p>And she still hasn\u2019t f**king looked at me. What\u2019s wrong with her? My heart begins to hammer in my chest as I run through all the possibilities. Is she sick? Did something happen to her mother? Was she mugged on the frigging subway?</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>Kate walks into her office and closes the door, leaving me standing on the outside. This is where men got the shitty end of the stick, people. When God gave Eve that extra rib? He should have given us something extra too. Like mental telepathy.</p><p>I once heard my mother tell my father that she shouldn\u2019t have to explain why she was pissed. That if he didn\u2019t already know what he\u2019d done wrong, then he wasn\u2019t really sorry for it. What the f**k does that even mean? Newsflash, ladies: We can\u2019t read your thoughts. And frankly, I\u2019m not entirely sure I\u2019d want to. The female mind is a scary place to be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Men? We don\u2019t leave a lot of room for doubt: You\u2019re a dick. You f**ked my girlfriend. You killed my dog. I hate you. Direct. Clear. Unambiguous. You girls should try it sometime. It would bring us all one step closer to world peace.</p><p>I back away from Kate\u2019s door. Looks like I won\u2019t be finding out what her deal is any time soon.</p><p>Later that day, I sit in a caf\u00e9 across from Matthew, not eating my sandwich.</p><p>\u201cSo, Alexandra get to you yet?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s referring to the Thanksgiving Day Massacre\u2014in case you\u2019ve forgotten. I nod. \u201cI got the call yesterday. Apparently I\u2019ve committed myself to volunteer next month at the Geriatric Society of Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve been worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Remember Steven\u2019s Aunt Bernadette?\u201d</p><p>Old women have a thing for me. And I don\u2019t mean a pinch-my-cheek, pat-me-on-the-head kind of thing. I mean a grab-my-ass, rub-my-junk, why-don\u2019t-you-push-my-wheelchair-into-the-broom-closet-so-we-can-get-nasty kind of thing.</p><p>It\u2019s f**king disturbing.</p> <p>Matthew\u2019s now laughing his ass off. Thanks for the sympathy, man.</p><p>The bell above the door to the caf\u00e9 jingles. I look up and decide that maybe God doesn\u2019t hate me after all. Because Billy Dumbass Warren just walked in. His face, at any other time, would definitely put a dent in my good mood. But at this moment? He\u2019s just the donkey dick I need to see. I\u2019ll be nice.</p><p>I approach him. \u201cHey, man.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Billy, I was just wondering, is everything okay with Kate?\u201d</p><p>He snarls, \u201cKate isn\u2019t any of your f**king business.\u201d</p> <p>Let the record show, I\u2019m trying. And he\u2019s being a prick. Why am I not surprised?</p><p>\u201cI see what you\u2019re saying. But this morning, she really didn\u2019t look well. Do you know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate is a big girl. She can take care of herself. She always does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>And then it hits me. Like a bucket of ice-cold Gatorade after a football game.</p><p>\u201cDid you do something to her?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer. He looks down. That\u2019s all the answer I need. I grab him by the front of his shirt and pull him up quick. A second later, Matthew\u2019s there telling me to calm down. I shake the jerk off just a little. \u201cI asked you a question, motherfucker. Did you do something to Kate?\u201d</p><p>He tells me to get my hands off him, and I shake him harder.</p> <p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe broke up! We broke the f**k up, all right?\u201d</p><p>He means he broke up with her.</p><p>He pushes my hands off and shoves me. I let him. He straightens his shirt, glaring. But I just stand there. Stunned. His finger stabs my chest. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. You ever put your hands on me again, I\u2019m laying you out, dickhead.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he leaves. Matthew watches him go, then asks, \u201cDrew, what the hell was that about?\u201d</p><p>Ten years\u2014almost eleven. She loved him. That\u2019s what she said. Ten frigging years. And he dumped her.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t finish your sandwich.\u201d Food\u2019s important to Matthew.</p><p>\u201cYou have it. I have to get back to the office.\u201d</p><p>I sprint out the door to...</p><p>Well, you know where I\u2019m going.</p><p>Her office door is still closed. But I don\u2019t knock. Quietly, I walk in. She\u2019s sitting at her desk.</p><p>Crying.</p><p>Have you ever been kicked in the stomach by a horse?</p><p>Me neither. But now I know what it feels like.</p><p>She looks so small behind that desk. Young and vulnerable and...lost. My voice is soft and careful. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Kate glances at me, surprised, and then she clears her throat and wipes her face, trying to pull it together. \u201cWhat do you need, Drew?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to embarrass her, so I pretend not to notice the wetness that still clings to her cheekbones. \u201cI was looking for that file...\u201d Slowly, I step closer. \u201cDo you...uh...have something in your eye?\u201d</p><p>She plays along and wipes at her eyes again. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s an eyelash or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take a look? Those eyelashes can be dangerous if left untreated.\u201d</p><p>For the first time today, her eyes meet mine. They\u2019re like two dark shining pools. \u201cOkay.\u201d Kate stands up, and I guide her toward the window. I put my hands on her cheeks, gently holding her face. Her beautiful tear-streaked face.</p><p>I\u2019ve never wanted to do physical damage to someone as badly as I do Billy Warren in this moment. And I\u2019m pretty sure I can get Matthew to help me bury whatever\u2019s left of him in the backyard.</p><p>I wipe her tears away with my thumbs. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, even as more tears spring up. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m done pretending now. I pull her in against my chest. She lets me. I put my arms around her and smooth the back of her hair with my hand. \u201cDo you want me to talk to him? Was it...was it because of...me?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine the scumbag was very happy finding us in Kate\u2019s office like he did last week\u2014with her looking freshly f**ked and all. And no, I haven\u2019t gone insane. The last thing I want to do is help her get back with the a**hole. But goddamn it, she\u2019s killing me here.</p><p>One tear at a time.</p><p>She laughs into my chest. It sounds bitter. \u201cIt was me.\u201d Kate looks up at me and smiles sadly. \u201cI\u2019m not the same girl he fell in love with.\u201d</p><p>It must have been hard for her to hear those words. It\u2019s the oldest guy trick in the book. The blame game: \u201cIt\u2019s not me, honey. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cHe packed up all of his things and moved out on Saturday. He said a quick, clean break would be better. He\u2019s staying with Dee-Dee until he can find his own place.\u201d</p><p>She looks toward the windows for a moment, then sighs dejectedly. \u201cIt\u2019s been coming for a while, I think. It really wasn\u2019t a shock. For so long, my focus was on school...and then work. Everything else came second. I stopped...I couldn\u2019t...give him what he needed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...Billy held my hand the day we buried my father. He taught me to drive a stick shift, and convinced me I was good enough to sing in front of actual people. Billy helped me fill out my college application and opened the acceptance letter for me because I was too nervous to look. When I was in the MBA program, he worked three jobs so I didn\u2019t have to work at all. Billy was there the day I graduated, and he came with me when I wanted to move to New York. He\u2019s always been such a huge part of my life. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019ll be without him.\u201d</p><p>Women. No offense. But she doesn\u2019t even realize what she just said. These are her accomplishments. Challenges she\u2019s lived through. Shithead was just along for the ride. In the background. Like wallpaper. You can change the color of the walls anytime, and it might look different, but the room\u2019s still the same.</p><p>\u201cI know who you\u2019ll be: Kate Brooks, Investment Banker Extraordinaire. You\u2019re smart and funny, and you\u2019re stubborn and gorgeous and...perfect. And you\u2019ll still be perfect without him.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes hold for a minute, and then I hold her against me again until her tears subside. Her voice is muffled as she whispers, \u201cThank you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not until late that night, as I crawl between the cool sheets of my bed, that the ramifications of today\u2019s events really hit me.</p><p>I sleep nak*d, by the way. You should try it. If you haven\u2019t slept nak*d, you haven\u2019t lived. But that\u2019s beside the point.</p><p>The fact that hasn\u2019t occurred to me until now is\u2014Kate Brooks is single. Free. Available. The only real obstacle that stood between her and me and my office couch just shot himself in the foot. Holy shit. This is what Superman must have felt like when he turned back time and pulled Lois out of that car. It\u2019s a do-over. A second shot. Recommencing lift off.</p><p>I fold my hands behind my head and settle back into my pillows with the biggest, brightest can\u2019t-wait-for-tomorrow smile you have ever seen.</p><p>It\u2019s been four days since I found out Dipshit broke up with Kate. That next day, she came into work looking like herself again. For all intents and purposes, she seemed completely over the moron. But Mackenzie caught a cold, so Alexandra had to reschedule our lunch for next week. With the weekend Kate had, it was probably for the best.</p><p>Oh yeah. Just one more little detail you should know: I haven\u2019t gotten laid in twelve days.</p><p>Twelve days.</p><p>Two hundred and eighty-eight sex-free hours. I can\u2019t calculate the minutes\u2014it\u2019s too depressing. Remember all work and no play makes Drew a cranky boy? Well, at this point, Drew is practically a goddamn psychopath, okay?</p><p>Twelve days may not seem like a long time for you amateurs out there, but for a guy like me? It\u2019s a frigging record. I haven\u2019t had a drought like this since the winter of ninety-nine. That January, a massive blizzard blanketed the tri-state area with twenty-eight inches of snow. Only official vehicles were allowed on the roads, so I was stuck in the penthouse with my parents.</p><p>And I was seventeen. A year in a guy\u2019s life when a light breeze is capable of giving him a boner. I spent so much time in the bathroom, my mother thought I had a virus. Finally, after the seventh day, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I braved the elements and walked to Rebecca Whitehouse\u2019s condo uptown. We humped like bunnies in the janitor\u2019s closet of her parent\u2019s building.</p><p>She was a nice girl.</p><p>Anyway, once again, I\u2019ve been reduced to jerking off in the shower. It\u2019s humiliating. I feel so dirty. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with a good rub and tug in the morning to start the day off right. Particularly if, like myself, last weekend\u2019s typical Saturday score night had to be bypassed because of family-related holiday obligations. But if that\u2019s the only action you\u2019re getting? Well, that\u2019s just...sad.</p><p>The reason behind my recent extended sexual famine? I blame Kate. It\u2019s all her frigging fault.</p><p>Apparently, I\u2019ve grown a conscience. I don\u2019t know when it happened, I don\u2019t know how it happened, but I am not happy about it.</p><p>If I could, I would squash that Jiminy Cricket f**ker like the roach he is.</p><p>Because you know how some people have gay-dar? Well, I have dump-dar. That means I can pick out a recently dumped female a mile away. They\u2019re easy pickings. All you have to tell them is that their ex is an idiot for letting them go, and they\u2019ll be begging you to nail them.</p><p>Kate now falls into the aforementioned dumped category. Should be a sure thing, right?</p><p>Wrong. Here\u2019s where Jiminy rears his ugly little bug head.</p><p>I can\u2019t bring myself to make a move. The idea makes me feel like a goddamn predator. It\u2019s hard to tell if she\u2019s still raw. She doesn\u2019t seem to be, but you never know. She could just be putting up a good front. And if she is\u2014hurt and vulnerable\u2014that\u2019s not how I want her. When it happens for Kate and me, I want her ripping at my clothes, and her own for that matter, because she can\u2019t wait a second longer to have me pounding into her. I want her moaning my name, scratching my back and screaming because of the sheer magnificence of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn it, there I go again. I\u2019ve got a hard-on just thinking about it.</p><p>What a mess. I can\u2019t f**k Kate, and I don\u2019t want to f**k anyone else. It\u2019s my own personal Perfect Storm. Told you I\u2019d get what I deserve. Are you happy now?</p><p>I turn off the lights in my office and walk over to Kate\u2019s. She doesn\u2019t see me right away, so I cross my arms and lean against the doorframe, just watching her. Her hair\u2019s down, and she\u2019s standing, bent over her desk, looking at her computer. And she\u2019s singing:</p><p>No more drinks with the guys</p> <p>No more hitting on girls</p><p>I\u2019d give it all up</p><p>And it\u2019d be worth it in the end</p><p>If you were my lady</p><p>I would comprehend</p> <p>How it feels to have something real</p><p>I would want to be a good man...</p><p>She really does have a great voice. And the way she\u2019s bending over her desk like that...I just want to walk up behind her and...Christ. Never mind. I\u2019m just torturing myself.</p><p>\u201cRihanna better watch her back.\u201d She looks up at the sound of my voice, and her face breaks into a wide, embarrassed grin. I request, \u201cDon\u2019t stop on my account. I was enjoying the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. Show\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>I crook my finger at her. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m kicking you out. It\u2019s after eleven on a Friday night, and you haven\u2019t eaten yet. I know a place. My treat. They make a great turkey club.\u201d</p> <p>Kate turns off her screen and grabs her bag. \u201cOohh, they\u2019re my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>We grab a table in the bar area and order. The waitress brings our drinks, and Kate takes a sip of the margarita I ordered for her. \u201cMmm. This is just what I wanted right now.\u201d</p><p>I told you I was good at the drink thing\u2014remember? We talk comfortably for a few minutes, and then...watch this.</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes go wide as saucers, and she dives under the table. I look around. What the hell? I duck my head and take a peek at her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She looks panicked. \u201cBilly\u2019s here. Upstairs, in the loft over the dance floor. And he\u2019s not alone.\u201d I start to lift my head when she yells, \u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ\u2014this is ridiculous. So much for being over the dickwit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...I can\u2019t let him see me like this.\u201d</p> <p>Now I\u2019m confused. \u201cWhat are you talking about? You look great.\u201d She always looks great.</p><p>\u201cNo, not in these clothes. He said it wasn\u2019t attractive that I was so driven. It was one of the reasons he wanted to break up. That I...he said I was too...masculine.\u201d</p><p>You have got to be f**king kidding me. I\u2019m masculine. Hillary Clinton is masculine. Kate Brooks doesn\u2019t have a goddamn masculine cell in her body. She\u2019s all woman, believe me.</p><p>But I know what the f**ker was going for. Kate is intelligent, outspoken, ambitious. Lots of men\u2014like the shit-eating a**hole, for instance\u2014can\u2019t handle a woman like that. So they twist it around. Make those qualities seem unappealing. Something to be ashamed of.</p><p>Screw this. I grab Kate\u2019s hand and drag her out from under the table. She looks around quickly as I lead her to the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving you back your dignity.\u201d</p><p>I bump into several people on the way, making a slight ripple, so I\u2019m sure Douchebag will notice us. \u201cBy the time I\u2019m done, Billy Warren will be kissing your feet, your ass, and any other body part you tell him to, to get you back.\u201d</p><p>She tries to pull out of my grasp. \u201cNo, Drew that\u2019s not really...\u201d</p><p>I turn to face her and put my arms around her waist. \u201cTrust me, Kate.\u201d Her body\u2019s close to mine, her face so near I can see the green speckles in her eyes. Why the f**k am I doing this again?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a guy. I know how we think. No guy wants to see a girl that used to be his with someone else. Just go with me on this.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer. She just raises her arms around my neck, bringing us together\u2014chest to chest, stomach to stomach, thigh to thigh.</p><p>It\u2019s agony. Exquisite, delicious agony.</p><p>With a mind of its own, my thumb draws slow circles on her lower back. The music swirls around us, and I feel buzzed\u2014not from the drinks, but from the feel of her. I want to ignore the perfect way her body fits against mine. I try to remember my noble intentions. I should glance up to see if Dirtbag is watching us. I should, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m too caught up in the way she\u2019s looking at me.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m deluding myself, but I swear it\u2019s desire I see swimming in those dark beauties. Naked, uninhibited want. I lean in and brush my nose against hers, testing the waters.</p><p>I\u2019m not doing this for me. Really. I\u2019m not doing this because being this near to her is the closest to heaven that I\u2019ll ever get.</p><p>This is for her. Part of the plan. To win back the scumbag who doesn\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>I press my lips against hers softly. It\u2019s tender at first, and then she melts against me. That\u2019s when I start to lose it. She opens her mouth, and I slide my tongue in slowly. Then harder, firmer, more intense, like the downhill swoop of a rollercoaster.</p><p>I forgot how good she tastes. More decadent than the richest chocolate. Sinful. It\u2019s different from the other times we\u2019ve kissed. Better. There\u2019s no anger behind it, no frustration or guilt or a point to prove. It\u2019s unhurried, languid, and f**king sublime.</p><p>Our lips separate, and I force myself to look up, catching Warren\u2019s devastated glare before he disappears into the crowd. I turn back to Kate and touch my forehead to hers. Our breaths mingle\u2014mine panting, hers gasping slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt worked,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I feel her fingers playing with the hair at the nape of my neck. And when she speaks, her voice is breathy. Needy. \u201cDrew...could you? Drew...do you want...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, Kate. Ask me anything and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Her lips part, and she stares at me a moment. \u201cWould you...kiss me again?\u201d</p><p>Thank. You. God.</p><p>And as for you, Jiminy? Piss off.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>THE RIDE TO MY APARTMENT is an exercise in stunt driving. Trying desperately to keep my mouth on Kate and not get us killed. She sits on my lap straddling my waist, kissing my neck, tonguing my ear\u2014driving me out of my frigging mind. I\u2019ve got one hand on the steering wheel and the other wedged between us, gliding over her stomach, her neck, and those perfect br**sts that tease me through her half-open shirt.</p><p>Do not try this at home, kids.</p><p>Her skirt bunches high on her thighs as she grinds herself on my straining cock. She\u2019s so damn hot against me, I have to use every ounce of will not to let my eyes roll back into my head. I kiss her hard and watch the road over her shoulder. She slides up and down, jerking me off slowly with the pressure. Fucking Christ, dry humping never felt so good.</p><p>Control? Restraint? They went bye-bye a long time ago.</p><p>Finally, I pull into the parking garage of my building. I grab the first spot I see and drag us out of the car. My hands on her ass, her legs locked around my waist, I carry Kate to the elevator, our lips and tongues dancing furiously.</p><p>I didn\u2019t lock my car. I don\u2019t think I even closed the door.</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>They can steal it. I have more important matters at hand.</p><p>I stumble into the elevator and push the button for the top floor before slamming Kate back against the wall and thrusting against her like I\u2019ve been dying to do. She moans long and deep into my mouth. It\u2019s like that scene out of Fatal Attraction, without the creepiness.</p><p>Making it to my door, I grope for the lock with one hand still holding Kate against me. She nibbles on my ear and whispers, \u201cHurry, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I would have kicked the f**king thing open at this point if the key wasn\u2019t already turning. We fall into my apartment, and I kick the door shut with my foot. I peel her legs off me, and her feet slide to the floor, creating a delicious friction along the way. I need my hands free.</p><p>With our mouths still joined, I start unbuttoning the rest of her blouse. Kate is not so skilled\u2014or she\u2019s just impatient. She digs her fingers into the front of my shirt and pulls. Buttons scatter on the floor.</p><p>She just ripped my shirt open.</p><p>How hot is that?</p><p>I get to the clasp on her bra and pop it open. I\u2019m an expert at those things. Whoever invented the front-clasp bra? God bless you.</p><p>Kate pulls her lips away and smooths her palms over my chest and down my abs. Her eyes are filled with wonder as they follow her hands\u2019 path. I watch as my own fingers skim across her collarbone, down the center of her flawless br**sts, and over that valley I love before coming to rest at her waist.</p><p>\u201cGod, Drew. You\u2019re so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d I finish for her.</p><p>I pull her up against me again, wrapping my arms around her and lifting her feet off the floor as I back up toward the couch. Did I think dancing with her was heaven? No. Her bare chest against mine\u2014that is what heaven feels like. Fucking paradise.</p><p>I kiss down her jaw and suck at the tender flesh of her neck. I love Kate\u2019s neck\u2014and by the sounds vibrating in her throat, she loves what I\u2019m doing. I sit back on the couch, taking her with me with her torso resting against mine, her closed legs between my spread knees. She pulls my lips back to hers for one more kiss before standing up and backing away.</p><p>We\u2019re both out of breath and staring, practically attacking each other with our eyes. She bites her lip, and her hands disappear behind her back. I hear the hiss of a zipper, and then her skirt is slowly sliding to the floor. It\u2019s the sexiest goddamn thing I have ever seen.</p><p>Kate stands in front of me in black lace boy-short panties, an open white blouse, and high heels. Her lips are swollen, her cheeks are flushed, and her hair is tousled from my hands. She\u2019s a goddess...f**king divine. And the way she\u2019s looking at me almost has me coming right here and now. I reach for my wallet and pull the condom out, resting it on the cushion next to me.</p><p>Kate walks toward me...leaving her high heels on.</p><p>Christ Jesus.</p><p>She kneels between my legs and unbuttons my pants, keeping her blazing eyes locked on mine. I lift up, and she peels my pants and boxers off. My c*ck springs up, proud and hard and so f**king ready. Her eyes go down, and she looks me over. I let her get her fill; I\u2019m not really the shy type.</p><p>But when a devilish smile comes to her lips and she leans toward my dick, I grab her and pull her back to my mouth. I don\u2019t know what she was planning\u2014well, I have an idea\u2014but if I don\u2019t get inside her soon, I think I\u2019m actually going to die.</p><p>I lift her at the waist, and her knees rest on either side of me. I hold her up with one hand while the other pushes the lace between her legs to the side. I dip two fingers inside her. Jesus. She\u2019s ready too. I slide my fingers all the way in, and we both moan loudly. She\u2019s wet...and hot. She molds snugly around my fingers, and my eyes close, knowing just how incredible she\u2019ll feel around my cock. I pump my fingers in and out, and she starts riding my hand. She\u2019s whimpering...moaning...gasping my name.</p><p>Music to my frigging ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t take it anymore. I grab the condom and rip it open with my teeth. Kate rises up as I start to roll it on. Then she pushes my hands away. And she rolls it on for me.</p><p>Sweet f**king Christ Almighty.</p><p>I pull at her lace panties. I want her bare, nothing in the way. With a rip and a snap, I tear them off. Her dark curls and shiny lips beckon me, and I swear to God I\u2019ll give them all the attention they deserve later. But I can\u2019t wait.</p><p>My eyes are on hers...those dark chocolate eyes that pulled me in the moment I first saw them.</p><p>Gorgeous.</p><p>Slowly, she sinks down on me. For a moment, neither of us moves. Or breathes. She\u2019s tight...fuck...even through the rubber, I feel her walls stretching for me.</p><p>I whisper her name, like a prayer. \u201cKate.\u201d</p><p>I take her face in my hands and bring her down to me. I can\u2019t not kiss her. She rises up, pulling me almost completely out before smoothly sliding down, taking me back inside.</p><p>Holy God.</p><p>Nothing has ever felt this good\u2014nothing. My hands grasp her hips, helping her ride my c*ck with steady strokes. Our mouths are open against each other, kissing and panting.</p><p>I pull myself up to sit straighter, knowing the added pressure against her cl*t will make it better for her. And I\u2019m not wrong. She comes down on me harder, faster, my hands digging into her hips. I kiss her neck and bend my head, licking my way to a hardened nipple. I take it in my mouth, sucking and rolling my tongue around, making her hand fist in my hair as she moans.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to last. There\u2019s no way. I\u2019ve waited for this too long, wanted it too much. I brace my feet on the floor and start thrusting up, stabbing into her, pushing her h*ps down hard as I do. It\u2019s bliss. Hard, deep, wet rapture, and I never want it to end.</p><p>She throws her head back and moans louder. \u201cYes...yes...Drew.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m cursing and calling her name, both of us almost mindless. Out of control. Because it feels that f**king good.</p><p>She screams my name, and I know she\u2019s coming.</p><p>God, I love her voice.</p><p>And then she\u2019s contracting all around me\u2014her p**sy around my cock, her legs against my thighs, her hands on my shoulders\u2014all clenching taut and stiff. And I\u2019m right there with her.</p><p>\u201cKate, Kate...fuck...Kate.\u201d</p><p>I thrust up again and again. Then I come long and hard. White-hot pleasure shoots through my body unlike anything I have ever felt before. My head falls against the back of the couch.</p><p>After the spasms die down, my arms come up around Kate, bringing our chests together and her head against my neck. I feel her heartbeat start to return to normal. And then she\u2019s laughing, low and satisfied.</p><p>\u201cGod...that was so...so...\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m smiling too. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Earth shattering. Off the Richter Scale. Powerful enough to take out a small island country.</p> <p>I stroke my hand through her hair...so frigging soft. I lean down and kiss her again. So goddamn perfect.</p><p>What a great night. I think this could very well be the best night of my life. And it\u2019s only just started.</p><p>Kate squeals as I stand up and carry her, wrapped around me, to my bedroom.</p><p>I\u2019ve never brought a woman to my bedroom before. It\u2019s a rule. No random hook-ups in my apartment\u2014never even considered it. If one of those girls actually knew where I lived? Can you say Stalker Psycho, anyone?</p><p>But I don\u2019t think twice about laying Kate down in the middle of my bed. She watches me, on her knees as I strip off my buttonless shirt and get rid of the used condom. Biting her lip with a smile, she peels off her own blouse that was still hanging on her arms. Oh yeah\u2014and she\u2019s still got her heels on.</p><p>Nice. So very, very nice.</p><p>I crawl over to her and rest on my knees in the center of the bed. I cradle her face in my hands as I kiss her long and hot. I\u2019m all set to go again. My dick pokes her in the stomach where it stands firm and ready. But this round, I want to take my time. I\u2019ve admired her body for months\u2014and now I plan to explore every f**king inch of it, up close and personal.</p><p>I lean forward and lay her back. Kate\u2019s hair fans out behind her onto my pillows. She looks like some mythical imp, some fabled pagan sex deity from a Roman legend.</p><p>Or a well-acted porno.</p><p>Her knees fall open naturally, and I settle between them. Christ...she\u2019s already damp. I can feel how wet she is against my stomach when she pushes up and rubs against me. Silently begging for it\u2014again.</p><p>I kiss my way down her neck and collarbone, coming face to face with her pebbled br**sts. Kate\u2019s hands knead my shoulder blades as I lick a circle around one dusky pink center. Her breathing\u2019s fast and urgent. I flick my tongue over her nipple quickly until she groans my name.</p><p>The minute the word leaves her lips, I close my mouth over her and suckle hard. For a few minutes, I alternate licking, sucking, and scraping her pointy little peak. Her reaction is so frigging primal, I can\u2019t help but switch to the other tit and give that beauty the same attention.</p><p>By the time I work my way lower, Kate is writhing under me, bucking and rubbing herself on any part of my body she can reach.</p><p>It\u2019s shameless.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>And as badly as I want her right now, as goddamn good as it feels to have her grinding against me\u2014I\u2019m in complete control of what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m in charge. And there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t wait to do. Something I\u2019ve f**king dreamed of doing ever since that night at Howie\u2019s. I lick a trail down the center of her stomach, then crawl lower. I slip her shoes off and lick another path up her inner thigh till I\u2019m eye level with my target: her neat patch of dark curls.</p><p>Kate is shaved short, trim, and the skin surrounding her snatch is as smooth as silk. I know because I\u2019m nibbling my way around that manicured little triangle right now. Guys love a p**sy that\u2019s almost completely bare. And no, it has nothing to do with perverted pre-pubescent fantasies. The idea that a woman is nearly bald there is just...naughty. Such a turn on.</p><p>I rub my nose into her tiny, coarse patch and inhale. Kate gasps and moans above me\u2014eyes closed, mouth open.</p><p>Just so you know, men don\u2019t expect a woman to smell like Winter Pine or Niagara Falls or whatever the f**k those feminine products say. It\u2019s a p**sy\u2014it\u2019s supposed to smell like one. That\u2019s the f**king turn on.</p><p>Kate\u2019s scent in particular has me salivating like a famished frigging animal. I rub again, kissing her plump outer lips. Mother of God.</p><p>Her hands clench the blanket.</p><p>\u201cGod, you smell so good, I want to eat you all night.\u201d</p><p>And I just actually might.</p><p>I lick up her wet slit, and she arches off the bed with a moan. I push her h*ps down with my hands, holding her immobile as I do it again, and she cries out louder.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Kate\u2014let me hear you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m well aware that this\u2014that I\u2014am the first man to ever do this to her. And yes, as a guy, that fact makes it even better.</p><p>You know who Neil Armstrong is, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Now tell me who the second guy was. Hell, tell me any other guy you know who made it to the moon after him. You can\u2019t, can you? That\u2019s why this is such a rush.</p><p>She\u2019ll never forget this.</p><p>She\u2019ll always remember...me.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s chauvinistic and egotistical, but it\u2019s the truth.</p><p>Up and down, over and over, I lick her from end to end. Her cream is sweet and thick. Goddamn delicious. I push her thighs apart, spreading her wider, and push in and out of her\u2014f**king her with my tongue. Her head rolls side to side as high-pitched moans echo from her throat. She\u2019s incoherent, and her toes dig into my shoulders, but I don\u2019t let up. No freaking way. In one motion, I suck Kate\u2019s firm little cl*t into my mouth and slip two fingers inside her.</p><p>Then I\u2019m the one moaning. Her hot juice coats my fingers, almost burning. I can\u2019t stop my h*ps from rotating and rubbing against the bed. Fuck. Still pumping in and out with my hand, I flatten my tongue and rub steady, hard circles on her clit.</p><p>\u201cDrew! Drew!\u201d</p><p>Hearing Kate scream charges me up even more. I move my fingers faster, in time with my tongue, and look up...needing to see her lose it. I\u2019m going to come just watching her. The look on her face is full-blown ecstasy, and I don\u2019t know which one of us is getting off more.</p><p>\u201cOh God, oh God, oh God...God!\u201d</p><p>Then she\u2019s rigid\u2014stiff as a f**king board. Her hands pull my hair, her thighs tighten around my head, and I know she\u2019s there.</p><p>After several moments she loosens her hold, and I slow my tongue to leisurely paced licks. When Kate relaxes her limbs even more, I sit up, wipe my face with my hand, and slide on a fresh condom.</p><p>Oh yeah\u2014I\u2019m just getting started.</p><p>I lean over her, and she pulls me down and kisses me hard. She pants against my lips, \u201cSo...incredible.\u201d</p><p>Smug, conceited satisfaction pumps through my veins, but I can\u2019t even smile. I need to f**k her too goddamn much. I slide in easily. She\u2019s slick but tight\u2014like a wet fist. I feel her clench around me as I pull out slow and glide back in.</p><p>I start to thrust faster. Harsher. My arms are straight on either side of her head so I can watch the pleasure that flickers across her face. Her tits bounce every time I surge forward, and I almost lower down to suck on one.</p><p>But then she opens her eyes and looks up at me. And I can\u2019t look away. I feel like a king\u2014like a f**king immortal. And any self-control I had just vanished. I push into her, fast and merciless. Pure heated pleasure swells in my stomach and down my thighs.</p><p>Sweet Jesus.</p><p>Our bodies slap together over and over, hard and quick. I hook one arm under her knee and raise her leg up over my shoulder. She feels even tighter, and I can\u2019t help but moan, \u201cKate...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, like that. God, yes! Drew...\u201d And then she goes stiff under me again, her eyes closing as a strangled moan leaks from her lips.</p><p>That\u2019s when I let go. I ram into her one last time before the most intense orgasm of my life rushes through me. I groan loud, flooding the condom inside her to the frigging brim. My arms collapse, and my full weight falls on her. She doesn\u2019t seem to mind. The moment I\u2019m down, she\u2019s kissing me\u2014my eyes, my cheeks, my mouth. I struggle to catch my breath, and then I\u2019m kissing her back.</p><p>Un-f**king-believable.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>I READ AN ARTICLE ONCE that said hav**g s*x extends the human life span. At this rate, Kate and I are going to live forever. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times we\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s like a mosquito bite\u2014the more you scratch, the more it itches.</p><p>I\u2019m just glad I bought the extra-large box of condoms at Costco.</p><p>And in case you couldn\u2019t tell from my reactions, I\u2019ll just come out and say it: Kate Brooks is a fantastic lay. A spectacular piece of ass. If I wasn\u2019t sure that Billy Warren was a complete dumbass fuckwit before\u2014since I\u2019d sampled what he threw away\u2014now I\u2019m completely certain of it.</p><p>She\u2019s adventurous, unapologetically demanding, spontaneous, and confident. A lot like me. We\u2019re a perfect fit, in more ways than one.</p><p>When we finally come up for air, the night sky outside my window is just turning gray. Kate is lying quietly, her head on my chest, her fingers tracing its contours and occasionally stroking the dusting of hair there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hope after everything I\u2019ve told you that this doesn\u2019t come as a shock, but I don\u2019t \u201ccuddle.\u201d Typically, after a woman and I are done, there is no spooning, no snuggling, no frigging pillow talk. I might, on occasion, have a nap before I head out the door. But I can\u2019t stand it when a girl braids herself around me like some mutant octopus. It\u2019s annoying and uncomfortable.</p><p>With Kate, however, the old rules just don\u2019t seem to apply. Our warm skin is meshed together, our bodies aligned, her ankle over my calf, my thigh under her bent knee. It feels...peaceful. Soothing in a way I can\u2019t fully describe. I have absolutely no desire to move from this spot.</p><p>Unless it\u2019s to roll over and nail her again.</p><p>She breaks the silence first. \u201cWhen did you lose your virginity?\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cAre we playing First and Ten again? Or are you wondering about my sexual history? Because if that\u2019s it, I think you\u2019re a little too late, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that. I just want to know you...more.\u201d</p><p>I sigh as I think back. \u201cOkay. My first time was...Janice Lewis. My fifteenth birthday. She invited me to her house to give me my present. It was her.\u201d</p><p>I feel her smile against my chest. \u201cWas she a virgin too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She was just shy of eighteen\u2014a senior.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh. The older woman. So she taught you everything you know?\u201d</p><p>I smile and shrug. \u201cI picked up a few tricks over the years.\u201d</p><p>We fall quiet again for a few minutes, and then she asks, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know about mine?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t even have to think about that one.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t want to spoil the mood, but we\u2019ll pause here a second.</p> <p>When it comes to a woman\u2019s past, no guy wants to hear about it. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve f**ked one guy or a hundred\u2014keep it to yourself.</p><p>Let me put it this way: When you\u2019re out at a restaurant and the waiter brings your meal, do you want him to tell you about every single person who touched that food before you put it in your mouth?</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>I also think it\u2019s pretty safe to assume that her first time was with Warren\u2014that he was her one and only. And he is the last f**king person I want to be discussing at this particular place and time.</p><p>Now, back to my bedroom.</p><p>I turn on my side so I\u2019m facing Kate. Our faces are close, our heads sharing one pillow. Her hand\u2019s tucked under her cheek in an innocent kind of way.</p><p>\u201cThere is something I want to know, though,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAsk away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you go into I-banking?\u201d</p><p>I come from a long line of white-collar professionals. Alexandra and I weren\u2019t expected to follow in our parents\u2019 footsteps\u2014it just sort of happened that way. People always gravitate toward what they know, what\u2019s familiar.</p><p>Like professional athletes. Have you ever noticed how many Juniors there are in major league baseball? It\u2019s to distinguish them from their Hall of Fame fathers. The Manning quarterbacks\u2014same deal. But I wonder what attracted Kate to investment banking considering her adolescent years of petty crime.</p><p>\u201cThe money. I wanted a career where I knew I\u2019d make a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me knowingly. \u201cYou were expecting something more noble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess I was.\u201d</p><p>Her smile dims. \u201cThe truth is, my parents got married young\u2014had me young. They bought the diner in Greenville. Mortgaged it to the gills. We lived above it. It was...small...but nice.\u201d</p><p>Her smile fades a little more. \u201cMy father was killed when I was thirteen. Car accident\u2014drunk driver. After that, my mom was always busy. Trying to keep the diner going, trying to keep herself from falling apart.\u201d</p><p>When she pauses again, I put my arm across her and pull her in until her forehead rests against my chest. And then she goes on:</p><p>\u201cShe barely kept us above water. I wasn\u2019t deprived or anything, but...it wasn\u2019t easy. Everything was a struggle. So, when they told me I was going to be Valedictorian, and I received a full scholarship to Wharton, I figured\u2014okay\u2014investing it is. I never wanted to be helpless or dependent. Even though I had Billy, it was important to me to know I\u2019d be able to support myself, by myself. Now that I can, all I really want to do is take care of my mom. I\u2019ve been asking her to move to New York, but so far she\u2019s said no. She\u2019s worked her entire life...I just want her to rest.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say. For all my snide comments about my family, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d lose my frigging mind if something happened to any one of them.</p><p>I raise her chin so I can look into her eyes. Then I kiss her. After a few minutes, Kate turns around. I wrap my arms around her waist and pull her right up against me. I press my lips to her shoulder and settle my face in her hair. And even though it\u2019s technically morning, that\u2019s just how we stay until we both fall asleep.</p><p>Every healthy man in the world wakes up with a stiffy. A fatty. Morning wood. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some medical explanation for the phenomenon, but I just like to think of it as a little present from God.</p><p>A chance to begin the day with your best dick forward.</p><p>I can\u2019t remember the last time I slept next to a woman. Waking up beside one, however, definitely has its benefits. And I\u2019m prepared to take full advantage of them.</p><p>With my eyes still closed, I roll over and search for Kate. I plan on teasing her awake before giving her a \u201cgood morning\u201d from behind. It\u2019s the only acceptable wakeup call, in my book. But as my hand slides over the sheets, it finds only empty space where she\u2019s supposed to be. I open my eyes, sit up, and look around. There\u2019s no sign of her.</p><p>Huh.</p><p>I listen for movement in the bathroom or the sound of running water from the shower. But there\u2019s only silence. Deafening, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Where\u2019d she go?</p><p>My heart rate kicks up a notch at the thought that she snuck out while I was asleep. It\u2019s a move I\u2019ve performed myself\u2014on several occasions\u2014but one I\u2019d never expect from Kate.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to get out of bed when she appears in the doorway. Her hair\u2019s pulled up in one of those elastic bands that women always seem to pull out of thin air. She\u2019s wearing a gray Columbia T-shirt\u2014my gray Columbia T-shirt\u2014and I\u2019m momentarily fascinated by the way her tits jiggle beneath the lettering as she walks.</p><p>Kate sets the tray she\u2019s carrying on the bedside table. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>I pout. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been. Why\u2019d you get up?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m starving. My stomach was growling like a caged troll. I was going to cook breakfast for us, but the only thing I could find in your kitchen was cereal.\u201d</p><p>Cereal is the perfect food. I could eat it at every meal. And not the healthy bran-and-oats shit your parents shoved down your throat. I only go for the good stuff: Lucky Charms, Fruity Pebbles, Cookie Crisp. My cabinet is a veritable smorgasbord of highly sugared puffed wheat.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI order out a lot.\u201d</p><p>She hands me a bowl. Apple Jacks\u2014good choice. Between bites, Kate says, \u201cI borrowed a T-shirt. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>I crunch my breakfast of champions and shake my head. \u201cNot at all. But I really like you better out of it.\u201d</p><p>See how she looks down? How her lips curve into a soft smile? See the color that rises in her cheeks? Good God\u2014she\u2019s blushing again. After last night? After the cursing, the screaming, the scratching? Now she blushes?</p><p>Adorable, right? I think so too.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think cooking in the nude was very sanitary.\u201d</p><p>I put my now-empty bowl back on the tray. \u201cDo you like to cook?\u201d In the months we\u2019ve worked together, I\u2019ve learned a lot about Kate, but there\u2019s still more I want to know.</p><p>She nods and finishes her cereal. \u201cYou grow up over a diner, it kind of rubs off on you. Baking is sort of my thing. I make great cookies. If we can get the ingredients later, I\u2019ll make them.\u201d</p><p>I smile devilishly. \u201cI\u2019d love to eat your cookie, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head at me. \u201cWhy do I have the feeling you\u2019re not talking about the chocolate chip variety?\u201d</p><p>Remember that gift from God? I can\u2019t let it go to waste. That would be a sin\u2014and I really can\u2019t afford any more of those. I drag her onto the bed and pull the T-shirt over her head.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m not. Now, about that cookie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen to B-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBishop to G-five.\u201d</p><p>Games are fun.</p><p>\u201cKnight to C-six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck.\u201d</p><p>Games without clothes? They\u2019re more fun.</p><p>Kate\u2019s brow furrows as she stares at the chessboard. This is our third match. Who won the other two? Please, like you even need to ask.</p><p>We\u2019ve been trading stories while we play. I told her about the time I broke my arm skateboarding when I was twelve. She told me about the day she and Delores dyed her hamster\u2019s fur pink. I told her about the nickname Matthew and I have for Alexandra. (Kate pinched my nipple after that one. Hard. She remembered the day I called her \u201can Alexandra\u201d in my office.)</p><p>It\u2019s comfortable, easy, enjoyable. Not as enjoyable as screwing\u2014but a close second. We\u2019re lying on the bed on our sides, our heads resting on our hands, the board in the middle.</p><p>Oh\u2014and in case you forgot, we\u2019re nak*d.</p><p>Now, I know some women have issues with their bodies. Maybe you\u2019ve got a little extra junk in the trunk? Get over it. Doesn\u2019t matter. Naked kicks Modest\u2019s ass every single time. Men are visual. We wouldn\u2019t be f**king you if we didn\u2019t want to look at you.</p><p>You can write that down if you like.</p><p>Kate has no problem being nak*d. She\u2019s definitely comfortable in her own skin. And it\u2019s sexy\u2014damn sexy.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to move or just burn a hole in the board looking at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush me.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cFine. Take all the time you need. There\u2019s nowhere for you to go anyway. I\u2019ve got you cornered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re cheating.\u201d</p><p>My eyes open wide. \u201cThat hurts, Kate. I\u2019m wounded. I don\u2019t cheat. I don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>She raises a brow at me. \u201cDo you have to be so cocky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so. And talking dirty will get you nowhere. Stop stalling.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and accepts defeat. I make my final move. \u201cCheckmate. Want to play again?\u201d</p><p>She rolls onto her stomach and bends her knees, so her feet almost touch her head. My c*ck twitches at the sight.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play something else.\u201d</p><p>Twister? Hide the Salami? Kama Sutra charades?</p><p>\u201cDo you have Guitar Hero?\u201d</p><p>Do I have Guitar Hero? The jousting of our millennia? The coolest video game of all time? Of course I do.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should pick something else,\u201d I say. \u201cIf I keep beating you like this, it could damage your fragile female ego.\u201d</p><p>Kate glares at me. \u201cSet it up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eagerness should have been a red flag. It was a slaughter. Absolutely brutal. She kicked my ass\u2014from one end of the apartment to the other.</p><p>In my defense, Kate knows how to play a real guitar. That and...she made us put clothes on. How frigging mean is that? I kept trying to catch a glimpse of that succulent little ass peeking out from under my T-shirt. It distracted me.</p><p>I never had a chance.</p><p>So, by now you\u2019re probably wondering what the hell I\u2019m doing, right? I mean this is me. One ride per customer\u2014no rewinds, no repeats. So why am I wasting away my Saturday afternoon playing Adam and Eve with Kate?</p> <p>Here\u2019s the deal: I\u2019ve worked for months to get her where she is right now. I\u2019ve spent night after endless night wanting, dreaming, fantasizing about it.</p><p>Let\u2019s say you get stranded on a desert island and can\u2019t eat for a week. And then the rescue ship finally shows up with a big plate of food. Would you take one taste and throw the rest away?</p><p>Of course not. You\u2019d scarf down every bite. Devour every crumb. Lick the plate clean.</p><p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. Hanging out with Kate until I\u2019m...full. Don\u2019t read any more into it than that.</p><p>Did I mention Kate has a tattoo? Oh yeah. A slut tag. A tramp stamp. Call it whatever you like. It\u2019s inked just above the swell of her ass, on her lower back. It\u2019s a small turquoise butterfly.</p> <p>It\u2019s tasty. I\u2019m tracing it with my tongue right now.</p><p>\u201cGod, Drew...\u201d</p><p>After the Guitar Hero disgrace, Kate decided she wanted a shower. And get this\u2014she asked if I wanted to go first.</p><p>Silly, silly girl. Like showering single file was even a consideration.</p><p>I stand up and tease her from behind. She\u2019s hotter than the f**king water that hits us on all sides. I move her hair to the side as I feast on that scrumptious neck. My voice is husky as I tell her, \u201cOpen your legs for me, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She does.</p> <p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>She does again.</p><p>I bend my knees and slide my c*ck home. Jesus. It\u2019s been two hours since I was deep inside her like this. Too f**king long\u2014a lifetime.</p><p>We moan together. Her br**sts are slick from the soap as I slide my fingers to her n**ples and play with them in the way I know makes her purr. She drops her head back against my shoulder, and scratches her nails up my thighs. I hiss at the sensation and pick up the pace just a little.</p><p>Then she leans forward, bending at her waist and bracing her hands against the tiles. I cover them with my own, threading our fingers together. I pump in and out unhurriedly. I kiss her back, her shoulder, her ear. \u201cYou feel so f**king good, Kate.\u201d</p><p>Her head rolls on her neck, and she moans, \u201cGod, you feel so...hard...so big.\u201d</p><p>That phrase? Hearing that phrase is the dream of every man who has ever lived. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a freaking monk; you want to hear it.</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019ve heard it before. But coming from Kate\u2014in that sweet voice\u2014it\u2019s like I\u2019m hearing it for the first and only time.</p> <p>And then she\u2019s begging. \u201cHarder, Drew...please.\u201d</p><p>I do as she asks with a groan. I leave one hand on the wall and bring the other to her clit, so each time I push forward, she bucks up against my fingers. She moans at the contact.</p><p>Then she\u2019s demanding, \u201cHarder, Drew. Fuck me harder.\u201d</p><p>When her command reaches my ears, I snap, like the roof caving in on a raging house fire. I push into her until she\u2019s pinned against the wall, her cheek resting on the cold tile. I thrust rough and fast. Kate\u2019s gratified screams echo off the walls, and we come in perfect synch.</p><p>It\u2019s long and intense and f**king glorious.</p><p>As the pleasure wanes, she turns, wraps her arms around my neck and kisses me slowly. Then her head is on my chest, and we stand together under the spray. I can\u2019t keep the awe out of my voice as I say, \u201cGod, it gets better every time.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cYou too? I thought I was the only one who felt it.\u201d She looks up at me, bites her lip, and pushes my wet hair back from my eyes. It\u2019s a simple gesture. But there\u2019s so much emotion behind it. Her touch is gentle, the look in her eyes so cherishing, like I\u2019m the most wonderful thing she\u2019s ever seen. Like I\u2019m some kind of...treasure.</p><p>Normally, a look like that would have me ducking for cover\u2014heading for the nearest exit.</p><p>But as I stare at Kate\u2019s face, one hand holding her waist, the other moving through her hair, I don\u2019t want to run. I don\u2019t even want to look away. And I don\u2019t ever want to let go.</p><p>\u201cNo...I feel it too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>I\u2019M NOT BORING YOU with these sordid details, am I? I could shorten this whole thing by simply saying: Kate and I f**ked each other\u2019s brains out all weekend.</p><p>But that\u2019s not really much fun.</p><p>And it wouldn\u2019t give you the full picture. By taking the long way around, you get all the facts. And a bird\u2019s-eye view of all our little moments. Moments that seemed silly and insignificant at the time. But now that I have the flu, they\u2019re the only things I can think about.</p><p>Every minute of every day.</p><p>Have you ever gotten a song stuck in your head? Sure you have, everybody does. And maybe it\u2019s a beautiful song, maybe it\u2019s even your favorite. But it\u2019s still annoying, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s second rate. Because you don\u2019t want to just hear it in your brain\u2014you want it on the radio or live in concert. Replaying it in your mind is just a cheap imitation. A mocking, frigging reminder that you\u2019re not able to hear the real thing.</p><p>Do you see where I\u2019m going with this?</p><p>Don\u2019t worry, you will.</p><p>Now, where was I? That\u2019s right\u2014Saturday night.</p><p>\u201cThis is the perfect pillow.\u201d</p><p>We just ordered food\u2014Italian\u2014and we\u2019re waiting for it to arrive. Kate is sitting on my couch amid an oasis of pillows and blankets. And she\u2019s holding one bedroom pillow in her lap.</p><p>\u201cThe perfect pillow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m very high maintenance when it comes to pillows. And this one is perfect. Not too flat, not too puffy. Not too hard, not too soft.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cGood to know, Goldilocks.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve decided to watch a movie. On-demand cable is the second greatest invention of our time. The first, of course, being the big-screen plasma TV. I get up to fetch the remote while Kate fishes something out of her bag on the floor.</p><p>Have I mentioned we\u2019re still nak*d? We are. Very. It\u2019s liberating.</p><p>Fun.</p><p>All the good parts are easy to reach. And the view is fantastic.</p><p>As I turn to make my way back to the couch, a now-familiar scent assails my nostrils. Sweet and flowery. Sugar and springtime. I look at Kate and find her rubbing lotion on her arms. I grab the bottle from her, like a dog snapping at a bone. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>I bring the bottle to my nose and inhale deeply, then fall back against the pillows with a satisfied moan.</p><p>Kate laughs. \u201cDon\u2019t snort it. It\u2019s moisturizer. I didn\u2019t realize fighting dry skin got you so revved up.\u201d</p><p>I look at the bottle. Vanilla and lavender. I take another deep sniff. \u201cIt smells like you. Every time you\u2019re near me, you smell like...like a bouquet of f**king sunshine with brown sugar on top.\u201d</p><p>She laughs again. \u201cAw, Drew, I didn\u2019t know you were a poet. William Shakespeare would be so jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it edible?\u201d</p><p>She makes a face. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Too bad. I\u2019d have poured it on my food like a rich hollandaise. Guess I\u2019ll just have to settle for tasting it on Kate.</p><p>Now that I think about it\u2014that is the preferable option.</p><p>\u201cThey make a bubble bath too. Since you like it so much, I\u2019ll get some.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the first reference she\u2019s made about a next time. A hook-up at some later date. A future. Unlike my past bump-and-grinds, the suggestion of a second go-around with Kate doesn\u2019t fill me with indifference or irritation. Instead, I\u2019m eager\u2014excited\u2014about the prospect.</p><p>I stare at her for a moment, soaking in the strange enjoyment that comes from just looking at her. I could make a full-time profession out of watching Kate Brooks.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she asks, \u201cdid we decide on a movie?\u201d</p><p>She settles up against me, and my arm goes naturally around her. \u201cI was thinking Braveheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. What is it with that movie? Why are all men addicted to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the same reason women are obsessed with the freaking Notebook. That is what you were going to suggest, right?\u201d</p><p>She smiles slyly, and I know I guessed right.</p><p>\u201cThe Notebook is romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s f**king gay.\u201d</p><p>She hits me in the face with the \u201cperfect\u201d pillow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nauseating. I have friends who are flaming homosexuals\u2014and that movie is too g*y for them.\u201d</p><p>She sighs dreamily. \u201cIt\u2019s a love story, a beautiful love story. The way everyone tried to keep them apart. But then, years later, they found each other again. It was fate.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cFate? Please. Fate\u2019s a frigging fairytale, sweetheart. And the rest of the story is a bonfire of bullshit too. Real life doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the divorce rate is so high. Because movies like that give women unreasonable expectations.\u201d</p><p>And the same goes for romance novels. Alexandra practically took Steven\u2019s head off once because he borrowed one of my Playboys. Yet every summer, there\u2019s The Bitch laying out on the beach with her Fabio-covered soft porn.</p><p>Yeah, I said, \u201cporn.\u201d That\u2019s what it is.</p><p>And it\u2019s not even good porn: \u201cHe moved his trunk-like manhood toward the weeping petals of her womanly center.\u201d</p><p>Who the f**k talks like that?</p><p>\u201cReal guys don\u2019t think like Nolan or Niles or whatever the hell that douchebag\u2019s name was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd any man who would build a room in his house for some chick who blew him off? Any man who would wait years for that same girl to show up at his door, knowing she was with someone else? He\u2019s not a man at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big, hairy, unwaxed vag**a.\u201d</p><p>Was that too crude?</p><p>I\u2019m afraid that it was.</p><p>Until Kate covers her mouth with her hands and falls over on the couch, convulsing in a fit of deep, snorting laughter. \u201cOh...my...God. You\u2019re such...a...pig. How...how do you even come up with these things?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI call them like I see them. I won\u2019t apologize for it.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter dies down, but the smile\u2019s still there. \u201cOkay, no Notebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Then her whole face lights up. \u201cOohh, how about Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like Will Ferrell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Have you seen Blades of Glory?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s one of my favorites. \u201cThe Iron Lotus? Classic.\u201d</p><p>She wiggles her eyebrows at me and quotes expertly, \u201cYou got some sweet cream to soothe that nasty burn?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laugh. \u201cGod, I love y\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then I choke.</p><p>And cough.</p><p>And clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cI love...that movie.\u201d I fiddle with the remote, and we lay down on the couch as Anchorman starts.</p><p>Okay\u2014don\u2019t get crazy on me now. Let\u2019s just all calm down for a second, shall we? It was a simple mistake. A slip of the tongue. Nothing more.</p><p>My tongue\u2019s been getting quite the workout lately, so I think it\u2019s allowed.</p><p>After eating, we continue watching Ron Burgundy, lying against each other on the couch, her back to my front. My face is in her hair again, inhaling the scent that I\u2019ve become addicted to. I drift in and out of sleep. Kate\u2019s laughter vibrates against my chest as she asks softly, \u201cIs that what you thought of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first started at the firm. Did you think I was a \u2018scorpion woman\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s referring to a line Will Ferrell just delivered in the movie. I smile drowsily. \u201cI...when I first saw you that day in the conference room, it knocked me right on my ass. After that, I just knew nothing would ever be the same.\u201d</p><p>She must have liked my answer. Because a minute later, she rubs her h*ps back against me. And my half-erect c*ck slides between the cheeks of her ass.</p><p>I don\u2019t care how exhausted a guy is\u2014he could\u2019ve just worked a thirty-five-hour shift hauling sand bags across state lines\u2014that move will always, always wake him up.</p><p>My lips find their way to her neck as my hand skims across her stomach. \u201cGod, Kate. I can\u2019t stop...wanting you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s getting kind of ridiculous, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>I feel her breathing pick up. She turns to face me, and our lips meet. But before we go further, my curiosity gets the better of me, and I pull back. \u201cWhat did you think of me when we first met?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes roll to the ceiling as she contemplates her answer. Then she smiles. \u201cWell...that first night at REM, I thought you were...lethal. You just radiated sex and charm.\u201d Her fingers trace my lips and brows. \u201cThat smile, your eyes, they really should be illegal. It was the only time in all my years with Billy that I wished I was single.\u201d</p><p>Wow.</p><p>\u201cAnd then at the office I\u2019d hear the secretaries talking about you. How you had a different girl every weekend. But after a while...I saw that there was so much more to you. You\u2019re brilliant and funny. You\u2019re protective and caring. You shine so bright, Drew. Everything you do\u2014how you think, the things you say, the way you move\u2014it\u2019s...blinding. I feel...lucky, just being close to you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m speechless.</p><p>If any other woman said that to me, I\u2019d agree with her. I\u2019d tell her she was lucky to be with me\u2014\u2019cause I\u2019m the best of the best. There\u2019s no one better. But coming from Kate? From someone whose mind I envy, whose opinion I actually admire? I just...don\u2019t have any words. So, once again, I let my actions do the talking.</p><p>My mouth presses against hers, and my tongue begs for entrance. But when I try to roll us over so I\u2019m on top, Kate has other ideas. She pushes me on the shoulders until I\u2019m on my back. Then she moves her mouth over my jaw and down my neck, burning a trail down my chest and stomach. I swallow hard.</p><p>She takes my c*ck in her hand and pumps slowly, and I\u2019m already stiff as steel. I was hard the minute she started talking. \u201cJesus, Kate...\u201d I keep my eyes open, and watch from above as she wets her lips, opens her mouth, and slides me in. \u201cFuck...\u201d She takes my entire length in deep and sucks hard as she pulls back slowly. Then she does it again.</p> <p>I\u2019m sort of a connoisseur of bl*w j*bs. For a guy, they\u2019re the most convenient kind of sex. No fuss, little mess. If any of you out there have never given one, I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret. Once a guy\u2019s dick is actually in your mouth, he\u2019ll be so happy, it doesn\u2019t really matter what you do with it afterward. That being said, there are certain moves that make it better.</p><p>Kate pumps me with her hand while increasing the suction at the tip with her hot little mouth.</p><p>Like that, for instance.</p><p>She swirls her tongue around the head like she\u2019s licking a lollipop. Where the f**k did she learn that? I moan helplessly and grip the cushions on the couch. She takes me all the way down her throat once, then twice. Then she switches to fast, short pumps with her mouth and hand.</p><p>It\u2019s magnificent. I\u2019ve been blown by the best of them. And I swear to God, Kate Brooks has the technique of a freaking p*rn star.</p><p>I try to hold still, conscious that this really is her first time, but it\u2019s difficult. And then her hands are under me\u2014on my ass\u2014urging me upward. She guides my h*ps back and forth, pushing me in and out of her mouth. Holy God. She removes her hands, but my h*ps continue to move in short shallow jabs.</p><p>I\u2019m close to losing it\u2014but I always give a warning first. If a guy doesn\u2019t warn you? Dump him fast. He\u2019s a f**king prick.</p><p>\u201cKate...baby, I\u2019m...if you don\u2019t move now...God, I\u2019m gonna...\u201d Coherent words are apparently beyond my ability at the moment. Still, I think she gets the idea.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t move away. She doesn\u2019t stop. I look down at the very moment Kate opens her eyes and looks up. And that\u2019s all it takes. It\u2019s the moment I\u2019ve fantasized about since I first saw her. Those big brown doe eyes staring up at me as my c*ck slides between her perfect lips. With a whimper of her name, I fill her mouth with a pulsing stream. Kate moans and takes it all in, swallowing greedily.</p><p>After what seems like an eternity, I start to come down. You know when you first step out of a Jacuzzi? How your limbs feel like Jell-O? Yeah\u2014that\u2019s me. Right now.</p><p>I\u2019m breathing hard and grinning like the village idiot as I pull her up by the shoulders and kiss her deep. Some men are grossed out about kissing a woman whose mouth they just came in. I\u2019m not one of them. \u201cHow in holy hell did you learn to give head like that?\u201d</p><p>Kate laughs at the wonder in my voice as she spreads out on top of me. \u201cDelores dated this guy in college. He was really into porn. He used to leave movies at our dorm all the time. And, once in a while...I\u2019d watch them.\u201d</p><p>The next time I see Delores Warren? Remind me to drop to my knees and kiss her ass.</p><p>Once the movie ended, Kate and I decided to have a full-out Will Ferrell marathon. We\u2019re halfway through Blades of Glory when my phone rings. We\u2019re still on the couch, lying comfortably side by side, and I don\u2019t really feel like getting up. Or talking to anyone not currently in the room, for that matter.</p><p>I let the answering machine pick up. Jack\u2019s voice fills the room, yelling over the sound of pounding music in the background: \u201cDrew! Dude, pick up! Where the f**k are you?\u201d He pauses a moment, and I\u2019m guessing he realizes I\u2019m not going to pick up. \u201cYou have got to come out tonight, man! I\u2019m at Club Sixty-Nine, and there\u2019s someone here who wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>This doesn\u2019t sound promising. I start to sit up, my Y-chromosomal instincts telling me to turn the machine off. Now. But I\u2019m not fast enough. And a sultry female voice comes out of Pandora\u2019s Box. \u201cDreeewwww...it\u2019s Staaaacey. I\u2019ve missed you, baby. I want to take another taxi ride. Remember that night when I sucked your dick so g\u2014\u201d</p><p>My hand slaps down on the off button.</p><p>Then I glance sideways at Kate. Her face is frozen on the TV, her expression indecipherable. I should probably say something. What the f**k should I say? \u201cSorry, one of my other come-dumps called?\u201d Nah, for some reason, I don\u2019t think that one would go over very well.</p><p>She sits up stiffly. \u201cI should probably get going.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Frigging Jack.</p><p>Kate gets up, holding my pillow close against her, covering herself.</p><p>Well, that\u2019s not a good sign. An hour ago she was pushing her snatch against my face. Now she doesn\u2019t even want me looking at it.</p><p>Goddamn it.</p><p>She walks past me toward the bedroom. Even with my stomach churning, I can\u2019t help but admire the sway of her tight ass as she goes by. Predictably, my c*ck springs up like Dracula rising from his coffin.</p><p>When I was ten, we had a dog. He humped everything and anything\u2014from the maid\u2019s leg to my parents\u2019 four-poster bed. He was insatiable. My parents were mortified whenever company stopped by. But now I realize he really wasn\u2019t a bad dog. It wasn\u2019t his fault.</p><p>I feel your pain, Fido.</p><p>I sigh. And get up to follow Kate. By the time I make it to the bedroom, her skirt\u2019s on and her blouse is buttoned. She doesn\u2019t look at me when I walk in.</p><p>\u201cKate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where my other shoe is?\u201d Her eyes gaze at the floor, the bed\u2014anywhere but at me.</p><p>\u201cKate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s under the bed.\u201d She kneels down.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in the way of your plans.\u201d</p><p>Who has plans? The only plan I had was to gorge myself on the juicy buffet between her thighs. Again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Drew. You know, this has been nice...\u201d</p><p>Nice? She calls what we did last night and all day\u2014in the bedroom, the kitchen, the shower, up against the hallway wall\u2014\u201cnice\u201d? Is she f**king joking?</p><p>She must see the look on my face, because she stops mid-sentence and raises an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, was that the wrong adjective? Did I insult your fragile male ego?\u201d</p><p>I stutter indignantly, \u201cWell...yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat word would you prefer?\u201d</p><p>FYI\u2014I\u2019m still nak*d, and if my dick\u2019s posture is any indication, it doesn\u2019t take Einstein to figure out what I\u2019d really prefer at the moment.</p><p>\u201cStupendous? Transcendent? Unparalleled?\u201d I punctuate each word with a predatory step in her direction.</p><p>She matches my forward momentum with nervous steps backward, until her ass bumps up against my dresser. I smirk down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a graduate of the most prestigious business program in the country, Kate. My honor demands that you come up with something, anything, better than \u2018nice.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She stares at my chest a minute. Then she looks up into my eyes. She looks serious. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>She tries to walk past me, but I grab her arm and pull her back. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>No\u2014don\u2019t ask me why. I won\u2019t answer. Not now. I\u2019m only focused on here\u2014and her. The rest doesn\u2019t matter. She looks at my hand on her arm and then at me. \u201cDrew...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave, Kate.\u201d I pick her up, sit her on the dresser, and step between her legs. \u201cStay.\u201d I kiss her neck and nibble her ear. She shivers. I whisper, \u201cStay with me, Kate.\u201d I look into her eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She bites her lip. Then smiles slowly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I smile in return. And then my mouth is on hers. The kiss is long and slow and deep. I push her skirt up, skimming the skin of her thighs with my fingertips. She\u2019s still not wearing any underwear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You\u2019ve got to love the easy access.</p><p>I kneel down in front of her. \u201cDrew...?\u201d It\u2019s a half question, half moan.</p><p>\u201cShhh. If I\u2019m going to top \u2018nice\u2019 I need to concentrate.\u201d</p><p>And there\u2019s not a single coherent word between us for the rest of the night.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>EVERY SUPERHERO HAS A HIDEOUT\u2014a sanctuary. At least all the good ones do. I have one too. My own personal Bat Cave. It\u2019s where the magic happens. Where I\u2019ve built the legend that is my career.</p><p>My home office.</p><p>It\u2019s a male haven. A p**sy-free zone\u2014in the good kind of way. Every guy should have one. I decorated it myself\u2014each piece, every detail. If my car is my baby, this room is my firstborn. My pride and joy.</p><p>Mahogany floors, handmade oriental rugs, English leather couches. A stone fireplace and built-in bookshelves line one wall. Behind my desk is a full picture window that offers a priceless view of the city. And in the corner is a card table where the guys and I drink aged Scotch, smoke Cuban cigars, and play poker once a month.</p><p>It\u2019s the only time Steven is allowed to come out and play.</p><p>I\u2019m at my desk, in boxers, working on my laptop. It\u2019s what I do every Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Kate? No\u2014she\u2019s still here. But after our fuck-a-thon last night, I figured I should let her sleep in. Recharge the batteries. I canceled brunch with my mother and blew off the basketball game with the boys. And now I\u2019m staring at the final draft of a contract when a sleepy voice calls me from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I look up and smile. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s wearing another one of my T-shirts\u2014the black Metallica one. It goes past her knees. That and the sleep-mussed hair make her look sweet but sexy. Alluring. Compared to Kate, work\u2019s not looking so appetizing anymore.</p><p>She runs a hand through her hair as her eyes sweep over the room. \u201cThis is a beautiful office, Drew. Breathtaking.\u201d</p><p>Kate is the type of woman who appreciates the importance of an awe-inspiring workspace. If you want to be a winner, you need an office that says you already are one. \u201cThanks. It\u2019s my favorite room in the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why.\u201d</p><p>She picks up a frame from one of the shelves and shows it to me. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a picture of Mackenzie and me at the beach last summer. She buried me up to my neck in the sand. \u201cMy niece, Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>She looks at the photo and smiles. \u201cShe\u2019s adorable. I bet she worships you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she does. And I\u2019d pretty much cut my hand off for her if she asked me to, so it\u2019s equitable. I\u2019d love for you to meet her one day.\u201d</p><p>Kate doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019d really like that.\u201d</p> <p>She makes her way over to my chair and perches herself on my knee. I lean forward till my lips find hers\u2014my tongue driving deep into the mouth I now know so well.</p><p>She snuggles back against my bare chest. \u201cYou\u2019re so warm.\u201d She rests her head on my shoulder and looks toward my computer. \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cThis deal with Jarvis Technologies.\u201d</p><p>Jarvis is a communications company. They\u2019re looking to acquire a broadband satellite subsidiary.</p><p>I rub my eyes.</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m usually a lone wolf when it comes to business. I don\u2019t confide\u2014I don\u2019t share. My opinion is the only one that counts. But talking to Kate about business is kind of like talking to myself. I\u2019m actually interested in hearing what she has to say. \u201cYeah. The CEO is all brains and no balls. I\u2019ve got the perfect deal lined up, but he won\u2019t pull the trigger. He\u2019s nervous about the risk.\u201d</p><p>Her finger traces my jaw. \u201cEvery acquisition has risks. You have to show him the payoff is worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d</p><p>She perks up then. \u201cYou know, I have something that could help you out. One of my old study partners from Wharton designed a template for a new valuation model. If you run it and the numbers are solid, it might just be enough to persuade Jarvis to take the plunge.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to think Kate\u2019s brain turns me on almost as much as her ass.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on disk in my bag. I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><p>As she stands to go, I grab the bottom of her shirt and pull her back down on my lap\u2014so there\u2019s no way she can miss the perpetual hard-on I\u2019m sporting. My arms wrap around her waist, trapping her. My mouth\u2019s against her ear.</p><p>\u201cBefore we get into that, there\u2019s something I want to do first.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s amusement in her voice as she asks, \u201cWhat do you want to do, Drew?\u201d</p><p>I pick her up, sweep everything off my desk, and lay her down.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>We spend the rest of the day working. And talking. And laughing. I tell Kate about Mackenzie and the Bad Word Jar that\u2019s sucking me dry. She tells me more about growing up in Greenville and her parents\u2019 caf\u00e9. We eat lunch on the balcony. It\u2019s cold, so Kate sits on my lap to keep warm and feeds me with her fingers.</p><p>I can\u2019t remember ever having such a good time. And we aren\u2019t even screwing.</p><p>Go figure.</p><p>It\u2019s after ten. We\u2019re getting ready for bed. Kate is in the shower.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>She took my razor and kicked me out. Unlike women, guys don\u2019t need privacy. There is no bodily function a man won\u2019t perform in front of an audience.</p><p>We have no shame.</p><p>But whatever; if Kate needs her space, she can have it. I keep myself busy while I wait for her. I change the sheets. I take the box of condoms out of my drawer\u2014to have a few in easy reach.</p><p>Then my heart sinks. And if he could, my dick would cry.</p><p>The box is empty. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly. Great minds think alike.\u201d</p><p>I turn at Kate\u2019s voice. She stands in the doorway, one hand on her hip, the other braced against the doorframe. She\u2019s beautifully, wonderfully nak*d. Her snatch is shaven even closer than before\u2014just a whisper of dark curls. Sweet Christ.</p><p>I keep waiting for the time when Kate\u2019s body doesn\u2019t get to me. When I feel been-there-done-that. So far, it\u2019s just the opposite.</p><p>It\u2019s like...eating lobster. If you\u2019ve never eaten it, you think, \u201cEh, maybe.\u201d But once you\u2019ve tasted it? The chance to eat it again gets your mouth watering like the goddamn Mississippi River. Because now you know how f**king delicious it really is. Even just the thought her...God. I may end up being the first man in history capable of masturbating without touching himself.</p><p>Look, Mom\u2014no hands.</p><p>She walks toward me, wraps her arms around my neck and kisses me slowly, her tongue coming out to trace my lower lip in the sexiest frigging way. I force myself to pull back. \u201cKate, wait...we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her hand slides into my boxers, around my already hard cock. She gives it a few pumps. \u201cI think someone disagrees with you.\u201d</p><p>I press my forehead to hers. My voice sounds strangled. \u201cNo...I mean, we\u2019re out. Condoms. I...um...\u201d I put my hand over hers, stopping her strokes so I\u2019ll be able to string a few words together that actually make sense. \u201cI have to go to the store on the corner and get more...and then...God, then I\u2019ll f**k you all night.\u201d</p><p>Kate looks down and swallows. Her voice is hushed. \u201cOr, we could...not...use them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never gone bareback. Ever. Not even during my younger years. I\u2019ve always loved my dick much too much to have it shrivel up and fall off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill, Drew. And Billy...he\u2019s a lot of things, but he\u2019d never cheat on me. Have you been...tested?\u201d</p><p>Sure I have. Once a month, for as long as I can remember. It\u2019s a must with my lifestyle. An occupational hazard, you could say. My voice practically squeaks. \u201cYeah. I...I have. I\u2019m good. But...are you sure?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been offered a lot of things in bed. Every kind of kinky contraption and role-play you can imagine. Some you probably can\u2019t. Fucking without protection has never been one of them. It\u2019s not smart or safe. A woman can say she\u2019s on the pill, but how do you really know? People can tell you they\u2019re clean, but I wouldn\u2019t believe them. That would require trust.</p><p>And trust has never been a factor in my sex life.</p><p>It\u2019s not about sharing\u2014getting to know someone and letting them know me. It\u2019s about getting off and getting the girl off in the process. Period.</p><p>\u201cI want to feel you, Drew. I want you to feel me. I don\u2019t want...anything between us.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at her eyes. The way she\u2019s looking at me...it\u2019s just like she did after our shower yesterday. Like she\u2019s giving me something\u2014a gift. That\u2019s just for me. Only for me. And it\u2019s her. Because she trusts me, has faith in me, believes in me. And you know what?</p><p>I don\u2019t want Kate to ever look at me any other way.</p><p>\u201cKate, these last couple days with you have been amazing. I\u2019ve never...I\u2019ve just never...\u201d I don\u2019t even know how to describe what I\u2019m feeling. I have no idea how to tell her. I make my living off the ability to communicate. By being able to verbalize an idea. Describe a plan.</p><p>But at this moment words are pitifully inadequate.</p><p>So I grab her by the upper arms and drag her against me. She moans from surprise or excitement\u2014I\u2019m not sure which. Her tongue slides against mine, and her hands pull at my hair. Somehow we end up on the bed, side by side, mouths fused together, my boxers on the floor. My hand slides over her tits, down her stomach, and between her legs.</p><p>I groan, \u201cFuck, Kate, you\u2019re already wet.\u201d</p><p>And she is. I\u2019ve barely touched her and she\u2019s dripping for me. Jesus. I\u2019ve never wanted anyone or anything as much as I want her at this moment. She nips at my neck as I slide my fingers inside. Her p**sy closes around them like a goddamn glove, and we both moan loudly.</p><p>Then Kate\u2019s hands are on me, all over me. Cupping my balls, stroking my cock, scratching my chest and back.</p><p>I roll her under me. I need her\u2014now. I tease her open with my dick, coating the tip with her sweet cream. Heat rolls off her, from her. She\u2019s like a fire\u2014calling to me, drawing me in. I push inside slowly but to the hilt, and my eyes fall closed in perfect f**king ecstasy.</p><p>She\u2019s bare, unguarded, all around me. She feels...more. Wetter, hotter, tighter. More in every way. It\u2019s unbelievable.</p><p>Kate grips my ass, kneading and massaging and urging me in deeper. But I pull all the way out, just so I can slide back in again.</p><p>Christ Almighty.</p><p>I set the rhythm. It\u2019s not slow or sweet or tender. It\u2019s brutal and hot, and f**king amazing.</p><p>High-pitched whimpers escape through her parted lips. Then my mouth is on hers again, cutting them off. And we\u2019re grasping at each other, desperate and raw.</p><p>Like it\u2019s the first time. Like it\u2019s the last time.</p><p>She\u2019s curled around me in every way. Her cunt envelops my cock, her legs surround my waist, her arms encircle my neck\u2014all wrapped tight like some exquisite vise. And I\u2019m burrowing into her, wanting to be closer, needing to be deeper. God, I\u2019d f**king crawl inside her if I could and never want out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kate\u2019s hands find mine. Our fingers fold together, and I bring them, joined, up over her head. Our foreheads touch\u2014every pant, every breath mixing and mingling. Her h*ps move with mine, like the flow of the ocean. Back and forth. In frenzied unison. Together.</p><p>Our eyes lock. \u201cGod, Drew...don\u2019t stop...please, don\u2019t ever stop.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m drowning in her. I can barely draw a breath. But somehow I grind out, \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll never stop.\u201d</p><p>I feel it when she comes. Every scorching wet inch of her tightens blissfully around me. And it\u2019s so good...so savagely intense I want to f**king weep from the pleasure. I bury my face in her neck, inhaling her, devouring her. And then I\u2019m coming with her\u2014within her. Bathing her insides with each carnal thrust. Sweet electricity races through me as one word falls from my lips over and over again:</p> <p>\u201cKate...Kate...Kate...Kate.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s miraculous.</p><p>After several moments, our bodies still. The only sounds in the room are our rapid breaths and pounding heartbeats.</p><p>Then Kate whispers, \u201cDrew? Are you all right?\u201d I lift my head and find her beautiful eyes looking at me with concern. Her hand cups my cheek gently. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>Have you ever tried to take a picture of something really far away? And you look through the lens and the whole scene is a blurry blob? So you mess with the focus; you zoom in and out. And then the camera whirls and seconds later\u2014boom\u2014instant clarity.</p> <p>Everything snaps into place.</p><p>The picture is as clear as crystal.</p><p>That\u2019s what it\u2019s like for me\u2014right now\u2014looking at Kate. Suddenly, it\u2019s all so obvious. So frigging clear.</p><p>I\u2019m in love with her. Totally. Helplessly. Pathetically.</p><p>In love.</p><p>Kate owns me. Body and soul.</p> <p>She\u2019s all I think about. She\u2019s everything I never thought I wanted. She\u2019s not just perfect\u2014she\u2019s perfect for me.</p><p>I\u2019d do anything for her.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>I want her near me, with me. All the time.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>It\u2019s not just the sex. It\u2019s not just her gorgeous body or her brilliant mind. It\u2019s not just that she makes me think or how eager she is to challenge me. It\u2019s more than any of that.</p><p>It\u2019s all of it.</p><p>It\u2019s her.</p> <p>I\u2019ve broken every goddamn rule I\u2019ve ever set for myself to be with her. And it wasn\u2019t just to f**k her.</p><p>It was to have her. To keep her.</p><p>How did I not see it before? How come I didn\u2019t know?</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d She kisses me softly on the lips. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go? I lost you for a minute. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I swallow harshly. \u201cKate, I...\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI...I\u2019m fine.\u201d I smile and kiss her back. \u201cI think you just wore me out.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWow. Never thought that would happen.\u201d</p><p>Yeah\u2014tell me about it.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>I KNOW WHAT YOU\u2019RE THINKING: What the fuck?</p><p>If I realized that I\u2019m in love with Kate, and she\u2019s obviously infatuated with me\u2014how does she end up back with Billy Why-Don\u2019t-You-Just-Die-Already Warren?</p><p>Excellent question. We\u2019re almost there. But first: a science lesson. What do you know about frogs?</p><p>Yes. I said frogs.</p><p>Did you know that if you put a frog in boiling water, he\u2019ll jump out? But, if you put one in cold water and heat it slowly, he\u2019ll stay in. And boil to death. He won\u2019t even try to get out. He won\u2019t even know he\u2019s dying. Until it\u2019s too late.</p><p>Men are a lot like frogs.</p><p>Was I freaked out by my little epiphany? Of course I was. It was huge. Life-changing. No more strange p**sy. No more stories for the guys. No more Saturday nights. But none of that mattered anymore. Honestly.</p><p>Because it was too late. I was already boiling\u2014for Kate.</p><p>That whole night I watched her sleep. And made plans...for us. The things we\u2019d do together, the places we\u2019d go\u2014tomorrow and next weekend and next year. I practiced what I would say, how I would tell her my feelings. I imagined her reaction and how she would confess she felt the same way. It was like a movie, some horrible chick flick that I would never go see. The dashing playboy meets the take-no-prisoners girl of his dreams, and she snags his heart forever.</p><p>I should have known then that it was too good to be true. The best things usually are: Santa Claus, the male G-spot, heaven\u2014the list is endless.</p><p>You\u2019ll see.</p><p>We\u2019re walking down Fifth Avenue. Instead of wasting precious time driving across town to Kate\u2019s apartment, we stopped at Saks on the way to work, where I bought Kate a new navy Chanel suit. Can\u2019t have her doing the Walk of Shame into the office, now can I? When she was trying on clothes for me, I swear, I felt just like Richard f**king Gere in Pretty Woman. Kate even bought me a tie.</p><p>See?</p><p>Then she insisted on stopping by the lingerie department to replace the panties I\u2019d so erotically destroyed. I put up a good fight over that one, but I lost. You ladies ought to know\u2014going commando? That\u2019s sexier than leather and lace and whips and chains all put together.</p><p>We stop by Starbucks and grab some much-needed caffeine. As we walk back outside, I pull Kate close. I cup her cheek and kiss her. She tastes like coffee\u2014light and sweet. She pushes my hair back out of my eyes and smiles.</p><p>I\u2019ll never get tired of looking at her. Or kissing her. Pussy whipped, thy name is Drew. Yeah I know. It\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind. \u2019Cause if this is the Dark Side? Sign me up. Seriously. Don\u2019t be surprised if I start skipping down the street singing, \u201cZip-a-Dee-f**king-Doo-Dah.\u201d I\u2019m that happy.</p><p>Kate and I turn the corner. Holding hands and smiling at each other like two idiots who popped one too many antidepressants. Nauseating, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>We need to stop here for just a minute. You should look at us. How we are right here, right now\u2014hand in hand. You should remember this moment. I do.</p><p>We were...perfect.</p><p>Then we get to our building. I open the door for Kate and walk in behind her.</p><p>And the first thing I see are daisies. Large white daisies with cheerful yellow centers. Some in vases on the security desk, others in bunches tied with ribbon. Some are scattered singly all over the floor, random petals here and there. In the middle of the lobby is a circle of even more daisies. In the center of that circle, is Billy Warren. And he\u2019s got his guitar.</p><p>Fuck. Me.</p><p>No, that doesn\u2019t quite cover it.</p><p>Fuck me with a chainsaw.</p><p>Yeah\u2014that\u2019s about right.</p><p>You ever see a singing a**hole? Here\u2019s your chance:</p><p>I was so blind I didn\u2019t know</p><p>How much it would hurt to let you go</p><p>I want to heal us, want to mend</p><p>Come back, come back to me again</p><p>If I didn\u2019t hate him so much\u2014and the jackal who spawned him\u2014I\u2019d have to admit he\u2019s not half bad. I watch Kate closely. Every emotion that crosses her face, each feeling that dances in her eyes.</p><p>You know when you have a stomach virus? And you lay around all day with a bucket at your side because you feel like you\u2019re going to puke at any second? But then there\u2019s that moment\u2014when you know it\u2019s coming. You break out in that cold, full-body sweat. Your head pounds, and you feel your throat expand to make room for the bile that\u2019s charging up from your stomach.</p><p>That\u2019s me. Right now.</p><p>I actually put my coffee down and look around for the nearest garbage can just to be sure I\u2019ll make it there in time.</p><p>And I need to say I\u2019m sorry</p><p>For all the pain I caused</p><p>Please give your heart back to me</p><p>I\u2019ll keep it safe for eternity</p><p>We belong together</p><p>We\u2019ve always known it\u2019s true</p><p>There will never be another</p><p>My soul cries out for you.</p><p>Any other time, any other girl, I would bury Warren. Without even trying. He can\u2019t hold a candle to me. I\u2019m a goddamn Porsche; he\u2019s a frigging pickup truck that can\u2019t pass inspection.</p><p>But this is Kate. They have a history, a decade\u2019s worth. And that, kiddies, makes him some major-league competition.</p><p>In the dark of night, it\u2019s your name I call</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I almost lost it all</p><p>One more chance, one breath, one try</p><p>No more reasons to say goodbye</p><p>I want to pick Kate up, caveman style, and carry her out of here. I want to lock her in my apartment where he can\u2019t see her. Can\u2019t touch her. Can\u2019t touch us. The whole time I stare at her, but she doesn\u2019t turn to look at me.</p><p>Not one f**king time.</p><p>And I need to say I\u2019m sorry</p><p>For all the pain I caused</p><p>Please give your heart back to me</p><p>I\u2019ll keep it safe for eternity</p><p>We belong together</p><p>We\u2019ve always known it\u2019s true</p><p>There will never be another</p><p>My soul cries out for you</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I learn to play an instrument? When I was nine, my mother wanted me to play the trumpet. After two lessons, the tutor quit \u2019cause I let the dog piss on his mouthpiece.</p><p>Why the hell didn\u2019t I listen to my mother?</p><p>You are my beginning, you\u2019ll be my end</p><p>More than lovers, more than friends</p><p>I want you, I want you</p><p>He can\u2019t have her. Go ahead and want all day long, douchebag. Sing from the motherf**king rooftops. Play until your fingers fall off. It\u2019s too little, too late. She\u2019s already mine. Kate isn\u2019t the type to have sex with just anyone. And she f**ked me all weekend like the world was ending. That has to count for something.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>And I need to say I\u2019m sorry</p><p>For all the pain I caused</p><p>Please give your heart back to me</p><p>I\u2019ll keep it safe for eternity</p><p>For eternity</p><p>You and me</p><p>The small crowd that\u2019s gathered in the lobby applauds. Dickhead puts his guitar down and walks up to Kate.</p><p>If he touches her, I will break his f**king hand. I swear to God.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t acknowledge me at all. He\u2019s focused only on Kate. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling you since Friday night...and I stopped by the apartment a few times this weekend, but you were out.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right. She wasn\u2019t home. She was busy. Now ask her what she was doing.</p><p>Who she was doing.</p><p>\u201cI know this is work...but do you think we could go somewhere? To talk? Maybe your office?\u201d</p><p>Say no.</p><p>Say no.</p><p>Say no, say no, say no, say no, say no, say no, say no, say no...</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>As she starts to walk away, I grab Kate\u2019s arm. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes question me. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I have to tell you. Now. It\u2019s important.\u201d I know I sound desperate, but I really don\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>She puts her hand over mine, the one still clasping her arm. She\u2019s calm\u2014condescending, like she\u2019s talking to a child. \u201cAll right, Drew. Let me talk to Billy first and I\u2019ll meet you in your office, okay?\u201d</p><p>I want to stomp my foot like a two-year-old. No. It\u2019s so not f**king okay. She needs to know where I stand. I have to stake my claim. Throw my hat in the ring. Get my car in the goddamn race.</p><p>But I drop my hand anyway. \u201cFine. You two have a nice chat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I make sure I walk away first.</p><p>I stride toward my office. But I can\u2019t help but stop at Erin\u2019s desk when they walk by. As Kate turns to close her office door, our eyes meet. And she smiles at me. And for the first time in my life, I don\u2019t know what it means.</p><p>Is she reassuring me that nothing\u2019s changed? That nothing will? Is she saying thank you for bringing that f**k nut crawling back to her? I just don\u2019t know.</p><p>And it\u2019s driving me crazy.</p> <p>I clench my jaw and stalk toward my own desk, slamming the door behind me. And then I pace. Like a soon-to-be father outside the delivery room, waiting to see if everything that means anything to him will come out unscathed.</p><p>I should have told her. Last night. When I had the chance. I should have explained how much she means to me. What I feel for her. I thought I had time. I figured I\u2019d ease into it, slowly work up to it.</p><p>Stupid.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I just f**king tell her?</p><p>Goddamn it.</p> <p>Maybe she already knows. I mean, I brought her to my apartment, I cuddled with her. I worshiped her. I f**ked her without a rubber\u2014three times. She\u2019s got to know.</p><p>Erin quietly enters the room. I must look like a disaster, because her face is soft with sympathy. \u201cSo, Kate and Billy are talking, huh?\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d</p><p>She opens her mouth, probably to tell me yes, but closes it and starts again. \u201cNo. I just know you, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take a walk? See what I can see...or hear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think that\u2019ll work?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cThe CIA would be lucky to have me.\u201d</p><p>I nod again. \u201cOkay. Yeah. Go do that, Erin. See what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>She walks out. And I go back to wearing a hole in the rug. And pushing my hand through my hair until it sticks up like I\u2019ve been struck by lightning.</p><p>A few minutes later, Erin comes back. \u201cThe door\u2019s closed, so I couldn\u2019t hear anything, but I peeked through the glass. They\u2019re sitting in front of her desk, facing each other. He\u2019s got his head in his hands, and she\u2019s listening to him talk. Her hand is on his knee.\u201d</p><p>Okay. He\u2019s pouring his heart out. And she\u2019s being sympathetic. I can live with that. Because then she\u2019s going to crush him, isn\u2019t she? She\u2019s going to tell him to screw off. That she\u2019s moved on\u2014found someone better. Right?</p><p>Right?</p><p>Christ, just f**king agree with me.</p> <p>\u201cSo...what should I do?\u201d</p><p>Erin shrugs. \u201cAll you can do is wait. And see what she says when they\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been good at waiting. No matter how hard my parents tried, I could never wait until Christmas morning to find out what I got. I was like a mini-Indiana Jones\u2014searching and digging until I found every single gift.</p><p>Patience may be a virtue, but it\u2019s not one of mine.</p><p>Erin stops at the door. \u201cI hope it works out, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Erin.\u201d</p><p>And then she leaves. And I wait. And think. I think about the look on Kate\u2019s face when she was crying at her desk. I think about the panic she was in when she saw Warren at the bar.</p><p>Was that all I was to Kate? A distraction? A means to my own end?</p><p>I start pacing again. And praying. To a God I haven\u2019t spoken to since I was ten years old. But I talk to him now. I promise and I swear. I barter and beg\u2014fervently.</p><p>For Kate to choose me.</p><p>The longest ninety minutes of my life later, Erin\u2019s voice hisses out of the intercom on my desk.</p><p>\u201cIncoming! Incoming! Kate, nine o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>I dive across my desk, knocking pens and paperclips to the floor. I push my chair up, smooth my hair down, and shuffle some papers around so it looks like I\u2019ve been working. Then I take a deep breath. Pull it together.</p><p>It\u2019s game time.</p><p>Kate opens the door and walks in.</p><p>She looks...normal. Completely herself. No guilt. No anxiety. Not a care in the world.</p><p>She stands in front of my desk. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I force myself to smile casually. Even though my heart\u2019s pounding in my chest. Kind of like a dog\u2019s would\u2014just before he\u2019s put down.</p><p>I should make small talk so I don\u2019t look too eager\u2014too interested. But I just can\u2019t manage it. \u201cSo...how\u2019d things go with Billy?\u201d</p><p>She smiles softly. \u201cWe talked. We said some things that I think we both needed to hear. And now we\u2019re good. Really good, actually.\u201d</p><p>God. Can you see the knife sticking out of my chest? Yeah\u2014the one she just twisted. They talked\u2014they\u2019re good\u2014really good. She took him back.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Kate. Mission accomplished, then, huh?\u201d I should have been an actor. I deserve a goddamn Academy Award after this.</p><p>Her brow wrinkles. \u201cMission?\u201d</p><p>My cell phone rings, saving me from this nightmare of a conversation.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d It\u2019s Steven. But Kate doesn\u2019t know that. I force my voice to sound strong. Energized. \u201cHey, Stacey. Yeah, baby, I\u2019m glad you called.\u201d</p><p>Always score first. Remember?</p><p>\u201cSorry I missed you on Saturday. What was I doing? Nothing important\u2014a little project of mine. Something I\u2019ve been trying to get done for a while. Yeah, I\u2019m finished with it now. Turned out it wasn\u2019t as good as I thought it\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>Yes, my words are calculated. Yes, I hope they hurt her. What did you expect me to say? This is me you\u2019re talking to here. Did you really think I\u2019d sit back like a chump while Kate gave me the brush-off?</p><p>No f**king way.</p><p>I ignore Steven\u2019s confusion on the other line and compel my lungs to laugh. \u201cTonight? Sure I\u2019d love to see you. Right, I\u2019ll bring the taxi.\u201d</p><p>Why are you looking at me like I\u2019m the bastard? I gave Kate everything I have, everything I\u2019m capable of. And she kicked me in the f**king teeth with it. I opened up my soul to her\u2014and I know how pussified that sounds. But it\u2019s true. So don\u2019t look at me like I\u2019m the bad guy, because\u2014for once\u2014I\u2019m not.</p><p>I loved her. God, I f**king love her. And right now, it\u2019s killing me. I feel like one of those patients on ER who get their chests cracked open with a freaking rib spreader.</p><p>With the phone still on my ear, I finally look up at Kate. And for a second, I can\u2019t draw a breath. I thought she\u2019d be pissed, maybe disappointed that I tossed her to the curb first. But that\u2019s not how she looks.</p><p>Have you ever seen someone get hit?</p><p>I have. Matthew, in our younger years. And Jack, on occasion, hasn\u2019t moved fast enough after coming on too strong to the wrong woman. When they got smacked\u2014there was this expression. It only lasted a few seconds. Their whole face just went white...and blank. I guess it\u2019s shock, like they can\u2019t believe what just happened actually happened to them.</p><p>That\u2019s what Kate looks like.</p><p>Like I slapped her across the face.</p><p>You think I should feel guilty about that? You want me to be sorry? Well too f**king bad. I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. She made her decision. She made her choice.</p><p>Now she can choke on it.</p><p>I cover the mouthpiece of the phone. \u201cSorry, Kate, I have to take this. I\u2019ll see you at lunch, okay?\u201d</p><p>She blinks twice. Then turns and walks out of my office without a word.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>AFTER KATE LEAVES, things are...hazy. Isn\u2019t that how they always describe it? Victims of some catastrophic train wreck? That, in the moments after, it\u2019s all unclear. Unreal.</p><p>I tell Erin I\u2019m sick. Her smile is sad and pitying. Before I get in the elevator, I look back at Kate\u2019s office, hoping to see her again. Just to torment myself.</p><p>But her door is closed.</p><p>It\u2019s raining outside. A winter downpour. The kind that soaks your clothes and chills you from the inside out. It doesn\u2019t bother me.</p><p>I walk back to my apartment, numb and dazed. Like a zombie from some low-budget horror film who doesn\u2019t react, even when he cuts his own foot off with a chainsaw.</p><p>But when I make it through the door\u2014that\u2019s when my senses kick back in. When I start to feel again. And I feel Kate.</p><p>Everywhere.</p><p>I can still see her eyes, heavy lidded with heat. I hear her whisper in my ear as I fall on the bed. Her scent covers my pillow. And I just can\u2019t get past the fact that she was right here a few hours ago. And I could touch her and look at her and kiss her.</p><p>And now I...can\u2019t.</p><p>It\u2019s like when someone dies. And you can\u2019t believe they\u2019re really gone because you just ran into them yesterday. They were right there with you, alive and real. And that\u2019s the memory you hold on to\u2014the moment you mourn the most.</p><p>Because it was the last.</p><p>When did it happen?</p><p>That\u2019s what I can\u2019t figure out. When did Kate become so important to me that I can\u2019t function without her? Was it when I saw her crying in her office? Or the first time I kissed her in mine? Maybe it happened when Anderson insulted her, and I wanted to kick his ass for it. Was it that first night at the bar? The first time I looked into those endless brown eyes and knew I had to have her?</p><p>Or was it here? In my apartment? In any one of the hundred times I touched her...</p><p>God, why didn\u2019t I see it sooner.</p><p>All those weeks\u2014all those months\u2014wasted. All those women I f**ked, whose faces I can\u2019t even remember. All the times I pissed her off, when I could have been making her smile. All those days I could have been loving her. And getting her to love me.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it\u2019s not us who ends it? We don\u2019t get to walk away.</p><p>We crawl.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have said those things. In my office. Kate didn\u2019t deserve that. It\u2019s not her fault she doesn\u2019t want what I want. That she doesn\u2019t feel what I feel.</p><p>Christ, this is awful. Just f**king kill me.</p><p>Where\u2019s a stray bullet from a random drive-by shooting when you need one?</p><p>Have you ever felt like this? Have you ever held something that meant...everything to you? Maybe you caught a home run ball as it flew over the fence? Or looked at a picture of yourself from some sweet, unforgettable time? Maybe your mother gave you a ring that belonged to your grandma\u2019s grandmother? Whatever it is\u2014you look at it and swear you\u2019ll keep it forever. Because it\u2019s that special. Precious.</p><p>Irreplaceable.</p><p>And then one day\u2014you don\u2019t know how or when it happened\u2014you realize it\u2019s gone.</p><p>Lost.</p><p>And you ache for it. You\u2019d give anything to find it again. To have it back with you, where it was always supposed to be.</p><p>I curl myself around the pillow. I don\u2019t know how long I stay there like that, but the next time I open my eyes and look out the window, it\u2019s dark. What do you think they\u2019re doing right now? Celebrating probably. Going out. Or maybe staying in.</p><p>I stare at the ceiling. Yes, those are tears. Liquid regret.</p><p>Go ahead\u2014call me a p**sy. Call me a bitch. I deserve it. And I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>Do you think he has any idea how lucky he is? How blessed?</p><p>Of course he doesn\u2019t. He was the idiot who let her go. And I was the idiot who couldn\u2019t keep her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe they won\u2019t last.

Not after I put that look on her face.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>I roll off the bed and fall toward the trashcan. I barely make it before I wretch and heave. And anything that was in my stomach isn\u2019t.</p><p>And that\u2019s the moment\u2014there on my knees. That\u2019s when I tell myself I have the flu. Because this...this broken wreck can\u2019t really be me.</p> <p>Not forever.</p><p>If I\u2019m just sick, then I can take some aspirin, get some sleep, and I\u2019ll feel better. I\u2019ll be me again. Eventually. But if I admit I\u2019m crushed, if I acknowledge that my heart has been shattered into a thousand f**king shards...then I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll ever be all right again. Maybe never.</p><p>So I get back into bed. To wait it out.</p><p>Till I\u2019m over the flu.</p><p>Chapter 19</p> <p>SO THAT\u2019S IT. That\u2019s my story. The rise. The fall. The end. And now\u2014here I am\u2014in this lousy restaurant Alexandra and Matthew dragged me to, where I just finished telling them pretty much the same story I told you.</p><p>When I was six, I learned how to ride a bike. Like all kids when they first take the training wheels off, I fell. A lot. Any time it happened, Alexandra was the one who was there. She dusted me off, kissed the scrapes away and convinced me to climb back on. So it\u2019s only natural that I expect my sister to be compassionate about my heartache. Gentle. Sympathetic.</p><p>What I get is, \u201cYou\u2019re a goddamn idiot, you know that, Drew?\u201d</p><p>I bet you were starting to wonder why we call her The Bitch. Well, here you go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sorry is exactly what you are. Do you have any idea what a mess you\u2019ve made? I always knew you were spoiled and self-centered. Hell, I was one of the people who made you that way. But I never thought you were stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Huh?</p><p>\u201cAnd I could have sworn you were born with testicles.\u201d</p><p>I choke on my drink. And Matthew laughs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I distinctly remember changing your diaper and seeing those cute little guys hanging there. What happened to them? Did they shrink? Disappear? Because that\u2019s the only reason I can think of to explain why you would behave like such a pathetic no-balls coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Alexandra!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think even He can fix this.\u201d</p><p>Defensive anger seeps into my chest. \u201cI really don\u2019t need this right now. Not from you. I\u2019m already down\u2014why the f**k are you kicking me?\u201d</p><p>She scoffs, \u201cBecause a swift kick in the ass is exactly what you need to pick yourself up. Did you ever even consider that when Kate said they were \u2018really good,\u2019 perhaps she meant they were civil? That they had decided to be friends? Part amicably? If you knew half as much about women as you think you do, you\u2019d understand that no woman would want to end a ten-year relationship on bad terms.\u201d</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t even make any sense. Why would anyone want to be friends with someone they used to be able to f**k and can\u2019t anymore? What would be the frigging point? \u201cNo. You\u2019re totally off base.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cRegardless, if you had acted like a man instead of a wounded little boy, you would have told her how you felt.\u201d</p><p>Now she\u2019s just pissing me off. \u201cDo I look like a f**king a**hole to you? \u2019Cause I\u2019m not. And there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to put myself out there and chase after someone who wants to be with somebody else.\u201d</p><p>A look washes over Alexandra\u2019s face that I\u2019ve never seen before. At least not directed at me.</p><p>It\u2019s disappointment.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Drew. Why should you chase anyone, when you\u2019re so content to let everyone chase you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means everything has always been easy for you. You\u2019re handsome, intelligent, you have a family who loves you and women who lay down for you like sacrificial lambs. And the one time you have to struggle for something you want\u2014the one time you have to risk your heart for someone who\u2019s finally worth it\u2014what do you do? You give up. You shoot first and ask questions later. You curl up in a ball and wallow in self-pity.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head slightly, and her voice softens. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even try, Drew. After all that. You just...threw her away.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my drink. My voice is quiet. With remorse.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t thought about it. Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t regretted my words or lack thereof. Because I have. Bitterly. \u201cI wish...but it\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p><p>Matthew finally speaks up. \u201cIt\u2019s never too late, man. The game\u2019s not over; it\u2019s just rain delayed.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. \u201cHas Delores said anything to you? About Kate and Billy?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot about them...but she\u2019s had a whole lot to say about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean Dee hates your guts. She thinks you\u2019re a scumbag. Seriously, dude, if you were on fire in the street? I don\u2019t think she\u2019d spit on you.\u201d</p><p>I roll that information around for a minute. \u201cMaybe she hates me because I f**ked her cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she hates you because you broke her best friend\u2019s heart?\u201d</p><p>Yeah. It\u2019s a toss-up. No help there.</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with Kate, Drew?\u201d</p><p>My eyes meet Alexandra\u2019s. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a chance that she feels the same way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d The more I thought about Kate\u2019s words and actions that weekend, the more certain I became that Kate felt something for me. Something real and deep.</p><p>At least she did before I shot it all to hell.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen whether she\u2019s back with her ex or not is irrelevant. The question you need to ask yourself is what are you willing to do\u2014willing to risk\u2014to make this right? To get her back.\u201d</p><p>And my answer to that is simple: Anything. Everything. My throat is tight as I confess, \u201cI\u2019d give anything to have Kate back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, for God\u2019s sake, fight for her! Tell her.\u201d</p><p>As her words sink in, Matthew grips my shoulder. \u201cIn times like this, I always ask myself, \u2018What would William Wallace do?\u2019\u201d His eyes are serious. Stirring. Then his voice takes on a Scottish accent he doesn\u2019t have. \u201cAye...run, and you won\u2019t get rejected...but years from now, would you be willin\u2019 to trade all the days from now to then for a chance\u2014just one chance\u2014to go back and tell Kate she can take your balls and hang them from the rearview mirror of her car, but she can never take...your freedom!\u201d</p><p>Alexandra rolls her eyes at the Braveheart speech, and I actually laugh. The black cloud that\u2019s been sitting on my shoulders all week long finally starts to lift. In its place is...hope. Confidence. Determination. All the things that make me...me. All the things I\u2019ve been missing since the morning I watched Billy Warren sing.</p><p>Matthew smacks me on the back. \u201cGo get her, man. I mean, look at you\u2014what have you got to lose?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. Who needs dignity? Pride? They\u2019re overrated. When you\u2019ve got nothing, you\u2019ve got nothing left to lose.</p><p>\u201cI have to go see Kate. Right now.\u201d</p><p>And if I strike out? At least I\u2019ll go down swinging. If I crash and burn and she grinds my ashes into the dirt with her heel? So be it. But I have to try. Because...</p><p>Well, because she\u2019s worth it.</p><p>When Alexandra turned sixteen, my parents rented out Six Flags Great Adventure for the day. Excessive? Yes. But that\u2019s one of the perks of a privileged upbringing. It was awesome. No lines, no crowds. Just our family, some business associates, and a hundred and fifty of our closest friends. Anyway, there was this one rollercoaster\u2014the Mind Bender. Frigging insane.</p><p>Remember how I said I never ride the same coaster twice? This was the exception.</p><p>Matthew, Steven, and I rode it until we puked. Then we climbed back on and rode it again. The first hill was nasty. A long, torturous incline that ended in a four-hundred-foot vertical drop\u2014straight freaking down. No matter how many times we rode that bad boy\u2014every time we climbed that first hill\u2014it felt the same. My palms got sweaty, my stomach turned over. It was the perfect combination of excitement and dread.</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly how I feel right now.</p><p>See me there? The guy jogging through Times Square.</p><p>Just the thought of seeing Kate again...I\u2019m pumped about it, I won\u2019t lie. But I\u2019m nervous too. Because I have no idea what\u2019s on the other side of this hill, how far the drop might be for me.</p><p>No sympathy, huh? Tough crowd. You think I got what I deserved? Maybe I still deserve worse?</p><p>It\u2019s a compelling argument. I f**ked up. No question about it. It was a slump\u2014all the greats have them. But those days are over now. I\u2019m off the bench and back in the game.</p><p>I just hope Kate will give me another chance at bat.</p><p>Panting from the seven-block sprint, I nod my head in greeting to the security guard and make my way through the empty lobby. I use the brief elevator ride up to catch my breath and practice what I\u2019m going to say. Then I step out onto the fortieth floor.</p><p>There\u2019s only one place Kate Brooks would be at ten thirty on a Monday night. And that\u2019s right here, where it all started. The offices are dark. It\u2019s quiet, except for the music coming from her office. I walk down the hall and stop outside her closed door.</p><p>Then I see her. Through the glass.</p><p>Christ Almighty.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting at her desk, staring at the computer screen. She\u2019s biting her lip in that way that brings me to my f**king knees. Her hair is pulled back, exposing every flawless feature on her face. I\u2019ve missed looking at her. You have no idea. It feels like...like I\u2019ve been underwater, holding my breath. And now I can finally breathe again.</p><p>She looks up. And her eyes meet mine.</p><p>See how she stares for a few seconds longer than necessary? How her head tilts to the side, and her eyes squint? Like she doesn\u2019t quite believe what she\u2019s seeing.</p><p>She\u2019s surprised. Then the surprise morphs into distaste. Like she just ate something rotten. And that\u2019s when I know. When I\u2019m certain of what you\u2019ve probably already figured out. That I am a complete f**king idiot.</p><p>She didn\u2019t take Warren back. There\u2019s no way.</p><p>If she had? If our weekend had meant nothing to her? If I meant nothing? She wouldn\u2019t be looking at me like I\u2019m the goddamn devil. She wouldn\u2019t be affected at all. It\u2019s simple guy logic: If a woman is angry? It means she cares. If you\u2019re in a relationship and a chick can\u2019t even be bothered to yell at you? You\u2019re screwed. Indifference is a woman\u2019s kiss of death. It\u2019s the equivalent of a man not interested in sex. In either case\u2014it\u2019s over. You\u2019re done.</p><p>So, if Kate is upset, it\u2019s because I hurt her. And the only reason I was able to do that is because she wanted to be with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That may seem like a twisted way to think\u2014but it\u2019s the way it is. Trust me, I know. I\u2019ve spent my life screwing women I felt nothing for. If they f**ked another guy right after me? Good for them. If they told me they never wanted to see me again? Even better. You can\u2019t get blood from a stone. You can\u2019t get a reaction from someone who doesn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>Kate, on the other hand, is overflowing with emotion. Anger, distrust, betrayal\u2014it simmers in her eyes and shines on her face. The fact that she still feels something for me\u2014even if it\u2019s hatred\u2014gives me hope. Because that I can work with.</p><p>I open the door to her office and walk in. Kate looks back to her laptop and hits a few keys.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Drew?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cI\u2019m working. I don\u2019t have time for you.\u201d</p><p>I step forward and close her laptop. \u201cMake time.\u201d</p><p>She turns her eyes on me. They\u2019re hard. Glacial, like black ice.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p> <p>I smirk, even though there\u2019s nothing remotely funny about any of this. \u201cBeen there. All week.\u201d</p><p>She leans back in her chair, looking me up and down. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Erin told us about your mysterious illness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stayed home because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCab ride take too much out of you? Needed a few days to recover?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWhat I said that day was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>She stands up. \u201cNo. The only mistake here was mine. That I ever thought there was anything more to you. That I actually let myself believe there was something...beautiful underneath all your cocky charm and big-dick attitude. I was wrong. You\u2019re hollow inside. Empty.\u201d</p> <p>Remember when I said Kate and I are a lot alike? We are. And I don\u2019t mean just in bed or at the office. We both have the uncanny ability to say just the right things\u2014to wound. To find that weak spot inside every one of us, and nail it with a verbal frigging grenade.</p><p>\u201cKate, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cuts me off. And her voice is tight. Clogged.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Drew, I\u2019m not stupid. I wasn\u2019t expecting a marriage proposal. I knew what you were like. But, you seemed so...And that night at the bar? The way you looked at me. I thought...\u201d</p><p>Her voice breaks, and I want to f**king kill myself.</p><p>\u201c...I thought I meant something to you.\u201d</p><p>I step closer, wanting to touch her. To comfort her. To take it all back.</p><p>Make it all better.</p> <p>\u201cYou did. You do.\u201d</p><p>She nods stiffly. \u201cRight. That\u2019s why you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything! There was no hook-up. No goddamn taxi ride. It was all bullshit, Kate. It was Steven on the phone that day, not Stacey. I just said those things so you would think it was her.\u201d</p><p>She goes pale, and I know she believes me. \u201cWhy...why would you do that?\u201d</p><p>I blow out a breath. My voice is soft and strained. Begging her to understand.</p><p>\u201cBecause...I\u2019m in love with you. I\u2019ve been in love with you for a long time. I didn\u2019t know it until that Sunday night. And then when Billy showed up here...I thought you took him back. And it f**king crushed me. It hurt so much that I wanted to make you...feel as bad as I did.\u201d</p><p>Not my best moment, huh? Yeah, I know\u2014I\u2019m an a**hole. Believe me, I know.</p><p>\u201cSo I said those things on purpose, so you would think you were nothing to me. That you were just another girl. But you\u2019re not, Kate. You\u2019re not like anyone I\u2019ve ever known. I want to be with you...really be with you. Only you. I\u2019ve never felt this way about anyone. And I know I sound like a freaking Hallmark card, but it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve never wanted all the things I want to have when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything. She just stares at me. And I can\u2019t take it anymore. I put my hands on her shoulders, on her arms. Just to feel her.</p><p>She stiffens, but doesn\u2019t pull away. I bring my hands to her face. My thumb smoothes over her cheeks and her lips.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>Her eyes close at the contact, and the lump in my throat feels like it\u2019s strangling me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Kate, can we just...go back? Everything was so good before. It was perfect. I want us to be like that again. I want that so much.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never believed in regret. In guilt. I used to think they were just in a person\u2019s head. Like a fear of heights. Nothing you can\u2019t get past if you have the determination. The strength. But I\u2019ve never had someone\u2014hurt someone\u2014who meant more to me than...me. And to know that I messed this up because of my fear, my f**king stupidity, it\u2019s just...unbearable.</p><p>She knocks my hands away. And steps back.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Kate picks her bag up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when I first started working here? And you told me your father wanted me to put together a \u2018practice\u2019 presentation?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou said that because you didn\u2019t want me to get the client. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then the night we met with Anderson, you told me that I was shoving my tits in his face because...how did you put it? You wanted to \u2018get a rise out of me.\u2019 Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>Where\u2019s she going with this?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then last week\u2014after everything\u2014you made me believe that you were talking to that woman because you wanted to hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now, now you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re in love with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head softly. \u201cAnd why on earth should I believe you, Drew?\u201d</p><p>I stand there. Silent. Because I\u2019ve got nothing. No defense. No reasons that would make any real difference. Not to her.</p><p>She turns to leave. And I panic. \u201cKate, please wait...\u201d</p><p>I step in front of her. She stops but looks past me\u2014through me. Like I\u2019m not even here.</p><p>\u201cI know I f**ked up. Badly. The taxi-girl thing was stupid and cruel. And I\u2019m sorry. More sorry than you\u2019ll ever understand. But...you can\u2019t let that ruin what we could have.\u201d</p><p>She laughs in my face. \u201cWhat we could have? What do we have, Drew? All we\u2019ve ever had are arguments and competition and lust...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s more than that. I felt it that weekend, and I know you felt it too. What we have could be...spectacular. If you just give it a chance. Give us\u2014me\u2014one more chance. Please.\u201d</p><p>You know that song \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud to Beg\u201d by the Rolling Stones? It\u2019s my new theme song.</p><p>Her lips fold against one another. Then she moves around me.</p><p>But I grab her arm.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d And I don\u2019t just mean her arm.</p><p>She jerks away. \u201cTry harder. You did it once. I\u2019m sure you can manage it again.\u201d</p><p>Then she walks out the door.</p><p>And I don\u2019t follow her.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>OKAY. SO THAT DIDN\u2019T GO VERY WELL.</p><p>You\u2019re right\u2014it was a goddamn disaster. You think I should have gone after her? Well you\u2019re wrong. Have you ever read The Art of War by Sun Tzu? I have. It\u2019s a book about military strategy. A good general knows when to attack. A great general knows when to pull back. To regroup.</p><p>I\u2019ve told Kate what I needed to. Now I have to show her.</p><p>Actions win wars. Actions heal wounds. Not words. Words are cheap. Mine, in particular, have the combined value of pocket lint at the moment.</p><p>So...I have a plan. And failure\u2019s not an option. Because this isn\u2019t just about me, about what I want. Not anymore. It\u2019s about what Kate wants too. And she wants me. Sure, she\u2019s fighting it\u2014but it\u2019s there. Like it\u2019s always been.</p><p>No one will ever be to Kate what I can be. And\u2014before you take my head off\u2014I\u2019m not saying that because of my overdeveloped sense of confidence. I\u2019m saying it because behind the anger, under the hurt...Kate is just as in love with me as I am with her.</p><p>Looking at her was like looking in a goddamn mirror.</p><p>So I won\u2019t quit. I won\u2019t throw in the towel. Not until we both have what we want.</p><p>Each other.</p><p>Hey\u2014you know what else a great general knows how to do?</p><p>Call in the reserves.</p><p>Here\u2019s a fact for you: Most men can\u2019t multitask.</p><p>It\u2019s true.</p><p>That\u2019s why you won\u2019t catch many guys trying to make a full-course Thanksgiving dinner. That\u2019s the reason mothers all over the world come home to a disaster area when they leave their kids with the hubby for a few hours. Most of us can only really focus on one thing at a time.</p><p>Most of us\u2014but not me.</p><p>Before I\u2019m out the door of the office, I\u2019ve got Erin on the cell. No, I\u2019m not a slave driver. If you\u2019re an assistant to one of the most successful I-bankers in New York City, late-night calls are part of the job description. Now that my head has been removed from its weeklong vacation up my ass, I need to find out if I have any clients left to work with.</p><p>Lucky for me, I do.</p><p>\u201cI hope you can grow a third kidney, Drew,\u201d Erin says. \u201cBecause if Matthew, Jack, and Steven ever need one at the same time, you\u2019re going to have to hand them over.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, they\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve been covering for me while I was making that permanent dent in my couch.</p><p>\u201cBook Jack a table at Scores this weekend. On me.\u201d</p><p>Nothing says thank you like a prepaid stripper.</p><p>As for Matthew and Steven\u2014I\u2019m going to need to think about that one. I have a feeling titty bars are outlawed on the Dark Side.</p><p>After Erin updates me about work, I tell her to clear my schedule and give her a list of the things I\u2019ll need for tomorrow. I\u2019ve got a hell of a day planned\u2014but it\u2019s got nothing to do with investment banking.</p><p>By the time we hang up, I\u2019m walking through the door of my apartment. Jesus Christ. I cover my nose with my hand. How the hell did I live with that smell for seven days?</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s right\u2014I was a vegetable.</p><p>I take a good look around. Garbage bags line one wall. Empty bottles are stacked on the table. Dirty dishes fill the sink, and the air reeks like that stale scent that seeps through your car vents when you\u2019re stuck in traffic behind a garbage truck. Alexandra did her best to clean up, but it\u2019s still a disaster.</p><p>Kind of like my life at the moment, huh? How\u2019s that for symbolism.</p><p>I walk to the bedroom where I can actually breathe through my nose. I sit on the edge of the bed and stare at the phone. Remember those reserves I mentioned? Time to call them up.</p><p>I pick up the phone and dial. A soothing voice greets me after the second ring. The perfect combination of strength and comfort, and I answer back.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>You thought I was calling someone else, didn\u2019t you?</p><p>Deep down\u2014I\u2019m a momma\u2019s boy. I\u2019m man enough to admit it. And trust me, I\u2019m not the only one. Explains a lot, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s the reason your boyfriend can\u2019t manage to get his socks or underwear actually in the hamper\u2014because he grew up with mommy doing it for him. That\u2019s why your pasta sauce is good, but not great\u2014because his taste buds have been finely tuned to Mom\u2019s Sunday gravy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Plus, you know that saying \u201cMother knows best\u201d? Yes, it\u2019s annoying. But is it accurate? Abso-f**king-lutely. I\u2019ve never known my mother to be wrong. About anything. So at this moment, her opinion is my most valuable resource. I know what I think I should do to fix things with Kate, but I want confirmation that it\u2019s actually the right thing to do. This is new territory for me. And I can\u2019t afford to screw it up.</p><p>Again.</p><p>My mother starts talking about chicken soup and cold compresses. But I cut her off.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014I haven\u2019t been sick. Not like you think, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>With a sigh, I dive into the whole sordid tale. The abridged, G-rated version.</p><p>Sort of feels like confession.</p><p>After I describe the morning in my office where I screwed the pooch with Kate\u2014okay, you\u2019re right, where I pretty much f**ked the whole kennel\u2014my mother lets loose a sorrowful \u201cOh, Drew.\u201d</p><p>My stomach flips with regret and disappointment. What I wouldn\u2019t give for a time machine.</p><p>I finish the story of my downfall and go on to explain my plans to unfuck myself tomorrow. After I\u2019m done, she\u2019s quiet for a few seconds. And then she does the last thing I\u2019d expect my polite, reserved mother to do.</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re so much like your father. Sometimes I wonder if you got any of my DNA at all.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never really seen any similarities between my dad and me. Except our love of business\u2014our drive to succeed. We\u2019ve always been evenly matched in that respect. Otherwise, my father\u2019s as straight-laced as they come. A dedicated, loyal family man through and through. Pretty much the opposite of me in every way.</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still chuckling. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll tell you how your dad and I really ended up together at Columbia. And I\u2019ll include all the dirty little details he never wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>If that story involves sex in any way, I don\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>Ever.</p> <p>As far as I\u2019m concerned, my parents have had sex two times in their entire lives. Once for Alexandra and once for me. That\u2019s it. On some level I realize I\u2019m deluding myself, but this is one topic where I prefer to live in denial.</p><p>\u201cAs for you and Kate, I imagine she\u2019ll be quite...impressed with what you have planned. Eventually. At first, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019ll be livid. You should be prepared for that, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m kind of counting on it. Remember that fine line Matthew talked about?</p><p>\u201cI have to ask you though, dear\u2014are you sure? Are you absolutely positive that Kate Brooks is the young lady for you? Not just as a lover but as a friend, a companion, a partner? You need to be certain, Drew. It\u2019s wrong to toy with someone\u2019s feelings; you don\u2019t need me to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s reproach in her voice now\u2014the same tone she used when I was eight and got caught reading Alexandra\u2019s diary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a hundred percent sure. It\u2019s Kate or...nothing.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still shocked by how true this is. And, frankly, scared shitless.</p><p>I mean, even before I nailed Kate, my interest in f**king any other woman had started to fade. Drastically. And it wasn\u2019t really because they were a bad lay. It was because they weren\u2019t Kate. If, by some catastrophe, Kate won\u2019t take me back, I might as well shave my head and move to frigging Tibet.</p> <p>I hear the monks are hiring.</p><p>\u201cWell then, here\u2019s my advice: Be relentless. Unyielding. Absolutely persistent in your pursuit. If your confidence wavers at all, Kate will take that as a sign that your affection may waver as well. You\u2019ve already given her several reasons not to believe in you; don\u2019t let your insecurities give her more. Be sweet, Drew. Be honest. Act like the man I raised you to be. The man I know you are.\u201d</p><p>I smile. And just like that, I know\u2014without question\u2014that somehow, some way, I\u2019ll make this right.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m about to say goodbye, she adds, \u201cAnd for goodness\u2019 sake, as soon as you clear up this situation, I want both of you over at the house for dinner. I want to meet the woman who\u2019s got my son wrapped around her finger. She must be extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>A hundred snapshots of Kate jump into my head at once...</p><p>Kate at her desk, glasses on. All brilliance and determination. A force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Kate laughing at one of my inappropriate comments. Introducing Matthew to Dee-Dee. Helping Steven out of a jam.</p><p>Kate in my arms\u2014so f**king passionate and giving. Trusting and open. Her below me, above me, around me, matching me move for move, moan for moan.</p><p>I smile wider.</p><p>\u201cShe is, Mom. She really is.\u201d</p><p>Time for a history lesson, kids.</p><p>Back in the olden days, when two clans were at war, they would send their noblemen onto the field before a battle to try and negotiate a nonviolent resolution. If the lords could figure out a compromise, then there wouldn\u2019t be a fight. But if they couldn\u2019t reach an agreement\u2014it was on.</p><p>And I\u2019m talking old-school battle axes, flaming arrows, cannonballs-that-will-take-your-legs-off-at-the-knee kind of on.</p><p>Yes, this was a scene in Braveheart. But it\u2019s still historically accurate.</p><p>My point is, for every goal, there\u2019s two ways of reaching it: the hard way and the easy way. The men back then understood that. And so do I. Which is why I\u2019m standing outside my office building waiting to catch Kate before she walks through the door. To extend the olive branch. To work out a peaceful solution.</p><p>We\u2019ll call this my \u201ceasy way.\u201d</p><p>And here she comes. See her down the block? Apparently, I\u2019m not the only one who came to work today ready for war. Kate definitely has her armor on.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a black pantsuit and heels so high she\u2019ll be eye level with me. Her hair is twisted into a tight bun with just a few wisps caressing her face. Her chin\u2019s raised, her eyes are hard, and she\u2019s walking with fierce, purposeful strides.</p><p>Fucking magnificent.</p><p>My heartbeat speeds up, and my c*ck rises to half-mast, but I ignore it. True, it\u2019s been a freaking millennia since I\u2019ve gotten any, but I\u2019ll get into that later. Right now, my focus is completely on Kate and my next move.</p><p>I push off from the building and meet her halfway.</p><p>\u201cHi, Kate. You\u2019re looking especially edible this morning.\u201d</p><p>I smile and hold out a purple lavender flower. She doesn\u2019t take it. Instead, she brushes past me without a word.</p><p>I backtrack so I\u2019m still in front of her. \u201cMorning, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She tries to go around me, but I block her in. And I smirk.</p><p>Can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not speaking to me? You really think that\u2019s feasible considering we work together?\u201d</p><p>Her voice is flat and rehearsed, like a robot. \u201cOf course not, Mr. Evans. If you have business to discuss with me, I\u2019d be happy to converse with you. But if it\u2019s not regarding work, then I\u2019d really prefer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Evans?\u201d I don\u2019t think so. \u201cIs this like a kinky role-play thing? I\u2019m the bad boss and you\u2019re the sexy secretary?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenches, and her hand tightens on her briefcase.</p><p>\u201cOr you can be the boss, if you like. And I could be the submissive assistant who needs punishing. I could definitely get into the dominatrix thing.\u201d</p><p>She makes a disgusted sound.</p><p>And walks away.</p><p>I easily catch up to her. \u201cNo, wait, Kate. I\u2019m kidding. It was a joke. Please wait. I really do need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is sharp\u2014annoyed. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>I smile and hold out the flower again. \u201cHave dinner with me on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkles. \u201cAre you taking some kind of medication that I\u2019m not aware of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I not make myself clear last night? Why would you think I would ever consider going out with you again?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d be in a better mood this morning. That maybe after a good night\u2019s sleep you\u2019d realize that you still...like me.\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d</p><p>She takes a step. Then stops and turns back to me.</p><p>\u201cNo, on second thought\u2014do.\u201d</p><p>I keep pace beside her as she continues toward the building. I\u2019ve got two minutes here, maybe less. I talk fast.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Kate, I\u2019ve been thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill wonders never cease.\u201d</p><p>Was she always this much of a smartass?</p><p>\u201cI want to start over. Do things right this time. I want to take you out. Tell you all the things I should have said before. About how amazing I think you are. How important you are to me. Oh, and I\u2019m never going to lie to you again.\u201d</p><p>Ever.</p><p>I mean it.</p><p>Ten years from now, if Kate asks me if a certain pair of jeans makes her ass look fat\u2014and they do? I\u2019m going to take my life in my hands and say yes.</p><p>I swear.</p><p>She looks straight ahead as she answers, \u201cThanks for the offer, but no thanks. Being made to feel stupid and used really isn\u2019t high on my to-do list this week. Been there, done that. Not looking for a repeat.\u201d</p><p>I grasp her elbow gently and turn her toward me. I try to catch her eyes, but she refuses to meet mine. My voice is low. And sincere.</p><p>\u201cKate...I panicked. I got scared, and I screwed up. It\u2019ll never happen again. I learn from my mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d She looks me up and down meaningfully. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Then she walks away. And I blow out a big breath.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Hard way it is.</p><p>Why am I not surprised?</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>WHEN KATE OPENS THE DOOR to the building, I\u2019m right behind her. As soon as she crosses the threshold, the music starts.</p><p>And she stops dead in her tracks.</p><p>They\u2019re called the Three Man Band. They\u2019re traveling musicians. Literally. The lead singer\u2019s got a guitar hanging from a strap across his shoulders and a microphone attached to his chest. The drummer has a six-piece set harnessed in front\u2014like a kid in a marching band, but much cooler. The last guy has a combination base guitar and keyboard sitting on a platform at his waist.</p><p>It\u2019s really not as corny as it sounds. They\u2019re good. Like one of those cover bands that play down the Jersey shore in the summer. And they\u2019re playing \u201cCaught up in You\u201d by .38 Special.</p><p>Kate hisses at me through her teeth, \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how to play the guitar. And I can\u2019t sing. So...\u201d</p><p>I know what you\u2019re thinking. Music, Drew? That\u2019s the big plan? Didn\u2019t Billy already try that? Yes, Warren tried this strategy and failed. But this will be different.</p><p>Better.</p><p>Longer.</p><p>The Three Man Band is mobile. Which means they can\u2014and will\u2014follow Kate all day. Serenading her with not just one but dozens of carefully chosen songs. And no\u2014this isn\u2019t the whole plan. This is just the first step. There\u2019s more.</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>No she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>I slide my unclaimed flower behind her ear. \u201cListen to the words, Kate.\u201d</p><p>The singer croons about a man on his knees, who\u2019s so in love he wants to change, to be better\u2014more. For her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kate rips the flower out of her hair and drops it on the floor. Then she shoves past me toward the elevator and gets in.</p><p>And the Three Man Band crowds in around her. Still playing.</p><p>She looks horrified, doesn\u2019t she? As the doors close, I almost feel bad.</p><p>Almost.</p> <p>I take the next elevator up to the fortieth. By then, the sounds of \u201cAngel\u201d by Aerosmith fill the air. Apparently, Kate has barred the Three Man Band from her office. So they\u2019re stationed outside her closed door.</p><p>I stop at Erin\u2019s desk. She hands me my coffee.</p><p>\u201cGood song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Everything set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocked and loaded, boss.\u201d Then she snaps her fingers. \u201cOh, and I brought this for you.\u201d She hands me a medium-sized box filled with DVDs. Laying on top are Gone with the Wind, Say Anything, Beauty and the Beast, Casablanca, Titanic, and...The Notebook.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResearch. For you. I figured you might need it.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWhat would I do without you, Erin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpend the rest of your life miserable and alone?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not far off the mark.</p><p>\u201cGive yourself another week\u2019s vacation, okay?\u201d</p> <p>I take my box of goodies into my office and prepare for phase two.</p><p>Flowers. Lots of women say they don\u2019t want them. But every woman is happy when they get them.</p><p>Which is why I\u2019ve arranged to have them delivered to Kate\u2019s office, every hour on the hour. Seven dozen at a time. That\u2019s one dozen for every day we were apart.</p><p>Romantic, right? I thought so too.</p><p>And although I know Kate\u2019s favorite are white daisies, I specifically told the florist to avoid them. Instead, I\u2019ve chosen exotics\u2014bouquets with brightly colored petals and strange shapes. The kinds of flowers Kate has probably never seen in her life, from places she\u2019s never been.</p><p>Places I want to take her to.</p><p>At first I kept the notes simple and generic. Take a look:</p><p>Kate,</p> <p>I'm sorry.</p><p>Drew</p><p>Kate,</p><p>Let me make it up to you.</p><p>Drew</p><p>Kate,</p><p>I miss you. Please forgive me.</p><p>Drew.</p><p>But after a few hours I figured I needed to step it up a notch. Get more creative. What do you think?</p><p>Kate,</p><p>You're turning me into a stalker.</p><p>Drew</p><p>Kate,</p><p>Go out with me on Saturday and I'll give you all of my clients.</p><p>Every. Single. One.</p><p>Drew</p><p>Kate,</p><p>If I throw myself in front of a bus,</p><p>will you come visit me at the hospital?</p><p>Drew</p><p>PS - Try not to feel too guilty if I don't survive. Really.</p><p>That last batch was delivered forty-five minutes ago. Now I\u2019m just sitting at my desk, waiting. Waiting for what, you ask? You\u2019ll see. Kate may be stubborn, but she\u2019s not made of stone.</p><p>My office door slams open, leaving a dent in the drywall.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>\u201cYou are driving me crazy!\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks are flushed, her breathing\u2019s fast, and she\u2019s got murder in her eyes.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>I raise my brows hopefully. \u201cCrazy? Like you want to rip my shirt open again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Crazy like the itch of a yeast infection that just won\u2019t go away.\u201d</p><p>I flinch. Can\u2019t help it.</p><p>I mean\u2014Christ.</p><p>Kate steps toward my desk. \u201cI am trying to work. I need to focus. And you\u2019ve got Manny, Moe, and Jack playing every cheesy eighties song ever written outside my office door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheesy? Really? Huh. I so had you pegged for an eighties kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Well, you live and learn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Drew. This is a place of business; I can\u2019t be the only one this noise is bothering.\u201d</p><p>Good. We\u2019re back to Drew. Progress.</p><p>And as far as disturbing the rest of the staff? I thought of that. I spoke with most of the people on this floor and gave them a heads-up about the entertainment for the day. They didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious too, Kate. You shouldn\u2019t be working. You should be listening. I chose this playlist myself. It\u2019s my grand gesture. To show you how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about how you feel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s harsh.\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms, and her foot taps on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t want to do this, but you\u2019ve left me no choice. You\u2019re obviously too immature to handle this like an adult. So...I\u2019m going to tell your father.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>She\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to tell Daddy on me, but I\u2019m being immature.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>And I thought of that already too. \u201cMy father\u2019s in California for the next two weeks. I\u2019m not overly concerned about what he might do to me via telephone.\u201d She opens her mouth to try again, but I continue. \u201cYou could try talking to Frank. But he\u2019s in the Hamptons, at that year-round golf course Trump just opened. George is in his office.\u201d She turns, but my next words make her pause. \u201cI should warn you, though...he\u2019s got a real soft spot for romantics. I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up if I were you. And he\u2019s my godfather.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me a minute. She\u2019s trying to think of a comeback. I\u2019m just glad I cleared all the heavy objects off my desk.</p><p>You know, the ones she probably wants to chuck at my head right about now.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this. This is sexual harassment.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and lean across my desk. \u201cSue me.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opens to spew what I\u2019m sure will be a tirade of volcanic proportions. But I cut her off. And my voice is calm. Rational.</p><p>\u201cOr, you can save yourself the trouble and just go out with me on Saturday. One date. One night, and all this goes away. After that, if you still don\u2019t want to have anything to do with me, I\u2019ll leave you alone. Scout\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>Technically, this isn\u2019t a lie. We\u2019ve already established Boy Scouting was not my thing. Loopholes, remember?</p><p>Her face contorts into a mask of disgust. \u201cAbsolutely not. I won\u2019t be blackmailed into going out with you.\u201d</p><p>I sit back down. \u201cThat is the strong choice. The feminist, I-am-woman-hear-me-roar decision. I\u2019m proud of you, Kate.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow suspiciously.</p><p>Smart girl.</p><p>\u201cPlus, I can\u2019t wait for you to see what I have planned for tomorrow. I wouldn\u2019t schedule any meetings, though. Might be too loud.\u201d</p><p>Her voice rises with every word. Like thunder from a storm that\u2019s moving closer. \u201cYou are a manipulative, childish, vindictive bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be.\u201d</p><p>She makes her way around my desk, and I stand up to meet her.</p><p>\u201cA selfish, self-centered, egotistical son of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She hits me on the chest with both fists.</p><p>Whack.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d never seen you at that stupid club!\u201d</p><p>Whack.</p><p>\u201cI wish I never got this job!\u201d</p><p>Whack.</p><p>\u201cI wish I never met you!\u201d</p><p>I grip her wrists and pull her close.</p><p>Now here\u2019s when we usually start kissing.</p><p>Were you looking forward to that part? Sorry. Not gonna happen. Because this isn\u2019t just about me and my raging hard-on. Not anymore. And I have to prove that to Kate.</p><p>So I hold back. But don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy, \u2019cause it\u2019s not. There\u2019s nothing I want more than to mold my mouth to hers and remind her of how good it was between us. How good it can still be.</p><p>I lean in and rest my forehead against hers. She closes her eyes. I brush my nose against hers and inhale, needing a fix. She smells even better than I remember. Like warm cookies in the Garden of f**king Eden.</p><p>And then I whisper, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you. I didn\u2019t mean any of it. Not a single goddamn word. Please believe that.\u201d</p><p>Kate opens her eyes. There\u2019s surprise in those brown beauties. And fear, like a deer that just caught a hunter\u2019s scent. Because she wants to believe me. And she knows I know that.</p><p>Then she blinks. And her eyes go hard. It\u2019s difficult to tell if she\u2019s more pissed at me or herself.</p><p>Probably me.</p><p>She shoves my chest, and I fall back into my chair.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>She stalks back around my desk toward the door.</p><p>\u201cHere? Now?\u201d I look up at the ceiling, like I\u2019m debating the prospect. \u201cWell...okay. But be gentle. My couch is a virgin.\u201d</p><p>I loosen my tie and start to unbutton my shirt.</p><p>She stutters. Then she points her finger at me and practically growls.</p><p>Yeah\u2014it\u2019s f**king hot.</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d Then she walks out of my office. She stops in front of the Three Man Band, who\u2019ve been waiting outside. \u201cAnd don\u2019t follow me!\u201d</p><p>As she disappears down the hall, the lead singer looks at me.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>And they follow in Kate\u2019s footsteps, belting out \u201cHeat of the Moment\u201d by Asia.</p><p>Hey\u2014what\u2019s wrong? You look worried. Don\u2019t be. I know what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s all part of the plan.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>I BET YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW THIS, but lots of guys have a thing for Ariel. You know, from The Little Mermaid? I\u2019ve never been into her myself, but I can understand the attraction: she fills out her shells nicely, she\u2019s a redhead, and she spends most of the movie unable to speak.</p><p>In light of this, I\u2019m not too disturbed about the semi I\u2019m sporting while watching Beauty and the Beast\u2014part of the homework Erin gave me. I like Belle. She\u2019s hot. Well...for a cartoon, anyway. She reminds me of Kate. She\u2019s resourceful. Smart. And she doesn\u2019t take any shit from the Beast or that douchebag with the freakishly large arms.</p><p>I stare at the television as Belle bends over to feed a bird. Then I lean forward, hoping for a nice cl**vage shot...</p><p>I\u2019m going to hell, aren\u2019t I?</p><p>I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m desperate. Frustrated.</p><p>Horny.</p><p>I said I\u2019d get to this later, remember? Well, it\u2019s later. I feel like a shaken can of soda that\u2019s about to explode. I know my previous record is twelve days\u2014but this is different.</p><p>Worse.</p><p>I\u2019ve gone cold turkey. Completely. I haven\u2019t even jerked off. Not once. In nine frigging days. I think the buildup of sem*n is starting to affect my brain. Like sugar to a diabetic.</p><p>Why haven\u2019t I used the hand God gave me, you ask?</p><p>It\u2019s a new rule. My own self-imposed penance for my stupidity. I refuse to come until Kate comes with me. Seemed like a good idea yesterday. But after seeing her today, I\u2019m pretty sure the wait is going to kill me.</p><p>Don\u2019t roll your eyes.</p><p>You don\u2019t understand. Unless you\u2019re a guy, you can\u2019t. You have no idea how important regular sexual gratification is for us. It\u2019s crucial. Vital.</p><p>I\u2019ll explain.</p><p>In 2004, UCLA conducted a survey to determine how highly women valued getting off in relation to other daily activities. You know what they found? Eight in ten\u2014that\u2019s eighty percent\u2014said if given the choice between sex or sleep, they would choose sleep.</p><p>In that same year, NYU conducted its own study. With rats. They implanted electrodes in the brains of male rats and put two buttons in their cages. When the lucky little bastards pushed the blue button, the electrodes triggered an orgasm.

Then I pick up the phone and dial.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Her voice is sleepy. Husky.</p><p>\u201cHi, Kate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrew? How...how did you get my home number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked in your personnel file.\u201d</p><p>Yes, those things are supposed to be confidential, but I called in a favor. I play to win. Never said I play fair.</p><p>I lie back on the couch while images of Kate in bed dance in my head.</p><p>\u201cSo...what are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>Click.</p> <p>That went well.</p><p>I dial again.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were thinking about me before I called, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Click.</p><p>I smile. And dial again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in case you\u2019re wondering, I still have them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou still have what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour underwear. The black lace ones. They\u2019re in my drawer. Sometimes I sleep with them under my pillow.\u201d</p><p>Sick? Possibly.</p><p>\u201cYou keep trophies from all your victims? How very serial killer-ish of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not from all of them. Just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to be flattered? Nauseated is more like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping we could add another one to the collection.\u201d</p><p>Click.</p><p>Now this is just getting ridiculous.</p><p>I dial again.</p><p>\u201cWhat. Do. You. Want?\u201d</p><p>You.</p><p>And me.</p><p>Stranded on a luxurious deserted island for about a week.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up. I\u2019ll just keep calling back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take the phone off the hook.\u201d</p><p>The challenge in her voice brings my semi full throttle. Did I say a week? I meant a month.</p><p>At least.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll come over. I\u2019ll plant myself outside your door and talk through it. It won\u2019t make you very popular with the neighbors.\u201d</p><p>For a few seconds, she doesn\u2019t speak. It\u2019s after midnight. She\u2019s probably wondering if I\u2019m serious.</p><p>I am.</p><p>Then she huffs, \u201cFine. I\u2019ll stay on the phone. Do you actually have a reason for calling, or do you just want to annoy me\u2014more?\u201d</p><p>I tell her the bare, honest truth. \u201cI just wanted to hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>Not too long ago, I could stop by Kate\u2019s office whenever I wanted. I could talk to her. Look at her. Listen to her.</p><p>I miss that. A lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWorking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Kind of. What are you working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA proposal for a new client. Jeffrey Davies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe millionaire? Isn\u2019t he...like, crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very eccentric, yes.\u201d</p><p>I heard he\u2019s a f**king nutcase. Like one of those Trekkie fanatics who know the Klingon language or surgically alter their ears to look like Mr. Spock.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he interested in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnology. Life-prolonging scientific research, to be exact.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is comfortable now. Normal. Almost friendly.</p><p>\u201cI have some contacts in cryogenics. I could hook you up. We should discuss it over dinner on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to bribe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer breakfast? Lunch works for me too.\u201d</p><p>At this point, I\u2019d settle for a light midday snack.</p><p>She snorts. It\u2019s not a laugh, but it\u2019s close. \u201cLet it go, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I smirk even though she can\u2019t see it. \u201cNot going to happen. I can keep this up forever. I have amazing stamina\u2014but then you already know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to hang up again?\u201d</p><p>I whine, \u201cNo. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my side. My apartment is dim and still. It feels...intimate. Like one of those late-night conversations you had in high school under the covers because you weren\u2019t supposed to still be on the phone.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a smile in her voice when she answers. \u201cMy mom\u2019s coming to visit. Dee-Dee\u2019s is too, so we\u2019re all going out together for Christmas dinner. And then my lease is up next month, so I plan on doing some apartment hunting while Mom\u2019s here. I\u2019m hoping New York will impress her. Maybe I\u2019ll find a place that will entice her to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Warren? Is he still staying with Delores?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t want any sneak attacks, now do we?</p><p>The edge is back in her tone as she tells me, \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but Billy moved to LA three days ago.\u201d</p><p>Well, doesn\u2019t that just make me want to stand up and do the happy dance on my dining room table?</p><p>\u201cDo you guys still...talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to email me once he\u2019s settled. Let me know how things are going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate...what happened between you two, that day in your office?\u201d</p><p>I should have had the balls to listen to her that day. I should have asked her this question then. At the time I thought it\u2019d be easier to pretend I didn\u2019t care than to hear her say she didn\u2019t.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>She sounds sad when she answers. And weary. \u201cWe talked, Drew. I told him that I loved him, that a part of me always would. I said that I knew he loved me too. But that we weren\u2019t...in love anymore. Not the way we were supposed to be...not for a long time. It took a while, but eventually Billy agreed with me. And\u2014\u201d she blows out an annoyed breath \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m telling you any of this.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet for a moment. And then I just can\u2019t help myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s silent. She doesn\u2019t respond at all.</p><p>And my chest tightens because I know why.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re an excellent liar when you want to be, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. So this is what it feels like to sleep in the bed you made, huh? It sucks.</p><p>But my voice is firm. Determined and un-f**king-wavering. \u201cI\u2019m not lying to you now, Kate. But it\u2019s okay. Do what you need to do. Curse me out, slap me around\u2014get it all out of your system. I can take it. Because the more you push me away, the harder I\u2019m going to fight to prove to you that this is real. That I\u2019m not going anywhere and that what I feel for you isn\u2019t going to change. And then someday\u2014maybe not any time soon, but one day\u2014I\u2019m going to tell you that you, Kate Brooks, are the love of my life, and you won\u2019t have any doubt that it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>After a minute, Kate clears her throat. \u201cI should go. It\u2019s late. And I have a lot of work to finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Okay. Me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cIt could have been. But you\u2019re across town.\u201d</p><p>She laughs then. It\u2019s quick and muffled, but it\u2019s genuine. And I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the best sound I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams, Kate. You know, the ones with you and me in them. Naked.\u201d</p><p>Click.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>THE MOST IMPORTANT GAME in a rookie pitcher\u2019s career isn\u2019t his debut. It\u2019s his follow-up. The second showing. He has to prove that he\u2019s consistent. Reliable.</p><p>Today is my follow-up game. The day I show Kate she\u2019s not getting rid of me and that I\u2019m one hell of a clutch player. I\u2019ve started with something simple. Elegant. Something less in-your-face than the Three Man Band. After all, you don\u2019t always need to drop a nuke to win the war.</p><p>I had Kate\u2019s office filled with balloons.</p><p>A thousand of them.</p><p>Each printed with I\u2019M SORRY.</p><p>Too much? I don\u2019t think so either.</p><p>Then I had a little something delivered to her office. From Tiffany\u2019s. A small blue box with a note:</p><p>You already own mine.</p><p>Drew</p><p>Inside the box, on a platinum chain, is a flawless two-carat diamond heart.</p><p>Sappy? Sure it is. But women love sappy shit like that. At least according to the films I stayed up until three o\u2019clock in the goddamn morning watching they do.</p><p>I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll knock Kate off her feet. Right onto her back\u2014and I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to tell you how much I like her in that position.</p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>Kind of.</p><p>Besides, I get the feeling Kate isn\u2019t used to getting presents, at least not of that caliber. And she should be. She deserves to be spoiled. To have nice things. Beautiful things. Things her dipshit ex-boyfriend couldn\u2019t afford and probably wouldn\u2019t have thought to give her.</p><p>Things I can. And will.</p><p>I wanted to be there when she opened it. To see the look on her face. But I have a meeting.</p><p>\u201cAndrew Evans. Still as handsome as the devil himself. How are you, m\u2019boy?\u201d</p><p>See that woman hugging me in my office? Yes, the auburn-haired, blue-eyed lady who\u2019s still a knockout, even in her fifties? She used to be my sixth grade teacher. Back then, her skin was as smooth and creamy as her Irish brogue. And she had a body that begged for sin. Lots and lots of sin.</p><p>She was my first crush. The first woman I ever masturbated about. My first Mrs. Robinson-like, older-woman fantasy.</p><p>Sister Mary Beatrice Dugan.</p><p>Yep, you heard me right\u2014she\u2019s a nun. But not just any nun, kiddies. Sister Beatrice was a NILF. I don\u2019t need to spell that one out for you, do I?</p><p>In those days, she was the youngest nun any of us had ever laid eyes on\u2014unlike the bitter, black-robed hags who looked like they were old enough to have actually been around when Jesus was alive. The fact that she was a woman of the cloth\u2014forbidden\u2014and in a position of power over us naughty Catholic boys just made it all that much more erotic.</p><p>She could\u2019ve spanked me with a ruler anytime.</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t the only one who thought so. Just ask Matthew.</p><p>When we were thirteen, Estelle noticed Matthew was wincing when he walked. She dragged him bitching and moaning to the doctor\u2019s, where he was promptly diagnosed with CPS.</p><p>Chafed Penis Syndrome.</p><p>The doc told Estelle the condition had been caused by leaving wet swim trunks on too long. And she believed him. Even though it was November. Matthew\u2019s dick was raw all right, but it wasn\u2019t because of a f**king bathing suit.</p><p>It was because of Sister Beatrice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as stunning as ever, Sister B. You decide to leave the order yet?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t go to church. Not anymore. I\u2019m a lot of things, but a hypocrite really isn\u2019t one of them. If you\u2019re not going to play by the rules, you don\u2019t show up for team meetings. Over the years, however, I\u2019ve kept in touch with Sister Beatrice. She\u2019s the principle at St. Mary\u2019s now, and my family has always donated generously.</p><p>She taps my face. \u201cCheeky boy.\u201d</p><p>I wink. \u201cCome on, Sister, be fair. God\u2019s had you for, what? Thirty years? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you gave the rest of us a shot?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and grins. \u201cAh, Andrew, yer charms would tempt the virtue of a saint.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hand her a cup of tea, and we sit down on my unadulterated couch.</p><p>\u201cI was surprised by yer phone call. And more \u2019an a bit curious. What hole \u2019ave you dug yerself into, m\u2019boy?\u201d</p><p>I called her yesterday. And told her I needed her help.</p><p>\u201cI have a friend I\u2019d like you to speak with.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes twinkle. \u201cWould this be a lady friend, now?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cYes. Katherine Brooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were the one kissin\u2019 the lasses and makin\u2019 \u2019em cry. And about what would you be liking me to talk to Miss Katherine about? You haven\u2019t gotten her in the family way, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, no.\u201d</p><p>She raises a stern brow at me.</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>She nods, and I go on. \u201cI was hoping you could talk to her about...forgiveness. Second chances. Redemption.\u201d</p><p>She takes a sip of tea and looks thoughtful. \u201c\u2018To err is human; to forgive, divine.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Exactly. I thought about sending Matthew or Steven to plead my case. But they\u2019re too biased. Kate would never buy it. And before you ask\u2014no\u2014I would never send The Bitch. Too risky. When it comes to persuasion, my sister\u2019s kind of like a pet lion. Sweet and playful one minute, but if you make the wrong move? She\u2019ll rip your frigging face off.</p><p>Sister Beatrice is a religious woman. Kind. Honest. If anyone can convince Kate that men\u2014that I\u2014am capable of changing, it\u2019s her. The fact that she adores me almost as much as the woman who gave birth to me doesn\u2019t hurt either.</p><p>\u201cAnd who might the young lady be needing to forgive?\u201d</p> <p>I raise my hand. \u201cThat would be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlayed the cad, did you?\u201d</p><p>I shrug in the affirmative. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been trying everything I can think of since to make up for it\u2014short of tattooing her name on my ass and streaking across Yankee Stadium.\u201d</p><p>I was saving that for next week.</p><p>\u201cMen often want what they can no longer have, Andrew. I like to think that you are not that type of man. So if I speak to the young lady and convince her to trust you with her heart again, what are you intendin\u2019 to do with it?\u201d</p><p>I look into her cerulean eyes. And speak without a trace of doubt:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cherish it. I\u2019ll do anything I have to to make her happy. For as long as she\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spreads across Sister Beatrice\u2019s face. \u201cAnd they say miracles don\u2019t happen anymore.\u201d She sets her cup aside and stands up. \u201cIt appears I have the Lord\u2019s work to do. Where are you hidin\u2019 the dear girl? Is she expectin\u2019 me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI took the liberty of speaking with Kate\u2019s secretary. She\u2019s expecting someone. She just doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019ll ruffle her feathers a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But she won\u2019t take it out on you. She\u2019ll save all her feathers for me.\u201d</p><p>We make our way to the door.</p><p>\u201cHave you tried praying, Andrew? Prayer is a powerful thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your prayers are a little more powerful than mine these days.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and touches my cheek like a mother would.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all sinners, m\u2019boy. Some of us just enjoy it more than others.\u201d</p><p>I laugh as I open the door.</p><p>And then the smile slides off my face as I stare at Erin\u2019s back. She\u2019s standing in front of my office with her arms out. Blocking it. From the woman in front of her.</p><p>Who just happens to be Delores Warren.</p><p>After Erin escorts Sister B to Kate\u2019s office, I turn toward Delores. She\u2019s wearing a black bustier, tight leather pants, and red stiletto heels. If this is what she wears to work, I can\u2019t f**king imagine what she wears in the bedroom. Must be interesting.</p><p>Steven walks up to us, his eyes on the retreating forms down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWas that Sister Beatrice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He nods appreciatively. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>See? NILF. Told you.</p><p>He smiles evilly at Delores. \u201cHey, Dee, did Matthew tell you about Sister B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of. He introduced us at church last week.\u201d</p><p>Unlike me, Matthew still attends church regularly. He likes to keep his bases covered, just in case.</p><p>Steven smiles wider. Like a toddler who\u2019s about to tattle on a sibling.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you about CPS?\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkles. \u201cWhat\u2019s CPS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Matthew. He\u2019ll tell you. He\u2019s kind of an expert on it.\u201d He nudges me with an elbow. \u201cAlexandra and Mackenzie are coming by later. You want to join us for lunch?\u201d</p><p>I scratch behind my ear. \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got a meeting...with a guy...about a thing.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s a skywriter. He\u2019s supposed to fly over the building at four. I just need to work out what he\u2019s going to write. But I don\u2019t want Delores to know. Can\u2019t have her warning Kate ahead of time.</p><p>Steven nods. \u201cAll right. Later.\u201d</p><p>I look Delores in the eyes. And flash her one of my classic smiles.</p><p>She just glares back.</p><p>I must be losing my touch.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>There are only a few reasons why Delores Warren would want to talk to me at this point in my life. None of them are pleasant.</p><p>I motion toward my office. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>This is how it must feel to invite a vampire into your house.</p><p>I sit down behind my desk. She stands.</p><p>You ever watch Animal Planet? Women are kind of like a herd of elephants. They stick together for protection. And if one senses danger? They all stampede.</p><p>I need to play this carefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Delores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-castration would be great. But I\u2019ll settle for a flying leap off a bridge. I hear the Brooklyn is nice this time of year.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah\u2014this is going to be fun.</p><p>\u201cBesides that.\u201d</p><p>She braces her hands on my desk and leans over, like a snake getting ready to strike. \u201cYou can stop f**king with my best friend\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>Not a problem. Kate\u2019s head isn\u2019t the body part I\u2019m looking to f**k at the moment. Think I should tell her that? Probably not.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about last week, when you treated her like a used condom. And now, all of a sudden, you\u2019re all flowers and music and love notes.\u201d</p><p>Heard about those, did she? That\u2019s a good sign.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re either a split personality\u2014caused by the raging syphilis coursing through your bloodstream\u2014or you\u2019ve got an itch for a good challenge. In either case, move along, jerk-off. Kate isn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not into challenges. When Kate blew me off that first night at REM, did I chase her? No, I went with the sure thing. The easy out.</p><p>Or in that particular case\u2014the double play.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not bullshit each other here. We both know Kate is very interested. You wouldn\u2019t be so eager to rip into me if she wasn\u2019t. As for the rest of your concerns, I don\u2019t do head games. And there\u2019s a line of women around the block willing to scratch any itch I can think of. This isn\u2019t about getting laid.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward on my desk. And my tone is straightforward and persuasive, like she\u2019s a client on the fence. One I need to sway to my side. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, my feelings for Kate caught me off guard and at first, I handled things badly. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing all this\u2014to show her that I care about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou care about your dick.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t really argue with that.</p><p>She sits down across from me. \u201cKate and I are like sisters. Closer even. She\u2019s not a one-night-stand kind of girl\u2014she never was. She\u2019s a relationship kind. It\u2019s very important to me that she\u2019s with someone who treats her right. A man.\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t agree more. Most guys would sacrifice a limb for some juicy girl-on-girl action. It\u2019s a turn-on\u2014big time. But when it comes to Kate? I don\u2019t plan on sharing. With either sex.</p><p>\u201cLast time I checked, that\u2019s what I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re a dog. She needs a good man. A nice man.\u201d</p><p>Good guys are boring. You need a little bad to keep things fun. And nice guys? Nice guys have something to hide.</p><p>Jeffrey Dahmer\u2019s neighbors thought he was a nice guy. Until they found those heads in his freezer.</p><p>She crosses her arms, and her voice turns triumphant. Gloating. \u201cAnd I know someone who\u2019s perfect for her. He works in my lab. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s funny. His name is Bert.\u201d</p><p>Bert?</p><p>Is she f**king kidding me? What kind of sick son of a bitch names his kid Bert in this day and age? That\u2019s just cruel.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll show Kate a good time. I plan on setting them up this weekend.\u201d</p><p>And I plan on handcuffing myself to Kate\u2019s ankle and eating the key. Let\u2019s see what kind of good time Bert can show Kate when she\u2019s dragging me around behind her like a Siamese twin.</p><p>\u201cI have a better idea. How about we double. You and Matthew, me and Kate. We\u2019ll hang out. It\u2019ll give me the chance to show you how perfect Kate and I are for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you sound like a stalker. You had your chance, you f**ked up, get over it. Pick some other number out of your little black book and leave Kate alone.\u201d</p><p>I stand up. \u201cContrary to what you think you know, I\u2019m not some serial scumbag. I don\u2019t lead women on\u2014I don\u2019t need to. You want me to tell Kate I\u2019m sorry? I have. You want a guarantee that I\u2019ll never hurt her again? I can write you one, and I\u2019ll sign it in blood if it makes you happy. But don\u2019t ask me to leave her alone, because I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move. Her face is as still and hard as a pissed-off statue. And my argument is making about as much of a dent as a goddamn toothpick.</p><p>\u201cDid Matthew tell you what I was like? Do I look like the type of guy who goes catatonic over just any woman? God, Delores, I f**king worship her.\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cToday. You worship her today. But what happens if she gives in? When the novelty wears off and the sex gets old? And some new bitch in heat crosses your path and wants you to sniff her ass?\u201d</p><p>Sex doesn\u2019t get old. Not if you\u2019re doing it right.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else. And I don\u2019t see that changing any time...ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re full of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do. If you dicked Matthew around the way I did with Kate, I\u2019d pretty much write you off too. But what you think doesn\u2019t change what Kate wants. And deep down, even if she won\u2019t admit it yet, that\u2019s me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you be any more full of yourself? You may have money, but it can\u2019t buy you class. Or integrity. You\u2019re not even close to good enough for Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you think your cousin is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Billy\u2019s an immature jackass, and that relationship was going nowhere fast for a long time. Over the years I tried to tell her. To make her see that she and their relationship had become more about friendship than real love. But by then our lives, our families, were so intertwined, I think they were both afraid of rocking the boat and losing more than just each other. But he did\u2014does love her. I\u2019m sure of that. He\u2019s just always loved his guitar more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She starts to pace in front on my desk. Like a professor in a lecture hall.</p><p>\u201cSee, Drew, there are three kinds of males in this world: boys, guys, and men. Boys\u2014like Billy\u2014never grow up, never get serious. They only care about themselves, their music, their cars. Guys\u2014like you\u2014are all about numbers and variety. Like an assembly line, it\u2019s just one one-night stand after another. Then there are men\u2014like Matthew. They\u2019re not perfect, but they appreciate women for more than their flexibility and mouth suction.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not wrong. You should listen to her.</p><p>The only part she doesn\u2019t get, though, is that sometimes a guy can\u2019t become a man until he\u2019s met the right woman.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make that call. You barely know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know you. Believe me. I was conceived by a guy just like you.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Daddy issues. They\u2019re the worst.</p><p>\u201cKate and I look out for each other,\u201d she goes on. \u201cWe always have. And I\u2019m not going to let her be another notch on your STD-coated bedpost.\u201d</p><p>You ever bang your head against a wall?</p> <p>No?</p><p>Watch closely. This is what it looks like.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you! What f**king language would you like to hear it in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you speak anything besides Asshole?\u201d</p><p>I pinch the bridge of my nose. I feel an aneurism coming on.</p><p>\u201cOkay, look\u2014you don\u2019t trust me? Fine. Talk to Matthew. You trust him, right? He wouldn\u2019t want me screwing around with his girlfriend\u2019s best friend if I wasn\u2019t playing for keeps.\u201d</p> <p>She waves her hand in the air. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t prove anything. Penises stick together.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.</p><p>I scrub my hand down my face. Then I take a deep, calming breath. Time to lay it on the line. Put my cards on the table. Throw the Hail Mary pass.</p><p>I walk to the window, gathering my thoughts as I watch the traffic far below. I\u2019m still looking at it as I tell her, \u201cYou know what I saw yesterday when I was coming to work? I saw a pregnant woman, getting a cab...\u201d</p><p>I used to think pregnant women were kind of grotesque. Deformed. You should have seen Alexandra. When she was knocked up with Mackenzie, she looked like she\u2019d eaten Humpty Dumpty for breakfast. And the way she was chowing down at the time, she totally could have.</p><p>\u201c...and all I could think about was how adorable Kate would look pregnant. And about how I wanted to do things for her. Like...if she gets sick, I want to be the guy making her tea and bringing her tissues. I want to know how she got that small scar on her chin and if she\u2019s afraid of spiders...and what she dreams about at night. Everything. It\u2019s f**king insane\u2014don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that. It\u2019s never happened to me before. And I don\u2019t want it to ever happen again\u2014with anybody else. Just Kate.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head from the window and look her in the eyes.</p><p>If you\u2019re ever in the woods and come face to face with a pissed-off momma bear, it\u2019s always better to look her in the eyes. Run away? She\u2019ll feed you to the cubs. One arm at a time. But if you stand your ground, you just might make it out alive.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to hear that Kate has me whipped? \u2019Cause she does. She\u2019s got me on my knees and under her thumb, and I don\u2019t want to get out.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet after that. Delores just stares at me. For a while. Searching my face for...something. I\u2019m not exactly sure what it is, but I know the moment she finds it. Because something shifts in her eyes. They become softer. Just a little. And her shoulders relax. And then she nods.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>Some battles don\u2019t have a winner. Sometimes the best a good general can hope for is a ceasefire.</p><p>\u201cKate makes her own choices,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if those choices turn out to be rotten, then I\u2019ll help her clean up the mess. Because that\u2019s what best friends do\u2014help bury the body.\u201d</p><p>She stands up. Walks a few steps to the door. Then she stops, and spins around with her finger pointing in my direction.</p><p>\u201cYou just remember one thing, buddy. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s ten days down the road or ten years, I\u2019ll be watching you. And if I ever find out that you\u2019ve f**ked her over? I\u2019ll make you sorry. And I work in a lab, Drew. With chemicals. Odorless, tasteless chemicals that can permanently shrink your nuts so small, you\u2019ll have to start calling yourself Drewsilla. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Matthew is out of his f**king mind. Delores Warren is scary. Definite psycho-bitch potential. She and Alexandra should totally hang out.</p><p>And she\u2019s put way too much thought into that little plan for my liking.</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cCrystal.\u201d</p><p>She nods again. \u201cGlad we understand each other.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she breezes out of my office. And I collapse back into my chair and stare at the ceiling.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>This relationship shit is exhausting. I feel like I just ran a marathon. With hurdles.</p><p>But you know what? I\u2019m pretty sure the finish line\u2019s in sight.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>AFTER DELORES LEAVES, I pick up my briefcase and head out the door. To my meeting with the skywriter. I still have to figure out how to get Kate on the roof. Speaking of Kate...</p><p>Want to swing by her office on the way out? See how her and the good Sister are getting along?</p><p>Her door\u2019s open. I brace my hands on the frame and lean in. Can you see her through the balloons? Sitting at her desk, with her hands folded on top\u2014a smile stuck on her face as she nods obediently to whatever Sister Beatrice is saying.</p><p>\u201cLadies. How are we doing this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Kate turns to me. And her voice is strained. \u201cDrew. There you are. I was just thinking about you\u201d\u2014from the way she\u2019s gripping her hands together, it looks like she was thinking about strangling me\u2014\u201cwhile Sister Beatrice here was telling me the fascinating tale of glass houses. And how those of us who live in them shouldn\u2019t throw stones.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still smiling. But her eyes say something else entirely.</p><p>It\u2019s a little creepy.</p><p>You know in Texas Chainsaw Massacre when the old man smiles just before he slits the girl\u2019s throat? Yeah\u2014it\u2019s kind of like that.</p><p>Sister Beatrice looks at the ceiling. \u201cWe are all imperfect in the eyes of the Lord. Katherine, may I use yer facilities, dear? Nature is calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sister.\u201d They stand, and Kate opens the door to her adjoining washroom.</p><p>And as soon as that door closes, Smiley Kate goes bye-bye. Mad Kate takes her place. She marches toward me.</p><p>And the balloons run for their lives.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you this one time, and if you lie to me, I swear I\u2019ll let Delores poison you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she a real nun? Or some actress you hired?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. I didn\u2019t even think of that. \u201cNo, she\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>Kate is not pleased. \u201cGod, Drew! A nun? A f**king nun? This is low. Even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s technically a Mother Superior now.\u201d</p><p>I lean in closer to Kate because...well, just because I can...and the smell of her lotion hits me. Hard. I resist the urge to put my nose against her skin and sniff like a coc**ne addict.</p><p>\u201cIs there any level you won\u2019t sink to to get your way?\u201d</p><p>Nope. Sorry. Not a one. I don\u2019t mind getting down and dirty.</p><p>Actually, I prefer it that way.</p><p>\u201cDesperate times...I had to call out the big guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to see guns? As soon as the Flying Nun leaves my office, I\u2019ll show you guns! I can\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>God, she\u2019s beautiful. I mean, look at her. She\u2019s like a volcano going off\u2014fierce and fiery and breathtaking. If she doesn\u2019t find a way to ugly herself down, I\u2019m going to be spending an awful lot of time pissing her off.</p><p>Which might not be such a bad thing in the end. Angry sex is awesome.</p><p>I cut off Kate\u2019s rant. \u201cAs titillating as this conversation has been\u2014and believe me, it\u2019s been very\u2014I have a meeting to get to.\u201d</p><p>Before I go, I motion toward her bare neck. \u201cHey, why aren\u2019t you wearing your necklace?\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms and smiles proudly. \u201cI donated it to Sister Beatrice. For the less fortunate.\u201d</p><p>Played that one well, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>I can play too.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very generous. Of course, I\u2019ll have to replace it for you. With something...bigger. You should expect another delivery tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her smile turns upside down. And she smacks a rogue balloon out of the way.</p><p>Then she slams the door in my face.</p><p>I wait two seconds before calling through it, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you later, Kate. Good talk.\u201d</p><p>From inside, I hear Sister Beatrice\u2019s voice: \u201cDid Andrew leave already? Such a sweet boy he is. And devoted too, when he sets his heart to a task. Let me tell you about the time he weeded the convent\u2019s garden. It\u2019s a long story, but we \u2019ave all afternoon. There was a scuffle in the lunch room, you see...\u201d</p><p>Traffic was a bitch and a half. Both ways. But I worked out the particulars with the skywriter. He was suiting up when I left. I now have just enough time to get to Kate\u2019s office and get her to the roof. If she won\u2019t come willingly, I\u2019m just going to pick her up and carry her. Although I\u2019d feel a lot better about the idea if I had a cup on.</p><p>Kate is definitely a kicker.</p><p>I sprint through the lobby and push the button for the elevator. But what I see when the doors open stops me cold.</p><p>It\u2019s The Bitch, with Mackenzie at her side. And in my niece\u2019s perfect little hands are strings. A dozen of them. Strings that are tied to balloons. Kate\u2019s balloons.</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a nice way to greet your doting sister and her daughter.\u201d</p><p>Had I said that out loud? Doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Fuck f**k fuckity fuck.</p><p>This is bad\u2014very bad. Like an F-five tornado kind of bad, except my sister is capable of leaving more damage behind.</p><p>\u201cHi, Uncle Drew!\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cHi, sweetheart.\u201d Then I scowl. \u201cWhat the hell did you do, Alexandra?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen innocently. Like she\u2019s surprised. \u201cMe? I came to meet my husband for lunch. Is that a crime?\u201d</p><p>When I was in junior high, a kid named Chris Whittle sucker punched me when I was coming out of trigonometry. I had hooked up with his girlfriend. She had talented hands.</p><p>Anyway, the next day, Alexandra paid Chris a little visit\u2014and made him piss his pants.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>See, according to The Bitch Code, she can f**k with me all she wants to, but no one else is allowed. Now do you see why I\u2019m concerned?</p><p>\u201cYou went to see Kate, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie answers for her, \u201cWe did, Uncle Drew! She\u2019s great. Kate gave me dees balloons and a calculator! See?\u201d She holds it over her head like it\u2019s the Stanley Cup, and I can\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrific, Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>Then I glare at Alexandra again.</p><p>She\u2019s not concerned. \u201cYou said you wanted Mackenzie to meet Kate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If you put two pregnant hamsters in the same cage, you know what they\u2019ll do?

I didn\u2019t want you meeting Kate until I was done smoothing things the hell over.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie takes my friend the Bad Word Jar out of her backpack and holds it up. I put two dollars in.</p><p>She sticks her face in the mouth of the jar and looks up at me with a frown. \u201cUm...Uncle Drew? Bad words no cost one dollar no more. They cost ten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTen? Since when?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s excited. \u201cIt was Kate\u2019s idea.

I pay my fine in cash. \u201cHow about you add up the rest on your calculator, honey?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s going to need it. I have a feeling this little discussion is going to put me in the triple digits.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you say to Kate?\u201d I ask Alexandra.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cWe talked, one woman to another. I appealed to her business sense. It went well. You really don\u2019t need to know all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me decide what I need to know. Considering you shouldn\u2019t have f**king talked to her at all.\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap-tap goes the calculator.</p><p>\u201cUngrateful much? I was just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Kevorkian was just trying to help his patients too. And we all know how they turned out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help. I have a plan.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra\u2019s hands go to her hips. \u201cRight. Your master plan that entails what, exactly? Annoying Kate until she agrees to go out with you? You gonna call her names on the playground too? Pull on her braids? I have to admit, Sister Beatrice was an interesting touch. I can\u2019t believe Kate isn\u2019t falling on her knees, begging you to take her back after that. Very romantic, Drew.\u201d</p> <p>My jaw clenches. \u201cIt\u2019s. Working.\u201d</p><p>She raises a brow. \u201cThat\u2019s not what Kate said.\u201d</p><p>And there she is. Take a good look.</p><p>The Bitch in all her glory.</p><p>And you thought I was overreacting.</p><p>\u201cDid she say something to you? About me? What did she say?\u201d</p><p>She waves her hand in the air. \u201cOh, this and that.\u201d</p><p>You know how some kids like to tease their dogs by showing them a bone and then yanking it away before they can bite it? My sister was one of those kids.</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit, Lex.\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap-tap.</p><p>\u201cI like her, by the way,\u201d she says. \u201cShe really doesn\u2019t take any shit does she?\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap-tap.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she doesn\u2019t take any shit?\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap-tap.</p><p>\u201cDid you give her shit, Lex?\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap-tap.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of shit did you give her, Alexandra?\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap-tap.</p><p>She laughs. \u201cMy God, would you relax. I haven\u2019t seen you this wound up in...well, never. Now that you\u2019re not pathetic and sad, it\u2019s actually kind of fun.\u201d</p><p>My status with Kate at the moment is like a house of cards. I\u2019ve managed to build myself up a few floors, but one small tremor and the whole damn thing falls apart.</p><p>\u201cIf you f**ked this up for me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap-tap.</p><p>\u201cYou know stress causes premature gray hair. If you keep this up, you\u2019re going to look like Daddy before you turn thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you find this so amusing. I don\u2019t. We\u2019re talking about my frigging life here.\u201d</p><p>That sobers her up. Her head tilts to the side. Appraising me. And then her voice isn\u2019t teasing anymore.</p><p>It\u2019s tender, sincere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, you know. You\u2019re sticking this out. Seeing it through. You\u2019re...all grown up.\u201d She smiles softly. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d And then she hugs me. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Drew. Promise.\u201d</p><p>When I was eight, my grandfather had a heart attack. After my parents left for the hospital, Alexandra promised me everything would be okay.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDid Kate tell you that?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNot in so many words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you know?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs again. \u201cIt\u2019s the estrogen. It gives us ESP. If you had a vag**a, you\u2019d know too.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie raises her hand proudly. \u201cI have a bagina.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cYes, you do sweetheart. And someday, it\u2019s gonna help you rule the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny Fitzgerald has a penis. He say his penis is better than my bagina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny Fitzgerald\u2019s an idiot. Vag**as beat penises every time. They\u2019re like kryptonite. Penises are defenseless against them.\u201d</p><p>My sister puts an end to our discussion. \u201cO-kay. That\u2019s enough of that lovely conversation. Although I\u2019m sure Mackenzie\u2019s preschool teacher will enjoy hearing all about it. Right before she calls Child Protective Services on me.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands up. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to tell her like it is. The sooner she realizes the power she has, the better off she\u2019ll be.\u201d I check my watch; I need to get upstairs. I look at Mackenzie. \u201cWhat\u2019s the damage, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighty dollars.\u201d</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>I need to start billing my clients more. Or work out some kind of payment plan.</p><p>As the bills fall into the jar, Alexandra takes her hand. \u201cCome on Mackenzie, let\u2019s go to the American Girl store and spend some of Uncle Drew\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>They walk across the lobby but stop at the double doors. Mackenzie whispers something to Alexandra and hands over her balloons.</p><p>Then she runs back to me.</p><p>I scoop her up and hold her tight as her little arms come around my shoulders and squeeze.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Uncle Drew.\u201d</p><p>You ever drink brandy? Usually I\u2019m more of a whiskey man myself. But a good glass of brandy warms you all over, from the inside. And that\u2019s me\u2014right now.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>She pulls back. \u201cGuess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate ask me what I wanna be when I grown up.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cAnd did you tell her you want to be a princess?\u201d</p><p>Her forehead creases adorably, and she shakes her head. \u201cI no wanna be a princess no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief. What do you want to be?\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cA banker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic choice. What made you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers play with the collar of my shirt as she tells me, \u201cWell, Kate is a immessment banker, and you say you be proud of me to be jus\u2019 like her. So tha\u2019s what I wanna be.\u201d</p><p>After her words sink in, I ask her seriously, \u201cMackenzie? Did you tell Kate that I said I wanted you to grow up to be just like her?\u201d</p><p>You see that smile? That\u2019s not the smile of a four-year-old child. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the smile of a genius.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. And chuckle. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think of this myself. Mackenzie is the perfect weapon. My very own baby Borg. Resistance is futile.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d I say, \u201cyou did Uncle Drew a huge favor. Anything you want for Christmas\u2014name it and it\u2019s yours. And I mean anything.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen at the possibilities. She glances at my sister and then whispers conspiratorially, \u201cCan I have a pony?\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy.</p><p>I think about it for exactly one second.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She squeezes me tighter and squeals.</p><p>\u201cOnly...don\u2019t tell mommy until after it\u2019s delivered, okay?\u201d</p><p>I may have to enter the witness protection program after this one.</p><p>Mackenzie kisses my cheek, and I set her on her feet. She skips back to Alexandra, and I wave as they walk out the door.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>I WALK INTO KATE\u2019S OFFICE like a soldier storming the beach at Normandy. She\u2019s at her desk writing rapidly on a yellow legal pad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back. Miss me?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cDesperately.\u201d</p><p>Sarcasm is the oldest defense in the book. I play along. \u201cI knew I was wearing you down. What put me over the top? Sister B?\u201d</p><p>Kate pushes back from her desk and crosses her legs. She\u2019s wearing new shoes. I didn\u2019t notice before. Black Mary Janes with a wicked high heel and a strap around the ankle. Good God. They\u2019re the perfect blend of naughty and nice. Sweetness and sex. And my poor neglected c*ck convulses as I picture all the fantastic\u2014and semi-illegal\u2014things I could do to her in those shoes.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had a fetish, but I\u2019m thinking about starting one.</p><p>Kate\u2019s voice drags me away from my impure thoughts. \u201cNo. It was the visit from your sister, actually. Subtlety doesn\u2019t run in your family does it?\u201d</p><p>Uh oh. I was afraid of this.</p><p>\u201cAlexandra has deep-seated psychological issues. She\u2019s unstable. You shouldn\u2019t listen to anything she says. No one in my family does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed completely lucid when she was here.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMental illness is a tricky thing.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes squint doubtfully. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious are you?\u201d</p><p>Crap. No lying.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, she\u2019s never been diagnosed. But her ideas about justice and revenge are certifiable. Imagine Delores...with a decade more experience to perfect her technique.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s face goes slack with understanding. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Yep\u2014welcome to my world, sweetheart.</p><p>\u201cShe brought me coffee,\u201d Kate says. \u201cShould I drink it?\u201d</p><p>We both eye the Starbucks cup on her desk suspiciously.</p><p>When I was thirteen, I auctioned off a pair of Alexandra\u2019s underwear in the boys\u2019 locker room. Dirty ones. When she found out through the grapevine of older sisters, she played it cool\u2014never let on that she knew. And then she spiked my Coco Pebbles with chocolate-flavored laxatives. I didn\u2019t leave the bathroom for three days.</p><p>Now, I realize she\u2019s not carrying that kind of grudge against Kate, but still...</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She nods stiffly and slides the cup back away from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you think of Mackenzie? I really wanted to be here when you met her.\u201d</p><p>Her smile is warm and genuine. \u201cI think she\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be thrilled to hear she used your calculator on me when I ran into them downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widens. \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, and Kate says, \u201cI see now why Alexandra started the Bad Word Jar, since you seem to spend so much time with Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cShe talks like you. It\u2019s not every day you hear a four-year-old say Prince Charming is a douchebag who\u2019s only holding Cinderella back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s my girl.</p><p>\u201cSwearing is good for the soul.\u201d</p><p>Kate stifles a laugh. And she looks so tempting I can\u2019t help but lean over her chair, trapping her with my arms. Small talk is over. Time to get back to business.</p><p>\u201cCome for a walk with me.\u201d</p> <p>My voice is low. Persuasive.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>And utterly ineffective.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kate, it\u2019ll just take a minute. I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do? Hire Ringling Brothers to do a show in the lobby? Organize a ticker-tape parade in my honor?\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Kate raises one skeptical brow.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re right\u2014I would so do that. But not today.\u201d</p><p>She pushes me back and stands up. I let her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not scared, are you?\u201d I ask. \u201cAfraid you won\u2019t be able to control yourself if you\u2019re alone with me?\u201d</p><p>To people like Kate and me, a dare is kind of like a hooker at a sex addicts\u2019 convention. There\u2019s almost no chance they\u2019re going to get turned down.</p> <p>\u201cIf you mean am I afraid I\u2019ll kill you if there aren\u2019t any witnesses to testify against me, then the answer\u2019s yes. Although I must admit, twenty-to-life is looking like a small price to pay at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Do you think she enjoys the verbal foreplay as much as I do? She\u2019s got to. She\u2019s so good at it.</p><p>She circles around, putting her desk between us.</p><p>\u201cLook, Drew, I have a new client. I told you that. You know how it is. I can\u2019t afford these...distractions right now.\u201d</p><p>I take that as a compliment. \u201cI distract you?\u201d</p><p>She huffs. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Then her face changes. And she\u2019s imploring, \u201cYou have to stop this\u2014\u201d her hands wave in the air \u201c\u2014this mission you\u2019re on. Just let it go. Please.\u201d</p><p>When Steven was eleven, he ran into a tree during a game of touch football in his backyard\u2014and busted his forehead open. For as long as I live, I\u2019ll never forget the sound of him begging, pleading with his mother not to take him to the hospital. Because he knew he needed stitches. And stitches just\u2014suck. At any age.</p><p>But Janey Reinhart didn\u2019t give in. She brought him anyway. Because even though Steven was terrified\u2014even though it wasn\u2019t what he wanted\u2014she knew it was what he needed.</p> <p>You see where I\u2019m going with this?</p><p>\u201cThe ball\u2019s in your court, Kate. I told you that from the beginning. You want me gone, all you have to do is go out with me on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>She bites her lip. And looks down at her desk.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Come again?</p><p>Sure, I\u2019d love to. With Kate.</p><p>Okay\u2014not the time to joke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry? Could you repeat that, please?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes meet mine. They look hesitant but resigned. Like someone waiting in line for a rollercoaster. Determined to get on but not exactly sure what the hell they\u2019ve gotten themselves into. \u201cI said yes. I\u2019ll have dinner with you on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s official. Brace yourselves. Hell has actually frozen the f**k over.</p><p>\u201cAfter talking with your sister, I realized a few things...\u201d</p><p>You love me? You need me? You can\u2019t live without me?</p><p>\u201c...I think you need closure, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. Not closure. Anything but f**king closure.</p><p>Closure is a made-up word that women invented so they can overanalyze something and talk about it\u2014to death. And then, after it\u2019s been blessed and buried, closure gives them the excuse to dig the poor f**ker up and talk about it\u2014some more.</p><p>Guys don\u2019t do that. Ever.</p><p>It\u2019s over. Fade to black. The end.</p><p>That\u2019s all the goddamn closure we need.</p><p>\u201cClosure?\u201d</p><p>She walks toward me. \u201cI think things with us started and stopped so fast, you didn\u2019t have time to acclimate yourself. Maybe if we spend some time...if we talk away from the office...you\u2019ll understand that after everything that\u2019s happened, the best we can hope to be is friends.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure she means without benefits. And that just doesn\u2019t work for me.</p><p>A guy can\u2019t be friends with a woman he\u2019s actively attracted to. Not really. Because at some point his dick will take over. It\u2019ll walk like him and talk like him, but\u2014like one of the poor schmucks infected by those freaky face-sucking things in Alien\u2014it won\u2019t be him. And from that point on, every move, every gesture will be geared toward accomplishing the dick\u2019s goal. Which sure as shit won\u2019t have anything to do with friendship.</p><p>Besides, I have friends\u2014Matthew, Steven, Jack. I don\u2019t want to f**k any of them.</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t notice my disgust with the idea. Or she just doesn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>\u201cYes. We should get reacquainted as coworkers. Equals. Not a date. Kind of more like a business meeting between colleagues.\u201d</p><p>Denial is a powerful thing. But at this point I\u2019ll take what I can get. \u201cSo, what you\u2019re telling me is you\u2019ll go out with me on Saturday? That\u2019s the bottom line, right?\u201d</p><p>She hesitates. And then nods. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Don\u2019t say anything else. I\u2019ll pick you up at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll meet you.\u201d</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>I speak slowly, \u201cNow, Kate, I know you haven\u2019t been on many dates, considering the moron you called a boyfriend had you engaged before you were out of a training bra. But in cases like this, the guy\u2014that\u2019s me\u2014is supposed to pick you\u2014the girl\u2014up. It\u2019s an unwritten law.\u201d</p><p>See how her lips press together? How her shoulders square off? Oh yeah, she\u2019s ready to rumble.</p><p>\u201cI just told you this isn\u2019t a date.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSemantics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say hypothetically it is a date. It would be a first date. And I would never have a man that I didn\u2019t know come to my apartment to pick me up for a first date.\u201d</p><p>I push a hand through my hair. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. You know me. We did sixty-nine. I\u2019d say you know me pretty damn well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, these are my terms. If you can\u2019t live with them, we can just forget the whole\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait. Let\u2019s not be hasty. I give. You can meet me at my apartment. At seven. Sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have some terms of my own.\u201d</p><p>She jumps down my throat. \u201cI\u2019m not hav**g s*x with you!\u201d</p><p>I force myself to look surprised. \u201cI\u2019m wounded. Really. Who said anything about sex? I would never require sex as part of our agreement.\u201d</p><p>And then I smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s optional. Clothing too.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d</p><p>Oh, baby. If she only knew. Though it\u2019s probably better that she doesn\u2019t. Don\u2019t want to scare her away.</p><p>\u201cI want four hours. At least. Uninterrupted. I want conversation, dinner\u2014appetizers, entr\u00e9e, dessert\u2014wine, dancing...\u201d</p><p>She holds up her hand. \u201cNo dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne dance. That\u2019s non-negotiable.\u201d</p><p>She looks at the ceiling, weighing her options. \u201cFine. One dance.\u201d She points her finger at me. \u201cBut if your hands go anywhere near my ass, I\u2019m out of there.\u201d</p><p>Now it\u2019s my turn to think it over. \u201cWell...okay. But if you renege on any of my stipulations, I reserve the right to call do-over.\u201d</p><p>She waits a moment. Her eyes narrow distrustfully. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll leave me alone\u2014completely\u2014until Saturday? No priests popping in to say hello? No ice sculptures melting outside my door?\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like we never met. Like I don\u2019t even work here.\u201d</p><p>Chances are I won\u2019t be here. I\u2019m going to be a very busy boy.</p><p>Kate nods. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I hold out my hand. She shakes it and says, \u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>I turn her hand over gently and kiss the back\u2014like I did the first night we met. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>Have you ever walked into a room to get something, but once you\u2019re there, you have no idea what you came for? Good. Then you\u2019ll understand why I turn and start to walk out of the room.</p><p>Until Kate\u2019s voice stops me. \u201cDrew?\u201d</p><p>I look back at her. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Her face is downcast. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t enjoy hurting people. So...don\u2019t get your hopes up about Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Before I can open my mouth, movement out the window catches my eye. And I can\u2019t believe I almost forgot. Wordlessly, I walk forward and take Kate\u2019s hand. I bring her to the window and stand behind her, resting my hands on her shoulders.</p><p>I bring my mouth to her ear. My breath gives her goose bumps. The good kind.</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>I wanted it to be simple. Something I would have carved on a tree or spray-painted on a wall if we were kids. But I needed it to be clear. A proclamation. Telling Kate and every other woman out there that I, Drew Evans, am off the field.</p><p>Kate gasps when she sees it.</p><p>Up there in the sky, in huge white letters, for the whole city to see:</p><p>Always go out on top. Have I told you this yet?</p><p>No? Well I\u2019m telling you now.</p><p>I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a businessman, a singer, or a top-rated television show\u2014leave them wanting more. Never overplay your hand. You can always go back later for an encore, but once they\u2019re sick of you, there\u2019s no taking it back.</p><p>I kiss the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Saturday, Kate.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019s still staring out the window as I walk out.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry\u2014the show\u2019s not over yet. I still have a few tricks up my sleeve, and I always save the best for last. You\u2019re really not going to want to miss this.</p><p>I head straight for Erin\u2019s desk. \u201cI need you to get the florist on the phone. And the caterer. And set up an appointment for me\u2014tonight\u2014with that interior designer we talked about yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She picks up her phone and dials. \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I said interior designer. You don\u2019t know what that\u2019s for, do you?</p><p>It\u2019s the grand finale. My winning move.</p><p>You\u2019ll see.</p><p>On Saturday night.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>SEE THAT RAKISHLY HANDSOME GUY in the charcoal slacks and black shirt with the sleeves half rolled up? The one arranging the china plates on that table?</p><p>That\u2019s me. Drew Evans.</p><p>Well, not really. Not the old me. I\u2019m new and improved. This is DAK. Can you guess what that stands for? Half the women in this city would give their left tit to have me where I am right now. Pussy whipped. Obsessed.</p><p>In love.</p><p>But there\u2019s only one woman who was able to put me here. Now I just need to show her I\u2019m here to stay. I haven\u2019t seen her for two days. Two long, excruciating days. It wasn\u2019t as bad as the seven, but it was close.</p><p>Anyway, take a look around. What do you think? Am I missing anything? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fresh flowers cover every available surface. White daisies. Before, I thought seeing them would remind her of Warren, but I\u2019m not worried about that now. They\u2019re Kate\u2019s favorite, so they\u2019re the only kind here. Bocelli plays softly on the sound system. Candles light the room. Hundreds of them\u2014glass-enclosed.</p><p>You can\u2019t go wrong with candles. They make everyone look better. They make everything smell better.</p><p>Knock-knock.</p><p>That would be Kate. Right on time. I scan the room once more. This is it. My Super Bowl. Game Seven. And everything\u2019s ready. I\u2019m ready. As I\u2019ll ever be. I blow out a deep breath. And open the door.</p> <p>And then I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t think. Breathing? That\u2019s not a frigging option either.</p><p>Kate\u2019s dark hair is piled high on her head. Elegant tendrils kiss her neck, caressing the very spot that I spent hours nibbling on not so long ago. Her dress is dark red\u2014shiny\u2014maybe satin. It hangs from delicate straps that bridge her shoulders and fall low in back. The bottom rests above her knee, exposing her smooth legs inch by delectable inch.</p><p>And her shoes...Mother of Christ...her shoes are all heel, held on by an intricate black bow tied at the back of her ankle.</p><p>When I\u2019m actually able to form words, my voice is rough. \u201cIs there any way we could renegotiate the no-ass-grabbing clause? \u2019Cause I have to tell you, in that dress? It\u2019s going to be hard.\u201d</p><p>And it\u2019s not the only thing, if you catch my drift.</p> <p>She smiles and shakes her head. \u201cAll previous stipulations stand.\u201d</p><p>I stand back as she walks in, looking me over out the corner of her eye. Watch her face closely. See how her eyes darken? How she licks her lips without realizing it? Like a lioness that just spotted a gazelle in the high grass.</p><p>She likes what she sees. She wants to compliment me. She wants to, but she won\u2019t. This is Kate we\u2019re talking about here. Post-my-colossal-foot-in-mouth-fuck-up Kate. And despite my recent progress, she\u2019s still defensive. Untrusting. On guard.</p><p>And that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not offended. Her eyes tell me everything she won\u2019t let herself say.</p><p>I lead her toward the living room, and she bites her lip as she asks, \u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d</p><p>And then she stops short when she spots the candles. And the flowers. And the perfectly set table for two.</p> <p>I tell her softly, \u201cWe\u2019re already here.\u201d</p><p>She gazes around the room. \u201cWow. It\u2019s...it\u2019s beautiful, Drew.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThe room\u2019s nice. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She blushes. And it\u2019s amazing.</p><p>I want to kiss her. Badly.</p><p>You ever been thirsty? Really thirsty? Like on a ninety-eight-degree summer day when you don\u2019t have enough spit in your mouth to even swallow? Now imagine somebody puts an ice-cold glass of water in front of you. And you can look at it, and you can picture how perfect it would taste\u2014but you can\u2019t touch it. And you definitely can\u2019t drink it.</p><p>That\u2019s pretty much the hell I\u2019m in at the moment.</p><p>I tear my eyes away from Kate\u2019s face and hand her a glass of red wine. Then I take a long drink of my own.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to your fingers?\u201d She\u2019s referring to the Band-Aids that cover four of my ten digits.</p><p>\u201cMushrooms. Spongy little bastards don\u2019t appreciate being sliced.\u201d</p><p>She looks surprised. \u201cYou cooked?\u201d</p><p>I was going to take Kate to a restaurant. The best in the city. But she\u2019s about quality, remember? And I figure she\u2019ll appreciate my effort a hell of a lot more than anything a gourmet chef could come up with.</p><p>I smile. \u201cI have many talents. You\u2019ve only seen a few.\u201d</p><p>And this might remain true. I\u2019ve never cooked before.</p><p>Which reminds me\u2014Martha Stewart? She\u2019s my new idol. Seriously. I used to think her whole deal was a joke. Who becomes a billionaire by showing people how to fold goddamn dinner napkins correctly? But that was before. Before I actually tried to use my oven or set a table.</p><p>Now Martha\u2019s a f**king god. Like Buddha. And if her recipe helps me pull this off? I\u2019ll worship at her pudgy sandaled feet every day for the rest of my life.</p><p>Kate and I sit on the couch.</p><p>\u201cSo...how are things at the office?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She sips her wine and brushes nonexistent wrinkles off her dress. \u201cGood. Things have been good. You know...quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019ve been bored out of your mind without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s been...productive. I\u2019ve gotten a lot done.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cYou\u2019ve missed me.\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kate, I\u2019ve taken a vow of honesty here. It\u2019s only fair that you do the same.\u201d I lean forward. \u201cLook me in the eyes and tell me you haven\u2019t thought about me\u2014at all\u2014in the last few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>Buzzzzz...buzzzzz...buzzzzz.</p><p>Dinner\u2019s ready. Kate takes another drink from her glass.</p><p>\u201cYou should get that, Drew. Don\u2019t want it to burn.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019s saved by the buzzer.</p><p>For now.</p><p>The chicken Marsala I made looks...unique now that it\u2019s actually out of the oven and on our plates.</p><p>Okay it\u2019s f**king frightening. I admit it.</p><p>Kate\u2019s brow is furrowed as she pushes at the brown lumps like she\u2019s dissecting a frog in biology. \u201cDid you mix the flour with water before you added it?\u201d</p><p>Water? Martha didn\u2019t say anything about water. That bitch.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Drew, some of the best culinary dishes in history looked disgusting. Presentation doesn\u2019t count for much. It\u2019s all about the taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She picks up her fork and takes a deep breath. \u201cNo. I was just trying to make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>I stare at my plate. \u201cThanks for trying.\u201d</p><p>Before she takes a bite, I reach across the table and put my hand on hers. \u201cWait. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d</p><p>That way, if the food makes me keel over like bad blowfish, at least one of us will be conscious to call 9-1-1. Plus, if I\u2019m hospitalized, I think there\u2019s an excellent chance Kate would throw a pity f**k my way.</p><p>And don\u2019t think for a second that I wouldn\u2019t take it. In a freaking heartbeat.</p><p>I try not to breathe through my nose as I take a bite. Kate stares at me. I chew.</p><p>And then I smile slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>She seems relieved. Maybe even a little proud. She slides her fork through her lips. Then she nods. \u201cIt\u2019s really good. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014I get that a lot.\u201d</p><p>Through the entire meal, our conversation flows easily. Comfortably. I keep the topics safe. We talk about her new client, Matthew and Delores\u2019s burgeoning relationship, and the never-ending political antics going on in DC.</p><p>For dessert, I serve strawberries and whipped cream. Strawberries are Kate\u2019s favorite. I knew that from our Lost Weekend. Originally, I was going for strawberry shortcake. But you don\u2019t want to know how the pudding turned out. I don\u2019t think even Matthew would\u2019ve eaten it. When Martha said stir constantly, she wasn\u2019t screwing around.</p><p>While we enjoy our last course, I mention Mackenzie\u2019s impending Christmas present.</p><p>Kate laughs. Unbelieving. \u201cYou\u2019re not really going to buy her a pony, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. She\u2019s a little girl. Every girl should have a pony.\u201d</p><p>She sips her wine. We\u2019re halfway through our second bottle.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to get one of those carts like the horses in Central Park. That way they can train it to take her to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is New York City, Drew. Where are they going to keep it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have a five-bedroom condo. Two of the rooms are filled with Alexandra\u2019s useless shit. I figure they can clean one out and make it the pony\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me straight-faced. \u201cThe pony\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they going to get it to their floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreight elevator. All the older buildings have one.\u201d</p><p>She sits back in her chair. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve thought of everything haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I take a drink. \u201cI always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about what method your sister will use to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll surprise me. Will you defend me when she tries?\u201d</p><p>She fingers her wine glass and glances up at me through those insanely long lashes. \u201cNo way, Pony Boy. She\u2019s bigger than me. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand over my heart. \u201cI\u2019m crushed.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not buying it. \u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Our laughter fades into relaxed smiles. And I\u2019m content to just watch her for a moment. She\u2019s staring at me too.</p><p>Then she clears her throat and looks away. \u201cThis is a good CD.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s talking about the music that\u2019s been playing in the background for the last few hours.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take all the credit. The guys helped me burn it.\u201d</p><p>On cue, \u201cI Touch Myself\u201d by the Divinyls pours from the speakers.</p><p>\u201cJack picked that one.\u201d</p><p>Kate laughs, and I stand up and press the button on the CD player, changing the song.</p><p>\u201cAnd since I most likely only have a few weeks to live\u2014\u201d I hold my hand out to Kate \u201c\u2014may I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>A new song fills the room: \u201cThen\u201d by Brad Paisley. I\u2019m not really into country music, but Brad\u2019s pretty cool. He\u2019s a guy\u2019s guy, even for a singer.</p><p>She takes my hand and stands up. Her arms go around my neck. And my hands rest at her waist\u2014trying not to squeeze. Gently, we start to sway.</p><p>I swallow hard as her round, dark eyes look up at me without frustration or anger or hurt. They\u2019re all warmth, like liquid chocolate. And my f**king knees go weak. I trail my hand up her spine to the back of her head. She turns her cheek and lays her head on my chest. And I pull her against me even closer\u2014tighter.</p><p>I\u2019d like to tell you what it feels like. To hold her again. To have my arms wrapped around her, at last, and her body pressed against mine.</p><p>I\u2019d like to, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>Because there aren\u2019t words\u2014in English or any other language\u2014that could even come close to describing it.</p><p>I inhale the sweet flowery scent of her hair. If the poison in the gas chamber smelled like Kate?</p><p>Every Death Row inmate would die with a smile on his face.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t lift her head as she whispers, \u201cDrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to know...I forgive you...for what you said that day in your office. I believe you, that you didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, in hindsight, I realize that I didn\u2019t help the situation. I could\u2019ve said something, given you...reassurance about how I felt...before I went to talk to Billy. I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>And then her voice changes\u2014becomes lower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mournful.</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>My thumb sweeps back and forth across the bare skin of her neck. \u201cOf course it does. It changes everything.\u201d</p><p>She raises her head. \u201cI can\u2019t do this with you, Drew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d</p><p>She stares at my chest as she tries to explain. \u201cI have goals. Aspirations. That I\u2019ve worked hard for\u2014sacrificed for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to watch you meet those goals, Kate. I want to help make your dreams come true. Every goddamn one.\u201d</p><p>She looks up. And her eyes are begging now\u2014for understanding. For mercy.</p><p>\u201cWhen Billy broke up with me, I was sad. It hurt. But I was able to keep going. I didn\u2019t miss a beat. This thing with you...it\u2019s different. It\u2019s...more. And I\u2019m not too proud to admit that if it doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019m not going to be able to just pick myself up and move on. You can...You could break me, Drew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My hand moves to her cheek. And she leans into it.</p><p>\u201cI know what it feels like to think I\u2019ve lost you, Kate. And I don\u2019t ever want to feel that way again. I\u2019m a man who knows what he wants, remember? And I want you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head slowly. \u201cYou want me tonight. But what about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you tonight, and I\u2019ll want you tomorrow and the next day. And ten thousand days after that. Didn\u2019t you get the memo in the sky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might change your mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI might get struck by lightening. Or eaten by a shark. And both of those things are a hell of a lot more likely than a day ever coming when I won\u2019t want you. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>And I guess that\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>She stares at me for several moments, then her gaze falls to the floor. The song ends. And she starts to pull away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Drew. I just...can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I try to hold on. Like a drowning man gripping a life preserver.</p><p>\u201cKate...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>No no no no no. I\u2019m losing her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes harden like molten lava when it cools to black rock. \u201cYour time\u2019s almost up. This was lovely. But...\u201d</p><p>This is not f**king happening. It\u2019s like watching your receiver fumble the ball when you\u2019re up by three with twenty seconds left on the clock. She turns toward the door. But I grab her arm and force her to look at me. My voice sounds desperate. Because I am.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on. You can\u2019t go yet. There\u2019s one more thing I have to show you. Give me ten more minutes. Please, Kate.\u201d</p><p>Look at her face. Right now.</p><p>She wants to stay. No\u2014she wants me to convince her to stay. To give her a reason to believe in me again. And if this doesn\u2019t do it, nothing on God\u2019s green earth ever will.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Drew. Ten more minutes.\u201d</p><p>The breath rushes out of me. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I let go of her arm, grab a black silk scarf off the chair and hold it up. \u201cYou can\u2019t take this off until I tell you, okay?\u201d</p><p>Suspicion washes over her face. \u201cIs this some kind of weird sex thing?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cNo. But I like the way you think.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes to the ceiling right before I cover them with the scarf, and the world as she knows it fades to black.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>EVERY NEW ASSOCIATE at Evans, Reinhart and Fisher gets to redecorate his or her office. We\u2019re not the only firm with this kind of policy. It\u2019s good business. Makes employees feel comfortable, like a piece of the company belongs to them. The choices of paint colors and furniture patterns aren\u2019t unlimited\u2014but at a firm like ours, the pallet is pretty vast. That\u2019s how I got my inspiration. How I was able to figure out what Kate prefers.</p><p>She\u2019s not into florals, and I thank Christ for that. She likes stripes, paisleys, and earth tones. Why am I telling you this, you ask? What does it have to do with anything?</p><p>You remember the Bat Cave, don\u2019t you? My home office. My firstborn. My strictly dickly, men-only region? Well, it\u2019s gotten a sex change. No, that\u2019s not really accurate. It\u2019s more of a hermaphrodite now.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>I turn the light on and bring Kate to the middle of the room. Then I untie the scarf.</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u201cOh, my...\u201d</p><p>The once burgundy walls are now a majestic blue. The English leather couches are history. In their place are two sofas, striped in warm tan and the same deep blue as the walls. My desk is shifted to the left\u2014to make room for the lighter cherry one that sits next to it, side by side, like a bride and groom on their wedding day. The picture window behind them is framed with drapes in the same material as the sofas. And the poker table\u2019s still in the corner. But now it\u2019s got a stiff brown cover over it\u2014to support the large, leafy plant that sits on top. I don\u2019t usually do live plants. My thumb\u2019s about as green as Morticia Adams\u2019s. But the interior decorator said women were into them. Some shit about the nurturing instinct.</p><p>Pretty amazing what you can accomplish in a short time when you\u2019ve got an interior decorator with a team of workers at your disposal and money isn\u2019t an issue, right? But curtains are a real bitch to hang. I did those myself\u2014wanted to personally add a few touches. And I almost put the rod through the frigging window a dozen times before I got them straight.</p><p>I watch Kate\u2019s face closely. But I can\u2019t tell what she\u2019s thinking. She\u2019s blank. Stunned. Like an eyewitness to a double homicide.</p><p>I swallow hard. And start the most important pitch of my life:</p><p>\u201cI watched The Notebook again.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s still so f**king gay.</p><p>However...</p><p>\u201cI get it now. Why Noah put that art room together for Allie. It wasn\u2019t because he was a vag**a; it was because he didn\u2019t have a choice. She was it for him. No matter what he did, there was never gonna be anyone but her. So all he could do was set up the room and hope to God that one day she\u2019d show up to use it. And that pretty much sums up exactly how I feel about you. So I did this\u2014\u201d I gesture around the room \u201c\u2014because I want you in my life, Kate. Permanently.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes settle on me. And they\u2019re shining with tears.</p><p>\u201cI want you to move in here with me. I want to fall asleep with your hair in my face every night. And I want to wake up wrapped around you every morning. I want us to spend whole weekends without any clothes on at all. I want to have clean fights and dirty makeup sex.\u201d</p><p>She laughs at that one. And a single tear slips silently down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you until the sun comes up, and I want to bring you cereal in bed every Sunday. I want to work long, endless hours in this office, but only if you\u2019re here next to me.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is barely a whisper. \u201cLike a partnership? Fifty-fifty split?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. Not fifty-fifty. You don\u2019t get just half of me. You get all of me. A hundred percent.\u201d</p><p>She breathes deep. And bites her lip. And glances down at her desk. Then her face goes slack.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s her parents\u2019 wedding picture.</p><p>\u201cI stole it from your office and had it copied while you were at lunch.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head slowly. And looks back up at me. In awe. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did all this.\u201d</p><p>I take a step forward. \u201cI know you just got out of a relationship and I\u2019ve never been in one. And I know I\u2019m supposed to tell you that if you\u2019re not ready, that it\u2019s okay. That I\u2019ll be patient and wait. But...if I say those things...I\u2019ll be lying. Because...I\u2019m just not a waiting kind of guy. I\u2019m more of a take-the-bull-by-the-horns, keep-at-you-until-you-break-or-go-insane kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>She chuckles again.</p><p>\u201cSo if this isn\u2019t enough, if you need something more\u2014tell me. No matter what it is, I\u2019ll do it. For you.\u201d</p><p>When I\u2019m done, she just stands there. Staring at me.</p><p>She licks her lips and wipes her eyes. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d</p><p>I nod cautiously.</p><p>\u201cNo lying. I mean it, Drew. When you tell me something, I have to know that it\u2019s the truth. That you don\u2019t have some ulterior motive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no other women. I think I\u2019m pretty adventurous in bed when it comes to you, but I\u2019m monogamous. I don\u2019t swing. I don\u2019t do threesomes.\u201d</p><p>Not a problem. My dick only has eyes for Kate.</p><p>\u201cMe neither. Well, you know, not anymore. I mean...agreed.\u201d</p><p>And then she smiles. And it\u2019s blinding. Luminous.</p><p>Fucking incandescent.</p><p>And she steps toward me. \u201cWell, Mr. Evans...it looks like you\u2019ve got yourself a merger.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s all I need to hear.</p><p>I move like a spring that\u2019s been cocked too tight for too long. And before Kate can take a breath, I\u2019ve got her crushed against me\u2014holding her, lifting her right off her feet.</p><p>Our mouths snap together like two magnets. She grips my shirt. And my tongue slides into her welcoming mouth.</p><p>Jesus. The taste of her\u2014my memory was unforgivably inadequate. I feel like a recovering crack addict who just fell off the wagon and never wants to climb back on.</p><p>Our hands grope at each other. It\u2019s explosive. Combustible.</p><p>Burn, baby, burn.</p><p>I drag my lips across her jaw. She tilts her head to give me more room, and I attack her neck. She\u2019s panting. We both are. My hands are in her hair, holding her hostage. And her hands are on my chest skimming my ribs and waist. I have no f**king clue how she got my shirt opened. I\u2019m just glad she did. My fingers whisper down her back to the hem of her dress. Then I slide them under it, cupping her smooth, firm ass.</p><p>She must be wearing a thong.</p><p>I massage and squeeze, pressing our h*ps together. Kate\u2019s mouth replaces her hands, moving across my chest and lower. And I start to really f**king lose it. I grab the back of her dress in both hands and pull\u2014ripping it almost in two. Kind of like the Incredible Hulk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new one, I swear.\u201d</p><p>It falls to her waist. And our bare chests crash together.</p><p>Fuck me. I missed this. How in Christ did I ever go an hour\u2014let alone days\u2014without feeling her against me like this? Too f**king long.</p><p>\u201cGod, Drew.\u201d</p><p>Her hands are across my back now. Scratching and kneading. My mouth is at her ear, demanding, \u201cWhatever underwear you\u2019ve got on? I\u2019m keeping them.\u201d I drop to my knees, scorching a path between her br**sts and down her stomach.</p><p>Kate gasps. \u201cThat could be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I drag her dress down to the floor. And then I stare\u2014mesmerized\u2014at Kate\u2019s bare snatch.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not wearing any.\u201d</p><p>My c*ck moans in agony. And then I look up at her. \u201cYou always go commando to business meetings with friends?\u201d</p><p>She smiles shyly. \u201cI guess I was hoping you\u2019d change my mind about that.\u201d</p><p>For a second, I\u2019m stunned. She wanted this. Just as badly as I did. And I wasted all that time eating chicken Marsala\u2014when I could have been eating her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Without another word, I dive in.

She tastes warm and silky like the liquid sugar on top of a cinnamon bun, but sweeter.</p><p>Kate\u2019s knees buckle, but I brace my hands at the small of her back and slide her legs over my shoulder. And then I lay back on the floor so she\u2019s straddling my face.</p><p>Like I\u2019ve dreamed of every damn night.</p><p>She writhes and gasps above me. Unabashedly. And I devour her in a starving frenzy. Her whimpers get higher. Louder. Her hand reaches back. And she strokes my c*ck over my pants.</p><p>You ever heard of a two-pump chump? Well, if she doesn\u2019t stop touching me real frigging quickly, you\u2019re going to get a bird\u2019s-eye view of one.</p><p>I grab her hand and lock our fingers together. Kate uses them for leverage as she rotates her hips, rubbing her gorgeous cunt against my mouth. She moves once, twice...and then she\u2019s coming. Screaming my name brokenly.</p><p>She breathes deep as she comes back down. Then she slides sinuously over my body till our mouths line up. And we\u2019re kissing. It\u2019s savage and rough\u2014all tongue and teeth. My hands push through her hair, pulling it loose. Her h*ps grind against my dick, and her wetness soaks through my pants.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Kate. I\u2019m going to come so f**king hard.\u201d</p><p>I just hope I\u2019m actually inside her when I do.</p><p>She swirls her tongue around my nipple before she tells me, \u201cPants, Drew. Off.\u201d</p><p>My h*ps bow off the floor as I tear at the button on my pants. I manage to push them and my boxers down to my knees, but I\u2019m too out of my mind to get them off completely.</p><p>I grab her h*ps and bring them lower. And my c*ck slides effortlessly inside her.</p><p>Christ Almighty.</p><p>We freeze\u2014our faces just millimeters apart\u2014our breaths harsh and entwined. My eyes hold hers. And then she moves. Slowly. Drawing me almost completely out\u2014before surging back down. My head falls back, and my lids close.</p><p>It\u2019s perfect. Divine.</p><p>My hands are splayed across her hips. Helping her. Gripping hard enough to bruise. And then she sits up, arching her back till her hair brushes my knees. I force my eyes open, needing to see her. Her head\u2019s back, her br**sts are high, and her lips are open as euphoric moans and nonsensical words slip out.</p><p>You know how sometimes you read about nak*d pictures of some moron\u2019s wife getting leaked onto the Internet? I never got that.</p><p>But now I do. Because if I had a camera? I\u2019d be snapping that shutter like the freaking paparazzi. To capture this moment. To remember how Kate looks right now. Because she\u2019s just that magnificent. More stunning than any masterpiece in the Louvre\u2014more breathtaking than all the Seven Wonders combined.</p><p>She moves faster, harder. And I feel the pressure building low in my gut.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Kate. Ride me...just like that.\u201d</p><p>Her tits bounce with each thrust. Hypnotically. And I just can\u2019t resist a taste. I sit up and cover one tip with my mouth, laving and flicking her pointy little peak with my tongue. She screams as her legs wrap around my back\u2014pulling me tighter\u2014rubbing her cl*t along my happy trail.</p> <p>She\u2019s close. We\u2019re f**king close. But I don\u2019t want it end. Not yet.</p><p>So I roll her under me, cradling the back of her head in my hands, protecting it from the wood floor, as I lay on top of her. Kate\u2019s welcoming thighs open wide, and I push even deeper inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh God...oh God...\u201d</p><p>The sound of our bodies slapping and her breathy voice fills the room like an erotic symphony. The New York Philharmonic\u2019s got nothing on us.</p><p>\u201cGod! Oh God!\u201d</p><p>I smile as I pick up the pace, \u201cGod\u2019s not the one f**king you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Sure, I\u2019m in love, but this is still me here.</p><p>\u201cDrew...Drew...yes...Drew!\u201d</p><p>Much better.</p><p>You didn\u2019t think I was going to start spewing sickeningly sweet, asswipe-like phrases, now did you? Sorry to disappoint.</p><p>Besides, I like the word fuck. It implies a certain level of heat. Passion. And it\u2019s specific. If Congress had asked Bill Clinton if he f**ked Monica Lewinski, there wouldn\u2019t have been any question about just what the hell they were talking about, now would there?</p><p>It doesn\u2019t much matter what you say when you\u2019re screwing anyway. Or how you do it. Slow and gentle or fast and violent\u2014it\u2019s the feelings behind it that make it mean something. That make it mean everything.</p><p>Christ, am I enlightened or what? Aren\u2019t you proud of me? You should be.</p><p>I bend my arms and cover her mouth in a devouring, harsh kiss. Then I lick my way to her shoulder and, caught up in the moment, bite down. Not hard enough to break the skin but with just enough pressure to send Kate flying over the f**king edge again.</p><p>I straighten my arms so I can watch her. She bucks up one more time before she goes stiff and tight beneath me. Her perfectly painted toes curl in the air as she comes. Her muscles squeeze me hard from base to tip, like desperate hands milking a tube of toothpaste from the bottom up, wringing out every last drop.</p><p>My head rolls back and my eyes close as I grunt and curse. And I\u2019m helpless\u2014like a grain of sand in the grip of a tsunami. Pleasure pounds out of every pore in my body as I come with the force of a frigging geyser.</p><p>Incredible.</p><p>We ride out the wave of ecstasy together until we\u2019re both gulping for air. And then I collapse on top of her. My cheek lies in the valley between her br**sts, my stomach between her thighs. And few seconds later, Kate\u2019s hands come up my back before sliding down my spine in the most soothing f**king way.</p><p>I cup her face with my hands and kiss her. Slowly this time. Languidly. Her doe eyes stare into mine. But neither of us speaks. We don\u2019t need to.</p><p>And then I feel it.</p><p>Have you ever seen a racehorse after it\u2019s been sidelined for a while? I have. When they get back on the track, it\u2019s like fire\u2019s been shot into their veins. They can just run and run\u2014countless laps\u2014miles at a time.</p><p>You see where I\u2019m going with this?</p><p>I flip us over so Kate\u2019s once again on top, her knees straddling my hips, her head against my chest. We really should move this to the bed\u2014the floor\u2019s damn hard. But, then again, so am I. And that takes precedence.</p><p>Kate lifts her head and her eyes widen. \u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>I raise my brows. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed a lot of quality time lately. Apparently my dick would like to make up for every second of it. You game?\u201d</p><p>I rotate my hips, and she moans just a little.</p><p>I\u2019ll take that as a yes.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>WE MADE IT TO THE BED. EVENTUALLY.</p><p>A few hours and three orgasms later, we\u2019re laying side by side facing each other. Sharing a pillow. The pillow.</p><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the tenth time she\u2019s asked me. But I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll say it till I\u2019m blue in the face if she wants me to.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. It sounds content. \u201cI\u2019m going to be really clingy and needy for the next few weeks. You should be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be insecure and jealous. It\u2019ll work out great.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a smile in her voice. \u201cYou told me you don\u2019t get jealous.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI also told you I wasn\u2019t going to lie to you ever again.\u201d</p><p>Her hands comb through the back of my hair gently. \u201cWhen did you know?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThe first time you let me come inside you without a rubber.\u201d</p><p>She yanks my hair. Hard.</p><p>\u201cOw! Jesus!\u201d</p><p>Her voice is exasperated, like a mother who just caught her kid snagging an off-limits cookie for the tenth time.</p><p>\u201cDrew. That doesn\u2019t sound very romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d</p><p>I find the strength to lift my head, and then I lower it down over her already hardened nipple. I suck at it, tease it with my teeth, before slowly letting it go with a pop.</p><p>\u201cBecause I happen to think coming inside you is very, very romantic.\u201d</p><p>As I start to give the other beauty the same treatment, she gasps. \u201cThat\u2019s a good point.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cThey all are, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Laying my head back down, I drag my fingertip up her arm, fascinated by the goose bumps that rise up as I go.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask me when I knew?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWhen you knew what?\u201d</p><p>Kate rolls onto her stomach. And her hair swings over her shoulder, reaching the skin on my ribs. Tickling it like a feather. It\u2019s arousing. Sensual. And just like that, I\u2019m ready to go again.</p><p>Edward Cullen can take his stupid her**n and OD on it. Kate is my own personal brand of Viagra.</p><p>\u201cWhen I knew I was in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Have you noticed that Kate hasn\u2019t returned any of my \u201cI love you\u201ds? I certainly have. But like I said\u2014I try not to put much faith in words. Actions tell you more. And every move Kate makes tells me that we\u2019re on the same page.</p><p>Still, I\u2019m kind of curious.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>She leans forward and kisses my eyes...my cheeks...and then the tip of my nose before planting a sweet one on my lips. Then she leans back. \u201cDo you remember that day in my office? After Billy and I broke up, and I was crying?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI should have been devastated\u2014I was\u2014for a little while. But then you came in, and you put your arms around me. And I never wanted you to let go. It was like everything I\u2019d always needed, anything I\u2019d ever wanted, was right there in front of me. And that\u2019s when I knew. That, somehow, you\u2019d sucked me in, and I was totally in love with you.\u201d She laughs softly. \u201cI was so scared...\u201d</p><p>I bet.</p><p>\u201c...because I never in a million years thought you\u2019d feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>I brush my thumb across her beautiful bottom lip. \u201cI already did, Kate. I just didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and lays her head back down on the pillow. Her voice is soft and sincere.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You can be a real dumbass sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Was that what you thought she was going to say? Me neither.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>She cocks a brow smugly. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, if you look at our history\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she can finish, I\u2019ve got her pinned under me, her back to my chest. \u201cThose are fighting words Kate.\u201d My fingers travel down her ribs slowly. Torturously. She starts to squirm, and her ass rubs against my cock.</p><p>It\u2019s nice.</p><p>\u201cTake it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>My fingers move light and fast over her. Tickling her without mercy.</p><p>\u201cSay, \u2018Drew Evans is a god. A brilliant, genius god.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She bucks and shrieks, \u201cDrew! Stop! Stop!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t let up. \u201cAsk me nicely and maybe I will. Beg me for it.\u201d</p><p>She laughs even while she\u2019s screaming. \u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>You know what they say about never, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Oh yeah\u2014this is going to be fun.</p><p>She begged.</p><p>Did you have any doubt? Then she got on top of me, and I was the one begging.</p><p>Now I\u2019m lying with my head at Kate\u2019s feet, massaging them. Her head\u2019s on my thigh. Want to know how we ended up in this position? Nah\u2014I\u2019ll let you use your imagination. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, what did Alexandra say to you?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>I bend my elbow and rest my head on my hand so I can see Kate\u2019s face. She looks completely exhausted. Worn out. Un-gently used. It\u2019s a really good look for her.</p><p>\u201cThe other day, in your office, before you agreed to go out with me. You seemed different. More...receptive. Did she threaten you?\u201d</p> <p>She chuckles drowsily and cracks her eyes open. \u201cNo, no threats. She told me to think like the professional woman I am. To look at you like a business venture. That every investment has risks, but I have to weigh them against the payoff. She said based on your most recent performance, you\u2019re a risk worth taking.\u201d</p><p>Good strategy. I should have thought of that.</p><p>\u201cI should send her flowers.\u201d</p><p>Her hand rubs my thigh. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what convinced me to give you another chance.\u201d</p><p>My brow wrinkles. \u201cNo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did?\u201d</p><p>She swings around till her head\u2019s on my chest, and there\u2019s not a breath of space between us.</p><p>\u201cMackenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she pull it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me a story about how you took her to Central Park last summer. And a boy threw sand at her.\u201d</p> <p>I remember that day. I was just about to offer a six-year-old fifty bucks to dropkick the little f**ker.</p><p>\u201cAnd then he came up to her and said he was sorry. But she wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to play with him again. And she said that you told her that sometimes boys are stupid. And a lot of times they do stupid things. So, once in a while, she should take pity on them. And if they say they\u2019re sorry, she should give them a second chance. Not a third or a fourth...but you told her that everyone deserves a second chance.\u201d She pauses. And laughs. \u201cAnd then you told her if he did it again she should kick him in the balls.\u201d</p><p>All girls should know how to defend themselves. A well-aimed kick will do it every time.</p><p>It\u2019s kind of amazing, don\u2019t you think? If it wasn\u2019t for my perfect niece, we might not be here right now.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should buy her two ponies.\u201d</p><p>Kate smiles. And her eyes gaze up at me in that way I now crave. Like I mean everything to her.</p><p>\u201cYou have no sense of self-preservation, do you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, not at the moment. I\u2019m too focused on...fornication.\u201d</p> <p>She brings her knee up around my hip. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you so happy, Drew Evans.\u201d</p><p>My arms tighten around her. \u201cYou already have. After this? Heaven\u2019s going to be a major disappointment.\u201d</p><p>I dip my head and kiss her. It\u2019s wet and slow and wonderful. And she\u2019s kissing me back. Like she never wants to stop. And you know something?</p><p>That works really well for me.</p><p>So there you go. Thanks for coming along for the ride. But you really should leave now. No more living vicariously through my sex life. Because, remember when I said all guys talk to their friends about sex?</p><p>Well, we do.</p><p>But no guy talks to his friends about sex with his girlfriend. Ever.</p><p>You really think I want somebody jerking off to what Kate lets me do to her? Or what she does to me? No f**king way.</p><p>So this is where you get off. Not in the fantastic way I\u2019m about to, of course, but that\u2019s just too bad for you.</p><p>Still...after all the pointers I\u2019ve given you, I feel like I owe you some final words of wisdom. A lesson. Something meaningful. So here we go:</p><p>Assume nothing. Even if you think you know everything. Even if you\u2019re sure that you\u2019re right. Get confirmation. That whole \u201cass\u201d clich\u00e9 about assuming? It\u2019s right on the money. And if you\u2019re not careful, it could end up costing you the best thing that\u2019s ever going to happen to you.</p><p>And another thing\u2014don\u2019t get too comfortable. Take chances. Don\u2019t be afraid to lay it on the line. Even if you\u2019re happy. Even if you think life is freaking perfect.</p><p>Because I had a life once. A life I loved. It was consistent. Fun.</p><p>It was reliable. Safe.</p><p>And then one night, a beautiful dark-haired girl came along and blew it all to kingdom come. Now my life is a mess. In a good way. A giant unpredictable web of screw-ups and make-ups. Frustration and tenderness. Annoyance and affection. Lust and love.</p><p>But that\u2019s okay. Because as long as Kate Brooks is tangled up in that web with me?</p><p>Well, I can\u2019t imagine anything f**king better than that.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
