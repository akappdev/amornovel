And how many old adages can you cram into one sentence, anyway?\u201d she snorted.</p><p>Allie is my best friend, and has been since grade school, but she could be my worst enemy, too. Especially at times like this. She\u2019s an olive skinned beauty, topping out at five foot two, with short, thick black hair, currently highlighted with purple and cut in a pixie-ish way. She has shockingly bright blue eyes that dance with mischief, and she is feisty as hell. To top off all that cuteness? She\u2019s built like a brick shithouse, which for one, isn\u2019t fair, and two, who came up with that saying, anyway?</p> <p>I shook myself out of my stupor as Allie laughed quietly at my side. What? I mean, come on, when faced with a stack of deliciousness like the one standing not fifteen feet from me, wouldn\u2019t you be a little...I don\u2019t know, drooly?</p><p>Allie grabbed my arm and started dragging me further into the shop towards the counter. I started dragging my feet and fighting her, just then remembering why I wasn\u2019t happy with her in the first place.</p><p>\u201cAllie, I told you, I am not getting a tattoo! I promised you that I would come watch while you got your tongue, or toe, or whatever weird part of your body you decided on, pierced, but that\u2019s it!\u201d I tried to remove my arm from her grasp, which tightened as she dug her fingertips into me, but ended up just looking like a petulant child throwing a temper tantrum.</p><p>I drew up short when I realized that we had an audience. That stack of deliciousness I mentioned? Yeah. Staring at us. Smirking. Oh. My. God. I stopped struggling with Allie and she let go of my arm. I smoothed down my shirt, which had started riding up during my struggles, and cleared my throat. Allie rolled her eyes and continued walking to the counter, leaving me behind.</p><p>\u201c My friend here, er, well, there...,\u201d Allie looked over her shoulder at me and jerked her head in my direction, \u201cshe wants to get a tattoo.\u201d That stack of deliciousness glanced my way and gave me a small wink. (Whoa!) \u201cBut, she\u2019s kind of scared.\u201d</p> <p>I bristled a bit at that. What? Scared? Me? Pshaw...ok, yeah. I was. What of it? I mean, who really wants to spend, like, hours with someone digging sharp pointy things that buzz rather loudly into their skin?</p><p>\u201cAw, sugar, don\u2019t be scared,\u201d the stack of deliciousness said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come on up here with me and pick something out? I\u2019ll do you myself, and I promise, I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Talk about a double entendre...</p><p>Stack of deliciousness had a voice that was smooth as silk and rich as sin. And Lord, those eyes of his! Intense smoky, blue-grey eyes stared at me from under a shock of unruly black hair that swept down over his right eye. He was wearing a black, long sleeved t-shirt with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows. I could see black swirls of ink on both of his arms, but couldn\u2019t make out any specific designs without moving closer. He had a silver ring piercing his left lower lip, which made me unconsciously trace the tip of my tongue over my own lip. Which made him quirk his eyebrow at me. Ooh.</p><p>I noticed Allie looking pointedly in my direction before swinging her attention back to Stack. \u201cSo, yeah, Emma\u2019s going to come up here and pick something out, but until she actually moves her ass, I\u2019d like to see about getting my tongue pierced. Do you do those, too?</p><p>Stack glanced at Allie. \u201cYeah, we do that. Brandon is free right now, too, so I\u2019ll get you set up with him and then see what we can do about green eyes over there.\u201d He sent a look in my direction that dared me to come closer. Then he looked back at Allie and handed her some paperwork to fill out. \u201cJust answer those questions honestly, please, and then sign and date at the bottom.\u201d Looking back to me, he asked, \u201cSo, sugar, you just gonna stand there all day?\u201d</p> <p>I took a deep breath and decided that I couldn\u2019t back down from the challenge in his eyes. I mentally coached myself that I wasn\u2019t scared, that I could do this. (I was so lying to myself) I held my head high and started to make my way through the lobby/waiting area towards the counter. Which was a Bad. Idea. Apparently, I shouldn\u2019t have held my head so high, and instead should have watched where I was going. Maybe then I would have noticed the small, low table sitting beside a comfy looking black, leather couch. But I didn\u2019t, so in the next instant, my shin caught the edge of the table, which unbalanced me, and I face planted into the floor. Ouch.</p><p>Okay, so anyone who knows me knows that I am not graceful at all. That\u2019s why they call me Grace. Well, not really...just when I fall. Which is, ironically, a lot, seeing as how I can barely stand steady on my own two feet, let alone walk straight! And that\u2019s why I\u2019m now laying face first in silent mortification in the middle of a tattoo parlor floor, listening to Allie shrieking my name, and what sounded like a herd of elephants running towards me.</p><p>Strong hands grabbed me and started to turn me over and help me sit up. Allie, standing behind Stack (ohmigod! he\u2019s touching me!) gasps and covers her mouth with her hand in shock.</p><p>\u201cEmma, you\u2019re bleeding,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I put my hand up to my face and gingerly started to poke around, trying to determine the origin of said blood. Stack grabbed my hand, pulling it quickly from my face. I looked up (and I mean UP! He\u2018s gotta be at least six foot three!) at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cSugar, you busted your lip when you fell. C\u2019mon, lets go back here and get you cleaned up.\u201d Stack led me past the counter to the back area and into a spacious room that surprisingly reminded me of a cross between a dentist\u2019s office and a hospital. The walls were a deep burgundy with black and white accents, and one whole wall was taken up by photos of what I assumed to be tattoos that he had done.</p><p>As Stack moved about the room gathering things to doctor me with, Allie sat beside me on the dentist\u2019s chair (what else would it be called?) and tried not to laugh. I shot her a glare, daring her to giggle, just once.</p><p>At that moment, both Allie and I gaped at the doorway where another stack of deliciousness now stood. He looked like Stack, was built like Stack, with the same color hair and those intense smoky, blue-grey eyes, but while Stack\u2019s hair was longish, this new Stack\u2019s hair was closely cropped to his head, and he had a scruffy kind of five o\u2019clock shadow going on.</p> <p>\u201cLuke, there\u2019s a client sheet up front on the counter for an Allison McCormick to get a tongue piercing done. But no Allison. Where\u2019d she go?\u201d</p><p>Stack (Luke apparently?) grinned at New Stack and waved his hand at Allie. \u201cThat\u2019s Allison, Brandon, and this,\u201d looking over to me, \u201cis Emma. Right?\u201d I nodded. \u201cEmma decided she was falling for me and busted her lip.\u201d He smiled slyly and winked at me.</p><p>Brandon looked over grinning and, noticing the blood on my lip said, \u201c Ouch! Damn, that sucks.\u201d He then glanced over to Allie and asked her if she was ready. Allie nodded and started to get up off the chair.</p><p>As she leaned past me, I whispered, \u201cClose your mouth and wipe your chin. Geez, McCormick.\u201d She shot me a dirty look and walked out with Brandon.</p><p>It was then that it hit me. I was alone. With Stack. Er, Luke. I looked up as he moved close to me and lightly grasped my chin in his hand. God, his touch was electric...He put a cool moist cloth against my lip and dabbed at the blood still slowly welling from the shallow gash. I winced at the sting and sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm, thanks for helping me, and sorry...for that..this...\u201d I waved my hand vaguely as I raised my eyes to his and watched as he slowly smiled.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. It doesn\u2019t look too bad, just split it a little bit. I\u2019m Luke, by the way,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Emma,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cWell, Emma, you ready to get inked?\u201d Luke asked, then winked.</p><p>I blushed and nodded my head slightly. He helped me up off the chair and we walked out to the counter again so I could look through the books. I had had an idea of what I might want, in the event that I was not able to talk Allie out of her \u201clet\u2019s tattoo Emma\u201d idea, so I didn\u2019t think I would even need to look at them.</p><p>\u201cI want just a few small stars,\u201d I pointed behind my ear on my left side, \u201chere. Nothing big, nothing fancy. But before I do this, I need to know how bad its going to hurt.\u201d I was serious. I\u2019ve never had a tattoo before and I am not fond of needles or pain in any shape or form. Except maybe a little pain in the bed...never mind. I digress.</p><p>Luke smiled and nodded. \u201cWe really don\u2019t need to even look in the books then. Here, give me a sec and I\u2019ll draw something up real quick.\u201d He reached behind him to grab a pad of drawing paper.</p><p>As Luke started sketching out an idea for my tattoo, I heard Allie squeal somewhere in the back and then footsteps running towards me. I turned around in time to see her bounce to a stop in front of me, grinning from ear to ear. \u201cWell?\u201d I asked her, waiting for her to show me whatever body modification she\u2019d decided on.</p><p>She gingerly opened her mouth up and stuck her tongue out. Sure enough, there was a gleaming silver stud stuck in her tongue. She slowly pulled her tongue back in her mouth and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d I asked her, nonchalantly, figuring that if that hurt really bad, then a tattoo is going to be worse, and it might be time for me to run screaming out the door.</p><p>\u201cEhhh, it stung a little, but wasn\u2019t too bad! So did you pick a tattoo yet? Cause we aren\u2019t leaving here without you getting one.\u201d Allie gave me that look, the stubborn one that I knew meant that she was going to get her way come hell or high water.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, Luke is drawing something up for me now,\u201d I sighed</p><p>Allie squealed again. \u201cYay! Cant wait to see it!\u201d Then in a low tone she asked, \u201cWasn\u2019t Brandon yummy? I wanted to have something other than his fingers in my mouth, if ya know what I mean...\u201d She waggled her eyebrows like crazy.</p><p>\u201cMy, God, Allie! You slut!\u201d I gasped. I quickly turned around to make sure that Luke didn\u2019t hear her, or my outburst. Seeing the smirk on his face as he studiously sketched on the pad made me sink onto a stool by the counter and put my head in my hands.</p><p>Brandon came around the corner and smiled at Allie before asking me about my lip. I told him that it was fine, though it sounded a little muffled from the way I was hiding my face.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m headed down the street to grab some lunch. You got this?\u201d Brandon asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good, thanks. Bring me back a sandwich or something, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. See you ladies later!\u201d Brandon said as he walked out the door.</p><p>Allie sighed wistfully and poked me in the shoulder. \u201cAre you done hiding yet? I think Luke here is waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>I raised my head and saw that Luke was watching me with a half-smile on his lips. He picked up the pad and tossed it in front of me. Forgetting about my lip, I grinned. (Ouch, that hurt!) On the pad was a little cluster of five stars, all different sizes, but none more than a half inch in diameter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, Luke! Thanks!\u201d I looked up at him as he grabbed the pad back and started the process to print out the transfer sheet to put on my skin.</p><p>As he worked, I looked over at Allie and gripped her hand. \u201cYou are not leaving me, right? You promise to hold my hand the whole time?\u201d I was desperately squeezing her fingers together and she was trying frantically to pull them away.</p><p>\u201cEmma, let go! Of course I\u2019m going to stay. I gotta see hot stuff over there do his thing!\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes at her and let go of her fingers. Luke cleared his throat behind us and I turned around sheepishly to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cReady?,\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>Looking back, that tattoo wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it would be. I managed not to mangle Allie\u2019s hands too bad (she only screamed once) and it turned out seriously cute and sexy sitting there behind my ear. Not to mention, having Luke bent over me as he worked, even though he was plying needles in my tender flesh, was rather erotic. When everything was all finished, I hopped up off the chair (table?) and thanked Luke profusely.</p><p>After giving us both our after care instructions, we walked out to the front to pay and say goodbye. Surprisingly, I found myself slightly saddened by the thought that I wouldn\u2019t be seeing Luke again any time soon. Turned out, I was wrong.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>I rolled over in bed and reached blindly for my ringing cell phone charging on the nightstand beside my bed. As I grabbed it, I got a look at the clock and realized that its almost midnight. At that point, two things strike me. One, who the hell is calling me this late? And two, My God, I\u2019m pathetic. I think I\u2019m the oldest 29 year old in America since it\u2019s a Saturday night and I\u2019ve been in bed since 9:30. Shaking my head at myself, I hit the answer key on the screen, wincing as I pressed it too hard against my ear, and in turn, my tattoo. Ouchie.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d The frantic voice of my sister whispered harshly into my ear.</p><p>\u201cJenna? What the hell is going on? Is everything okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, well, can you come over and sit here with the kids? I need you to get here, like, yesterday. And don\u2019t park in the driveway! Can you park on the street and maybe, I don\u2019t know, sneak over the fence and through the back door?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord. Why did I answer my phone? Knowing better than to even ask for an explanation, I replied, \u201cYeah, Jenna. I\u2019ll be there in ten. And I will try to shimmy my big ass over the fence and through your back door. But you owe me for thi-\u201d</p><p>Jenna cut me off with a breathy, \u201cOkay-thanks-get-here-bye,\u201d and hung up on me.</p><p>Geez. You wouldn\u2019t think that Jenna was the oldest of us kids, but she is. She really is an intelligent, calm, cool and collected woman, but sometimes...I worry about her. Jenna is my oldest sibling at 33 years old. She\u2019s married to Noah Michaels, and has been since she was 22 and he was 23. Whirlwind romance, picture book wedding, and three years later, out pops my bouncing baby nephew, Jarrod Allen. Fast forward four more years and add a pinch of surprise! and here we have my now four year old niece, Hayden Michele.</p><p>Jenna looks like Barbie\u2019s best friend. You know, the brunette one that\u2019s just as pretty as Barbie but has dark hair? Sad thing is, no one can ever remember her name, so you know she had to be extremely jealous of Barbie. (I mean, come on, who wouldn\u2019t be, though? That little bitch has everything!) Jenna is shorter than me at five foot four, which is not a really big difference, considering I\u2019m only five foot six. Okay, so its actually five foot five and a half, but that really doesn\u2019t matter, right? She\u2019s also built like a brick shithouse (we\u2019ve discussed this term before), but seeing as how she looks like Barbie\u2019s friend, that would be obvious. Like me, she\u2019s got the jade green eyes of our mother, and the dark hair of our father. Currently, hers hangs somewhere around her shoulders, whenever she takes it out of the messy topknot that is usually sitting haphazardly on top of her head. Mine is now reaching the middle of my back in long, thick dark brown waves, which sounds gorgeous. Truth be told? Its not really. Especially if its rainy or humid or you live in Ohio. Which I do. Hello frizzies! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The big difference? She\u2019s tiny and I\u2019m a size twelve. On a good day, that is. On bad days, like bloated period days, or days when I\u2019ve decided that chocolate is calling my name nonstop, which, let\u2019s face it, is most days, then I\u2019m more of a fourteen. Not that I\u2019m fat, but since the images that society forces down our throats these days tell us that if you aren\u2019t built like a stick with boobs (bee sting size), then you are not skinny, but I am a healthy kind of curvy. I\u2019ve always said that I was just born in the wrong century, cause back then? I would have been the shit!</p><p>Sighing in exasperation at what I was about to walk into, I pulled up to the street outside my sister\u2019s house. I parked and got out, heading into the darkness of the trees lining the fence, knowing I\u2019m about to have to make an ass out of myself. I grabbed the top of the chain link fence and started jamming my toes into the holes and climbing. I got to the top and started to throw my leg over when all of a sudden a hand grabbed my ankle and I let out a terrified squeak.</p><p>\u201cHoly jeebus, shut the hell up, would you?\u201d Jenna smacked at my leg until I had to growl at her to stop.</p><p>\u201cJenna, you idiot, what are you doing? And why the hell do I need to climb your stupid fence anyway? Where\u2019s Noah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust hurry up and get down here. I don\u2019t have much time to get into place, since you took your sweet ass time getting here.\u201d Jenna moved back from the fence to allow me room to flip my other leg up and over the top.</p><p>Just as I got my leg over and started scrambling for a toe hold, my hands slipped and I fell backwards into the grass. Not giving me time to catch my breath, Jenna reached down and started pulling on my arms trying to get me to my feet. Once I got up, she grabbed me and we made a mad dash to the back door. Once we got to the door, she shoved me to the side and looked frantically both ways before sliding the glass door open. She reached back out and pulled me through the door.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she began breathlessly, \u201cI think Noah is cheating on me. He just told me that he has to leave shortly because he got called in to work. I\u2019m going to hide in the back of the car so I can see where he goes, so I need you to stay here with the kids. Got it? Good.\u201d Jenna started to turn away from me, but I grabbed her arm and turned her around to face me.</p><p>Putting my hand on her forehead to check for a fever, I asked, \u201cJenna, are you sick? Or maybe drunk? What the fuck have you been smoking? You\u2019re high, right? Cause there is no way in hell Noah is cheating on you. He\u2019s a detective for cripes sake, so he probably does have to go into work.\u201d I rolled my eyes at her as she ripped her arm out of my grasp and started to stomp away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back sometime, I\u2019m not sure when. You know where the blankets and pillows are, kids are asleep, duh, so...\u201d and then she walked out to the garage without a backwards glance.</p> <p>A split second later I heard footsteps thudding down the stairs and scrambled to cram myself into the pantry to avoid Noah as he walked towards the garage. God only knows what was going on with my sister, but far be it for me to ruin her carefully laid plans. Not that they really could be called carefully laid...but you get the idea.</p><p>I hear Noah call out, \u201cJenna? Honey? I gotta go, okay? Call me before you go to bed, baby, I love you. Jenna?\u201d Footsteps start to walk back towards the stairs, hesitate for a second, then I hear Noah sigh and walk out the door to the garage. I stay crammed into the pantry until I hear the garage door go up, the car back out, and the door shut again.</p><p>Shaking my head, I headed for the linen closet to make up the spare bedroom and get back to sleep, knowing that Jenna hasn\u2019t thought about when Noah comes home and finds me there and Jenna hiding somewhere in his car. That should prove to be an interesting conversation!</p><p>Not twenty minutes later, when I finally get settled and start to drift off to sleep, my cell phone rings. I groaned. Not again!</p><p>\u201cHello, Jenna,\u201d I sighed as I answered, not bothering to even look at the caller ID.</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m hiding in the backseat of the car under his old raincoat. He so doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m in here! Anyway, he\u2019s stopped at a Snack \u2018N Shack to grab a couple things, but I heard him on the phone talking to someone. He said something about getting ready cause it could take all night, and then something about saving him a cigar.\u201c Her voice turned whiney. \u201cEmma! He doesn\u2019t smoke! And what could take all night? See? He\u2019s cheating, I know...gotta go.\u201d The phone clicked off in my ear without another word.</p> <p>I pulled the phone away from my ear and tried not to rattle my brain shaking my head too much at my sister\u2019s crazy antics. And she\u2019s supposed to be the responsible mother one? Sheesh.</p><p>I woke up what felt like mere minutes later to see Noah standing in the door, looking at me in that disappointed, I\u2019m a cop, you\u2019re the bad guy, I want to put you in jail and throw away the key kind of way. Judging by the light creeping around the edges of the curtains, it must be morning. I sheepishly shrugged my shoulders and crawled out of the bed.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Noah.\u201d I lightly kissed his cheek as I passed him, intent on escaping to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cEmma, is there any way you want to tell me why your sister ended up crouched on the back floor board of the car under my rain coat last night? And maybe why your car is parked down the street by the fence?\u201d Noah didn\u2019t sound happy, but then again, I probably wouldn\u2019t be happy having a lunatic for a wife, either.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cGive me a minute and then I need coffee for this. Lots of it.\u201d I heard him walk away from me as I shut the bathroom door behind me.</p><p>After washing my face and trying to tame my hair with my hands a bit, I left the bathroom and followed the heavenly scent of coffee to the kitchen. I needed to get my Tattoo Goo out of my car and take care of my tattoo, but I figured that could wait until I got home. When I walked into the room, I had to stop and stare for a minute at the chaos spread before me. Jenna was sprawled face down at the table asleep while Jarrod sat staring at her from across the table. He was eating the biggest bowl of cereal I think I\u2019ve ever seen in my natural life. Hayden was standing beside Jenna\u2019s chair steadily poking her lolling head with a noodle (not the pasta kind, the long Styrofoam tubey kind that you play with in a pool). God only knows where she managed to get her hands on one of those, and at her feet was a gallon of milk that was looking suspiciously blue.</p><p>Shaking my head, I grabbed the noodle out of Hayden\u2019s hand and swiped the milk jug off the floor. Gazing into it\u2019s depths, I decided that it wasn\u2019t safe to keep, so I poured it down the sink.</p><p>\u201cHayden, its not nice to poke mommy in the head while she\u2019s sleeping. Go wash your hands, sweetie and we\u2019ll get you something for breakfast. How did the milk get blue anyway?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Hayden shrugged her tiny little shoulders at me and said, \u201cI don\u2019 know, Aun\u2019 Emmy.\u201d</p><p>I watched as she clasped her hands behind her back, fingers looking a little blueberryish. Then I noticed the two empty packets of Blue Raspberry Koolaid crumpled between Jenna\u2019s slippered feet under the table. Mystery solved. Well, at least I knew the what. The why? Hmm. Probably will never know.</p><p>Turning to Jarrod I asked, \u201cCould you have found a bigger bowl, dude? You\u2019re gonna make yourself sick trying to eat that much. Where\u2019d your dad go?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the back porch drinking coffee and waiting on you,\u201d he said. Turning back to his bowl of cereal and steady watch of his passed out mother, he effectively let me know that the conversation was over.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on your sister for a minute, would you? And share some of that cereal with her. Oh, and don\u2019t let her poke your mom anymore, either, okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jarrod nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I turned and made my way out the door to talk to Noah. Not that I was looking forward to this conversation, because, honestly, I had no clue what had happened last night with the exception of my falling on my ass after climbing the fence, hiding in the pantry, and listening to Jenna justify playing hide and seek with her husband without cluing him into the game.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Noah began, as he slid a cup of coffee over to me.</p><p>I held up my hand. \u201cIt would be easier and quicker if you just filled me in on the hours between when I fell off your fence, got manhandled by your wife, crammed myself into the pantry, fielded strange ass phone calls in the middle of the night, and now, when I woke up feeling like you were about to arrest me.\u201d</p><p>Noah quirked his eyebrow at me. \u201cYou climbed the fence and hid in the...never mind. Your sister,\u201d he sighed in exasperation, \u201chid on the floorboard in the back of my car last night. Under my raincoat. Like I wouldn\u2019t notice a wiggling lump in the back of the car. I mean, she does realize that I\u2019m a detective, right, Emma?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and watched as my sister opened the door to come out and join us. Her hair looked like she\u2019d stuck a finger in a light socket somewhere, and it wasn\u2019t pretty.</p><p>Noah continued, watching his wife with an unreadable expression. \u201cI stopped at the Snack \u2018N Shack to get some munchies because I got called in to cover for one of the guys who\u2019s wife went into labor. We were doing a stake out for this case we\u2019ve been working on, but since your sister decided to stow away like Little Orphan Annie in my car, I had to hang back and let someone else take point. So, I decided to teach your sister a lesson.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes widened at this, and I glanced at my sister who was watching her husband with that look. You know, the one that says, \u201cyou say another word and not only will I never put out for you again, but I will bury you in the back yard.\u201d</p><p>Noah said, \u201cI drove around until I got to Rider Park and parked in the back. Then I sat there to see how long it would be before Jenna realized that I knew she was there. I noticed the bag of chips being drug slowly into the backseat by a black glove covered hand,\u201d Noah drawled. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, and it took all I had not to laugh at the crunching sounds emanating from under my rain coat.\u201d He looked over to where Jenna was still standing and his eyes started to sparkle. \u201cI even let her get away with stealing my slushie while I was pretending to get something out of the trunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I was hungry and thirsty you bought all the good junk food that we never get to have in the house. Someone has to be the responsible parent and make the kids eat healthy,\u201d Jenna hollered indignantly.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at this and asked her, \u201cSo did you notice what your kids were eating this morning while you were passed out like a coed after a frat party on the table?\u201d</p><p>She glared at me and Noah before plopping down in Noah\u2019s lap and stealing his coffee.</p><p>Noah grinned and patted her thigh fondly. \u201cI was content to let her stay cramped up back there for as long as possible, but apparently she got bored. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore when I started hearing pig snorts and birds and busted out laughing.\u201d</p> <p>He started chuckling even harder when Jenna shrugged her shoulders and said, \u201cAngry Birds. Love that game.\u201d</p><p>I started laughing and couldn\u2019t stop because of the mental images I had popping around in my head.</p><p>\u201cSo I reached back and jerked the raincoat off of her. She just sat up and glared at me like I was interrupting her. Then I got in the backseat and pulled her up with me and we talked. And then we...\u201d Noah waggled his eyebrows and grinned lasciviously at Jenna. \u201cSo next time she calls you for a harebrained idea like last night? You can still come running,\u201d he said, laughing.</p><p>Jenna blushed and ducked her head against his shoulder. I groaned. Time for me to go!</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>The rest of my weekend passed without incident (which was a relief, for once) and Monday came way too early. Guess I should really learn to put down my book and actually go to sleep, right?</p><p>I walked into the office where I worked, my heels click clacking against the tile. I love that sound. Weird, right? But it makes me feel professional and sexy. I had worn my favorite sweater dress today, a soft smoky gray color that has a fitted top and sharp pleats that flow from just under my boobs to just above my knees. I paired it with black leggings and my high heeled black boots with the cute little double silver buckles on each side. I had swept my hair up in a messy topknot at the back of my head, and had put on a minimal amount of makeup. Usually, I only outline my eyes in kohl, because that makes them really stand out more than they already do from their unusual color. Already I could tell it was going to be a busy day because the phones were ringing off the hook.</p><p>I\u2019m a legal secretary for an attorney in the town where I live. I live in Phillus. Its not a big town, kind of small, really, in the southern part of Ohio. At least once a year some genius gets the bright idea to spray paint the town sign over the \u201ci\u201d with an \u201ca\u201d, and until the township catches it, we live in \u201cPhallus\u201d, Ohio. Doesn\u2019t that make you wanna visit?</p> <p>I snatch the phone up as I plop down at my desk. \u201cGood morning, Floyd Grim\u2019s office, may I help you?\u201d I said breathlessly into the phone.</p><p>A creaky, scratchy voice yells in my ear, \u201cEmma? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cYes, Mrs. Allen. It\u2019s me, Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, I cant find Fluffers. I think that rat bastard Doc next door took him again,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Allen, we don\u2019t handle those kinds of cases. I told you that last week. And remember? Doc is the town vet, he probably picked him up again to give him his shots,\u201d I told her in a gentle voice.</p><p>Mrs. Allen calls at least once a week, and the conversations usually have something to do with her forty-five pound cat, Fluffers. A couple of years ago, she got ambitious and brought him into the office because \u201che\u201d wanted to sue Doc for neutering him without his \u201cmommy\u2019s\u201d permission. I think the cat weighed almost as much as Mrs. Allen, and he was a nasty gray furball that I think was white at one time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think Mrs. Allen takes care of him as much as she can for someone who was born in 1824 (I\u2019m kidding...it was more like 1482) but Doc actually sneaks and helps her out.</p><p>Mrs. Allen wasn\u2019t done yet. \u201cWell, can I sue him for that? Fluffers doesn\u2019t like needles.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and leaned back in my chair. My other lines started to ring and I almost wept in relief.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Allen, you cant sue him for that, its helping Fluffers. My other lines are ringing, so I have to go, okay? I\u2019ll talk to you next week,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Emma. I\u2019m sure that rat bastard will have done something more to poor Fluffers by then. Thanks, dear.\u201d With that, Mrs. Allen hung the phone up in my ear.</p><p>I hit the button for the next line and gave my greeting. Silence. Oh, well, guess they will call back. Reaching to hit the next line key, I smiled as my boss walked in the door. He\u2019s a nice guy, been practicing law for all my life and even more of his. He\u2019s absent minded about a lot of things, but when it comes to his cases, he\u2019s sharp as a tack. And he pays pretty good, so... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grabbing a file off the counter that I threw up there for him, Floyd waved and ambled back out the door as I answered the phone again.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Floyd Grim\u2019s office, may I help you?\u201d I said into the phone.</p><p>\u201cEwwa!\u201d someone yelled into my ear. Huh?</p><p>\u201cEwwa, ith Awwie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAllie?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeth. Awwie. I goth a pwobwem,\u201d Allie whined into the phone.</p><p>Okay. \u201cAllie, what\u2019s going on? And why are you talking like that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI nee\u2019 yew to mee\u2019 me on yew wunth bweak ath my houth. Pweath,\u201d Allie begged.</p><p>This should be interesting. After promising I would be at her house at noon, I hung up the phone with Allie and got to work. The morning flew by in between phone calls and clients, and in no time I had to meet Allie. I grabbed my keys and locked up the office for lunch, heading out to my car.</p> <p>I pulled up at Allie\u2019s house in my cute, little yellow VW Bug and she came running down her front steps holding a paper towel up to her face. Now I was worried.</p><p>She got in the car and told me, \u201cThathoo thop, pweath. I wipp\u2019th my thung.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her in shock until she grunted and smacked at my thigh to get me going. Putting the car in drive, I headed downtown to the tattoo shop. (I\u2019m assuming that I heard her correctly. Its kind of hard to understand someone when they\u2019re holding their tongue with a paper towel.)</p><p>After about ten minutes, we pulled up at Skin Deep, the tattoo shop that I didn\u2019t think I would be frequenting again any time soon after Friday night. Especially for the fact that I embarrassed myself beyond belief in there.</p><p>Allie and I got out of the car and walked into the shop. I didn\u2019t see anyone at the counter right away, but after a minute, Brandon came around the corner looking even better than before (Either that or my eyes were so starved for eye candy they enhanced his deliciousness).</p><p>His face broke into a grin as he shouted, \u201cHey! It\u2019s Crash and Allison! What\u2019s up, ladies?\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes but couldn\u2019t help but return his grin as I pointed at Allie and said, \u201cWell, Allie has done something to \u201cwip\u201d her \u201cthung\u201d, which I am assuming translates to mean she ripped her tongue. How? Not sure. But I am dying to find out!\u201d I turned to grin at Allie, who looked so pathetic that I busted out laughing.</p><p>Allie shot me a dirty look and then turned to Brandon with the most pathetic face (even more pathetic than she looked ten seconds ago, which I didn\u2019t think was possible) I\u2019ve ever seen on a person. Brandon came around the counter and gently pulled Allie\u2019s fingers and the paper towel away from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you should be able to talk a little bit better without your fingers and everything in your mouth. So what did you do?,\u201d Brandon asked Allie.</p><p>\u201cI was eating a fudge bar and when I licked it, well, you know...when you eat a popsicle and you put it in your mouth and then kinda suck and pull it back out? Know what I mean?\u201d Allie trailed off, waiting for someone to acknowledge that we knew what she was talking about.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going there. And if Brandon\u2019s eyes got any bigger, they were going to pop out of his head. I didn\u2019t think his lips could stretch any further either, judging by the huge grin he had plastered on his face.</p><p>Allie continued earnestly, \u201c Well, I was eating the fudge bar and when I pulled it out, the ball to my tongue ring kinda dug into it and I felt this excruciating sharp pain in my tongue. Then I tasted the blood, which, hello, does not go with chocolate. Guess I could never be a vampire, huh? Anyway, I looked in the mirror and \u2018lo and behold, I ripped my tongue!\u201d The last part ended on a wail.</p><p>Brandon lost the battle and burst out laughing. I was more polite and turned away before losing it. Which earned me a quick smack to the back of my shoulder. What the hell, man!</p><p>We tried to control our laughter as Allie stood there and glared at us before asking Brandon, \u201cWell? Can you fix it?\u201d I swear she even stomped her foot.</p> <p>Brandon guffawed even louder before wiping tears from his eyes and then taking a deep breath to get himself under control. (I was still giggling)</p><p>He put his hand out for Allie to take and told her, \u201cCome on, Allie, let\u2019s check you out.\u201d</p><p>Brandon and Allie took off down the hall ahead of me, turning into a different room than the one I was in last time with Luke. I turned to follow them, letting out a muffled \u201coomph\u201d when I ran into a brick wall. Well, it was a soft brick wall. A soft, solid, living, breathing brick wall. And boy did it smell good, too.</p><p>I felt hands grab my hips to steady me as a deep, silken voice spoke in my ear, \u201cHey, careful there. Wouldn\u2019t want you to bust your lip again, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God. It was Luke. And he knew who I was. Eek!</p><p>I pulled back and looked up into his gorgeous eyes, giving him a sheepish grin. He was saying something, but the intense smoky blue-grey of his eyes drew me in, mesmerizing me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen that color before, but I think its my new favorite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d I stammer.</p><p>Luke grinned at me, shaking his head. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Something wrong with your tattoo?\u201d As he said this, he lightly grabbed my chin between his thumb and fingers and turned my face to the side. I felt his other hand come up and lightly trace the outside edge of my tattoo.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re here because Allie, believe it or not, ripped her tongue while eating a fudge bar. Brandon has her in the back looking at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...okay...\u201d Luke drew out the words in confusion, as if he wasn\u2019t sure I was being serious. Sadly, I was.</p><p>\u201cCan I go on back with her?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. I\u2019ve gotta see this; it\u2018s definitely not the usual story we hear!\u201d</p><p>We walked back to where Brandon had taken Allie and as I went to enter the room, I felt Luke\u2019s hand rest at the small of my back. Whoa. Yup. There goes that electricity again, sending shivers skittering up my spine.</p><p>Allie was looking up at Brandon with a scowl on her face while he stood doubled over from laughing so hard. He had tears pouring from his eyes.</p><p>Luke asked, \u201cWhat the hell, girlie?\u201d and grinned at Allie.</p><p>Brandon wiped his eyes and straightened up, looking over at me and grinning widely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen people rip their tongues before. But none by eating a fudge bar!\u201d Brandon lost it again until Allie reached out and smacked him on his shoulder. He tried to reign in his mirth, but was failing miserably.</p><p>I looked over at Luke who was trying his damndest to keep from laughing and couldn\u2019t help but smile at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Brandon wheezed, catching sight of the dismayed expression building on Allie\u2019s face. He stopped laughing and walked over to cup her cheek in the palm of his hand. \u201cIts just a little tear, didn\u2019t do much damage, and as long as you don\u2019t go sucking on any more fudge bars for the next week or two, it should heal fine. Might have a small scar, but the tongue literally is the fastest healing muscle in the body.\u201d He stooped down to look into Allie\u2019s eyes, watching her expression.</p><p>Allie replied quietly, \u201cOkay. Thanks, Brandon. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>I could tell that she was affected by his gentle touch, but hell, so was I. He was being so sweet...well, now he was, since he wasn\u2019t laughing uproariously in her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then it happened. I should have known it. I mean, I was thinking it in the back of my mind, but Allie\u2019s my best friend and even I would never have said it out loud. Ever.</p><p>Brandon pulled back, opened his mouth and said, \u201cAre you sure it was just a fudge bar you were sucking on? I\u2019m just sayin\u2019...\u201d he trailed off as he watched Allie\u2019s eyes flash fire and then took a step back.</p><p>I gasped at the same time I heard Luke groan, \u201cOh, Brandon, no...\u201d and then the resounding smack of a palm meeting cheek in what I\u2019ll term, \u201cThe Slap Heard \u2018Round the World.\u201d It was loud!</p><p>I opened my eyes, since I had squeezed them tightly shut knowing what was coming, and watched as Brandon reached up to grab his cheek, mumbling, \u201cFUCK\u201d under his breath while Allie stood there shaking her hand. I looked over at Luke and saw him standing with his head down, one hand covering his eyes, the other rubbing the back of his neck.</p> <p>He dropped his hands suddenly and glanced my way. Our eyes caught and held and I wondered if it was getting hot in there, or if it was just me? Even more confusing was the fact that my panties had started to dampen suspiciously, but my cha-chi hadn\u2019t seen any action in so long, I figured the damn thing would have been dry as the desert by now.</p><p>I started as Brandon cleared his throat and softly said, \u201c I\u2019m sorry, Allie. That was way out of line, and I didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d He cut his eyes down to hers and continued, \u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>Allie took a breath, nodded, and retorted, \u201cFor future reference, if I had something much more interesting than a fucking fudge bar in my mouth, I\u2019d have said-\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat loudly, diverting the disaster that I knew was headed out of Allie\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cFor further reference,\u201d she said as if I hadn\u2019t just interrupted her, \u201cif you want to question my intelligence as to if I know the difference between something soft, cold, creamy, and sweet versus hot, smooth, velvety and hard pushing past my lips...\u201d Allie trailed off as she sidled closer to Brandon and smiled slyly up at him. \u201cThen I assure you, I do,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>She reached up and ran her finger lightly down the bridge of Brandon\u2019s nose before sashaying towards the door.</p><p>I felt the wall behind me and leaned back against it for support, trying not to laugh at Brandon\u2019s stunned expression and the way he shifted uncomfortably and stared out the door after Allie. My laughter died in my throat as I put my head back against the wall, only to realize that the wall was breathing...(Oh, God, not again...)</p><p>I turned my head slightly to the right and found myself face to face with Luke, his lips curved slightly upwards in a crooked smile. I froze for a second and then stepped quickly away from him before I did the first thing that had popped in my head, which was lick his lip where the silver hoop sat.</p><p>He reached out to steady me before saying, \u201cWell, that was interesting.\u201d He looked at Brandon , who was still standing there in stunned silence, before turning back to me and asking, \u201cso, you ready for your next tattoo?\u201d</p><p>I gulped. \u201cUh...no, not quite, but thanks...\u201d I stuttered before turning to head out the door to see where Allie had gone.</p><p>Before I got too far, strong fingers reached out and grabbed my wrist, pulling me back to face Luke. I looked down at my wrist where his fingers encircled my flesh before letting my gaze roam upwards, taking in the thick, black lines of ink swirled in an intricate tribal design on his forearm, before disappearing under the sleeve of his long sleeved henley that he had pushed up to his elbows. I noticed lines of script positioned on the inside of his wrist but couldn\u2019t make out what they said.</p> <p>I dipped my head to look closer at the lines tattooed on his wrist but was stopped by his other hand as it came up to lightly turn my face up to his. I blinked at the heat in his eyes.</p><p>A small smile started to quirk Luke\u2019s lips again as he said, \u201cDinner. Tonight. Say, seven o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>Huh? He was asking me out? Ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod...this can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>I managed to swallow the lump that had formed in my throat (barely) and managed to squeak, \u201cOkay...yeah. Seven. Are you sure? I mean, you must be awfully busy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma. I\u2019m sure.\u201d Luke\u2019s smile grew wider as he took in the glazed look in my eyes.</p><p>He released my wrist and twined his fingers through mine instead, then pulled me out into the hall, walking toward the lobby. Allie was no where in sight, so I assumed she had already gone out to the car.</p><p>When we got to the front door, I turned to Luke and opened my mouth to protest that dinner wasn\u2019t necessary, but before I got a word out, he placed a finger gently over my lips, effectively shutting me up for the moment.</p><p>\u201cDinner. Seven. I\u2019ll pick you up. Where do you live?\u201d Luke murmured.</p> <p>I gave him my address, flushing as he tucked a stray strand of hair behind my ear, and walked out into the sunshine where Allie was waiting in my car.</p><p>When I got in the car, Allie turned to me expectantly and asked, \u201cWhat the hell took so long? You\u2019re gonna be late getting back to work!\u201d</p><p>Glancing at my watch, I groaned before putting the car in drive and tearing off towards Allie\u2019s house to drop her off and make a mad dash back to the office. As I drove, I filled Allie in with the unbelievable details of what happened after she left.</p><p>\u201cAiiyeeeee!\u201d Allie screamed excitedly. \u201cI cant believe he asked you out! Where are you going, what are you going to wear, are you gonna finally get some?\u201d The questions came fast off Allie\u2019s tongue.</p><p>\u201cMe, either, I don\u2019t know, clothes, I guess, and HELL NO!\u201d I replied. I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that Luke had even asked me out, let alone the thought of getting naked with him. Hell, one hour with me during dinner might render him comatose from boredom, and then I\u2019d be stuck doing all the work. Not that that\u2019s not how its always been with the douche bags I\u2019ve dated in the past. Let\u2019s just say that none of them have ever tickled me pink in the bedroom department.</p><p>I pulled up outside Allie\u2019s house and as she opened the door to get out she said, \u201cCall me with the details as soon as you get home. That\u2019s an order, Jensen.\u201d Sheesh.</p><p>I pulled away and headed back to the office, praying to anyone who might be listening to have mercy on me and not let me get pulled over.</p><p>Once I got back to the office, I didn\u2019t have much time to think about my date with Luke. The phone rang off the hook, I had about a million files to put away, and Floyd had been busy; he had dictated three tapes for me to transcribe.</p><p>At five o\u2019clock I pushed back from my desk, pulled files for the next day, and locked up the office. I headed home to get ready, my nerves starting to show themselves in full force.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>By quarter after six, I was putting the finishing touches on my makeup. My hair was twisted up into a messy chignon, and I was wearing a soft, black, fitted cowl neck sweater over my charcoal grey skinny jeans that were tucked down into my knee high, cuffed, black suede boots with a stacked heel. (I finally settled on these after trying on all sixteen other pairs of boots that I own. What can I say? I have a shoe fetish, and you don\u2019t even wanna know how many pairs of shoes I have on top of those sixteen pairs of boots. Its ridiculous; I need rehab.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By six-thirty I was sitting on the edge of my oversized, overstuffed armchair, anxiously watching the seconds tick by. My eyes were getting heavy from staring at the clock and I closed them briefly. Or not so briefly...</p><p>The chime of the doorbell pulled me from my dream. Blinking my eyes against the light from the lamp on the table beside my chair, I shook my head to clear it. Uh oh. It clicked in my head as to why someone was ringing my doorbell and I jumped out of the chair, frantically smoothing my clothes and patting my hair back into place.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I opened the door. My knees went weak at the sight of Luke standing there smiling at me. He looked even more delicious than ever in a dark grey button down shirt emblazoned with a gothic looking cross on the right side. It clung to him, hanging untucked over dark rinse jeans, and he wore black leather boots on his feet. Yum.</p><p>I leaned against the door jam, softly breathing, \u201cHey.\u201d</p> <p>His smile grew. \u201cHey,\u201d he said in that deep, rich voice of his, making my insides flutter. He started grinning at me as he raised his hand to gently trace the side of my face.</p><p>\u201cWere you sleeping?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I blinked. \u201cUmm...yeah. Sorry, I dozed off waiting...\u201d Wait. How did he know?</p><p>I told him to come in as I turned to look in the mirror hanging on the wall over my sideboard table. Face. Palm. The whole side of my face was flushed and creased with the imprint of my sweater sleeve. I closed my eyes and wished that the floor would open up and swallow me down.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Luke asked from behind me.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go,\u201d I replied. Hopefully the imprint would be off my face before we got wherever we were going.</p><p>I grabbed my purse, turned out the lights, and walked out the door, checking the lock behind me. Luke grabbed my hand and held it as we walked out to his car.</p><p>Now, I\u2019m not real knowledgeable about cars. I can\u2019t look at one driving down the road in the middle of the night and tell you what kind it is just by the headlights shining in your face, like some of those fanatics out there can. But I can tell when someone has a nice car. And Luke\u2019s car was NICE. As in, new Camaro ZL1, midnight black with cherry red pinstripes nice. Wow.</p><p>I nodded in appreciation at the car and smiled up at Luke. He grinned back and opened my door for me, waiting until I was safely ensconced before shutting the door and coming around to the driver side.</p><p>\u201cManny\u2019s okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded in assent, trying not to drool on myself. Manny\u2019s was my favorite restaurant in town and served the best authentic Italian food around. You can order food to be served family style, but I\u2019ve never had it that way. I\u2019m very protective over my Manny\u2019s; in fact, my brother tried to steal a piece of chicken from my fettuccini alfredo one night at dinner. Note the key word, tried. Didn\u2019t work, \u2018cause I bit him.</p> <p>We pulled up to the restaurant and parked. Before I could even get my seatbelt off, Luke was out of the car and holding my door open for me, reaching in to take my hand and help me from the car. Well whaddaya know? Smoking hot and chivalrous to boot!</p><p>Apparently, Luke was well known here as he was greeted by name and we were led immediately to a secluded corner booth. Luke ordered a bottle of wine for us to have with dinner and then, after giving our menu choices to the waiter, we were alone.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your tattoo doing?\u201d Luke asked. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. I really do. I wasn\u2019t really sure that I would ever be one to join the ranks of the tattooed, but I\u2019m glad I did it. You did a really good job.\u201d I replied.</p><p>He inquired about what I did for a living, so I told him the glamorous details of being a legal secretary before asking, \u201cSo how long have you been tattooing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI started when I was twenty, so its been about twelve years. I\u2019ve been drawing almost all my life. Drew something out that I decided I wanted inked on myself. I got my first tattoo when I was eighteen. Took my own work down to the shop to show them what I wanted. Guy running the place said I had a good eye, wanted to see more of my work. I came back the next day with my sketch pad and the rest was history. He helped me with the classes I was required to take, let me do my apprenticeship with him, helped me get my license, and there you have it. Three years after that, Brandon decided that\u2019s what he wanted to do, too, so Lenny took him on as well.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice trailed off after that and he got a faraway look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was almost six years to the day of when I walked into that shop for the first time that I got the call that Lenny had died from a heart attack. Didn\u2019t have any children, but he did have a wife. Jude.\u201d Luke smiled. \u201cShe was hell on wheels but loved us as if we were her own. She asked me and Brandon to meet her at the shop, and when we did, she handed us the keys, kissed our cheeks, and told us Skin Deep was ours now.\u201d</p><p>Luke caught my eyes and smiled ruefully before saying, \u201cThen she told us that if we didn\u2019t do right by Lenny\u2019s shop she\u2019d kick our asses and then sic Lenny\u2019s ghost on us.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled back at him and said, \u201cWell, it seems like you and Brandon are making it work. I\u2019m sure Lenny would be proud!\u201d</p><p>The waiter arrived at our table then with our entr\u00e9es, and the conversation lulled as we ate. I forked up a bite of my (what else?) fettuccini alfredo with grilled chicken and groaned uncontrollably with appreciation at the perfect harmony of creamy, cheesy sauce, succulent , juicy chicken, and firm but oh, so tender pasta. Chewing slowly, my gaze met Luke\u2019s as he stared at me hungrily.</p><p>\u201cWant to try a bite?\u201d I asked him, hoping that he\u2019d say no. What? I told you I was greedy with my Manny\u2019s...</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. Looks delicious, though. Want to try mine?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked over at his plate, eyeballing his chicken marsala with appreciation. I decided I\u2019d better not go there. \u201cNo, thanks. But I\u2019ve had that here before, and its kick ass.\u201d</p><p>The waiter came and switched out our basket of garlic bread for a warm one, but neither of us reached for them. I, for one, didn\u2019t want to ruin my chances of a good night kiss with garlic breath.</p><p>We didn\u2019t talk much while we finished eating. The waiter came back to clear the table and ask if we wanted dessert. Without waiting for Luke to reply, I jumped in and ordered my favorite black tie mousse cake, which is absolutely like an orgasm for your taste buds. We\u2019re talking, rich, moist dark chocolate cake, creamy, smooth chocolate mousse and vanilla custard, and then decadent chocolate swirl icing with mini chocolate chips. Gah! I\u2019m drooling...</p><p>Luke raised a brow at me before smiling and shaking his head. Hmm. No dessert for him? Too bad.</p><p>While we waited for the waiter to bring my cake, Luke asked me, \u201cSo you and Allie are best friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I replied. We\u2019ve been friends ever since she shared her bubble gum with me on the playground in third grade. I don\u2019t even remember exactly what happened, but my piece of gum fell out of my mouth into the grass. Allie saw it happen, came over, bit her piece of gum in half and gave it to me. Gross, yes, because she had already been chewing hers, but hey. We were young. Been inseparable ever since.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>Luke smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, that\u2019s gross. But sweet.\u201d</p><p>The waiter arrived with my dessert then and I wasted no time grabbing my fork and digging in. Scooping up a hefty bite, I wrapped my lips around it, unable to stop the uncontrollable moan of ecstasy from escaping my throat as I chewed slowly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I completely forgot about everything but my cake as I continued to scoop bite after bite, savoring each and every mouthful, closing my eyes and moaning, groaning, or humming with every morsel. I got down to my last bite, pausing to lick the chocolate off my fork, when I opened my eyes to find Luke staring at me, his eyes half-closed, nostrils flared, white knuckled hands gripping the edge of the able, and his lips set in a grim line.</p><p>Uh oh.</p><p>I blinked and asked sheepishly, \u201cWant some?\u201d (Again hoping that he\u2019d say no)</p><p>Luke didn\u2019t say a word, just barely shook his head from side to side, giving me the all clear to finish it myself (Yay!). Still holding his gaze, I briefly wondered if I\u2019d embarrassed myself, or even Luke, eating like starving pig, but couldn\u2019t stop myself from scooping the last bite up to my lips and then scraping the plate clean of any traces of chocolate remaining.</p> <p>Before I\u2019d even set my fork down, Luke grabbed his wallet, threw some bills down on the table, stood up and said, \u201cWe\u2019re done. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We left the restaurant and headed to Luke\u2019s car. He didn\u2019t touch me once, and we didn\u2019t speak as we got in, he started the car, and pulled out into the street. He wouldn\u2019t even look my way as we sat in silence. My cheeks were flaming in mortification as I thought about how much of an ass I had made of myself at dinner. I shouldn\u2019t have ordered dessert, and I for damn sure shouldn\u2019t have ignored him while I made love to a piece of cake sitting in a restaurant. Even though it was still relatively early, only nine o\u2019clock, I assumed that he was taking me directly home. I wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><p>Swallowing my disappointment in myself and battling tears of embarrassment, I turned to Luke to thank him for the evening as we pulled up in front of my house. Before I could open my mouth, he got out, came around and opened my door. He walked me up to the door, lightly clasping my fingers in his. I guess manners still win out over disgust.</p><p>I turned to tell him good night, leaning back against my front door, and found him watching me closely.</p><p>\u201cUmmm...well...thanks for a nice evening, Luke,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cIts not over, Emma,\u201d Luke replied.</p><p>Erm. Its not? Holy shit!</p><p>\u201cAsk me in.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, and I found myself gaping at him in disbelief, unable to comprehend why he would want to prolong this any longer.</p><p>I finally forced my lips to move. \u201cCome in? I...I\u2019m sure I could find a bottle of wine or something...\u201dI trailed off, not sure exactly what to say. I mean, my cha-chi was screaming, \u2018Yes! Come in! We\u2019re open!\u2019, but there\u2019s no way in hell that\u2019s what he was thinking. Right?</p><p>Luke followed me through the door into the living room. I turned to shut the door, locking it behind us out of habit. As my fingers slipped away from the dead bolt, I became aware of Luke\u2019s hard heat pressing close behind me. I felt him lightly stroke the backs of his fingers down my cheek and my breath caught in my throat. He leaned further into me, pressing me against the door. My head fell back against his shoulder as I felt his lips trace the side of my throat before lightly nipping my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cMmmm...,\u201d Luke whispered in my ear. \u201cYou taste as good as you look.\u201d</p> <p>Then, pulling back from me, I heard him walk further into the room and sit on the couch. I stayed where I was for a second, trying to convince my legs to work before turning to look at him. He looked so good lounging on my couch that, for a second, I contemplated kidnapping him and holding him hostage as my personal sex slave for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019ll get something to drink for us,\u201d I said before heading towards the kitchen. Luke</p><p>said nothing in reply, just smiled.</p><p>I rummaged absent-mindedly in the cabinet and in the fridge, finding a half-empty bottle of Ice Wine that I picked up on my last trip to Put In Bay, and an unopened bottle of tequila. Shrugging, I grabbed two shot glasses and a lime from the fridge, making a mental note to pick more up at the store so I could still make my tequila lime chicken for dinner one night. I quickly sliced a few wedges from the lime, picked up the salt and the bottle of tequila, and headed back to the living room, figuring I\u2019d drown my embarrassment and subsequent confusion in liquor.</p><p>\u201cShots,\u201d I said, unnecessarily, as I deposited my load on the coffee table in front of Luke.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Luke said.</p><p>Leaning forward, Luke poured two shots into the shot glasses, then picked up the salt shaker, turning to me and grabbing my hand. His eyes burned into mine as he slowly lifted my hand to his mouth and I felt the warmth of his breath on my skin before his tongue touched me in the curve between my thumb and forefinger. I couldn\u2019t control the small gasp that shot from between my lips at the unexpected touch.</p><p>He then lightly shook the salt over the dampness left behind from his mouth (I ignored the granules that missed my hand and fell into the couch and carpet...well, I told myself to, anyway) before setting down the shaker, grabbing a lime wedge and bringing it to my lips. He pressed the cold fruit against my lips, wordlessly entreating me to take it in my mouth. I held it gently between my lips, waiting for his next move. He grabbed one of the shots from the table, pulled my hand to him, licked the salt from my skin, and tossed back the tequila before sliding his hand behind my neck and pulling me to him.</p> <p>I moaned softly as his lips closed over mine, tasting the tartness of the lime burst on my tongue as he bit gently into the fruit before pulling back from my mouth. I opened my eyes and looked at him in confusion because I still had the lime wedge in my mouth; he hadn\u2019t taken it. I reached up and removed the wedge from my lips and before I could even lean forward to place the spent peel on the table, Luke moved like lightning, drawing me hard against him and boldly swiping his tongue against the seam of my lips before sliding inside when I gasped. He kissed me deeply, and I tasted the tanginess of lime and the tart bite of tequila on his tongue.</p><p>I dropped the lime husk from my hand, not caring when it landed on the carpet before running my hands up Luke\u2019s arms to tangle my fingers in his hair. I loved the feel of it in my hands, so soft and thick, adding another sensation to the already overwhelming tide drowning me in seduction. The silver ring piercing his lower lip pressed against mine, the contrast of its cool hardness against my heated skin driving me wild.</p><p>We broke the kiss, both of us breathing hard, our foreheads pressed together as we gazed into each other\u2019s eyes. He lightly skimmed his fingers up my arms to where my fingers were still tangled in his hair, wincing slightly as my fingers tightened convulsively before releasing it from my grasp.</p><p>I blushed, muttering, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIts ok,\u201d Luke said. \u201cI like knowing that I have that effect on you.\u201d His voiced dropped an octave as he leaned in again. \u201cIts only fair for what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>Whuh? What I do to him? What the fuck has he been smoking?</p><p>I sat back against the arm of the couch, watching him guardedly as he looked at me with hooded eyes, his lips curved up at the corners in a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your shot, sugar,\u201d Luke drawled.</p><p>I blinked owlishly at him, trying to get my wits together but failing miserably. How can he be so calm? I sat up and grabbed the shot, not wasting any time with the salt or lime, and downed it. Yikes. That was a mistake, because that shit burns! I choked on a cough as my eyes watered and, feeling like a moron, I felt Luke\u2019s hand pound my back. I finally caught my breath and held up my hand so that Luke would quit pounding on me before I looked over at him, blushing furiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou okay there, sunshine?\u201d Luke asked, laughing softly.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy turn again, then.\u201d Luke poured another shot and grabbed the salt shaker before leaning in close to me again. He jerked his head in the universal motion for \u2018come here\u2019 before tilting my head to the side with his hand on the nape of my neck. I felt his warm breath bathe my skin just before his lips closed over the sensitive skin of my neck, right at the curve where it meets my shoulder. My breath shuddered out as he gently suckled before flicking his tongue against my skin.</p><p>He pulled back and sprinkled salt sparingly over the dampness he left behind before grabbing the shot and placing another lime wedge between my lips. I waited for what was coming, holding my breath, surprised when he reached up with his free hand and pulled out the clip holding my hair up in place. My hair tumbled down in waves around my shoulders. I glanced up at Luke, watching in fascination as his eyes darkened before he tangled his fingers roughly in my hair at the back of my neck, and then, pulling my head sharply to the side, he licked the salt off my skin, and downed the shot. Then, with his fingers still tangled in my hair, he took the lime from my lips, again leaving behind the tart and tangy flavor of lime and tequila. After taking the lime out of his mouth and tossing it to the table, he brought his lips back to mine, kissing me deeply. His tongue swept inside my mouth, tangling with mine, stealing my breath with the intensity.</p><p>Luke used his fingers, still entwined in my hair, to thrust my head back, exposing my throat to him. He licked across my full bottom lip, sucked it between his teeth, and nipped at it sharply. A surprised sound escaped from me at how good that felt; the perfect combination of pain and pleasure. I felt his other hand slide up my thigh, skim my ribs and cup my breast, his thumb finding and circling my nipple with sure strokes.</p><p>I moaned into his mouth and he dragged his lips down my cheek to my neck, kissing, sucking, and licking every inch of my skin along the way. His fingers left my hair and both hands then cupped my breasts, palming the soft firmness of my flesh. I arched into his hands, my thighs squeezing together restlessly, trying to alleviate the ache building between them.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Luke whispered.</p><p>I opened my eyes, gazing at him through a haze of desire.</p><p>\u201cSugar, watching you wrap your lips around your fork, licking chocolate off your lips, and hearing you moan all night...I\u2019m about two seconds from ripping your clothes off and fucking you senseless on your couch. Baby, you have to tell me to stop now if you don\u2019t want this. Otherwise, I\u2019m gonna slide inside your hot, wet body, inch by inch, until I\u2019m buried so deep between your thighs...\u201d his words cut off on a harsh breath.</p><p>Stop? Tell him to stop? Is he insane? I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not that kind of girl; I hardly kiss on the first date, let alone jump into bed like my thighs were spring loaded and ready to part. But there was something seriously wrong with his brain if he thought for one second that I would ruin what was shaping up to be the single most satisfying, screaming orgasm inducing, hottest sexual encounter of my life.</p><p>My cha-chi was quivering with excitement, screaming, \u2018Hallelujah, the desert days are over, girl! Bring on the rain!\u2019</p><p>My voice was breathy when I said, \u201cNo, Luke. I don\u2019t want you to stop. Please...\u201d</p><p>Luke growled low in his throat before grasping my legs behind my knees, pulling me down and my legs out, kneeling between my now outspread thighs. I moaned at the feel of his hardness pressed against my aching softness, and then he was over me, thrusting against me, sliding his hands under my shirt and devouring my mouth in a furious kiss.</p><p>And then it happened. No, no...I don\u2019t mean It. If that would have happened, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here hornier than a horny toad, glaring at the object of my fury. Well, objects, plural. And boy was I pissed!</p><p>Just when we were getting to the good part, my legs wrapped around Luke\u2019s waist, his hips flush against mine, his hands tugging my shirt up, a noise broke through my daze and I raised my eyes over Luke\u2019s shoulder. Standing there, faces red with suppressed laughter and shock, was my brother, Calland, and my younger sister, Leah. Calland had his hand slapped over Leah\u2019s mouth but I could still hear her muffled snorts of glee.</p><p>I scrambled out from under Luke, tugging my clothes back into place and throwing a mumbled \u2018sorry\u2019 over my shoulder when I inadvertently elbowed him in the stomach in my mad dash to get away. He got up painfully and perched on the edge of the couch, trying to hide his condition from my family but it wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>I glared at Calland. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Don\u2019t you know how to call first?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, finally removing his hand from Leah\u2019s mouth. She immediately let loose with a loud hoot of laughter, throwing her head back and gripping her stomach, leaning so far back that she lost her balance and fell on her ass. Wonderful. She\u2019s drunk.</p><p>Calland looked behind me and grinned before saying, \u201cHi! I\u2019m Calland, Emma\u2019s brother. Apparently she has forgotten her manners or she would have introduced us by now. But I guess she was pretty preoccupied...\u201d his words trailed off in laughter.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d I said between clenched teeth, \u201cWhat are you doing here and why didn\u2019t you just call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did call. Four times. You didn\u2019t answer, but now I can see why.\u201d He grinned unabashedly at me. \u201cLeah called from the bar, said her date was a douche and she needed a ride. Cant take her home like this, so...tag! You\u2019re it!\u201d With that, he gave Luke a two fingered salute, nudged Leah off of his foot where she had landed, and took off towards the front door.</p><p>\u201cCalland!\u201d I yelled. \u201cGet your ass back here, you stupid son of a motherless goat!\u201d I let out a scream of frustration before remembering that Luke was still sitting there, taking everything in.</p><p>I blew out a breath, knowing that my night of debauchery was now out of the question. Leaving Leah where she lay on the carpet, I moved to stand in front of Luke, who had now risen from the couch.</p> <p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said quietly, my voice filled with regret.</p><p>Luke grinned and said, \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d before drawing me into his arms and pressing his lips to mine lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sugar. We\u2019re gonna fuck. Just not tonight.\u201d With that said, he kissed my lips softly once more and then was gone.</p><p>I stood there gazing longingly at the door for a minute until an animalistic snore broke through my reverie. I walked over to my sister, nudging her with my foot, telling her to get her drunk ass up. Leah is the youngest of us kids, just barely 25. She had a natural perkiness that had served her well as the captain of the cheerleading team in high school, long, dark, wavy brown hair like mine, and the jade green eyes that we all shared. She was tiny like Jenna, worked as a hairstylist in a shop by the mall, and had men follow her around in droves, all hoping to be on the receiving end of her bright smile.</p><p>I reached down and grabbed her under her armpits, hefting her up into a sitting position. She opened her eyes blearily and blinked at me before saying, \u201cEmma? \u2018Zat choo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Leah, its me. C\u2019mon, lets get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>It took some finagling, but I finally got her up, down the hall, and safely tucked into my bed before crawling in beside her and falling into a deep sleep. My last thought before it was lights out was, \u201cCalland is going to die.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 5</p><p>The rest of the week flew by. I was so busy with work and fielding calls from Allie demanding details from my date with Luke that I didn\u2019t have time to dwell much on the fact that I hadn\u2019t heard from him. Okay, so I lied. Its all I could think about. I could just shoot my brother for doing that to me, and I probably would, once I could get my hands on him. He wisely has been avoiding me.</p><p>On the bright side? My boss, sweetheart that he is, so kindly agreed without hesitation to bond me out of jail after I shoot Calland. Of course, I didn\u2019t tell him why it would be necessary. He\u2019s cool like that.</p><p>On Friday afternoon, having spent most of my morning fielding my usual ration of legal questions, phone calls (quite a few were hang ups or heavy breathing in my ear; weird), and client meetings, I answered my phone one last time as I shut down my computer, prepared to once again explain why someone couldn\u2019t get their marriage annulled. That, let me tell you, is a fascinating conversation: They say, \u201cI want to get my marriage annulled.\u201d I say, \u201cokay, have you consummated the marriage?\u201d They say, \u201cwhat?\u201d I say, \u201cDid you consummate the marriage?\u201d They say, \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d I say, \u201cDid you have sex with your wife/husband on your wedding night and/or any other night (or day) during the course of your marriage?\u201d And so on, and so forth. My favorite was an older woman who had called and we had the same conversation, but her response to my last question was classic. She said, \u201cWell wasn\u2019t I supposed to? He told me it was against the law if we didn\u2019t...\u201d Poor woman.</p> <p>\u201cGood afternoon, Floyd Grim\u2019s office, can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sugar,\u201d a deep, sinfully rich voice said in my ear.</p><p>Gah! \u201cHey,\u201d I said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there to get you at six. Be ready.\u201d</p><p>Ummm...no? I mean, we\u2019ve had one date. So who collared me and made him master?</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Luke,\u201d I replied in a clipped tone. \u201cGot plans with Allie. Another time?\u201d I really did have plans with Allie, but even if I didn\u2019t, I would have made some. As it was, she and I had a date with our fat clothes, junk food, and an Amanda Seyfried movie marathon; we had Letters to Juliet, Mama Mia, and Dear John. (Which we watch more for Channing Tatum. Yum. I mean, have you seen Magic Mike? Heellooo!)</p><p>\u201cCancel them,\u201d came the quick reply.</p><p>\u201cNo, Luke. And what gives you the right to call me up out of the blue, at my job, no less, and dictate what-\u201d</p><p>He cut me off mid-sentence. \u201cBabe. I\u2019ll call Allie. Six. Be ready. Later, sugar.\u201d</p><p>I heard the phone click off in my ear and stood there in shock , the receiver still pressed to my cheek.</p><p>After a minute, I replaced the phone on the hook, gathered up my purse and my keys, and locked up the office. Heading out to my car, I dialed Allie\u2019s number on my cell. She didn\u2019t answer, so I left her a message, demanding that she call me immediately. I figured she was closing up the store or she would have answered. She\u2019s manic about answering her phone, always telling me that if she didn\u2019t, she could miss the \u201cparty of a lifetime\u201d call that would keep her in enough Nipple Dip, Jack Rabbits, and Turtle Tools (Oh, my!) to last a lifetime.</p> <p>See, Allie\u2019s a pretty free spirit. She owns a thrift store at the edge of town in a quaint little shopping center, called Twice as Nice. She does pretty well there, but supplements her income (supports her addiction, however you want to call it) by doing Down &amp; Dirty parties. She ropes me into helping her sometimes with them and delights in presenting me with a new BOB every Christmas. For those of you who aren\u2019t as unlucky as me in the bedroom department, BOB is my battery operated boyfriend. Honestly, it\u2019s a pretty good relationship. I don\u2019t have to fight him for the remote, he doesn\u2019t hog the covers, and I get mine every time!</p><p>I pulled into my driveway a few minutes later and headed inside. Allie hadn\u2019t called me back yet, but she was supposed to be here in about a half hour anyway, so I really didn\u2019t think much of it. I was dying to talk to her about Luke, though.</p><p>I headed back to my bedroom after dropping my keys and purse on the sideboard by the front door. I stripped out of my work clothes, pulling on my favorite red fleece pants covered with penguins and snowflakes, soft, thick black socks, an old tank top, and one of my brother\u2019s old hoodies that he\u2019d left behind one night. It was black with the letters F.B.I. spelled out in huge white block letters. It was so big on me that the sleeves hung way past the tips of my fingers, and the bottom of it reached the middle of my thighs. Across the back was written Female Body Inspector. Eh. Who cares?</p><p>I pulled my hair up into a messy knot on the very top of my head and washed my makeup off before heading into the kitchen to start dragging out the makings for English muffin pizzas, me and Allie\u2019s favorite childhood meal. I also pulled out the ingredients for Dried Beef Dip, bags of chips, stuff to make s\u2019mores, and checked to make sure I had everything for our \u201cSpecial Sundaes\u201d which consisted of strawberry frozen yogurt (or ice cream) with strawberry daiquiri wine cooler poured over it. Delish!</p><p>I heard the doorbell and took off to open the door, wondering why Allie didn\u2019t just use her key. When I opened the door, I froze, completely thrown off by Luke standing on my doorstep.</p><p>\u201cLuke.\u201d My voice cracked a little, whether in shock, confusion, anger, or lust, I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cHey, sugar.\u201d He let his gaze roam up and down my body, taking in my disheveled appearance. \u201cSo, we staying in tonight?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cUm, Luke, I told you I have plans with Allie tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t. I told you I was calling her. She understands completely, by the way. She did ask me to tell you to call her immediately after we finally get down and dirty?\u201d His voice raised questioningly at the end and he quirked his brow at me.</p><p>I sighed, muttering under my breath, \u201cThanks for selling me out, Allie. Bitch.\u201d</p><p>I moved to the side, waving him in. He stepped through the door, waiting for me to shut it behind him. I turned to look at him, cocking my head to the side because I honestly just couldn\u2019t get a handle on him. What were we doing, here?</p><p>Luke shot me a quick grin before taking a step toward me. Instinctively, I took a step back. He continued stalking me, and I kept stepping back until my back hit the door behind me, my hand gripping the frame in desperation. He kept coming, pressing his body against mine before tipping my head up and lightly pecking my lips in a chaste kiss before moving back and grinning.</p><p>\u201cSo, are we?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Huh? \u201cAre we what?\u201d I know I had to sound as confused as I felt.</p><p>\u201cStaying in. I vote yes. What\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Luke headed into the kitchen and I followed him helplessly. Stomped, more like it because, honestly, I was a little miffed that I had only warranted a peck as a greeting kiss; I was expecting to be ravished, especially with the way he had stalked me. Humph.</p><p>My cell phone rang on the counter where I\u2019d left it and I picked it up, noting Allie\u2019s picture popped up on the screen.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d One word. That\u2019s all I said into the phone as a greeting.</p><p>\u201cLove you!\u201d she said breezily. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, save me a sundae, rock his world, and call me in the morning!\u201d She sang the last word before laughing and hanging up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tossed my phone back on the counter and resigned myself to the fact that I had no control over my life at the moment. Or ever.</p><p>I blew out a breath and asked Luke, \u201cEver had an English muffin pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCant say that I have, but I\u2019m open to trying new things,\u201d he replied. Oh really. Nice to know!</p><p>But seriously? I thought everyone on God\u2019s green earth had eaten one at least once in their life!</p> <p>\u201cWell, its been me and Allie\u2019s staple food since we were little. And they\u2019re good, I promise! Ready? You can help, too!\u201d</p><p>Luke jumped in, helping me split the muffins, slather them with sauce, and top them with tons of pepperoni, sausage crumbles, bacon, banana peppers, and mozzarella cheese. We stuck them in the oven and I put together the dip while they baked.</p><p>Once the pizzas were done, we carried them, the chips and dip, and large glasses of pop into the living room and laid it all out like a buffet on the coffee table. Luke sat on the couch while I sat on the floor, leaning back on the couch, my shoulder brushing his knee.</p><p>I turned on the tv and started the movie I had put in the DVD player earlier that night for when Allie and I had our marathon. The opening notes of Mama Mia began playing and I watched Luke out of the corner of my eye as I took a bite of pizza. He didn\u2019t flinch and didn\u2019t say a word, so I decided to see how long I could get him to actually watch the movie without either falling asleep or running out the door.</p><p>About an hour into the movie we had polished off the pizzas and plowed our way through most of the dip. I had moved closer to Luke who was now lounging back on the couch, still sitting on the floor, and was leaning against his leg, my head resting on his thigh. I was having a hard time concentrating on the movie because he had removed the ponytail holder from my hair and was softly running his fingers through it, smoothing it back from my face and across his thigh. Every once in a while he would trace the outer shell of my ear with a fingertip, making me shiver.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, lost in sensation, shivering from his touch when I snapped. Fuck Mama Mia, its on!</p><p>As Luke\u2019s hand smoothed my hair back from my face again, I rolled my head forward and bit into Luke\u2019s thigh through his jeans. I didn\u2019t bite hard enough to hurt, but did it enough that he let out a jagged breath and his fingers tightened convulsively in my hair.</p><p>I pushed off his leg, turning towards him and moving between his legs, running my hands up his thighs. His eyes narrowed, heavy lidded with desire, deepening the smoky blue-grey depths with added intensity. I leaned in and nipped at his thigh again before pushing to my feet and straddling his hips. His hands came up to grip my hips, and I leaned into him, touching my tongue to the silver ring in his lower lip before planting kisses along the hard line of his jaw. When I reached his mouth, I kissed him deeply, being the aggressor this time, finally getting my hello kiss that I\u2019d wanted since he\u2019d gotten there.</p><p>I pulled back from his mouth and, putting my lips to his ear, I softly growled, \u201cFuck me, Luke. I want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>Luke groaned, the tips of his fingers biting into the soft flesh of my hips as he ground himself against me.</p><p>I put my hands flat against his chest and pushed off, standing in front of him. I held out my hand, silently asking him to take it. He took it, slowly coming to his feet before I pulled him down the hall to my bedroom. Once inside, I didn\u2019t give him the chance to take control. Maneuvering him to the side of the bed, I turned with him so his back was facing the bed and then shoved with all my might. His eyes widened as he lost his balance and sat down hard on his ass on the edge of my mattress. I wasted no time, climbing astride his hips again as I pushed him back to lie flat.</p> <p>I pressed myself against him, my breasts crushed against his muscled hardness and fused my mouth with his, our tongues tangling, teeth nipping, and breath heaving. I felt his hands cup my ass, and then I was airborne, letting out a surprised squeak as I threw my arms around his neck, holding on for dear life.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Luke?\u201d I shrieked.</p><p>He grinned at me before turning and tossing me on the bed, following me down and stilling me with his body. \u201cYou aren\u2019t calling the shots tonight, sugar. We\u2019re gonna do this my way.\u201d He leaned down and rubbed his lips against mine before kissing across my jaw to my ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to repay you, sugar, for every time you set your teeth in my thigh. I\u2019m going to lick every inch of your body, eat you til you come, and then fuck you so hard, you\u2019ll still feel it next week. But for now, you\u2019re gonna strip. Then your gonna undress me, and then you\u2019re gonna take me in that sweet, sassy mouth.\u201d</p><p>He moved off of me and stood beside the bed. \u201cNow, sugar. Clothes. Off.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist the dark heat in his eyes, I got up and began undressing. I pulled the hoodie off over my head, taking my tank top with it and dropping them to the floor. I shoved my pants down my hips and stepped out of them, toeing my socks off at the same time. I stood in front of him clad in only my black lace bra and panties, feeling completely naked. I wrapped my arms around my midsection, the haze of passion clearing from my head a little and self-consciousness taking its place.</p><p>I felt Luke\u2019s fingers under my chin, tipping my head back so he could see my face. \u201cEmma, you\u2019re beautiful, sugar. Don\u2019t ever doubt that.\u201d He placed a soft kiss at each corner of my mouth before melding his lips with mine. After a minute he pulled back and murmured, \u201cNaked. Now.\u201d</p><p>I complied quickly and scrambled up on my bed, intent on grabbing the comforter to cover up with. Luke grabbed my ankle and pulled, preventing me from getting anywhere. He crooked a finger at me and then pointed to the floor in front of him. \u201cOn your knees, Emma. Take me in your mouth, baby.\u201d</p><p>I knelt on the floor in front of him, wondering if I was still supposed to undress him or not, when he answered the question for me by stripping his shirt off over his head and undoing his belt before popping the button and releasing the zipper of his jeans. He put his hands into the waistband to shove them off and I stopped him with my hands over his. I slipped my fingers into the waistband and slowly pulled his jeans down his hips until the hard, thick length of him sprang free. (Commando, much? Whoo-hoo!)</p> <p>Without giving Luke a chance to step out of his jeans, I wrapped my fingers around him (as much as I could) and stroked him gently before darting my tongue out to taste the bead of moisture glistening on the tip of him. Luke gasped, tunneling his hands into my hair and gripping tight. I leaned forward and closed my lips around him, gently sucking before laving him with my tongue. I settled into a slow rhythm, alternately stroking him with my lips, my tongue, and my hand, reaching up to cup the sac hanging heavily between his thighs with my other hand.</p><p>Luke groaned harshly in his throat and I felt his hands in my hair tighten, pulling me back away from him. I opened my eyes and looked up at him, locking my eyes with his as I pulled against his grip and slid him deep in my mouth again. He threw his head back and drew my head back away again before pushing me forward once more, thrusting himself deep in my throat. I relaxed into him, silently letting him know I understood what he wanted. Using my hair to guide me and hold me steady, Luke started thrusting smoothly in and out, fucking my mouth. I swallowed around the tip of him as he thrust forward, thanking the Gag Reflex Gods for not giving me one, and heard Luke growl, \u201cOh, Fuck!\u201d between clenched teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke tightened his hands even more, pulling my mouth away before letting go of my hair and hauling me up into his arms. He kissed me hungrily, running his hands over my body. Nipping at my lip, he pressed me down into the mattress, covering my body with his, his thighs pushing between mine. He kissed down my throat to my breast, taking my nipple into his mouth, sucking and alternately flicking his tongue rapidly against the hardened nub, and as I arched into his mouth, he dragged his lips across my skin to take my other nipple into his mouth, biting it gently with his teeth.</p><p>Luke slid his hand down between our bodies, spearing his fingers into my hot wetness, circling the hardened bud of my clit before sliding deep into me. Letting out a moan, I rode his fingers as he thrust them into me over and over, the wave building and building, and just before it crested, he moved his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo! Luke, please...\u201d I moaned, hanging by a thread of sanity, gripping his wrist tightly with my hand and trying to push it back down between my thighs. He wrenched his arm away and sat up, and I realized what he was doing.</p><p>Luke reached down into his jeans, grabbed a condom, and sheathed himself quickly before coming back over me, using his knees to spread me wide. He stroked himself through my slickness before pausing at my entrance and then (Yes!) finally thrusting home, stretching and filling me completely.</p><p>I drew my knees up, locking my legs around his waist, digging my nails into his back and fell headlong into the pounding rhythm of his hips and the slap of his skin against mine. I felt the wave cresting, rushing over me, pulling me under, as I chanted Luke\u2019s name and then felt him follow, slamming himself into me one last time before he let go, holding me tight and groaning with his release.</p><p>After a moment, he slid to the side of me and I convulsively tightened my inner muscles, reluctant to lose the hot hardness of him inside me. He gasped and shuddered, which set off a small aftershock that had me moaning again, before pulling out and walking to the bathroom to dispose of the condom.</p><p>I got up, intending to pull my clothes back on, but Luke came back in the room, gathered me up in his arms, and snuggled us both into my bed. Pulling the covers up around us, he settled me on my side, his arm under my head and curved around my back, my front pressed up against his side, and my leg cocked up over his thigh.</p><p>Sleepily, I muttered, \u201cYou said you were going to eat me \u2018til I screamed. You liar.\u201d</p><p>Luke chuckled in my ear before whispering, \u201cJust you wait, sugar.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and snuggled deeper into him. I must have dozed off at some point, but awoke on a moan when Luke slid inside me, kissing me deeply as he thrust against me. He made love to me tenderly at first, stoking the flames of desire rolling over me, until we both lost control, our bodies coming together fast and hard until we spent, clinging tightly to each other. Luke got up, took care of the condom, and then, crawling back into bed beside me, he wrapped himself around me and we both fell into sated sleep.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>I woke up Saturday morning to Luke stroking my hair back from my face. I stretched languidly, smiling sleepily at him until it hit me that sunshine was blazing through my window (I was a little preoccupied last night and didn\u2019t get the curtains shut) and I. Was. Naked. Eek! I jackknifed up in the bed, scrambling to drag the comforter up to cover myself.</p><p>Luke grinned, shook his head at me, leaned down and kissed the tip of my nose.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sugar. Sleep well?\u201d He winked at me and his grin turned sly.</p><p>Luke had woken me up twice more in the night to make love and I was finding it hard not to flush red from head to toe at the memories of things he\u2019d done to me and I\u2019d done to him. And yes, he did finally eat me until I screamed. And screamed. Lord, the things that man can do with his mouth...</p><p>I smiled shyly up at him as he leaned down to kiss me again. I noticed that he was fully dressed in his clothes from last night.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go to work, babe. Its my morning to open the shop, and since Brandon was going out last night, he\u2019s probably still drunk off his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ve got to go to my sister\u2019s house anyway. And then track down my brother, because I still owe him an ass kicking,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow many brothers and sisters do you have?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo sisters, one brother. Jenna\u2019s the oldest, she\u2019s 33, then there\u2019s me, I\u2019m 29, then Calland, who you had the unfortunate experience of meeting the other night, he\u2019s 27, and Leah, the drunk ass, she\u2019s 25. So, what about you? Brothers, sisters? Other than Brandon, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Brandon. He\u2019s 30. I\u2019m two years older than him,\u201d Luke replied. His tone was a little short. He stood up and I got the impression that he wasn\u2019t going to say anything else on that subject.</p><p>O-k-a-y...? We\u2019ll leave that for another time, I guess.</p><p>I struggled up off the bed, wrapping the comforter around me and pulling it with me as I started to walk out of the room, intending to walk Luke to the door. I heard a snort behind me and turned, raising a questioning eyebrow at him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you naked, Emma. We fucked four times last night and I ate you until you screamed. You don\u2019t have to be modest, sugar. Trust me, I liked what I saw, and I still like it now.\u201d He smiled at me.</p><p>I blushed and shrugged, walking away from him towards the front door. He followed, kissing me deeply before winking and walking out the door. I shut it behind him, leaning back against it and shaking my head. I heard my phone ringing somewhere and went to find it.</p><p>I found it on the kitchen counter and noted that I had sixteen missed calls. One from my mom asking me to come to breakfast on Sunday, three from Jenna asking where the hell I was, and twelve from Allie, all asking if I\u2019d \u201cgotten it in\u201d yet. (Where does she get this shit?)</p><p>Shaking my head, I quickly called my mom back to let her know I would be there, called Jenna to tell her I was on my way, and decided to let Allie stew a little longer. I took a record shower, threw on some clothes, and headed out the door to my sister\u2019s.</p><p>I pulled up at Jenna\u2019s house (in the driveway this time) and let myself in. I immediately wanted to turn around and let myself out, but the screams of \u201cAun\u2019Emmy! Aun\u2019Emmy!\u201d stopped me in my tracks. Sighing, I turned around to field the sticky ball of energy bearing down on me like a freight train.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, there, Hayden! What have you been doing, child?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cMommy made me pamcakes (how cute is she?) wif\u2019 syrup!\u201d She giggled gleefully.</p><p>\u201cHayden, get your sticky little behind back in here, right now, young lady!\u201d Jenna yelled from the kitchen.</p><p>I looked at Hayden, made a face, and we both took off for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHoly shi-oot, Jenna! Did you blow the place up?\u201d I asked her, taking in the state of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Emma,\u201d Jenna replied drolly. \u201cWe made pancakes for breakfast and Hayden, God love her little face, decided that it would be more fun to splatter the batter than to cook it. That, and she wanted to wear the syrup more than eat it. I mean, how messy can a four year old get? Jarrod wasn\u2019t that messy and he\u2019s a boy!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jarrod? And Noah?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNoah is in the garage organizing his screws or some manly shit like that, and I sent Jarrod up to get a shower to get the batter and syrup out of his hair. Don\u2019t ask me how that happened, I turned my back for five seconds to wipe batter off the cat and when I was done, Jarrod was looking at me like, what the hell?\u201d Jenna sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMommy said SHIT!\u201d Hayden yelled at the top of her lungs, running in circles around Jenna\u2019s legs until she spied the cat and took off after it.</p><p>\u201cHAYDEN, NO!\u201d Jenna shouted, taking off after her.</p><p>I shook my head, grinning at Noah as he came in the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Em. Welcome to the nut house. Wanna come help me organize the garage?\u201d Noah grinned at me before looking around the kitchen and wincing. Without another word he turned around and headed back to the safety of the garage.</p> <p>Jenna came back in the kitchen then, dangling the poor cat, Tommy (Hayden named her, poor thing) in her outstretched arms, who\u2019s fur was matted and sticky with syrup where Hayden\u2019s hands had grabbed her. Blowing out a breath, I grabbed a washcloth and wetted it with warm water and a little bit of dish soap.</p><p>Between the two of us, Jenna and I managed to get the cat, Hayden, and the kitchen cleaned in record time. Jarrod came down the stairs fresh from the shower, shook his head at his sister, and went out to the garage with his father.</p><p>A couple hours later, Jenna and I were sitting on her back deck sipping wine and I made the mistake of mentioning Luke, which led to how I met him, which led to Jenna shrieking and calling our mother to tattle on me. Geez, like I\u2019m not almost thirty!</p><p>Jenna was mad that I hadn\u2019t shown her the tattoo right after I got it, but shut up pretty quickly when I reminded her that she was quite preoccupied with her stakeout fiasco the last time I saw her.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of, Jenna, are you done trying to convince yourself that Noah is cheating on your dumb ass?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cSmart ass,\u201d Jenna replied. \u201cYeah, we worked it out. And for the record, I was going a little crazy at the time. I was late. As in, late!\u201d</p><p>I choked on my wine, setting my glass down and staring at Jenna wide-eyed. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at me. I think she looked a little sad, but then Hayden came running outside wearing Jarrod\u2019s underwear on her head, Jarrod hot on her heels yelling, \u201cMo-om!\u201d Jenna just leaned forward, put her head on the table and began banging it, whispering, \u201cWhy me? Why me?\u201d</p><p>I left Jenna\u2019s house around six and called Allie from my cell when I got in the car.</p><p>\u201cEmma Marie Jensen, you devious little bitch!\u201d Allie yelled into the phone, not bothering with niceties like saying hello or anything. \u201cI gave up fat clothes night and special sundaes for you to roll around naked with that hot piece of ass and you can\u2019t even call me to give me details? I thought you were my best friend! I\u2019m breaking up with you!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it. I laughed. \u201cAllie, calm down!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to tell me to calm down, chickie la la. I went out since we weren\u2019t having fat clothes night, and instead of finding me a hot piece of my own, I ran interception for you because I saw Leah at the bar. She was working herself up over the loss of her current man candy of the month and was planning on crashing your place again. So what now?\u201d Allie yelled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, okay, geez, keep your panties on! I\u2019m sorry, thank you, I love you, you have my undying gratitude, and if you are done yelling at me, meet me at Griff\u2019s for a drink and I\u2019ll give you the low down dirty details. Will that make up for it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she huffed. \u201cBe there in ten. Maybe fifteen.\u201d She hung up.</p><p>I chuckled, pulled out of Jenna\u2019s drive and headed downtown to Griff\u2019s.</p><p>When I got to Griff\u2019s, I headed to our favorite booth in the back. It was primo positioning, you had a clear view of the bar, clear view of the door, and, for the nights they had bands play, a clear view of the small stage. Unless people start a mosh pit in the middle of the floor, but I try to avoid those nights.</p><p>When I got to the booth, I pulled up short because it was occupied. Then I got a clear look at who it was and my night just got even better.</p><p>\u201cCalland Andrew Jensen,\u201d I drawled. \u201cImagine finding you here, little brother.\u201d I slid into the booth beside him, effectively blocking him in. Well, as much as I could because we both knew he could get past me if he wanted. He could slide out under the table, or, frankly, could bodily shove me out of the way. And he\u2019s done both before, so...</p><p>\u201cEmma, how many times do I have to tell you? Younger brother, youn-ger. I\u2019m bigger than you. I\u2019m stronger than you. Do we need to have this conversation again?\u201d Calland asked.</p> <p>Calland is 27, the only boy, and, well, there\u2019s no way around it. He\u2019s a spoiled rotten little asshole. But he\u2019s a gorgeous spoiled rotten little asshole. He\u2019s tall, topping out at six-two, and he\u2019s built. He has thick, dark brown hair cut almost in a high and tight, but his hair is a little longer on top. It always looks like he just ran his hands through it, but its actually styled like that. Weird, but it works for him, I guess.</p><p>His eyes are the same jade green as all of ours, rimmed in thick, long dark lashes that should have made him look feminine, but did no such thing, and his skin is nicely tanned. (Makes me sick because I generally just burn; which is why he\u2019s always so kindly telling me that I was adopted. Asshole, see?)</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d I muttered under my breath before saying, \u201cSo. You owe me so big for Monday night. You barge into my house, where I\u2019m clearly busy, and then if that\u2019s not bad enough, you left our sister passed out, not three sheets to the wind, but like six sheets to the wind, on my living room floor. I didn\u2019t get laid because of you, jerkwad!\u201d</p><p>Eek! I realized as soon as the words left my mouth that I had yelled that last part. And, of course, the song playing on the jukebox had just ended, so my words echoed in the sudden silence of the bar. The whole bar. Ugh. I hate my life sometimes.</p><p>Willy, a regular at the bar who, more often than not, was drunk by two turned my way and hollered, \u201cI\u2019ll do ya, sweet cheeks! Won\u2019t leave ya hangin\u2019, either!\u201d Yikes.</p><p>I chose to ignore Willy (he hits on everything that walks by with long hair and two legs. Caused a few tiffs, that\u2019s for sure, especially when it\u2019s a poor unsuspecting dude with long hair.)</p><p>I turned back to Calland, opened my mouth to say something, and he punched my arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me names!\u201d he smirked.</p><p>Rubbing my arm (it stung!) I replied, \u201cWhat are you, five? Cheese and rice, man!\u201d</p><p>Allie, fortunately or unfortunately, however you want to look at it, chose that moment to barrel up to the table, throw herself into the booth, and yell, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at her, knowing she was giving me my cue to spill. So I started telling her, relishing the horror that flashed over Calland\u2019s face before he shoved me out of the booth in front of him and took off, waving and hollering, \u201cLater!\u201d over his shoulder.</p><p>When I finished telling Allie every last little detail, she blinked for a second before saying, \u201cI just have one question.\u201d</p><p>Uh oh, I mentally groaned.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please tell me you had mowed the lawn. You did, right?\u201d she asked, a pained expression on her face.</p><p>Really? She had to go there? \u201cYes, Allie. Mowed down to the dirt. Bare floors. However you want to call it, there\u2019s nothing there. Are you satisfied? Can we forget about that for once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Em, you have to admit it\u2019s a valid question. I mean, you did look like you were smuggling Side Show Bob in your bikini bottoms. Bushzilla, baby!\u201d She cracked up like she was the funniest thing alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glared at her. \u201cAllie, that was summer camp, when we were thirteen! I cant help it, it was like I went to bed and woke up with my cha-chi revisiting the seventies!\u201d</p><p>Looking back, that had to have been the most embarrassing moment of my life. Allie was rushing me to get to the lake so we could swim with Alec Holt and Brad Sumner. I had walked out of the bunkroom in my swimsuit, ready to go. Allie and our counselor were standing in the living room of the cabin, and they had frozen, mouths open, gaping at me in shock. The counselor had turned without a word and walked into her room for a second before returning and handing me a pair of nail scissors. She then had pointed to the scissors, pointed to my thighs, and pointed toward the bathroom. Even at thirteen I got the hint, and never looked back. Bushzilla had never returned.</p><p>Allie shrugged. \u201cJust looking out for my bestie,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyway, so when are you gonna see him again?\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to shrug. \u201cNot sure. We didn\u2019t really talk about it, and I don\u2019t have his number. Come to think of it, he doesn\u2019t have mine, either.\u201d</p> <p>Allie pursed her lips, looking thoughtful. \u201cNo, but you do know where he works. We could always hit up Skin Deep...\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not stalking him at his work. He called me at my work, so he knows how to get ahold of me. And I just remembered that I\u2019m mad at him anyway. He just called out of the blue, ordered me around, and just expected me to listen!\u201d</p><p>I was trying to work myself into a good pissed-off-ness, trying not to think about how hot it actually was when had done that, when Allie said, \u201cHe did give you four orgasms, Emma.\u201d Allie, always (not always) the voice of reason.</p><p>Hmm. She\u2019s right. Only it was six. Can you say multiples? Holy shitballs, girls, they\u2019re real!</p><p>Shaking my head to clear those thoughts before they made me drool and stare glassy eyed off into space, I asked Allie what she wanted to drink. She gave me her order and I bellied up to the bar between Willy and Billy, Willy\u2019s drunken best friend and bar stool neighbor for life, and ordered two sangria margaritas, on the rocks, sugar rimmed, please.</p> <p>I fended off Willy and Billy\u2019s questing hands, grabbed our drinks and headed back to Allie.</p><p>As I got close to the table I said to her, \u201cOkay, no more talk of Luke, who may or may not ever call me again, orgasms, or Bushzilla. We\u2019re gonna drink our drinks and then I think we should go hit the drag show at Shimbots on Broad later. Showmia Buffet is headlining and I just love her!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t pay much attention to Allie until I sat the drinks down on the table and started to slide into the booth opposite her. When I looked at her face, I noted that she was staring wide-eyed at something. I turned my head to see what the hell she was looking at and my eyes collided with smoky blue-grey ones. Yikes!</p><p>\u201cUh, hey, Luke,\u201d I stammered.</p><p>He nodded, his lips twitching, before crowding into the booth beside me, giving me no choice but to slide over for him. As I did, I realized that he wasn\u2019t alone. Brandon was shoving Allie over on her side, as well.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, ladies!\u201d Brandon crowed, grinning at both of us. He then reached over and without a beat, snatched Allie\u2019s margarita, and downed it before licking every bit of sugar off the rim.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d Allie screeched. \u201cYou bastard, you owe me a drink! I hadn\u2019t even gotten to taste that yet!\u201d</p><p>Brandon leaned over and put his head on Allie\u2019s shoulder, giving her puppy dog eyes and sticking his bottom lip out exaggeratedly. \u201cForgive me, Allie...please?\u201d</p><p>I snorted, trying to hold back my laughter, but couldn\u2019t. I glanced at Luke and found him grinning at Brandon and Allie, and it made me feel warm inside. Which kinda scared me.</p><p>Luke caught my eyes with his and the smiles faded from both of our faces. Without thinking, I leaned in and kissed his lips softly before quickly pulling back. He blinked at me in astonishment and I heard twin gasps come from the other side of the table. I turned my head and found Allie and Brandon both staring at me, Allie\u2019s jaw hanging open and Brandon grinning widely.</p><p>I closed my eyes and dropped my head to the table. I couldn\u2019t believe I had just done that.</p><p>I felt a heavy arm drape itself around my shoulders, pulling me in close to a hard, warm body. I raised my eyes and found Luke\u2019s face close to mine. He smiled at me, pulled me back from the table, and tucked me into his side.</p><p>Allie\u2019s shrill voice turned my attention back across the table and I watched as Brandon slid his hand over to my drink and smoothly pulled it back before draining it, Allie shrieking in indignation and slapping at him.</p><p>\u201cBrandon, you dickhead, that\u2019s two drinks you owe us. Get your ass up to the bar!\u201d Allie was yelling at him, all the while shoving him off the edge of the booth. She managed to push him out completely and followed him towards the bar, presumably to make sure he actually replaced our drinks.</p> <p>\u201cMiss me?\u201d Luke\u2019s voice rasped in my ear.</p><p>I quirked my eyebrow at him, refusing to answer. He smiled a slow, secretive smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, who\u2019s Bushzilla?\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell no! Not touching that one with a twenty foot pole!</p><p>I shrugged, then asked, \u201cWhat about the shop? Aren\u2019t you busy on Saturday nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, usually. I got a couple other people that work part time sometimes. Brandon and I decided to grab some dinner real quick and saw you. Couldn\u2019t resist a chance to do this-\u201d and he kissed me. Hard, deep, lots of tongue.</p><p>I was lost in a daze when he finally pulled back from my lips but the catcalls and whistles rippling through the bar around us broke through, causing my cheeks to heat.</p><p>Allie and Brandon returned from the bar, each carrying two drinks. Allie had the replacement margaritas for us, and the guys had beers. I snagged mine from Allie, gulping it down quickly, which earned me another quizzical look from Luke, a grin and high-five from Brandon, and a kick under the table from Allie.</p><p>While we, well, they, were finishing their drinks, Luke and Brandon grabbed menus to look over. The waitress came over (she must have been new, because I didn\u2019t know her) to take their orders, and they both looked over to each of us and asked if we wanted anything.</p><p>Glancing at my watch, I realized it was heading towards eight o\u2019clock and I hadn\u2019t had anything since this morning at Jenna\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll just take an order of the pizza rolls. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>I loved the pizza rolls at Griff\u2019s. They weren\u2019t like the pizza rolls you buy at the store or anything. These were wonton wrappers filled with pizza sauce, spicy pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese all wrapped up and deep fried to ooey-gooey /crispy crunchy perfection! I always had a hard time deciding between those and the tater poppers, which are these little shredded potato bundles that are filled with a mixture of cream cheese and jalapenos and then deep fried. Yum...</p><p>I had intended for the waitress to hear my order, but apparently she was too caught up in undressing Brandon with her eyes. Wait...ohmigod! She was staring at Allie! Whoa!</p><p>I heard Luke clear his throat beside me, and when the waitress blushed and tore her eyes from Allie, he ordered my pizza rolls for me and a bacon cheeseburger for himself. Brandon ordered the same, and then Allie ordered an order of tater poppers (Yes! I get to steal some!). The waitress stuttered through repeating our orders back to make sure she had them right before she took off towards the kitchen door behind the bar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t waste any time. \u201cAllison Anne McCormick, what the hell was that?\u201d I said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, no big deal. I got pretty drunk last night running interception for you and maybe kissed her? Okay, yeah, I kissed her. And apparently laid it on her good,\u201d she chuckled, winking at me.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d Brandon shouted beside Allie, throwing his hand up to give her a high-five. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, baby! Shee-it!\u201d</p><p>Allie just grinned, slapped fives with Brandon, and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m an equal opportunity kisser, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>See? Free spirit. Very free. But I love her anyway.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The four of us, me, Allie, Luke, and Brandon, all sat at Griff\u2019s enjoying our food and drinks, and I guess time just flew. When I glanced at my watch, I gasped and shouted to Allie, \u201cWe gotta go! We\u2019re gonna miss the show!\u201d</p><p>Allie wasted no time in downing her drink, and then started trying to push Brandon out of the booth.</p><p>I looked at Luke and opened my mouth to ask him to excuse us so we could go, not in a million years imagining that he would want to go with us but he cut me off.</p> <p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going down to Shimbots on Broad to watch the drag show. Why? Wanna come?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Luke looked over at Brandon who just shrugged before he answered, \u201cSure. We\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Allie and I looked at each other, not needing to say a word because we both knew what the other was thinking. Oh boy.</p><p>After having a minor squabble over who was paying the bill (Allie and I lost), we all headed out and walked the two blocks to Shimbots. The show was set to start at ten, but I knew that it wouldn\u2019t. Queens always run late. I knew this with certainty because I, at one time, spent most of my nights hanging out at Shimbots with my best boy friend, Jace, who, I swear, was the straightest gay man you\u2019d ever meet in your life. He had a penchant for drag queens, so I became a \u2018fag hag\u2019 and ended up as an assistant to Needa Mann. I spent my evenings soothing tempers, dressing, pinning, poking, fluffing, and generally running around like a crazy person, but it was fun. Seriously, though? You hafta give them Queens props, cause those gowns they prance around in? They weigh a ton!</p><p>We walked in the door at ten after ten and before we could even pull out our wallets to pay the cover, I heard the unmistakable voice of Needa.</p> <p>\u201cAiiyeeeee! Emma, you sweet ass little thing, get in here! Girl, you know you don\u2019t have to pay no cover charge! Just grab your groupies and come sit at my table. Okay, sugar bear? Kiss kiss!\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head at her, grinned, and waved at the boy manning the ticket counter as I passed, looking over my shoulder to make sure that my little group was following. We walked into the main room, which was a huge open space, dotted liberally with tables and chairs and interspersed with sitting areas consisting of sleek, modern leather couches, love seats, and end tables. There was a black lacquered dance floor that actually rose up to become the stage, and a large horseshoe shaped bar smack dab in the middle.</p><p>I grabbed a table close to where the stage comes up, the one that Needa always had reserved for her guests and me and Jace. I hadn\u2019t seen Jace in about a year. He hooked up with a little hottie and moved to Wyoming. Not sure why they went there, but it had something to do with cowboys and hunting. Strange, I know.</p><p>I pulled out a chair and sat, noting that Allie sat across from me, Luke beside me, and Brandon beside him, sitting closer to Allie, though. As soon as we got settled, a waiter came and took our drink order, and the lights dimmed, getting ready for the show to start.</p><p>In the darkness, I felt a hand skim down my arm before coming to rest high on my thigh, making me gasp when it squeezed gently. I didn\u2019t move, and neither did Luke\u2019s hand, even when the lights came up. The stage had been raised and in the center stood the Queen Emcee, Showmia Buffet, stuffed into an outfit done up like the Chiquita Banana girl with fake fruit on her head and more glued strategically to other interesting places. Showmia Buffet (Glenn when not in drag) is middle aged, paunchy, and prone to channeling Weird Al Yankovic. Tonight proved no different.</p><p>The speakers started blaring Weird Al\u2019s Michael Jackson parody, Eat It, and Showmia began prancing around , lip syncing the lyrics and ripping fruit off her clothes while gyrating her hips and circling the stage so she could collect the tips being offered by audience members standing at the edge.</p><p>I looked over to Luke and he met my eyes, smiling at me. I saw Brandon grinning and shaking his head, and Allie was hooting and hollering and dancing in her seat. I dropped my hand from the top of the table down over Luke\u2019s, and entwined our fingers. He gave me an even warmer look that made my cheeks flush before we both turned back to watch the end of Showmia\u2019s performance. And boy, was it a doozy!</p><p>Just before the last \u2018Just Eat It\u2019, Showmia reached down and ripped off the last piece of fruit left on the outfit, which incidentally turned out to be a real banana glued precisely onto the skirt where Glenn\u2019s own banana would be located, peeled it, and took a big bite just as the final lyrics rang out.</p> <p>The crowd went wild, clapping and cheering, and I jumped up to join in. After Showmia, there were two more performances, and even though they were good, they didn\u2019t have quite the stage presence as Showmia Buffet. Needa had come by the table a couple times to chat briefly, not staying long before flitting off in a whirl of teased hair and Obsession perfume. After the third performer took her bow, Allie asked if I was ready to go. Luke caught my eye and nodded yes. Yup. I was ready.</p><p>The four of us walked back towards Griff\u2019s where Allie and I had left our cars. I stood beside my little bug, waiting to say goodbye to Allie and Brandon. I wasn\u2019t going to say goodbye to Luke; from the expression on his face, I was about to say hello to him...a lot of him. Allie gave me a hug and told me that she and Brandon decided to go have another drink at Griff\u2019s. I told her to have fun, which made her cross her eyes at me and stick out her tongue. She\u2019s so mature.</p><p>As they walked away, I turned to Luke and asked brazenly, \u201cSo is the night over or are you following me home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to stop by the shop real quick, make sure everything got locked up right, then I\u2019ll be there.\u201d He leaned in and brushed his lips against my ear, making me shiver as he said, \u201cBe naked. And wet.\u201d</p><p>Pshaw. Like I have a choice? The naked part, yeah, I could choose to obey. The wet part? Let\u2019s just say my cha-chi and I need to have a talk.</p><p>An hour and a half passed and I found myself sitting on my couch, wrapped in my bathrobe, flipping through the channels on the tv. And if you\u2019ve ever tried to watch tv late on a Saturday night, then you know there\u2019s nothing on but infomercials and skin flicks. Where the fuck was Luke?</p><p>I finally gave up at about three-thirty and shut off the tv. I got up to lock the door and as I approached it, I heard a soft knock. I peeked out the peephole and saw Luke standing on my porch, looking exhausted. Wrapping my robe tight around me, I opened the door, standing aside for him to enter.</p><p>He brushed by me, leaning in to kiss my lips softly as he did.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cHey, back. You okay?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. Just tired. Look, I\u2019m sorry, Emma. I probably shouldn\u2019t have even stopped by so late, but I didn\u2019t want you to think I\u2019d ditched you or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Luke. But what happened? I thought you were coming right behind me?\u201d</p><p>He ran his hands roughly over his face before answering. \u201cYeah, babe, I was. But I got to the shop and one of my part timers was still there. I keep the hours of the shop pretty flexible and we stay pretty busy. It was successful when Lenny had it, and has only gotten busier since, and because of that, I don\u2019t have to stay open late and cater to the drunk asses who come in to get ink that they regret twelve hours later after waking up hung over in a puddle of their own puke. The latest I ever keep it open is ten, and that\u2019s usually to accommodate someone specifically.\u201d</p><p>He pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. \u201cWe left the show after midnight. I walked into my shop and that little fuckerass dumbshit had six people sittin\u2019 in the lobby, smoking a fucking joint, of all things, while he had some whore in Brandon\u2019s room. She was sittin\u2019 on his lap with his dick in her while he was shooting a fuckin\u2019 tattoo on her tit! Christ!\u201d He was shouting by this point, and I didn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>I walked over to him and slid my arms around his waist, laying my head against his chest. After a beat, his arms came up and wrapped around me and I felt his lips touch my hair. Pulling back from his arms, I led him to the couch and sat beside him, tucking my feet up underneath me and leaning into his warmth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened when you walked in?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI stood in the door for a second, not believing my eyes. She\u2019d sit still on his dick until he\u2019d go to re-ink, and then she\u2019d bounce on him a couple times until he brought the needle back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d I said. Wait... Ack! \u201cIt sounds different...I mean, awkward!\u201d Shut up, Emma!</p><p>Luke gazed at me, his eyes heating a bit as he gave me a calculating look. Yikes!</p><p>He continued after a minute. \u201cFucking idiot didn\u2019t even realize it was me standing there. He didn\u2019t even look up, just told me if I was watching, that\u2019s cool, but if I wanted a tat, I\u2019d have to wait out front with the others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow. What a moron.\u201d I shook my head, floored by what he was telling me.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Dipshit. I finally cleared my throat and it would have been pretty damn comical except for the fact that Brandon\u2019s favorite liner machine, his three hundred dollar Workhorse Carnivore, went flying when Tom jumped up, and broke when it smashed into the floor. I finally got him to shut up and stop apologizing long enough to fire him, told him that he owed Brandon for the liner, and kicked him and his drunken whore out into the street, along with all his buddies in the lobby. Spent the rest of the time sterilizing and closing shit up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, wait. Some little slut is walking around town with a half finished tattoo on her titty?\u201d I asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYep. And it isn\u2019t getting finished, either. At least not in my shop.\u201d Luke grinned. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be something to hear? Her telling someone why it isn\u2019t finished?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, grinning back. We stood there grinning like loons at each other for a minute before Luke\u2019s smile started to slip, and his eyes darkened. Ooh. My cha-chi woke up like a bear from hibernation, screaming, \u2018Feed me!\u2019 Well, you know what I mean.</p><p>Luke started toward me, and instead of backing away, I met him head on, wrapping my arms around him and meeting his lips with mine, opening immediately as his tongue sought entrance. We kissed wildly, fumbling with each others clothes as we bumped our way down the hall toward my bedroom. We got about halfway there before I said fuck it and slid to the floor, Luke sliding over and in me in a heartbeat.</p> <p>I gasped and moaned softly as his thickness pushed into me as deep as he could before rearing back and thrusting back in, pounding into me over and over. I felt myself fall headlong into bliss almost immediately, and with every thrust of Luke\u2019s hips against me, I felt the waves cresting again. I held back, not wanting to let go without Luke this time.</p><p>Luke pressed himself against me tightly, burying his face in my neck, sliding his hands under my back to curl around the top of my shoulders, his hands gripping tightly. He shortened his strokes a bit, then began pulling out almost completely before sliding back in, stroking over my clit with every thrust. I began moaning, curling my legs around his thighs, my fingers digging into his back, even as I fought to hold back.</p><p>\u201cEmma, sugar, let go,\u201d Luke whispered in my ear, making me shiver even as the pleasure swelled, taking me under. \u201cThat\u2019s it baby,\u201d Luke groaned against my neck before slamming deep and I felt him shudder as he followed.</p><p>We laid there panting in the dark hallway for a minute, Luke still inside me, trying to catch our breath, then Luke slid out, getting to his feet and leaning down to take my hand and pull me up. I leaned against him, lifting my head for his kiss. I felt his hand come up and cup my cheek, his thumb stroking gently over my bottom lip, and I felt myself falling.</p><p>I jerked myself out of Luke\u2019s arms, stunned by the emotions swirling inside me. I realized that Luke was standing in front of me, arms still outstretched toward me from where I had pulled away so abruptly. As I watched, his arms slowly dropped to his sides and, embarrassed, I turned, grabbing my robe from the floor and fleeing to my room.</p><p>Great, just great Emma. Now he\u2019s gonna think you\u2019re Looney Tunes! I chastised myself as I thrust my arms into the sleeves of my robe, pulling it around me tightly as I sat on the edge of my bed. I leaned forward, resting my elbows on my knees and dropping my head into my hands. Two sock-clad feet came into view, standing in front of me. I felt Luke\u2019s hand lift my chin and looked up into his eyes.</p><p>His gorgeous eyes. So intense in that gorgeous face of his, with his sexy lips, extra sexy with that silver hoop through his bottom lip, lips that were...smirking at me? What the hell? Luke stood there watching me with a knowing smile, the corner of his mouth curved up in a secret smile/smirk that worried me as much as it turned me on.</p><p>\u201cSugar, you can run...\u201d Luke drawled, letting his words trail off, the implied meaning screaming into the silence.</p> <p>I jerked my chin out of his grasp, narrowing my eyes at him before gritting out through clenched teeth, \u201cWhat kind of game are you playing here, Luke? I mean, what are we doing? We don\u2019t even know each other and you say things like I\u2019m just , I don\u2019t know, yours or something. Like you can just snap your fingers or command me and I\u2019ll obey, just like that.\u201d I snapped my fingers into the air, emphasizing my words.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d Luke didn\u2019t say anything after that, just smiled again. Then he turned on his heel, walking out of the room.</p><p>I followed him, intent on making him explain just what the hell he meant by that cryptic statement, watching as he stopped to pull on his clothes that were strewn through the hall before he continued walking away from me.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I shouted at his retreating back. \u201cI am what? What the fuck! Don\u2019t you walk away from me...\u201d</p><p>Luke kept going until he got to the living room, where he stopped at the coffee table, grabbing my phone where it was sitting beside my purse. I stopped beside him, reaching out to try to wrench my phone out of his grasp. He easily evaded my hands, holding my phone over his head out of my reach as he punched in a series of numbers. I heard his phone start ringing in his pocket before he hit one last button on my phone and then handed it to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He then leaned in, kissed me quick and hard on my lips, grinned at me and walked out my front door. I stood there in shock, completely dumfounded by the fact that he\u2019d just walked out. I snapped, stomping my foot and shrieking in the back of my throat, and then I threw my phone into the couch. Hard. Oh, shit! My phone bounced off the back of the couch and flew back at me. I threw my hands up, more in defense than anything, but also trying to catch it before it could hit something and shatter. Luckily it thumped into my chest (Ouch!) and I was able to save it.</p><p>Shaking my head at myself and my own stupidity (If my phone would have shattered, it would have been the fourth one this year. What? I have a temper. So sue me.) I stomped to the door to lock it before stalking down the hall to my room, where I fell into a fitful sleep.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>My phone woke me up the next morning, ringing in the vicinity of my head. I lifted my head groggily, trying to locate it but couldn\u2019t see it. I shoved my hand under my pillow, searching blindly until I hit it with my fingers. I pulled it out to answer, but it quit ringing before I could get my fingers to work enough to slide across the touch screen to unlock my phone. I checked the display, noting that I had missed my mom\u2019s call before my eyes hit my alarm clock. Fuck me, I\u2019m late!</p> <p>I scrambled out of bed and set a new world record in the shower before throwing on an old pair of jeans and a tshirt, and pulling on my brother\u2019s hoodie as I slid my feet into my sneakers. I didn\u2019t bother tying them, just ran down the hall to grab my purse and my keys. Then I had to run back to my bedroom to get my phone, which had fallen to the bed in my mad dash to get ready.</p><p>I pulled up at my parents\u2019 house about half an hour late and headed inside. Since I was so late, everyone was already there and seated at the table, plates heaping with food. I breezed in and slid into my seat, reaching for the plate of bacon as everyone\u2019s eyes settled on me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d I said, filling my plate. At least once a month my family all got together for Sunday breakfast. Mom pulled out all the stops, making everyone\u2019s favorite foods. We had gravy, made from the sausage and bacon drippings with pieces of sausage and bacon crumbled in it, biscuits, scrambled eggs (with cheese for me, yum!), sausage patties, strips of bacon, shredded hash browns, popovers, sausage links, and French toast.</p><p>My mom got up and poured me a glass of orange, strawberry, banana juice and brought it to me, kissing the top of my head and saying, \u201cGood morning, o tardy one!\u201d</p><p>I grinned at her, thanking her for the juice before saying hi to my dad. He grunted, which meant hi back. He\u2019s lucky I am fluent in Dad Speak or we\u2019d never have a conversation. I waved to my sisters, winked at my niece and nephew, nodded to Noah, and stuck my tongue out at Calland. I still hadn\u2019t forgiven him for dumping Drunk Leah on my carpet while I was getting\u2019 my Luke on that night.</p> <p>My sisters both waved back at me, although Jenna gave me her we-need-to-talk face, Hayden laughed and tried to wink back, succeeding only in blinking her eyes owlishly, Jarrod grinned, Noah nodded back, and Calland, calmly as you please, reached across the table and stole my plate.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I cried. \u201cMo-om, Calland stole my plate,\u201d I whined. Yes, I know I was acting like a four year old, but hey. That was my food!</p><p>Mom just grinned and shook her head. I think she\u2019s used to us by now. Her and Dad have always been fans of the whole \u2018work it out for yourselves\u2019 type of conflict resolution, going as far as to pushing the furniture back in the living room to clear a space before letting us loose on each other. We never really fought, though. It was more wrestling around, trying to best the other by whatever means necessary, whether it be slapping, tickling, punching, sitting on top of, pinching, and biting. Biting was generally frowned upon, but was allowable as long as we weren\u2019t doing it to maim or draw blood.</p><p>All of this usually ended with one of us (me or my sisters) pissed off, screaming, crying, and stomping into our rooms to slam the door, and Calland laughing hysterically. Asshole.</p><p>I got up from the table, went around to where Calland was sitting, and tried to take my plate back. He pulled it away from me, trying to stab my hand with his fork.</p><p>\u201cCalland, give me my food you asshole!\u201d I shrieked.</p> <p>Calland said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Then he gave me my plate, but not before snatching all of my bacon and my biscuit.</p><p>Sighing, I took my now lightened plate back to my seat and replenished my empty bacon and biscuit spaces and commenced eating.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d my mom began. (She always makes me cringe when she starts sentences like that. You never can tell what\u2019s gonna come out of her mouth!) \u201cLeah and Calland tell me that you had some company the other night. Slut!\u201d she said, laughing and winking at me.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at her. Dad just shook his head and grunted again, while everyone else started laughing with Mom. I tuned them out because my mind had already drifted to thoughts of Luke and what the hell last night was all about.</p><p>Breakfast passed with me shoving food in my face (one, because I was starving, and two, because then I didn\u2019t have to answer my mom\u2019s questions. She did teach us not to talk with our mouths full, you know...) Leah and Calland took turns trying to one up each other with one liners about walking in on me and Luke. Noah excused himself and took the kids outside. Dad just sat there eating his food. He did, however, grunt every now and then when Leah or Calland managed a decent joke. Mom and Jenna just watched, shaking their heads and grinning at us.</p><p>After breakfast was done, me, Leah, and Jenna cleaned up and did the dishes for mom. We visited for a while before we all started dispersing. I said my goodbyes, gave my mom a kiss and hug, and headed home.</p><p>When I got home, I cleaned up my house and started a load of laundry before heading out to the screened-in porch off the back of my house. I curled up on my lounger in my penguin pants and Calland\u2019s hoodie to read a book. My eyes kept drifting to my phone, though. Giving in, I snatched it up and scrolled through my contacts. Sure enough, Luke had programmed his number into my phone. I also noticed that I had a text message that hadn\u2019t been opened yet.</p><p>The text was from Luke and it simply said, \u201cMine.\u201d Geez. Men and their cryptic messages. It showed that he had sent it around four a.m., after he left my house. I hit reply and typed: Mine? Wtf does that mean? I took a deep breath in and finished: I think things got a little weird between us. Sorry, but I don\u2019t think we should see each other anymore. I\u2019m just not sure where this is going, and can\u2019t see it working out.</p> <p>Before I could change my mind, I hit send and went to change the laundry over. My phone beeped as I was starting my second load in the washer, telling me I had a new message. I picked it up and opened the text from Luke.</p><p>Mine. Remember when I said you are last night? You said I treat you like you\u2019re mine or something. I was just letting you know, you are. Mine.</p><p>My phone beeped again and I opened his second message.</p><p>You think too much. Stop it.</p><p>Oh. My. God. He can\u2019t just claim me like that! Can he? Yikes.</p><p>I hit reply and typed: I think you\u2019re drunk. I\u2019m not a toy for you to possess and we just met! You don\u2019t even know me!</p><p>His response came back quickly.</p><p>Nope, not drunk. Again, stop thinking! I know you aren\u2019t a toy, but I sure as hell love playing with you. And I know enough...for now. We\u2019ll get to know each other very well, I promise. I\u2019ll call you in a bit, sugar. Got some things to do. Later, babe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nope. Uh-uh. Not talking to him later. I didn\u2019t reply, instead calling Allie to see how her night ended, and to see if Brandon had told her about the drama at the tattoo shop.</p><p>She sounded half-asleep, mumbling, \u201c \u2018lo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, sunshine!\u201d I said brightly. \u201cSleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh...Emma...why are you calling so early?\u201d Allie groaned.</p> <p>\u201cEarly? Allie honey, its almost two in the afternoon! Get your lazy ass up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo? Seriously? Holy mother of batman, I haven\u2019t slept this late since college!\u201d Allie sounded wide awake now.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m coming over and we\u2019re having sundaes. We need to talk.\u201d I heard a car pulling up outside, looked out and saw Leah getting out and heading towards the door. \u201cAnd Leah\u2019s coming, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. See you in ten,\u201d Allie replied before hanging up.</p><p>I wrenched open the front door before Leah could touch the knob, told her, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Allie\u2019s,\u201d and ran into the kitchen to grab the makings for our sundaes.</p> <p>\u201cOooh, we\u2019re having Special Sundaes?\u201d Leah asked.</p><p>\u201cYup. Let\u2019s roll.\u201d</p><p>We got into my bug and headed out. A few minutes later we pulled up at Allie\u2019s little cottage, where she was standing on the porch, waving at us. Leah and I grabbed everything and headed in.</p><p>We made sundaes and carried them out to Leah\u2019s back deck, sitting in the sunshine.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said to Allie, \u201cSpill.\u201d</p><p>Leah looked at me and raised her brows questioningly. I filled her in.</p> <p>\u201cAllie and I met at Griff\u2019s last night, had some drinks with Luke and Brandon. Brandon is Luke\u2019s brother, Luke you remember. Or, maybe not, you were pretty toasted that night! Anywho, we drank, went to the show at Shimbots, and then split up. I went home to wait for Luke, and Allie went back into Griff\u2019s with Brandon. So, Leah, now you\u2019re caught up, Allie, talk.\u201d</p><p>Allie rolled her eyes at me and started talking. \u201cBrandon and I had just gotten our drinks and were sitting down talking. Well, more like arguing because I swear that\u2019s all we do, but Brandon got a call from Luke and said some shit went down at the shop. He didn\u2019t go into detail, but apparently Luke had it under control, so we had a couple more drinks. I tried to get him to dance, he wouldn\u2019t, so I did without him. Then, we said goodnight and left. That\u2019s it, the end.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t buying it. Sober Allie has a hard time resisting finding someone to warm her bed, Drinking Allie finds it impossible.</p><p>\u201cNot the end. I know you, McCormick. What was it? All the way? Third base?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Leah chimed in, \u201cYeah, Allie, even I know that wasn\u2019t the end. Who are you trying to kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious! That was it...except maybe I kissed him.\u201d She mumbled the last bit, but we still heard.</p><p>My face broke into a huge grin and I smacked her arm. \u201cI told you! So? I had to tell you all the sordid details with Luke, now its your turn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a good kiss.\u201d Allie smiled softly at the memory. \u201cIt just happened. We were walking out of the bar, he walked me to my car, we said good night, and before he turned away, I just grabbed him and laid it on him. He kissed me back after a second, and we left it at that. Now, Emma, its your turn!\u201d</p> <p>Leah turned to me, bouncing in her seat. \u201cYeah! I gotta hear this! You finally get some?\u201d</p><p>Allie sold me out, crowing, \u201cHell yeah, she did! The other night and last night, too, if everything went as planned!\u201d</p><p>I glared at Allie, rolled my eyes, and started talking. I filled them in about waiting for hours until he showed, told them what happened at the shop (I\u2019m still kind of wondering how that would work) and finished with our fast and furious sex on the hallway floor and subsequent weirdness. Then I told them about the texts.</p><p>Allie and Leah just sat there, staring at me in silence, jaws slack, eyes wide. Then Allie said, \u201cWait. So these people were fucking while he was actually giving a tattoo? That\u2019s...interesting.\u201d</p><p>Leah nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cFocus, people!\u201d I shouted. \u201cWhat am I going to do about Luke?\u201d</p><p>Leah spoke first. \u201cI think you should go for it. I mean, he\u2019s into you, Em. And if he\u2019s good in bed?\u201d She made that a question, and I nodded emphatically. \u201cWell there ya go. Hot, good in bed, and into you. What more do you need?\u201d</p><p>Allie nodded before adding, \u201cYeah, Emma. He told you literally that you were his. He\u2019s staked a claim on you, and I wouldn\u2019t be running from that if I were you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut guys, that\u2019s just it! He staked a claim! Who does that? We\u2019re not in the ice ages again, and I\u2019m not going to date a caveman that expects me to just roll over and do whatever whenever. If I wanted that, I\u2019d have stayed with that douche bag, Brad. He\u2019d grunt and expect me to not only come running, but to know what that meant without asking. FUCK. THAT. Been there, done that, and I\u2019m not going back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm, I don\u2019t think Luke is like that,\u201d Allie interjected. \u201cI get the feeling that he\u2019s just very confident in himself and gets what he wants. And what he wants, babe, is you! Go with it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with Allie, Emma. You should go for it. It\u2019d be nice to see my sister settled down finally,\u201d Leah said.</p><p>\u201cLeah, you have a sister that\u2019s settled down. And since when do you care about my relationship status?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI care,\u201d she huffed. \u201cFrankly, I just don\u2019t want to be known as the girl related to the dumbass who dumped that hot ass tattoo guy. You know, I\u2019ve been wanting a tattoo...\u201d she trailed off thoughtfully before giving me a look that plainly said, \u2018you don\u2019t go for him and I\u2019m gonna get him.\u2019</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d I growled.</p><p>Allie broke in, trying to prevent the argument brewing. \u201cLeah, cut it out. You wouldn\u2019t do that to your sister, and its just mean trying to provoke her like that. Emma, you\u2019re stuck. Deal with it. And enjoy it, honey!\u201d She grinned, waggling her brows at me.</p><p>I sighed, clearly not getting anywhere in this conversation. My phone beeped and I looked at it. It was a message from Luke, asking where I was.</p><p>Out. We\u2019re done, remember? I typed and hit send.</p><p>I took a big bite of my sundae, then tipped the bowl up and took a big gulp of strawberry daiquiri. Allie and Leah were talking about some dress Allie had at her store that she thought Leah would look good in. My phone beeped again.</p><p>No. We\u2019re not. Where are you?</p><p>I sighed before responding: I said I was out. Luke, you can\u2019t just barge into my life and take over. You cant just get it into your head that I\u2019m yours, either. We fucked. That\u2019s it.</p><p>You know, for such a cute little thing, you\u2019re a real pain in the ass. Where are you, Emma?</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOD!\u201d I shouted as I read his last text and then growled low in my throat.</p><p>Allie reached over and yanked my phone out of my hand. She looked at me, shook her head, and then started typing.</p><p>\u201cAllie! Don\u2019t you dare, you interfering little witch!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cToo late!\u201d she said, handing my phone back to me.</p><p>I heard my phone beep again, almost immediately. Shooting a death stare at Allie, I opened the message. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On my way.</p><p>I stood up and grabbed my purse, digging for my keys. I couldn\u2019t find them; however, I did hear a slight jingling coming from my left where Leah was sitting.</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d I gritted out, my jaw clenched tight. \u201cGive. Me. My. Keys.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a blank stare while trying to keep from grinning. \u201cWhat keys?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLEAH!\u201d I yelled. \u201cGive me my keys! Now!\u201d</p><p>She gave up the fight and just grinned unabashedly at me. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>I repeated myself again, and when her answer didn\u2019t change, I lunged at her. She squealed and tossed the keys to Allie who caught them and took off running inside the house, while Leah headed around the side of the house through the yard. I followed, hot on Allie\u2019s heels, yelling threats at her. She ran through the house and out the front door, heading off the front porch and into the yard where Leah was waiting to grab my keys again.</p><p>Allie got about three feet into the yard before I managed to twist my fingers into the back of her shirt and pull, tackling her into the grass. We rolled, her trying to get away, or at least find an opening to toss the keys to Leah, and me trying to hold on to her as I worked my way up her body to get to her hand.</p><p>A shadow fell over us as we struggled on the ground and Allie and I both looked up. Dancing grey-blue eyes looked down at us, and I slumped over Allie, laying my forehead in the grass and groaning. Allie laughed and pushed me off to the side before accepting the hand that Luke held down to help her up. He stood her on her feet and reached down for me. I got to my feet myself, avoiding his hand.</p> <p>Luke just shook his head and sighed before asking Allie and Leah, \u201cIs she always this difficult?\u201d</p><p>Leah, big fat mouth that she is, replied, \u201cEh, she wasn\u2019t always. Douche Bag Brad did a number on her.\u201d</p><p>He quirked a brow at her response, silently entreating her to expound on just who Douche Bag Brad was.</p><p>I shot Leah a glare, daring her to say another word before I turned to Luke, crossing my arms in front of me. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought I told you that we were through!\u201d I shouted at him.</p><p>He just smiled at me and calmly said, \u201cThat\u2019s just it. You think too much, sugar. We\u2019re not done, not by a long shot.\u201d He looked over at Leah, who had taken my keys back from Allie, and asked her, \u201cYou good to take her car back?\u201d</p><p>Leah nodded, her and Allie both grinning widely.</p> <p>Luke grabbed my hand and pulled, tucking me into his side, his arm wrapping around my shoulders as he started walking me toward his car parked in front of Allie\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cLuke, wait!\u201d I yelled, frantically trying to think of a way to stall him. \u201cMy purse! I need it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d he stated.</p><p>\u201cMy cell phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need it either, sugar.\u201d</p><p>He stopped us by the passenger door of his car, opening it and lightly pushing me in, one hand on the top of my head and one on my hip. He closed the door as soon as I was completely inside and walked around to get in.</p><p>I turned to him. \u201cResorting to kidnapping now, are we? Where do you get off?\u201d I huffed.</p><p>\u201cIn your tight little body,\u201d he responded, deliberately twisting my words.</p> <p>I gasped as butterflies started dancing in my belly at his words, while other parts of me became damp. No! Not going there, not giving in! I sat quietly for a minute, twisting my hands in my lap.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me, then? Will you please just take me home?\u201d I asked the last question quietly, pleading with him and hoping that he would fall for it.</p><p>\u201cNo, and you\u2019ll see. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d he replied.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything else, just stared out the window as he drove. After about fifteen minutes, we turned onto a narrow lane, winding back through the trees. We pulled up in front of a two story log cabin style house with large windows framed by red shutters, a red tin roof, and a wraparound porch. It was beautiful, set back in a clearing in the woods, and it looked so homey and inviting. I wondered who lived there and asked Luke the same.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d he said.</p><p>We got out of the car and walked up on the porch. Luke slid a key into the lock and opened the door, stepping back to let me pass.</p><p>I stared at him, not moving into the house like he intended. \u201cYou live here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWell, me and Brandon and Doug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoug?\u201d I asked. I got my answer when a large yellow lab came bounding out the door at me, tail wagging, tongue lolling out the side of his wide open, full of large, sharp, pointy teeth mouth...yikes! I took a step back as he gathered himself to leap at me, terrified that I was about to be eaten. I looked at Luke, waiting for him to do something, say something, anything to save me, but he just grinned at me.</p><p>I felt two saucer sized paws come up on my shoulders, surprisingly gentle, and a big, wet tongue licked up the side of my face. My eyes flew open (I didn\u2019t even realize that I had closed them) and I stared into deep brown doggie eyes. My heart melted and I brought my hands up to rub his soft, floppy ears. After a second, he dropped to the ground and ambled away.</p><p>Luke smiled. \u201cEmma, meet Doug. He likes you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cI think I like him, too. He just caught me off guard and he\u2019s so big!\u201d</p><p>We both turned to watch Doug as he marked about a dozen trees before ambling back towards the porch. He walked up the steps and stopped by my side, where he reached his nose up and nipped the sleeve of my hoodie in his teeth, tugging me towards the door. I walked inside, not given much choice.</p><p>I heard Luke laughing behind me as he followed, closing the door behind him. Doug let me go once I cleared the door, walked to a large overstuffed tan couch, climbed up on it and laid down with a sigh.</p><p>I looked around the living room, surprised by the openness and warmth. It was definitely lived in, but not cluttered or dirty. To the left, a wide staircase led upstairs, and the kitchen was on the other side of the living room, separated by a long breakfast bar, complete with stool seating. To the right was a door I assumed would be a closet, and then a hallway leading to unseen rooms.</p><p>As I stood there taking everything in, I felt Luke come up behind me and lift my hair over my shoulder sweeping it off my neck. He then leaned in and pressed his lips softly behind my ear, kissing my tattoo. I felt myself melting back against him and stiffened, refusing to give in to the need starting to course through my body.</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>He answered me with his mouth still against my skin. \u201cSo you can know me. And because I\u2019ve been dreaming of having you in my bed since I touched you the first time.\u201d He pressed kisses down my throat, nipping my skin when he reached my shoulder.</p><p>I shivered at the feel of his teeth, closing my eyes at the sensation. I started to turn, forgetting for the moment that I was fighting against this, when he stepped back, dropping his hands from me.</p><p>He sat on the couch beside Doug, stroking his head absent-mindedly as he began speaking unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cI bought this place for me and Brandon after Lenny passed away. He had left us a pretty good sum in addition to the shop. Brandon could have gotten his own place, but honestly, neither one of us wanted that. This is the first real home we\u2019ve ever had, and we\u2019ve only really had each other.\u201d He paused as I crossed the room to sink into the overstuffed armchair that matched the couch he and Doug were sitting on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOur parents died in an accident when I was twelve. They weren\u2019t the best of parents, but they were our parents, you know? Anyway, we were sent to live with my dad\u2019s brother, who unfortunately, was a drunken asshole. He liked to come home from work and get shit faced. He had a wife, if you could call her that. She was treated more like a servant, though she was probably the nicest anyone had ever been to either of us.</p><p>One night, Brandon wasn\u2019t feeling well and ended up getting sick in the hallway as he tried to run to the bathroom. He was only ten, you know? So he called for Celia, hoping she\u2019d come help him, maybe mother him a little. Instead, he got Stu. Stu stumbled down the hall, saw the mess, and starting yelling at Brandon, telling him he was a worthless piece of shit that did nothing but make messes and cost him money. I had run out of my room when I heard him start yelling to get to Brandon. Brandon was crying, trying to explain that he didn\u2019t feel good, but Stu didn\u2019t want to hear it. Didn\u2019t want to hear it so much that he backhanded Brandon across the face, splitting his lip and knocking him to the floor. He raised his foot to kick him. A ten year old! He was gonna kick him in his ribs or his face, hell, I don\u2019t know which for sure, but I knew that I wasn\u2019t going to let him.</p><p>I screamed at Stu to stop, then I tackled him. I hit him over and over again until Celia pulled me off of him, then he just laid there. I never figured out if he had passed out from being drunk or if I had knocked him out, but Celia grabbed us up, packed our clothes into two large trash bags and drove us down to the Juvenile Detention Center. She told the guard on duty that they couldn\u2019t take us anymore, not that we were bad kids, but we just weren\u2019t wanted. We spent the night in a holding room and they put us in a foster home the next day.\u201d</p><p>Luke stopped talking for a minute, looking over to me and searching my face. I don\u2019t know what he was looking for, but he must have seen what he wanted because he continued.</p> <p>\u201cWe bounced from home to home until I was eighteen. I had always taken care of Brandon, so the day I turned eighteen, I packed us both up and we took off on our own. I managed to do well in school through the years, regardless of what was happening around us. I graduated, and I was gonna do everything in my power to make sure Brandon did the same. We lived in a shit hole motel in Timbleton, and I did odd jobs to make money. I had saved enough that we were doing okay, still living in the motel, but we didn\u2019t care, and I decided I was going to get my tattoo. My life was changed that day, and I\u2019ve never looked back.\u201d</p><p>I sat quietly, watching him watch me, but not knowing what to say. In the end, I didn\u2019t say anything, just got up and walked to him, pulling him to his feet and pointing upstairs. He twined his fingers in mine and we walked up the stairs, heading through a door at the end of the hall.</p><p>I pushed him down onto the huge king size bed dominating the room, following him down and laying my body over his, claiming his lips with my own. We both were breathing heavily when I slid to his side and sat up, undressing first myself, and then working on his clothes with his help. After we were both naked, I straddled him, my knees on either side of his hips, positioned myself over the velvety hard length of him, and pushed down, taking him deep inside me.</p><p>I rode him slowly, sliding up and down his hardness, running my hands up his chest, down his arms, entwining our fingers and raising his arms above his head, leaving our hands clasped. I soothed him with my body, my eyes locked onto his, his heat burning me from the inside out.</p><p>Then Luke pulled his hands from mine, grasped my hips hard, and began thrusting up into me, rolling his hips as he did which rubbed the tip of him against that secret place inside of me that made me sit up, throw my head back and fist my hands in my own hair as I slammed myself up and down on him, riding him harder and faster until I shattered, screaming out as I came around the hot, hard length of him pumping into me relentlessly.</p> <p>He followed me over, groaning out his release and holding my hips tightly to his, grinding me against him until I came again, shuddering in his arms as I collapsed on his chest. He held me tightly to him, still buried deep in my body, his face in my hair.</p><p>I felt his lips move, but didn\u2019t hear what he said. Bracing my elbows on the mattress beside his head, I raised myself enough to look down into his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head slightly before saying, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThank you for what, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for just being you. You didn\u2019t stare at me in horror or pity like every other person who\u2019s known my background. I don\u2019t talk about it much, and Brandon doesn\u2019t really talk about it at all. But it is what it is, it made us who we are today. And you just accepted it, but at the same time, you offered me comfort,\u201d he replied. \u201cSo, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t say anything to him, just leaned in and pressed my lips to his softly. I pushed myself up again, intending to slide off of him, but he tightened his arms and said, \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at him again, intending to call him on being overbearing again, but he just added a whispered, \u201cplease,\u201d and I relented. Not that it wasn\u2019t a really easy decision anyway, because quite frankly, I loved the feel of him still inside me.</p><p>We laid like that for a long time, not saying anything, each lost in our own thoughts. After a while, I shifted a little, intending to move to Luke\u2019s side, but the slide of him inside me made my breath catch. Luke heard it and slid against me again. I felt him stretching me as he hardened, completely filling me once again, and I moaned at the fullness.</p><p>Luke pressed his hands to my shoulders, urging me to sit up astride him, and I complied, seating him even deeper in my wet heat. Holding my hips, he sat up until we were face to face, then, completely taking me by surprise, he swung his legs off the edge of the bed and stood, supporting my weight like it was nothing, and still keeping our bodies connected. He turned back to the bed, laying me down on my back at the edge and, leaning back, grasping my ankles where they rested against the back of his thighs and pulling my legs up. Since I am so much shorter than him, my feet rested against his shoulders; he pushed my legs together and crossed my ankles, holding them up against his right shoulder with his hand, his left hand gripping my thigh as he began thrusting deep into me.</p><p>Having my legs so tightly closed around him made me feel every inch of him that much more, his hardness against my softness, grinding against me. Luke quickened his pace, pounding himself inside me over and over, the silence of the room broken only by our heavy breathing and the loud slap of his flesh against mine. I felt the pressure building as I soared higher and higher, coming closer and closer to the sweet edge of satisfaction and hanging there, not quite able to reach that peak that would set me free, send me flying over the edge.</p><p>I whimpered in my throat, my hands coming up to close over my breasts of their own volition, palming them roughly and squeezing before rolling my nipples between my fingers, pinching them hard. The sharp bite of pleasure-pain coursed through me, bringing me even closer to the edge, but still not quite taking me there. I let go of my right breast and slid my hand steadily down my body, but before my fingers could reach their destination, Luke dipped his head, turning it and sinking his teeth into my leg, just above my ankle. I screamed, exploding immediately into a million pieces, my body clenching rhythmically around his, which brought him instantly, pulsing and twitching deep inside as he ground his hips hard into me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the aftershocks faded, Luke pulled out of me and we crawled up to lie on the bed, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms. My legs felt like jello and I was exhausted and energized all at once. Luke ran his hand down my body, slipping his finger between my thighs and playing in the wetness there. Then he froze, his muscles tightening against me.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Luke said frantically. \u201cI forgot protection. Today and last night! Oh, God, baby I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, its okay, I promise. I\u2019m on the pill. And if you\u2019re worried about other things, you don\u2019t have to. I haven\u2019t been with anyone in a long time and I\u2019ve always been careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about that, sugar, but you don\u2019t have to worry about it either. I swear. But, we\u2019re good? I don\u2019t have to go buy stock in Trojan?\u201d Luke grinned down at me, his fingers beginning to slowly circle my clit again, making me buck my hips against his hand.</p> <p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I moaned, pressing my thighs together around his hand, stilling his questing fingers.</p><p>Luke smiled softly at me, dipping his head to kiss me before asking, \u201cToo sensitive?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSorry...just need a minute.\u201d</p><p>Both of us jumped then as we heard a door slam downstairs, and Brandon yelled, \u201cYo, Luke! Hey, bro, you upstairs?\u201d We heard footsteps hit the first stair and begin ascending.</p><p>Luke and I looked at each other, our eyes wide. Ohmigod! Brandon was seriously about to see so much more of me than he bargained for, or, for that matter, more than I\u2019d ever want him to see! I waved my hand frantically at Luke, silently entreating him to do something.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down in a sec, man!\u201d Luke yelled.</p><p>We both sprang from the bed and got dressed before heading downstairs. My face was flaming, knowing that I was, essentially, doing the walk of shame; something I had avoided for the entirety of my life thus far. I ran my hands nervously through my hair, hoping to tame at least some of the freshly fucked look out of it, but I had a sinking suspicion that I failed miserably.</p><p>We hit the last step and I heard Brandon whistle long and low through his teeth, before he grinned and said, \u201cWell, well, well. What have we got here?\u201d</p><p>I blushed even harder, unable to force any words past my lips. I settled for giving him a small wave as Luke just shook his head at him.</p><p>I tuned both of them out as Brandon began asking Luke questions about the shop and what had happened there last night. Since neither of them were paying attention to me, I wandered through the living room, looking at the few pictures that were hanging intermittently throughout the room. Most of them were of Luke or Brandon bent over someone, working on a tattoo. There were a couple with Luke and Brandon standing in front of the shop with an older man, heavily tattooed, with a grey handlebar mustache and a bald head. I assumed that this was the infamous Lenny.</p><p>On the wall by the downstairs hallway, there were two diplomas hanging there, and beside each was a picture of the boy receiving it. My heart swelled as I read the names neatly typed on the diplomas, Lucas Tyler Crimshaw and Brandon Joel Crimshaw, because I now knew just how hard they had each worked to get them, never letting life stand in their way.</p> <p>I looked over my shoulder at them, both of them so mouth-wateringly sexy, and reality began to sink back in. I knew more about Luke now, but it still wasn\u2019t enough. He was so...hot, and I was so...me. We were from two completely different worlds, and he still expected me to just accept his decree that I was his. (I must admit, though, that it did funny, fluttery things to my insides when he said it.)</p><p>Luke glanced over and caught me staring at him, a slow smile spreading across his face, even as he continued speaking to Brandon. Brandon followed his gaze and grinned from ear to ear as he saw the way Luke and I were staring at each other. Interrupting Luke in mid-sentence, Brandon clapped him on the shoulder, nodded once, and took off down the hall.</p><p>Luke turned to watch him go, surprise flitting across his face before he turned to me and shrugged, the smile that had slipped when Brandon walked away returning in full force. He took a step forward, I assume to come to me, but all of a sudden a yellow blur jumped off the couch and stood blocking Luke.</p><p>Luke said, \u201cNot now, Doug.\u201d He stepped to the side to walk around the large animal, but Doug followed, blocking him again. Luke sighed and stepped back to the other side, and Doug followed again. Luke threw his hands up in the air and asked, \u201cWhat? What the hell is wrong with you, dog?\u201d</p><p>At Luke\u2019s words, Doug sat on his haunches, threw his head back and began howling out all his doggie woes. Apparently there were quite a few of them, because this continued for a good two minutes. When he got out everything he needed to say, he shut his mouth with a snap, and I swear to you, nodded once at Luke, just like Brandon had a few minutes before.</p><p>I lost it, cracking up laughing when Luke just nodded back and said, \u201cOkay. We done?\u201d</p><p>I guessed they were when Doug stood up, sidled close to Luke, and nudged Luke\u2019s thigh with his nose, earning a quick pat from him, before Doug trotted off down the hall in search of Brandon. I heard Luke mutter, \u201cDamn dog!\u201d before he started towards me again.</p><p>Before he got to me, I held up my hand, palm out, saying, \u201cWait. I...you...just...will you take me home, Luke?\u201d I finished quietly.</p> <p>He froze, his eyes becoming shuttered, and then he turned on his heel and headed out to the car. I followed, feeling like a total bitch, knowing that I had hurt him somehow.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Monday proved to be a disaster. Hands down, it had to be the worst day of my life so far. It even topped the Bushzilla incident, and the only thing that topped that was when Calland had snuck about six of his friends into the bathroom where I was showering when I was sixteen. Calland had stood with his back to the curtain, his hand covering his eyes as he ripped the curtain back to reveal a (now hysterically screaming) naked, soapy me to six slobbering, perverted fourteen year old boys. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, I found out later that one of them had snuck his mom\u2019s camcorder over to our house and they had managed to be quiet and still long enough to hold it up over the shower curtain rod without me seeing.</p><p>Imagine my surprise when, during a very nice slideshow put together painstakingly by my mother for my high school graduation party, my senior picture was suddenly replaced with a shaky video of a very naked, soapy me dancing around singing \u201cMan! I Feel Like a Woman\u201d by Shania Twain at the top of my lungs.</p><p>So yeah. Bad day. It started when I didn\u2019t wake up with my alarm. I didn\u2019t really fall asleep until almost four in the morning; I couldn\u2019t get Luke\u2019s face out of my mind, the way he looked at me as I got out of his car and then pulled away without looking back. He hadn\u2019t said a word the whole way, the car filled with tension so thick you could taste it.</p><p>I got to work an hour and a half late. Floyd was standing beside my desk frantically throwing files around. When I walked in, apologizing profusely, he just held up his hand and demanded I find the file he was missing. I couldn\u2019t find it, and he had to go to court without it.</p><p>Then, in an effort to wake myself up, I made a pot of coffee. I carried my cup to my desk and stubbed my toe on the corner, which made me spill coffee all down the front of my favorite white cable knit sweater I had decided to wear that day.</p><p>I managed not to maim myself or anyone else for a while, but at lunchtime, I realized that I had forgotten my purse at home in my mad dash to get to work. Therefore, I had no way to eat lunch because I for damn sure didn\u2019t have time to pack anything that morning. So, stomach growling, I munched on a roll of mints that I had found shoved in the back of my desk drawer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The day continued downhill from there, and I\u2019ll just hit the highlights for you. I smashed my finger in the file cabinet drawer, got a paper cut on my thumb, dropped my pen under my desk and hit my head coming back up, misplaced two more files, hung up on another attorney that had called to speak to Floyd (accidentally, I swear!), and dropped a whole box of small paperclips all over the floor and had to crawl around to pick them all up. Not to mention that I keep getting hang up calls all day long. Then, when I went out to my car to leave for the day, I realized I had locked my keys in my car. Since I didn\u2019t have my purse, I didn\u2019t have my cell phone or my wallet. Thank God I had my work keys so I could call my dad to bring my spare car key that I kept at their house just in case. Too bad that I had to wait two hours for him to get there because he was in the middle of something.</p><p>I finally walked in my front door just after seven, but my day of horror didn\u2019t stop there. My heel caught on the edge of the carpet where the tile entryway ended and I pitched forward, my arms wind milling to try and catch my balance. That didn\u2019t work and I went down hard, clipping my cheek high on my cheekbone by my eye on the edge of the coffee table.</p><p>Which is why I was now lying on the floor, half under the coffee table, sobbing uncontrollably. Any why my face hurt so frickin\u2019 bad! After a minute, I got up to check my face because when I put my hand up to wipe my tears away, I realized that it wasn\u2019t all tears running down my face. I ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, staring in horror at the small cut in my cheek that was bleeding down my face, now dripping onto my sweater that was already ruined by coffee. A dark bruise was already forming.</p><p>I cleaned myself up, took a hot bath to try to relax, and wrapped myself up in my robe before curling up in the corner of my couch with my cell phone to see if I had any missed calls. I had one from Allie, but no one else. Not that I really expected otherwise.</p> <p>I called Allie back to see what she wanted, but also to vent about my day. I wasn\u2019t expecting what I got when she answered.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Allie asked as she answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Al, sorry I didn\u2019t have my phone on me because I forgot it at home with my purse today. You wouldn\u2019t believe the day I had-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? You had a bad day? Well so sorry to hear that, Emma, but maybe its your karma. What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d she yelled at me.</p><p>\u201cAllie, what are you talking about? I don\u2019t need you yelling at me after the day I\u2019ve had, that\u2019s for sure, so talk fast before I get pissed!\u201d I hollered at her.</p> <p>\u201cEmma, you\u2019re a moron. I ran into Brandon today and he asked what the fuck happened between you and Luke. So that\u2019s what I wanna know! How could you fuck this up already, Em? We had this conversation yesterday, Leah and I both told you to go for it because you\u2019re stupid if you didn\u2019t! He\u2019s told you clearly that he\u2019s into you, but you\u2019re letting Douche Bag Brad effect what could be something good, something right for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllie, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d I started before she interrupted me again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Em, I don\u2019t understand. And I think you\u2019re just over thinking everything and letting yourself get in your own way. What happened yesterday after he carted you away?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, knowing that I probably was gonna piss her off even more. \u201cHe took me to his house, where he and Brandon live. We talked, he told me about his life, his and Brandon\u2019s. He opened up to me and we...you know...twice...and then Brandon came home. They were just standing there, just so out of my league and I just...I\u2019m a bitch.\u201d There was no way around it. Luke had opened up to me and I had pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cGod, Allie, what am I gonna do?\u201d I moaned. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I panicked, but I did. He was just standing there and all I kept thinking about was douche bag, and I don\u2019t want to go through that again! I\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m a moron...I\u2019m a bitch,\u201d I said, repeating myself from earlier.</p><p>Allie didn\u2019t mince words, either. \u201cYeah, Emma, you are. So fix it. Brandon told me that Luke has been in a foul mood since he got back from taking you home yesterday. He said that Luke hasn\u2019t ever pursued any woman in his life. They\u2019ve always flung themselves at him, but he\u2019s never been one to let anyone in. Somehow you\u2019ve gotten under his skin, so fix it. Now, Emma.\u201d And then she hung up on me.</p> <p>I stared at my phone for a minute, torn. I decided to take the coward\u2019s way out and send a text to Luke, rather than call.</p><p>Hey. Its Emma. Can we talk for a minute? I hit send.</p><p>And got an immediate reply. Busy. Sorry. Maybe tomorrow.</p><p>Tears welled up in my eyes, silently coursing down my cheeks. I felt awful. I slowly got up off the couch and went to bed, hoping tomorrow would be a better day.</p><p>The week dragged by, and I was getting tired of the horrified and pitying looks I kept getting from everyone. I had one lady that came in for an appointment with Floyd, took one look at my face, ran around behind the counter and grabbed me up in her arms. She kept hugging me and crying, squeezing me tight while chanting, \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it, honey. Get out now, baby, please, please!\u201d That was awkward.</p><p>I\u2019ll admit that it probably did look like someone had punched me in the face. I had a black eye where the bruising on my cheek had spread, and a scab where the cut had been. I tried to cover most of it with makeup, but it was so tender that it hurt too much to do.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t talked to anyone except Jenna. Allie and even Leah was avoiding me, Calland was off being Calland, and, because I\u2019m a coward, I hadn\u2019t tried texting Luke again. So why I found myself standing outside his shop Friday night eluded me. I took a deep breath before walking in the door, knowing I had to do this.</p><p>I walked through the lobby, heading for the counter, my eyes on the tall, dark, and gorgeous man standing there with his back to me. Luke turned around, his expression hardening as he realized who was standing at the counter, but his face changed to dismay when he saw my face and he came striding around the counter.</p> <p>His hands bit into the flesh of my upper arms as he grabbed me roughly, growling, \u201cI\u2019ll kill him. Who\u2019s the fucking asshole who hit you, Emma?\u201d</p><p>I shivered at the soft dangerous tone of his voice and the flash of anger in his eyes. I reached up between us, as much as I could, and laid my palms on his chest. \u201cLuke, no one hit me. I\u2019m okay, I promise.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath in and loosened his grip on my arms, and I couldn\u2019t help my slight flinch when he let go. He saw it and narrowed his eyes at me before running his hand down my arm to grasp my wrist and pull my arm up to look at it. He pushed the wide, loose sleeve of my sweater up my arm and ran his fingertips lightly over the slowly darkening marks where his fingers had bit into me.</p><p>He drew in a breath, and his faced looked pained as he whispered, \u201cOh God, Emma, I\u2019m so sorry. I hurt you, sugar...\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head at him and told him quietly, \u201cIts ok, Luke. You didn\u2019t really hurt me, you were just upset. I\u2019m sorry for just showing up out of the blue like this. I guess its pretty shocking...\u201d I trailed off.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, it is. What happened anyway?\u201d He brought his hands up to cup my cheeks, running his thumb softly over the edge of the bruise slowly fading on my cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had a bad day on Monday. A really, really bad day. I tripped and fell at home and hit my cheek on the corner of the coffee table. But that was just the final straw.\u201d I swallowed, looking away from his intense gaze before I forced myself to look back into his eyes. \u201cLuke, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry for the way I left things with us on Sunday. I mean, you opened yourself up to me and I basically shrugged in your face, and I cant take it back, but I am asking that you forgive me.\u201d</p><p>I stood in front of him, his hands still cupping my face, waiting for him to say something. He didn\u2019t. Instead, he just lowered his head and gently pressed his lips to mine. He pulled back after a second and said, \u201cStay here real quick. Don\u2019t leave, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and he walked off to the back of the shop. After a minute he came back out, grabbed my hand, and pulled me out the door to his car.</p><p>\u201cWait! Luke, my car!\u201d I cried, pulling back on his arm to slow him down.</p> <p>He paused for a second, then said, \u201cTake it to your house and I\u2019ll follow. But then we\u2019re going to go get some dinner and you\u2019re staying at my house tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d I began, but Luke raised his hand, not letting me finish.</p><p>\u201cMy house. Tonight, Emma. I want you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, giving in and walking to my car. I drove to my house, Luke right behind me. When I pulled up, Luke parked behind me and came inside while I got some clothes together. I didn\u2019t even have my bag zipped before Luke grabbed it and then me, and pulled me out the door. I managed to get him to stop long enough to lock my front door and then we were in his car, headed back into town.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go to dinner, sugar?\u201d Luke asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, Luke. Whatever sounds good to you.\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cBeck\u2019s on Main?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s good.\u201d I replied, already flipping through their menu in my head. What? I love food!</p><p>We went to Beck\u2019s and were seated immediately because it\u2019s a bar like Griff\u2019s but they\u2019ve got more of a bistro type menu. I ordered my favorite, loaded baked potato soup with cheese and bacon, and a turkey bacon club sandwich. Luke ordered a French dip sub and started to order the French onion soup to go with it, but changed it to the potato soup as well when he glanced my way. Hmm...</p><p>It didn\u2019t take us long before we were done eating and headed to Luke\u2019s house. We pulled up and Luke grabbed my bag off the backseat before I could, and held my hand as we walked up on the porch. As I was waiting for Luke to unlock the door, I heard a small chuff behind me. Then the smell hit.</p><p>I turned around, surprised to see Doug standing behind us, his yellow fur hidden under mud and only God knows what else. I plugged my nose, trying to breathe out of my mouth, because he smelled like a skunk. I gagged and took a step back, plowing into Luke who had turned to see what was going on. He had his shirt up over his nose and was glaring at Doug, who seemed to be smiling at us.</p> <p>\u201cYou stupid ass dog, Doug!\u201d Luke yelled. \u201cThis is the fifth time this year you\u2019ve been sprayed by a skunk and its supposed to be Brandon\u2019s turn to deal with it!\u201d He growled deep in his throat, which made Doug even happier. His whole body shook with the vicious wagging of his tail.</p><p>Luke looked over to me and shook his head in exasperation. He unlocked the door and stepped back to let me inside, hollering, \u201cNO!\u201d over his shoulder at Doug. When we got inside, he put my bag down by the steps and then I heard, \u201cOh, shit!\u201d and Luke took off running through the living room towards the kitchen and the back door off the side of it that opened out onto a huge back deck with a hot tub sunk into it.</p><p>I watched in fascination as the doggie door ( I hadn\u2019t noticed it before) just barely began pushing in when Luke dove to the floor, jamming his hands against the flap, and subsequently, Doug\u2019s head. I heard Doug woof once outside the door, while Luke laid on the kitchen floor, forehead on the tile, hands extended out in front of him holding the doggie door shut. Luke very carefully reached up with one hand and released the locking flap, moving his other hand quickly out of the way as it swung down, before sliding the lock into place.</p><p>He turned his head to look at me, a grin beginning to grow on his face that could only be described as devilish, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get dirty tonight, sugar!\u201d</p><p>I groaned.</p><p>An hour later I was kneeling in a kiddie pool filled with tomato juice. I was holding onto a hundred and twenty pounds of wiggling, stinky dog, and I was covered head to toe in the juice that should have been on the dog instead. Luke was standing in the pool on the other side of Doug, almost falling over from laughing so hard. The last pitcher of juice that he had scooped up to pour over Doug had landed on my head, leaving me gasping and blinking my eyes while the dog barked and began licking my face.</p><p>I glared up at Luke, and then Doug jerked in my grasp, so I ended up lying face down in tomato juice with Doug standing over me. He noticed the ponytail holder in my hair, apparently, because he suddenly pounced on my back, nipped the holder between his teeth, and began pulling.</p><p>I shrieked, reaching up to try to dislodge his mouth, and heard Luke, still laughing, breathlessly trying to call Doug off.</p> <p>At the end of the ordeal, Luke and I were wearing just as much juice as Doug, my hair was loose down my back, and Doug was prancing around, flipping my hair tie up in the air with his teeth before chasing it.</p><p>Later on that night, after we had shampooed the tomato juice off of Doug and off of each other (that was fun!), we were cuddled up on the couch together, watching a movie. Brandon came in about halfway through and sat down on the other end of the couch by my feet. A few minutes later, I felt him grab my feet and pull them up in his lap, rubbing them gently with his hands.</p><p>I heard Luke take a sharp breath in, and pulled my feet back away from Brandon, who just laughed, got up, and slapped Luke\u2019s leg as he walked down the hall to his room.</p><p>I glanced up at Luke asking, \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, not saying anything. I sat up and asked again.</p><p>Luke shook his head a little, before he sighed and said, \u201cBrandon just let me know that if I didn\u2019t make things right with you, then...you know.\u201d</p><p>I froze. \u201cWhat do you mean, you know? Are you saying...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He said that he would do what he could to make me regret losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he on drugs? I mean, sure he\u2019s hot (Luke growled when I said this) but so are you and I\u2019ve never even looked at him like that!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to know, sugar.\u201d Luke said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd besides. You didn\u2019t lose me. We weren\u2019t ever really together-\u201d</p><p>Luke cut me off. \u201cEmma, quit while you\u2019re ahead.\u201d</p><p>I shut up. For a second anyway. \u201cWell, since we\u2019re talking, I just want you to realize that you were being overbearing. I mean, I felt like you were a caveman, beating his chest and pulling me around by the hair. You claimed me, Luke! Like I was a possession!\u201d I winced when I realized I was yelling at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry...again. I\u2019m such a bitch.\u201d I flung myself backwards on the couch, covering my eyes with my arm.</p><p>Luke moved over me, spreading my legs open and kneeling between them. \u201cEmma, baby, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I moved my arm, just barely enough for me to peek at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEmma, I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m being that way with you. Its just, the first time you came into the shop, you were such a breath of fresh air. You weren\u2019t looking at me like you were calculating how to get me in bed, or how much money I make.\u201d</p><p>I covered my eyes again. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I was looking at you like I wanted to get you in bed. I was embarrassing myself staring at you so much,\u201d I muttered.</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cI liked you looking at me. And when I had you in my chair, I wanted nothing more than to rip your clothes off and fuck you til you screamed for me.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. \u201cBut why, Luke?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019m not some gorgeous model type that just walks in a room and guys drool over her. That\u2019s never been me, its always been Leah, and I just cant help but feel like this is something that will pass, and then you\u2019ll be done, over me and moved on to the next. Beautiful women throw themselves at you, but look at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am looking, Emma! Don\u2019t you ever look in a mirror? You\u2019re beautiful, sugar. You\u2019re curvy, you\u2019ve got this long, thick, dark hair that makes me want to bury my hands in it, and gorgeous jade green eyes...you are beautiful,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I closed my eyes, a lump forming in my throat, and tears threatened behind my lids.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Emma. And I\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 10</p><p>I woke slowly in the morning, stretching and yawning loudly. I felt the bed shift behind me and froze for a second until I realized that I was at Luke\u2019s house, in his bed. I smiled, rolling over to wrap my eyes around him and came face to face with...Doug. The lab was panting, tongue lolling out the side of his mouth, his doggie lips stretched into a doggie grin.</p><p>I smiled back at him, reaching out to pat his head, and Luke walked into the room, holding steaming cups of coffee.</p><p>I sat up, holding the sheet tightly to my naked breasts, my muscles slightly sore from the activities of the night before. Luke had staked his claim completely after uttering the words to me. He had picked me up and carried me (Yes! Carried me!) up the stairs to his bed before making love to me all throughout the night. The last time was just a couple of hours ago, when he\u2019d stood me up in front of the window, curtains wide open, my palms to the glass, my leg hooked over his forearm as he pushed into me from behind as I leaned back into him, just as the sun slipped up over the horizon. I\u2019ll never look at sunrise the same again!</p><p>\u201cMorning, baby,\u201d Luke said, handing me a cup of coffee and leaning down for a kiss. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get ready and head to the shop. I have a tattoo scheduled for this morning, but it shouldn\u2019t take too long. Do you have any plans, or do you wanna come watch?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I thought for a second. \u201cUmm... I don\u2019t think I have anything going, so, yeah. I\u2019ll go if you want me to. Maybe I\u2019ll let you ink me again...\u201d I grinned at him, but my smile faltered when his eyes darkened.</p> <p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I asked. I wasn\u2019t sure I liked the look he was giving me.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, sugar. I\u2019ll definitely do that again.\u201d His voice was low and sent shivers down my spine.</p><p>I sat my coffee down on the nightstand beside the bed and let the sheet fall to my waist. I leaned back on my elbows, cocking my head to the side before asking, \u201cReally? You\u2019ll do me again?\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes darkened even more and he groaned in his throat. \u201cEmma, don\u2019t do this to me. We gotta go, sugar.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulder at him, making my breasts jiggle, and laid down on my back, stretching my arms up over my head and moaning softly. I heard Luke\u2019s breath catch and watched him bite his lip, clearly torn. I decided to up the ante and slid my hand down my chest, cupping my breast in my hand and tweaking my nipple with my thumb.</p><p>Luke groaned harshly before he was on the bed, Doug flying out the door, as Luke was coming over me and sliding as deep as he could. He fucked me furiously, slamming himself in and out, and I reveled in it. I couldn\u2019t contain my moans as my knees came up to bracket his sides, my hands sliding up and down his back, digging my nails into his skin. Without warning, it hit me and I came, screaming my release, my body pulsating as he still pounded into me until he thrust deeply one last time, his body jerking with his release.</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed my lips quickly before pulling out and leaving the bed. I rolled over, squeezing my thighs together, enjoying the slight aftershocks still zinging through my loins, and I felt him slap my ass, yelling, \u201cGet up, woman! We\u2019re gonna be late now!\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at him and he grinned at me before heading off to the shower. I thought about joining him, but decided we\u2019d never leave the house if I did, so I let him finish, jumping in and showering quickly as soon as he emerged to get dressed.</p> <p>We pulled up outside the shop just a few minutes late. Brandon was already there, even though he didn\u2019t have anything scheduled until later that afternoon.</p><p>When I walked in the door with Luke, his arm thrown around my shoulders holding me tightly to his side, Brandon hooted loudly, yelling, \u201cFinally! Maybe now I can go home and get some sleep!\u201d</p><p>Luke punched him playfully in the arm and went back to get his room ready for his client.</p><p>Brandon looked at me, winked and said, \u201cOh, Luke! Harder Luke! Yes...Ohhhhh!\u201d in a high-pitch falsetto.</p><p>I gasped, my cheeks flooding with heat, and punched him in his chest, glaring at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t sound like that, asshole. I never said any of that, either,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Brandon just grinned at me, nodding his head vigorously up and down.</p><p>I spun on my heel and headed down the hall to Luke\u2019s work room. My cell phone rang in my jeans pocket as I walked towards the back and I pulled it out to see who was calling me.</p><p>Allie\u2019s name flashed across the screen, so I answered it. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! What are doing today?\u201d Allie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m down here at Luke\u2019s shop. He\u2019s doing a tattoo this morning and said I could watch.\u201d</p><p>Allie was silent for a minute. \u201cWith Luke, huh? I take it you got your head outta your ass, Jensen?\u201d</p><p>I said quietly, \u201cAllie, I didn\u2019t mean to be such a bitch. But you know what happened with Douche Bag Brad. Like I told you, I just don\u2019t want to be hurt like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Em, but Luke just...I don\u2019t know. I can just see that\u2019s he\u2019s not like that. You\u2019ll be good together, make pretty babies.\u201d I could tell she was smiling now.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cYeah, well I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in the cards any time soon. We just started dating.\u201d</p><p>Luke poked his head out of his doorway and looked over to where I had stopped to talk to Allie.</p><p>\u201cWe just started dating?\u201d he asked with a grin.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him and turned my back. To Allie I said, \u201cListen, I\u2019ll call you later when I get home.\u201d I heard Luke snort behind me and I turned back to see what he was doing. He shook his head at me and I raised my eyebrow at him.</p><p>He mouthed, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going home. Unless I\u2019m going with you...\u201d</p><p>I gaped at him, Allie repeating, \u201cHello? Emma? Are you still there?\u201d in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Allie, sorry. Like I said, I\u2019ll call you later, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay! Talk to you later! And Emma? Don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do...\u201d she warned, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m covered then, Allie, because we both know there\u2019s not much you wouldn\u2019t do!\u201d I replied drolly.</p><p>We hung up and I walked into Luke\u2019s room. Brandon came by to tell him his appointment was there, and Luke went out to greet them. He came back with a college-aged boy in tow, who was talking his ear off about his tattoos. When they got in the room, Luke waved to where I was seated on a stool in the corner, asking if the guy had any problem with me being in there to watch.</p><p>The boy shook his head no, staring at me wide-eyed. He then cleared his throat and asked timidly, \u201cCould she come hold my hand?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed and smiled at the poor thing, while Luke narrowed his eyes at him. The boy lowered his eyes and mumbled sorry to Luke, who shot me a dirty look. I waved his look away and pulled my stool up beside the chair where Luke had him sit, and I held out my hand for him to take. He blushed and took it. I got the impression he was trying to be macho with Luke, but seeing me had triggered his nerves.</p><p>Luke stared at me a beat before turning back to his client. He explained the process, and pulled out the transfer sheet to show him the design that Luke had previously drawn up for him. The design was a sweet ass nautical star, two toned with black and red. The top corner point of the star was drawn to look like it was ripping into the skin, and two blood red droplets were suspended from the opposite bottom corner point, underneath which the words Under My Skin were scripted. Inside the lower droplet, which was placed so it almost seemed like it dotted the \u2018i\u2019 in Skin, was a tiny skull and cross bones.</p><p>Wow. I was seriously impressed with Luke\u2019s skills, and I was only seeing the drawing.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mike, we\u2019re all set if you\u2019re satisfied with the design. You\u2019re still wanting this to go on your right pec?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>Mike nodded and then looked worried as Luke had him lie back on the chair after taking off his shirt. He blushed furiously as he took it off, glancing my way out of the corner of his eye. I ducked my head to hide my smile.</p> <p>Luke did his thing, shaving the area where the tattoo would be placed (even though Mike didn\u2019t have much going for him chest hair wise), set the transfer and had Mike check it in the mirror. It looked awesome.</p><p>When Luke set up his machine and starting inking the liner needle, Mike reached out blindly for my hand again, and I took it, squeezing it reassuringly. He took a deep breath in and held it. And held it.</p><p>Luke finally looked up as he swung toward him with the gun in his hand and said, \u201cDude, you gotta breathe. Cant have you passing out on me in my chair while I\u2019m working on you, man.\u201d</p><p>Mike let his breath out slowly and I decided to try to take his mind off of it. I asked, \u201cSo does the tattoo have any special meaning to you, Mike?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyes wide as Luke started the outline. I felt him squeeze my hand a little bit more. Then he finally spoke. \u201cI met this girl last year. Freshman year. I\u2019m a sophomore this year at Cincinnati. Anyway, she\u2019s so beautiful but she just doesn\u2019t see it. She keeps telling me that I\u2019m just after one thing and that\u2019s all it would ever be between us, but its not like that. I mean, I like this girl, man! She\u2019s the one. Ya know what I mean?\u201d He looked over at me and nodded, apparently answering his own question for me. \u201cSo, anyway, we went out a couple times and I think I\u2019ve got her almost convinced. But she\u2019s under my skin. And I don\u2019t see her going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Luke looked up and caught my eye as he paused to wipe off the excess ink and reink the needle. I nodded imperceptibly, letting him know that I knew what he was thinking. And it made me feel kinda warm inside.</p> <p>I looked back to Mike and asked him, \u201cWell, what happens if something happens and she\u2019s not convinced? Not that I\u2019m second guessing you or anything, but, you know?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI thought of that, but it really wouldn\u2019t matter either way. She\u2019s under my skin and if something happens, then it\u2019ll just be a reminder that I let someone get under my skin, that I need to be more careful in the future.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. Mike was a pretty smart cookie. Oohh...cookies. My stomach growled loudly, reminding me and everyone else in the room that I hadn\u2019t had breakfast this morning.</p><p>I grinned sheepishly as everyone looked at me, laughing.</p><p>\u201cEmma, why don\u2019t you run down to the caf\u00e9 and grab us some breakfast?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I replied. I asked Luke what he wanted, his reply being to surprise him. Mike declined anything, reassuring me that he didn\u2019t need my hand anymore, and I headed down the hall to find Brandon to see if he wanted anything. I found him in his work room with the door shut. I knocked on the door, opening it when he yelled, \u201cCome in!\u201d</p><p>Whoa! I was not expecting to see him seated on a stool with the chair raised up high in front of him, a buxom blonde coed half-reclined on it with her legs spread wide, skirt hiked to her waist. She grinned and giggled at me, shrugging her shoulders before saying, \u201cI\u2019m getting my hood pierced! Isn\u2019t that like, so cool?\u201d</p><p>I barely managed to keep from rolling my eyes at her, and Brandon grinned at me from over her hip. All I have to say about it is thank God the chair was facing away from the door. I\u2019d have been traumatized if it hadn\u2019t been. I asked Brandon about food before hot footing out of the room, closing the door behind me. Before I got completely away from the door I heard the perky, high pitched voice of the blonde squeal then say, \u201cOoh, pretty!\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t stop the eye roll this time. But, hood piercing...I wonder what that-? Nevermind. I\u2019m not even going there.</p><p>After getting food and coffee from the caf\u00e9, I brought everything back and divvied it up between the four of us. Four, because Mike decided he was hungry too, so I shared half of my sandwich with him.</p><p>Luke finished Mike\u2019s tattoo and it was amazeballs! I loved it so much that I was contemplating actually getting another tattoo. Me! The girl who swore I\u2019d never let a needle anywhere near me voluntarily! Weird, right?</p><p>After Luke cleaned everything up and did what he needed to do, we headed out, leaving Brandon in charge at the shop. He had a couple appointments coming in, and was back with another walk-in piercing ( I didn\u2019t ask, I didn\u2019t want to know this time!).</p><p>Luke surprised me by not heading to his house, nor did we go to mine. Instead, since it was the beginning of October, he took me to The Patch, the best pick-your-own pumpkin farm in southern Ohio. We spent a good hour wandering through the vines, looking for the perfect pumpkins to carve. He found a couple immediately and set them to the side in a pile for him and Brandon. I, however, am very picky about my pumpkin. I finally found it, jumping up and down like a little kid while Luke laughed at me.</p><p>On the way to the front with our pumpkins, we went by the little pumpkin area, and I couldn\u2019t help but pick out a couple little pumpkins to carve, along with a few tiny gourds and the cutest, tiniest little pumpkins to decorate my front porch with. We stopped at the store after leaving The Patch and got a couple of those really cool carving kits with the nifty tools and killer patterns, candles for the pumpkins, and Luke surprised me again by grabbing the stuff to make s\u2019mores with.</p><p>As we were leaving the store, my cell phone rang and I answered it without looking at the screen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello, Emma...\u201d a voice whispered harshly.</p><p>\u201cUmm...hello?\u201d I responded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, little girl?\u201d the voice continued in that nasty raspy whisper.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, grinning at Luke who was staring at me questioningly. \u201cCalland, you ass. What the hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>My brother busted out laughing and hung up on me. I didn\u2019t call him back because I knew his little games by now.</p><p>He called me back after a minute, and when I answered he said, \u201cYou bitch! You didn\u2019t call me back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. So what\u2019s up?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMom says that you have to be here for breakfast tomorrow. I say you don\u2019t have to,\u201d he replied in his smart ass tone.</p><p>I heard my mom yell at Calland in the background before she grabbed the phone from him, smacking him and muttering under her breath.</p><p>\u201cEmma? Breakfast tomorrow, honey, and bring your friend. Allie\u2019s coming, too.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord...what was my mother up to? \u201cI\u2019ll be there, Mom. I\u2019m not speaking for anyone else. Luke may have plans with his brother or something.\u201d</p><p>To my dismay, Luke leaned close to me and said, \u201cNope. Don\u2019t have plans. Where we going?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and sighed, knowing my mother had heard him.</p><p>\u201cEmma? See? You\u2019re friend doesn\u2019t have plans, and his brother can come, too. Don\u2019t be late, Emma Marie. Ten o\u2019clock. Love you, bye!\u201d Mom hung up the phone on me, and I tossed my phone into my purse.</p><p>I glanced at Luke, who cocked his eyebrow at me before asking, \u201cEmma Marie, huh?\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him before replying, \u201cLucas Tyler, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouche\u2019 sugar.\u201d Luke grinned, reaching over and taking my hand in his bringing it to his thigh and holding it there against his warmth.</p><p>We pulled up at his house and unloaded everything from his car. We debated starting the pumpkins, but I decided that we\u2019d wait on Brandon. To kill time until he got home, Luke and I snuggled on the couch, watching a movie while Doug snored on my feet.</p><p>As the credits rolled on the movie, I glanced at my watch. It wasn\u2019t even five yet and Brandon wouldn\u2019t be home until around seven. Luke had fallen asleep halfway through the movie. I slid gently out from under his arm, intending to let Doug out to use the bathroom and do the same myself. I froze for a second when Luke sighed and settled deeper into the couch, but didn\u2019t wake.</p><p>Doug and I did our business and I went back to the couch to snuggle back in with Luke. While I was gone, Luke had slid down further in the couch, his head resting in the corner of the armrest, his arms folded across his chest, one of his legs bent at the knee, the other stretched out in front of him. He looked so beautiful it took my breath, and I couldn\u2019t help myself.</p><p>I sank to my knees in between his thighs, lightly resting my hands on his hips. He didn\u2019t move. I traced my fingertips along the waistband of his jeans, watching his face intently. His muscles quivered under my light touch, but he still didn\u2019t wake. I slowly unbuttoned his jeans, and slid his zipper down, before parting the denim wide and tugging it down gently. I drew in a breath when he came into view, because he was already hard. My eyes flew up to his face to find his eyes, still heavy lidded with sleep (or maybe desire?) watching me.</p><p>I tugged a little more on his jeans and he lifted his hips a bit until he sprang completely free of the denim trapping him in. He was so hard that he stood straight up, pointing towards his hard belly, the tiny slit weeping already. I encircled his hardness with my fingers, stroking him softly before bringing him to my lips. I let my tongue flick out to wet my lips, the tip brushing over the slit of him, tasting and moaning softly.</p><p>I heard Luke\u2019s quickly indrawn breath, and then his gasp as I parted my lips and slowly slid the tip of him in the wet warmth of my mouth. I kept my eyes locked with his as I took him deeper, and his hands came up to tangle in my hair on both sides of my head. I worked him with my lips, my tongue laving the head of him on my upward strokes, my hand wrapped securely around the base of him. Luke was gasping with every stroke, his hands tightening in my hair and guiding me into a smooth rhythm up and down his velvety hardness.</p> <p>On my next upward stroke with my lips and tongue, I let my hand follow my mouth, stroking in tandem. Luke faltered, his thighs quivering and I could feel him getting harder between my lips, getting ready to lose it. He used my hair to start pulling my head away from him, but I fought it, moving faster up and down him, sucking him deep. His hips jerked under me and he groaned as he lost it, his hands tightening almost painfully as he gave over to it and I swallowed him down.</p><p>\u201cGod, Emma...what you do to me, baby.\u201d Luke rasped, his voice thick with sleep and desire.</p><p>I smiled softly up at him, not sure why I blurted, \u201cI\u2019ve never done that before. Never let anyone...\u201d I ducked my head, biting my tongue. I heard Luke groan again before he hauled me up into his lap and kissed me wildly, his teeth nipping at my lips, the silver ring in his lip pressing so deliciously against mine.</p><p>His lips left mine abruptly and he sat up, pushing me back and twisting me to lie on the couch. He jerked my jeans down my legs, taking my panties with them, tossing them over the back of the couch in a heap. I hurriedly pulled my shirt and my bra off over my heard, tossing them behind the couch, as well. Then it was my turn to gasp as his hands smoothed down my stomach to my thighs, before the fingers of one hand pressed deep into my wetness.</p><p>I moaned as he whispered, \u201cDripping for me. God, sugar!\u201d He brought his fingers up to his lips and slowly slid them between his lips, tasting me on them.</p><p>My breath came in on a gasp as desire curled hard in my belly, setting me on fire from head to toe. I read the intent in his eyes and moaned yes uncontrollably as he slid his lips down my stomach, coming to rest at the juncture of my thighs, his hot breath searing my tender, bare flesh. I spread wide for him, inviting him to taste, almost frantic with the need. My hips bucked wildly as he licked into me, my fingers spearing into his hair, holding him tightly against my writhing body.</p><p>He flicked his tongue rapidly over the hard, tight bud of my clit before sliding down and pushing into me as deep as he could before retreating and laving me with the flat of his tongue, up and down, the pressure building and building until I was screaming with the need to explode.</p><p>Luke pulled back from my body, softly kissing the insides of my thighs and nipping lightly at my skin. I tugged his hair roughly, trying to pull his mouth back to me but he wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cLuke, please!\u201d I growled. \u201cPut your mouth back on me, please Luke, please don\u2019t stop!\u201d</p><p>Luke chuckled, blowing lightly over my wetness and I shivered. \u201cIn a minute, baby. Mmmm...I love it when you beg.\u201d</p><p>I growled at him but I really wanted to scream in frustration, and just when I thought I actually would, my growl turned into a low, drawn out moan as he brought his lips back to the tender flesh between my thighs, kissing it before sucking my clit into his mouth and flicking his tongue rapidly against it.</p><p>My back arched, my hips bucking up into his mouth, my hands forcing him harder into my soft, hot cleft as he slid his tongue down and speared it into me, groaning as I rode his mouth, his tongue fucking in and out and in and out until I was writhing and shaking under him.</p><p>I jerked my hands back from his hair as his hands slid up my body and roughly cupped my breasts, his fingers pinching and rolling my nipples, my hands slipping up and my fingers twisting in my own hair, pulling as every nerve in my body screamed in pleasure. I exploded, my body spasming, my thighs clenching tightly around Luke\u2019s head, trapping him against me as I thrust myself wildly into his mouth, his tongue dancing over my clit as I came and came hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke pulled away from me with one last lick that made me gasp and my hips jerk again, and then he was up and over me, thrusting his tongue between my lips and kissing me roughly. I tasted myself on his tongue and it made me feverish with wanting again, even though I had just orgasmed myself senseless.</p><p>Luke growled deep in his throat as I bit his lip, flicking my tongue over the silver ring there before licking into his mouth, tangling my tongue with his. I pushed up against his chest with my hands, sitting up as he pulled back. Without pause, I straddled his hips, grinding my wetness against the hardness of him that was standing tall and thick between the parted sides of the jeans he still wore pushed low on his hips from earlier.</p><p>I thrust my hands into his hair, jerking his head back as I rose over him, looking down into eyes that had gone electric, a dangerous glint sparkling in the smoky grey-blue depths. I bit my lip, feeling myself grow even wetter against the heat of him pressed between my folds, feeling the throb of his pulse in the thick vein running the length of him, nestled against my clit.</p><p>The darkness in his eyes flat did it for me. I felt something shift inside me, something wild and as equally dark and dangerous as the look in his eyes. I don\u2019t think I would have felt it, or would have done what I did next if he hadn\u2019t looked at me that way.</p><p>Baring my teeth at him, I pulled my hands from his hair and reached down between us to grab the hem of his henley. I jerked it up over his head, his arms coming up to help, and then he raised his hips, his hands sliding underneath me to shove his jeans down his legs until he could kick them off completely. When he was completely naked under me, I pressed my right hand to his chest, tracing the heavy lines of ink tattooed there in an intricate design, while my left hand tangled in his hair again. I jerked his head back again, and he sucked a breath in through his teeth.</p><p>I leaned into him and, still looking in his eyes, I growled, \u201cInside. Now, Luke.\u201d</p><p>I rose up over him a bit to allow him room to reach down and take himself in his hand, running the thick tip of himself back and forth through my dripping wet heat before pushing just the very tip of him into me. He barely had time to move his hand before I slammed myself down onto him until every glorious inch of him was buried tightly and deeply inside me. I ground my hips against him as I buried my face in his neck, biting and licking and sucking.</p><p>I raised my head from his throat, staring into his eyes again as I scored his chest lightly with my nails and said, \u201cFuck me, Luke. Hard.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, his hands gripping my hips tightly, before he jerked his head back away from my fingers and lifted me off of him. He stood, still holding me in his arms, but allowing my feet to slowly drop to the floor. Once I was standing, leaning into him, he fisted his hand into my hair at the back of my neck, twisting his hand until the long, thick strands wrapped his fist in a silken shroud. He yanked my head back.</p><p>Luke bent and sucked my bottom lip between his teeth, nipping it sharply, and then spoke against my lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking for, Emma.\u201d</p><p>I moaned into his mouth. \u201cI want it, Luke. I can see it in you, can feel your restraint. I want your darkness.\u201d</p><p>He abruptly let go of my hair, freeing his fingers from the silky strands, and leaned his forehead against mine, whispering, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whispered back. No, I didn\u2019t know what I was asking for. All I knew is that I\u2019d had a slight taste of that edge. Douche Bag Brad had spanked me once, but he hadn\u2019t expected me to enjoy it. When he had realized that I did, that had been the beginning of the end, and he\u2019d become even more of an asshole. But with Luke, there was the promise of so much more, and I trusted him. I\u2019m not sure why, but I did, and I wanted him to take me there.</p><p>Luke closed his eyes and blew out a breath. He opened them again and looked at me. \u201cIf I do something you don\u2019t like, or anything hurts, and not in a good way, you stop me immediately. Just say stop, Emma, and I will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I nodded at him, afraid to look away from him for fear that he would change his mind, and I wouldn\u2019t get to taste the wild edge I could sense just beneath the surface of him.</p><p>Just like that, the fire was back in his eyes and he growled low and deep as he fisted his hand in my hair again. He kissed me, roughly and deeply, before jerking my head back and turning me around. He used my hair to push me forward, bending me at the waist in front of him.</p><p>\u201cBrace your hands on the couch, sugar.\u201d Luke gritted out, his jaw clenched.</p><p>I put my palms onto the couch cushion, bracing myself as I felt his hand release my hair, and his hands skimmed down my back to my ass, squeezing the soft, round globes in his palms as he leaned forward and pressed hot, open mouthed kisses down my spine before sinking his teeth into the flesh of my hip. I hissed at the sting of his bite, but my hips pressed back against him, silently asking for more.</p><p>Without warning, he spread me wide with his hands before slamming into me, going deep before almost immediately withdrawing. I felt the sting of his palm as it connected with my ass, sharply slapping, once, twice, three times in rapid succession, drawing a ragged cry from my lips, and then he pushed into me again. He fucked into me quickly, his hips slapping hard against my ass and his hands reaching under my body to grab my swaying breasts firmly, roughly pinching my nipples. The heavy sac hanging between his thighs slapped against my clit with every thrust, and I could feel myself tightening as the wave crested.</p><p>Releasing one of my breasts, Luke slapped my ass again, harder than before, and it sent me over the edge, my knees buckling so that he had to grab my hips to hold me up as he continued to pound into me. I could feel my inner muscles clenching him, milking him, and he fucked me harder, harder, and faster until I heard him shout hoarsely, thrusting one last time as he came, the thick heat of him pulsating between my thighs with the force of his release.</p><p>Luke pulled out and we both sank to the couch in a tangle of limbs, both panting for breath. I rolled my head to the side to look at Luke and we both froze when we heard a gasp near the door. My eyes flew to the door, where there was a man (a fucking hot one!) standing just inside, his hand tugging at the crotch of his jeans that were stretched uncomfortably with a bulging hardness. A small scream escaped my lips as I scrambled to cover myself, trying to hide behind Luke\u2019s body.</p><p>Luke jumped up off the couch, unmindful of his nakedness, and scooped his shirt up off the floor, handing it to me. I jerked it on over my head, thankful that it hit the middle of my thighs. Then I realized that Luke wasn\u2019t pissed that a strange man was standing in his living room, obviously getting his jollies from watching us have sex. He was grinning at the man as he grabbed his jeans and pulled them on before striding towards the door, and then they were grasping each other\u2019s hand and pulling each other into that weird handshake-man hug-pound each other to death kind of thing.</p><p>\u201cJackson, you fucking bastard!\u201d Luke yelled. \u201cWhat the fuck, man? Its been a while but God, its good to see you!\u201d</p> <p>The stranger (Jackson, apparently) grinned back at Luke, replying, \u201cI know, man, but damnit! I was not expecting to see that much of you, you fucking fiend!\u201d He glanced my way, winking at me and I gasped in outrage.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with these people?</p><p>Luke and Jackson continued with their reunion, ignoring me as I sat quietly on the couch. I sighed, got up and grabbed my clothes, and headed down the hall to find the bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 11</p><p>An hour later I was sitting at the kitchen table, my chin resting on my hand as I listened to Luke and Jackson trading tales back and forth. I had found the downstairs bathroom, but not before I found Brandon\u2019s bedroom (which looked like a disaster area), and I had put my jeans and panties back on, choosing to keep Luke\u2019s shirt on instead of changing back into mine. Brandon was due back any time now, and I was hoping it would be soon so I could talk him into carving pumpkins with me, since Luke had obviously forgotten that I was there.</p><p>Jackson was talking to Luke, and they both were laughing. I took a moment to study him. He was hot, definitely another stack of deliciousness. He was about six-four, broad shouldered, and fit, with soft, deep brown eyes framed by long lashes that did nothing to detract from his masculinity, close cropped black hair, tanned skin, and the cutest dimple in his cheek when he smiled that gave him a boyish air.</p><p>I figured that I should be embarrassed because, hello, he definitely caught us in the act! But honestly, they hadn\u2019t paid any attention to me since Jackson had winked at me by the door. I sighed and then gave a weak smile when I realized that they were both staring at me.</p> <p>\u201cBored, Emma?\u201d Luke asked, smiling at me, his eyes dancing. \u201cSorry, baby, I\u2019ve been rude. Jackson is an old friend of mine from high school. We were inseparable back in the</p><p>day but I haven\u2019t seen his sorry ass in a while!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Emma. So nice to meet you,\u201d Jackson said, his voice deep and even toned. \u201cForgive me for intruding earlier. I wanted to surprise Luke, but I think I\u2019m the one who was surprised!\u201d He started laughing and Luke joined in, apparently not embarrassed in the least at being caught with his pants down. Literally.</p><p>I felt myself blush and sighed in relief when Brandon walked through the door, Doug hot on his heels. I jumped up out of my seat and ran to Brandon, who took a step back at my exuberance.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I crowed at him, \u201cReady to carve pumpkins?\u201d I knew I sounded like a kid, but Halloween was one of my favorite holidays. My other was Christmas, but I think that\u2019s a given. Who doesn\u2019t like presents? I have no shame, I\u2019m a present whore.</p> <p>Brandon grinned at me, nodding his head and saying, \u201cYeah. Sounds good, just let me change.\u201d He took off toward his bedroom and I wondered how long it would take him to find something in there. If he could...</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Luke said behind me.</p><p>I turned around slowly, not sure I was ready to face them again. I raised a questioning brow at him.</p><p>Luke was standing right behind me and he slid his arms around me, kissing me lightly on my lips. \u201cJacks is going to stay here for a few nights, so are you cool with us sleeping here rather than your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Luke, you don\u2019t have to worry about that. You guys can stay here and hang out. You haven\u2019t seen each other in a while and I\u2019ve got to go to my mom\u2019s tomorrow. We\u2019ll just carve pumpkins and, if you don\u2019t mind, you can run me home and then spend some time with Jackson.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s face went hard. \u201cEmma, you aren\u2019t leaving. I want you in my arms, in my bed tonight, sugar, and I\u2019m getting\u2019 inside you again, too. We\u2019re not done.\u201d</p> <p>I shivered at his words, but kept my mouth shut. I didn\u2019t want to argue in front of Jackson and Brandon, who had found something to change into a lot quicker than I would have thought. They were grinning at each other and doing the same manly display of affection that Luke and Jackson had engaged in earlier. I shook my head.</p><p>Luke found some newspaper and we spread it out on the table before plunking the pumpkins down on it and divvying up the carving tools. Brandon and I argued over my pumpkin. It was one I had picked out specifically for myself because it was the perfect carving shape, and Brandon knew it, too. He tried bribing me with everything under the sun to get my pumpkin, but I wasn\u2019t budging. Nu-uh, no way, no how!</p><p>Then we argued over the designs we each were going to do. I was nice and gave Luke first pick, and, after offering Jackson one of the smaller pumpkins I had picked out, gave him second pick, which pissed Brandon off again. At least until Jackson declined a design pattern, simply stating that he wanted to free hand it.</p><p>Brandon crowed in glee and grabbed the book from my hand; I didn\u2019t fight him. Then I laughed until I thought I would piss myself when I pulled out the second book we had gotten at the store and calmly flipped to the design I had already picked out for myself. Brandon saw the book and, like a five year old, yelled, \u201cCheater! Luke! Emma\u2019s</p><p>cheating!\u201d</p><p>Luke just shook his head and laughed.</p><p>Brandon shut up real quick as I picked up the long sharp knife I had gotten out of their kitchen to cut the lid holes in the pumpkins and pointed it at him. (Which is a no-no, kids. Do as I say, not as I do!)</p><p>Carving pumpkins is messy, and even more so when Jackson and Brandon are involved. That\u2019s why, two hours later when we were standing outside looking at the pumpkins all in a row along the front porch, each glowing brightly from a small votive candle in its belly, we were all (and I mean all) covered in pumpkin guts. Doug looked like he had an orange spaghetti wig on top of his head, Brandon\u2019s face was orange (Ha! Served him right for putting pumpkin in my hair), and both Luke and Jackson had pieces of pumpkin and seeds stuck to them everywhere. The kitchen looked like the pumpkins had exploded and we Rock, Paper, Scissor-ed to see who would get stuck with cleanup. Fortunately for me, Jackson was the one who actually lost and now has to clean the mess. He tried to play the guest card, and he would have gotten away with it if Luke hadn\u2019t reminded me that he was actually the one who started the pumpkin fight.</p> <p>We all headed inside to clean up, Jackson tackling the kitchen first, Brandon heading to the downstairs shower, while Luke pulled me upstairs, gave me another one of his shirts to wear, and then got me naked in the shower. No, we didn\u2019t have shower sex, because we were supposed to meet Jackson and Brandon back downstairs for pizza, beer, and maybe a movie. But I was still hopeful to experience that one.</p><p>Luke threw my clothes into the washer with theirs when we got downstairs, and I folded myself onto the couch with a light flannel blanket covering my bare legs, leaning into Luke\u2019s side. Brandon had ran into town to pick up the pizza and grab some beer, and Jackson was finally in the shower downstairs. Luke was flipping through the channels on the tv when I heard my cell phone ringing in the bottom of my purse, which was sitting on the coffee table. I grabbed it and answered without looking at the caller display before they could hang up.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Em? How\u2019s tricks, woman?\u201d The voice was slurred and I pulled the phone back from my ear to look at the number. It wasn\u2019t one I recognized.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t know your man\u2019s voice? Wha\u2019 tha fuck, Emmy?\u201d</p><p>It clicked in my head then. It was Douche Bag Brad. Why the hell was he calling me?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Brad?\u201d I asked shortly. I felt Luke tense beside me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s about you come over here and be a good lil\u2019 girl like you\u2019re s\u2019posed to? I got things that need tendin\u2019 to, woman. And pick up some beer on your way and maybe I\u2019ll be nice and fuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad, we broke up a year ago. You slept with your next door neighbor and I caught you two in bed, at which time you told me I was a whore and then called me a frigid bitch. You\u2019re drunk, lose my number, and fuck you.\u201d I hung up and powered my phone off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could feel Luke\u2019s gaze boring into me, so I turned to look at him. I held up my hand, stopping him as he opened his mouth to speak. \u201cThat was Douche Bag Brad, my ex. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s calling me now, he hasn\u2019t changed, and I want nothing to do with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what exactly was he saying to you?\u201d Luke asked, his voice quietly menacing.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess he wanted me to come bring him beer, and be a good little woman like he always expected me to be. And then he told me he\u2019d fuck me if I was a good girl,\u201d I told him, my voice flat.</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes flashed and his lips tightened even more before he asked, \u201cWas he always like that with you? Do as your told? Be a good girl? And are you serious about him calling you frigid?\u201d His voice rose in disbelief. \u201cYou are the furthest thing from frigid!\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged and nodded my head at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stay with him then? You\u2019re so much better than that, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was good to me at first. We met when I was in college, he took me out on the most romantic date I\u2019d ever been on, treated me like I was really special. I didn\u2019t realize that he was just reeling me in until it was too late; I fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. Things were good for a while, then he turned into some archaic caveman who wandered around thumping his chest, grunting \u2018me he-man, you my bitch\u2019 to me all the time.\u201d I shrugged my shoulders again, shaking my head at my own stupidity.</p><p>\u201cGod, what a douche bag,\u201d Luke muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I call him Douche Bag Brad. He snapped his fingers at me and expected me to jump...literally. And then I came home one day and caught him in bed with the neighbor. And I\u2019m sure you heard what he told me after that,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird that he called me out of the blue like that. I haven\u2019t talked to him in a very long time, and I for damn sure don\u2019t want anything to do with him! Okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Emma, but I\u2019m telling you what. He, or anyone for that matter, talks to you like that again, I will hunt him down and hand him his balls personally.\u201d Luke\u2019s tone was menacing, his face hard.</p><p>In the silence that followed Luke\u2019s statement, Jackson\u2019s voice rang out, yelling, \u201cHoly fuck, dog! That\u2019s not yours! Get out, get the fuck out!\u201d</p><p>Luke and I looked at each other and busted out laughing, the tension permeating the room dissolving immediately. We were still chuckling when Jackson emerged from the bathroom (bare-chested, barefoot, and jeans undone, oh my!) glaring at the lab trotting happily by his side. When he came into the living room, he moved his glare to Luke. \u201cYour dog...\u201d he growled, \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong with him. I think he\u2019s gay! I stepped out of the shower to dry off and he tried to lick my dick! He did lick my thigh, but what the fuck, man?\u201d</p><p>Luke burst out laughing again. \u201cHe was trying to get the water droplets, you ass! He used to push the door to the bathroom open when he was a puppy and when I\u2019d step out, he\u2019d go crazy trying to lick the water off my feet and legs. He quit doing it, mainly because we learned to keep the doors tightly shut so he couldn\u2019t get in, but you must not have latched the door!\u201d</p><p>We were still laughing at him when Brandon walked in the door, balancing three large pizza boxes and a case of beer. I jumped up from the couch to help, tugging Luke\u2019s shirt down my thighs so I didn\u2019t give anyone a show.</p><p>A few minutes later, we all had platefuls of pizza and ice cold beer, and Brandon was putting a movie in. We argued over which one we were going to watch, and finally all agreed on No Strings Attached, which the guys all said was really funny, but I hadn\u2019t seen it yet. Luke lounged in the corner of the couch and I sat beside him. Brandon took the overstuffed armchair, plopping his feet up on the coffee table, Doug jumped on the love seat and sprawled out, and Jackson was left with the remaining spot on the couch on the other side of me. He clearly wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere near Doug to fight for a seat!</p> <p>We ate, drank, and watched the movie, laughing at parts, but holy mother of hotness! There was a lot, and I mean a lot, of sex scenes!</p><p>About halfway through the movie, our empty plates were stacked on the table and we had worked our way through almost all the beer. I was leaned into Luke\u2019s side, my feet curled up beside me on the couch. Brandon was stretched out in the chair still, and Jackson was lounging back in the opposite corner of the couch. My legs were starting to get stiff from sitting curled up and I began to stretch them out. I accidentally kicked Jackson\u2019s thigh, glancing at him to apologize, but he just shrugged and grabbed both my feet, pulling them into his lap. My body twisted and my back ended up pressed against Luke, his arm still wrapped around my shoulders, and Jackson started rubbing my feet.</p><p>I tensed and began to pull my legs back, but Luke snuggled me closer to his chest, glanced over at Jackson, shrugged, and smiled down at me before turning back to the movie. It took a while, but I finally relaxed as Jackson\u2019s hands worked magically over my feet and ankles, and Luke\u2019s heat seeped into me as he lightly ran his fingertips up and down my arm. I closed my eyes, so warm and comfy, and must have dozed off.</p><p>I woke up a while later, not sure what time it was until I saw the digital clock on the cable box. It was almost three a.m. The tv had been turned off and the lights were all out, and in the faint glow of the clock, I could make out the empty chair where Brandon had been sitting. I stretched a bit before closing my eyes again, enjoying the warmth of Luke surrounding me. I was on my side, curled between Luke\u2019s legs with my cheek resting against his chest as he half-reclined on the couch. My hand was pressed to his chest by my cheek and my other arm was wrapped around his waist behind his back against the arm of the couch.</p><p>My left leg was lying stretched out along Luke\u2019s, and my right one was cocked up at an angle, my knee pressed just under Luke\u2019s. His chest was warm along the length of my leg, and his head was a solid weight resting on my thigh, his breath warming the bare flesh between my thighs since my shirt had ridden up.</p><p>Oh, fuck! My eyes sprang open and I sat up, my elbow ramming dangerously low on Luke\u2019s abdomen as I tried to untangle myself. Well, I hoped it was Luke\u2019s stomach...ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod. In the darkness, I felt arms come around me from behind, pulling me back against a hard, warm chest and holding me close again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d I heard Luke whisper in my ear, his voice sleepy, making it even deeper than usual.</p><p>I could feel myself breathing heavily, headed into panic mode. \u201cLuke, there\u2019s a head on my thigh by my...you know. And my shirt...your shirt...is not covering me anymore. Ohmigod, who\u2019s laying on me, Luke?\u201d My voice was rising and I started to struggle against Luke\u2019s chest so I could move away from the unknown male between my thighs.</p> <p>\u201cShhhh, baby. Its Jacks. Has to be because Brandon went to bed not long after you fell asleep on us. I guess I dozed off and apparently he fell asleep on you, too.\u201d He yawned in my ear. \u201cWe\u2019re kinda in his bed, you know. Want to go upstairs with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Luke, please. But...I\u2019m a little stuck. His face is right there, and I\u2019m afraid to move.\u201d My panic was ebbing a little bit, soothed by Luke\u2019s closeness and the fact that he was about to help me out of my predicament. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt Luke shift a bit as he stretched behind his head to the lamp on the end table beside the couch. I blinked at the sudden soft light filling the room before my eyes flew to the head nestled on my thigh, so close to my naked cha-chi.</p><p>I heard a sharp, indrawn breath behind me as Luke looked down my body, getting a clear look at where Jackson was lying. Then, weirdly, I felt Luke\u2019s breath become erratic, like it does when he wants to get me naked. His hands came up on my hips, sliding beneath the hem of it and moving up to cover my breasts.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I gasped in shock, my hands rising up to grab at his and pull them away, but he tweaked my nipples then, and I succeeded only in covering his hands with mine while he fondled me.</p><p>\u201cGod, sugar, it makes me so hard to see your pretty little body spread out in the light like that.\u201d Luke groaned in my ear, his lips tracing it before moving down to my neck, kissing and nipping my</p><p>tender skin while his hands roamed over my breasts and stomach, his fingers dipping low, lightly brushing over the softness of me that was growing damp.</p><p>\u201cLuke, no! Jackson...\u201d I broke off on a gasp as he lightly parted me, the pad of his finger tracing my clit before sliding lower and dipping inside.</p><p>\u201cYes, Emma. I\u2019m gonna make you come, and you have to hold still and be really quiet so we don\u2019t get caught.\u201d His voice was a hoarse whisper against my neck, and I moaned softly, the feel of his lips on my skin combined with his erotic words making me shiver as want flooded my veins. My breath was coming faster, harsher; I was so confused, but so turned on I felt like he was turning me inside out.</p><p>Luke felt me shiver, and his hand tightened convulsively on my breast. His hips jerked behind me and I felt the impossibly hard length of him press against my lower back. I shifted, intending to slide up so I could position that hardness where I wanted it most, but Luke\u2019s hands stilled me.</p><p>\u201cJacks, sugar. Don\u2019t move or you\u2019ll wake him up.\u201d He slid his finger slowly back out of my heat and, using his fingers, spread me open, baring me to his gaze. He gave a soft, guttural moan as he stared at my glistening pink folds.</p><p>I jumped as Jackson sighed in his sleep, his breath blowing lightly against my exposed clit.</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I whispered, my voice breaking on a moan. \u201cPlease, lets go upstairs, baby. Oh, God, what if he wakes up? He\u2019ll see you...what you\u2019re doing to me. He\u2019ll see me, Luke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sugar. But look down, Emma, see how wet you are? You\u2019re dripping, baby, so turned on by the thought of being caught. Mmm, think of it, Emma...what would happen if Jacks opened his eyes right now? He\u2019d see this,\u201d Luke moved his fingers spreading me wide and suddenly thrust them inside me, \u201cwouldn\u2019t he, Emma? He\u2019d see my fingers fucking you, baby, and it would make you wild.\u201d</p><p>Luke turned his head into my neck again, biting the curve of my shoulder and making me moan louder this time. His words were like fire, racing through my veins, desire curling in my belly as they washed over me.</p><p>Oh. My. God. I was a freak! The thought of Jackson catching us, of him seeing Luke with his fingers sliding in and out of my body, turned me on so much that I felt like I would come from it. I tried to fight it, shaking my head against Luke\u2019s chest as my hips began to jerk uncontrollably, rising to meet the thrust of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no...\u201d I was moaning, even as I covered his hand with my own, pressing his fingers even deeper into my hot, wet channel.</p><p>\u201cYessss, Emma, yes!\u201d Luke hissed against my skin. He pulled his other hand out from under my shirt and caught my chin, twisting my head around to take my lips in a wild kiss. Without pulling his lips away, Luke growled harshly, \u201cHe\u2019s gonna wake up, Emma. He\u2019s gonna wake up and he\u2019s gonna see you come. And then I\u2019m gonna let him watch as I slide into you from behind, sitting here just like this, baby, and I\u2019m gonna fuck you. I\u2019ll fuck you so hard while he watches and you won\u2019t care, baby. You want it, Emma, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Luke increased the pace of his thrusting fingers, and I rode his hand, bucking my hips as I moaned, \u201cNo! Yes! God, Luke, I don\u2019t know...I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Luke pulled back a bit to look me in my eyes, his rhythm never faltering, and said, \u201cLet go, Emma. You can. You want it, baby, I can see how much the thought of it turns you on. Show me your darkness, sugar.\u201d</p><p>I broke at his words, coming so hard around his fingers as I threw my head back against his chest and bit my lip to keep from screaming. Luke was crooning in my ear, his fingers still lightly stroking me as I tried to recover from my shattering release.</p><p>I raised my head, looking down the length of my body and my eyes clashed with deep brown ones. I gasped, but my eyes remain locked on Jackson\u2019s where he was lying between my thighs. He had raised his head off my thigh, and was propped slightly up on his elbow. His lips were curved slightly, half-smiling as he deliberately dropped my gaze and let his eyes roam over me.</p><p>I closed my eyes and whispered, \u201cLuke...\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me, holding me tight, murmuring, \u201cIts okay, baby, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I felt Jackson move, sitting up and leaning back against the opposite arm of the couch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and forced myself to look at him, even as my face heated with embarrassment. I shook my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to be sorry about, Jacks. I...\u201d I trailed off, not knowing what to say.</p><p>Emotions were warring inside me. My head was telling me that I should feel ashamed, but my body, and even my heart, were both telling me that I was seriously bent, a total freakazoid, and that wasn\u2019t a bad thing. I felt free, like a piece of me had been broken loose, and I smiled at Jackson before turning to Luke and kissing him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Luke replied. \u201cYou\u2019re bent (was he psychic?) Emma. Seriously twisted. I love it.\u201d</p><p>I moaned against his lips as he kissed me deeply again. He gripped my hips with his hands and lifted me up as he slid down lower on the couch. When he pulled my hips back down, I was sitting astride his, the hardness of him trapped beneath his jeans pressed against my naked wetness. I was still facing Jackson, and he was devouring me with his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I gasped. I looked over my shoulder at Luke and continued. \u201cI don\u2019t...I\u2019ve never...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, you don\u2019t have to do anything. Jacks is just gonna watch, if you\u2019re okay with it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for more than that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cut Luke off. He smiled and crooked his finger at me. I carefully pushed myself up off of his lap and he sat up on the couch before pulling me down astride him again. He hugged me tight to his chest.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201c Luke said, smiling slowly. \u201cIf you\u2019d let me finish, I\u2019m not ready for that. I don\u2019t want anybody but me touching you.\u201c Luke glanced over at Jackson, smiling wryly as he said, \u201cNo offense, man, but you seriously are never touching my girl.\u201d</p><p>Jackson nodded solemnly. \u201cNone taken. I know where you stand on this one.\u201d He grinned mischievously then. \u201cBut I do still want to watch, just once. She\u2019s beyond...\u201d He shook his head, but didn\u2019t finish what he was saying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke apparently understood, because he nodded at Jackson and squeezed me tight again.</p><p>A while later, Luke and I were curled together in his bed, and he was gently brushing my hair back from my face as he placed soft kisses along my jaw.</p><p>I let my mind wander to what had happened earlier, still slightly convinced that it was all just a dream. Luke had pulled his shirt off and then shoved his jeans down and kicked them off, completely uncaring that Jackson was sitting three feet away. He had pulled my shirt off me, too, both of us standing naked for a second before he had lounged on the couch again, facing Jackson, and pulled me over him. I straddled his hips, facing outward towards Jackson, and he had pushed up into me, filling me as he reached around and spread me open to Jackson\u2019s gaze.</p><p>He had set a smooth, quick pace that had sent me over the edge almost immediately, and didn\u2019t stop until I had come twice more. The last one was so intense that I screamed, and Luke had to slap his hand over my mouth so I didn\u2019t wake up Brandon. It had been so intense because Jackson had shoved his jeans down and began stroking himself, matching the thrust of my hips against Luke\u2019s. I had been unable to tear my eyes away from him, from the sight of his hand circling the (huge!) hard length of him, firmly stroking root to tip as I rode Luke, and it had set me off, exploding around Luke and milking him until he came, still thrusting and prolonging my orgasm until Jackson followed as well, spilling himself over his hand.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, pressing my thighs together at the ache the memory of that moment caused. I heard Luke laugh softly behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, sugar?\u201d Luke asked, his tone teasing.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking,\u201d I replied. I turned to face him. \u201cLuke? Why...how...I\u2019m kind of confused,\u201d I stammered. \u201cI\u2019ve been confused since Jackson got here. He watched us...and you weren\u2019t mad. Then...earlier happened, and you were okay with everything but you said he couldn\u2019t touch your girl, and he said he knew where you stood on this one. What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Luke pressed his lips to my forehead, and then pulled back to watch my face as he spoke. \u201cJacks and I have known each other for a long time. I met him when I first went to live with my dad\u2019s brother; he was in my class. He became my friend, my only friend, and he really was the only person constant in my life other than Brandon. It didn\u2019t matter where we were sent for foster care, he made his mom bring him over, or even come get us, because I tried to never leave Brandon behind, until he was able to drive. Then he did the same. His mom took me to get my license, and Jacks helped me get my first car. We\u2019ve never been separated until the last year or so, and that\u2019s only because he took a job in L.A.</p><p>There\u2019s no way to ease into this, so I\u2019ll just be blunt. We used to have some wild times, and we\u2019ve shared women. In fact, we shared almost all the women we dated. None of them ever meant anything really, but we always swore that if we found one that did, then the other wouldn\u2019t touch her. I...you said you\u2019ve seen the darkness in me, Emma. I cant help it, it\u2019s a rush, that feeling of someone watching, of being caught in the act. I know I pushed you into it, and I\u2019m sorry if I went too far.\u201d Luke sighed, closing his eyes and resting his forehead against mine.</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cLuke, you pushed me, but I felt safe, I feel safe with you. And you were right, it turned me on so much. But you still didn\u2019t explain what Jackson meant when he said he knew where you stood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Emma. I\u2019ve told you that. You heard me tell him he wasn\u2019t touching my girl. You\u2019re my girl. Mine.\u201d He punctuated his last word with a hard kiss on my lips.</p><p>I raised my brows at him, but didn\u2019t feel like arguing because I was way too warm and comfortable wrapped in his arms.</p><p>\u201cSugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I tipped my head back a bit to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do we have to be at your parents\u2019 house in the morning?\u201d Luke asked.</p> <p>Shit! I had forgotten about that. \u201cUmmm...ten?\u201d</p><p>Luke rolled over to look at the clock, and groaned when he saw what time it was. \u201cSleep!\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later (it felt like) the covers were ripped off me, and Luke slapped my ass. \u201cGet up, sleepy head! We\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d</p><p>I buried my face in the mattress. \u201cNo! Sleep!\u201d My words came out muffled and then I shrieked as Luke lifted me up off the mattress and set me on my feet, pointing me towards the bathroom. I stood there for a second, blinking sleep from my eyes, and Luke swooped in, kissed me briefly, and shoved me into the bathroom to get ready.</p><p>When I got out of the shower, my clothes from last night were sitting on the counter, neatly folded and pumpkin free. An unopened toothbrush was sitting next to them, and I smiled at Luke\u2019s thoughtfulness. I dressed hurriedly, brushed my teeth, and then, finding Luke\u2019s comb, quickly combed the tangles out of my hair and pulled it up into a knot on my head.</p><p>I got downstairs to see Jackson still sprawled out asleep on the couch, but Brandon and Luke were standing by the door, both looking wide awake and ready to go.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you guys wake up Jackson to go?\u201d I asked, baffled.</p><p>\u201cUh, well, we\u2019re going to your parents\u2019 house and didn\u2019t want to be presumptuous,\u201d Luke replied.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it would be rude to leave him! Get him up and lets go!\u201d I looked at the clock on the kitchen wall and let out a little shriek. \u201cNow! We\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, we were crammed into Luke\u2019s car and headed to my mom and dads. I really didn\u2019t think I was ready for this, but I\u2019ve learned over the years not to argue with my mom. It only makes things worse.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Luke followed my directions and we pulled up outside my parents\u2019 house. I closed my eyes when I noticed that every window curtain in the front of the house was twitching. I opened them again to see that my family had quit being cautious and were openly staring out the windows. My mom was in the window above the sink in the kitchen. Leah and Jenna were each in a window in the living room, and Allie\u2019s face popped up above Leah. My dad and Calland were peering out of the two small side windows framing the front door.</p><p>Leave it to Hayden to be the ice breaker, though. She flung the door wide, and as we got out of the car, I heard her say, \u201cAun\u2019 Emmy, Mommaw, Poppaw, Mommy, and Uncle Cow are \u2018pying on you from the windows!</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI know, sweetie. That\u2019s because they\u2019re nosy, and Aunt Leah and Aunt Allie aren\u2018t any better!\u201d</p><p>She nodded sagely at me before turning the three men standing beside me. She craned her neck to look up at them and her eyes widened. \u201cAun\u2019 Emmy! You gots giants wif\u2019 you!\u201d she whispered loudly.</p><p>I blushed, whispering, \u201cHayden! They aren\u2019t giants, and Uncle Calland is almost the same height.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, her little hands on her hips, and studied each of the guys. \u201cNo. They bigger than Uncle Cow. They prettier, too.\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head and grabbed her arm, dragging her with me into the house, Luke, Brandon, and Jackson all trailing behind me.</p><p>We walked in and everyone had moved back from the windows, pretending to be busy with something, with the exception of Noah and Jarrod, who were playing Xbox and shaking their heads. I rolled my eyes and began introducing everyone. When I got to Jackson, I turned to my mom. \u201cSorry, Momma, there\u2019s one extra. This is Jackson and he\u2019s in from out of town to visit Luke and Brandon. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind, though.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind! The more the merrier!\u201d Mom beamed at Jackson, and the way she smiled made me wonder if she\u2019d been sneaking sips from the liquor cabinet this morning. She\u2019s been known to do that. Usually that results in her dancing around everywhere with her lips pursed, bent halfway over, side-stepping back and forth, all the while yelling, \u2018Put in Billy Squire! C\u2019mon!\u2019 Sheesh. Mothers.</p><p>Allie bounced over to Brandon, but came to a dead stop when she got an up close look at Jackson. \u201cWhoa!\u201d she whispered. I noticed Brandon looking at her funny, but Hayden tugged on my hand and I turned my attention to her.</p><p>\u201cWe gots lots of yummy stuffs for breakfas\u2019. We hafta wait \u2018til you got here wif\u2019 you friends. Can we eat now?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for my answer, she pulled away from me and grabbed one of Luke\u2019s and Jackson\u2019s hands in each of hers and led them to the table.</p> <p>My sisters and I helped my mom carry the food to the table and we all sat down to eat. Everything was going as I imagined it would. It was chaos, everybody reaching for food, talking over one another. Dad wasn\u2019t saying much, just eyeballing Luke every once in a while. Mom and Jenna were discussing new curtains for Jenna\u2019s kitchen, Allie and Leah were staring at the guys, Noah, Jarrod and Hayden were all engrossed in their food, and Calland was playing twenty questions with Luke.</p><p>When Calland said, \u201cSo, Luke, what are your intentions toward my sister?\u201d I slapped my hands down on the table and hollered, \u201cEnough!\u201d I glared at Calland and he just shrugged at me, smirking. My glare transferred to my father when I saw him sneak a high-five to my brother. Ugh!</p><p>Fortunately, the rest of breakfast passed without incident, and, after helping my mom clean up again, we all piled back into Luke\u2019s car. As he backed down the drive, I asked him to drop me off at my house.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, because I\u2019ve got some things I need to do at my house, I have to work tomorrow, and you will want to spend some time with Jackson while he\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>Without asking anyone else, Luke answered, \u201cWe\u2019ll just hang out at your house until you\u2019re done and then we\u2019ll go back out to mine. You can stay tonight and I\u2019ll drop you off at work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him in disbelief before glancing in the backseat, sure that Brandon and Jackson would have something to say about it. Both of them just shrugged at me. I closed my eyes, my head falling back against the headrest. I don\u2019t know why I bother.</p><p>We pulled up at my house and I unlocked the door. All three of the guys brushed past me and headed in different directions. Luke plopped down on the couch and commandeered the tv remote, Brandon started methodically going from room to room, checking my place out, and Jackson headed to the kitchen. I followed him, curious to see what he was doing. Without a care in the world, he popped his head into my freezer and then my fridge, rummaging around.</p><p>\u201cJackson?\u201d I asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d he replied, not bothering to remove his head from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? You cant be hungry, we just ate!\u201d</p> <p>He backed out of the fridge, his arms holding lunchmeat, cheese, and other sandwich fixings. \u201cYes, I can. I just had one plate of food. I\u2019m starving, wasting away to nothing!\u201d He stuck his lip out pitifully and whined, \u201cFeed me, Emma, please?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him, telling him that he could have had more than one plate of food at my parent\u2019s house before grabbing the food from his arms, putting it on the counter so I could grab the bread and make his sandwich. As soon as I had the bread in my hands, he walked out of the kitchen towards the living room, hollering over his shoulder, \u201cmustard and mayo, please! I couldn\u2019t find any lettuce but if you have any, I want that too!\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I went to the fridge and pulled out the bag of shredded lettuce I had in the crisper drawer. Before I made his sandwich, I popped my head around the corner to the living room to ask Luke and Brandon, who apparently had finished wandering my house, if they wanted something too. Surprisingly (to me, at least) they did. Even more surprising, Luke got up off the couch, leaving Brandon and Jackson to fight over the remote, and followed me into the kitchen to help.</p><p>We made sandwiches and Luke carried them into the living room for them while I put everything away and started some laundry. I unloaded the clean dishes from the dishwasher, and then loaded the few dirty ones I had sitting in the sink. Then I swept the floor and was about to mop when the handle was pulled out of my hand.</p><p>I looked up in surprise and saw Brandon there holding the mop and pointing me towards the living room. I started that way when I heard my vacuum turn on. I walked in to see Jackson sweeping the floor, but Luke wasn\u2019t in the room. I walked down the hall until I found him in the bathroom, where he was wiping down the sink and putting away my hair stuff and makeup. He looked so cute that I snuck up behind him and wrapped my arms around his waist, pressing myself to his back. I felt him start, but he recovered quickly and turned in my arms, hugging me tight and kissing my lips softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you guys cleaning my house for me?\u201d I asked him in between kisses.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to get some stuff done, so we\u2019re helping. Cuts down on the time between now and when I can get inside you again.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, his words making me tingle in crazy places.</p> <p>\u201cWhat else do you want done, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need to do another load of laundry and pack up my clothes for tomorrow. Is that okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, but couldn\u2019t you just load up your laundry and take it to my house?\u201d</p><p>He made it a question and the look on his face was so cute I couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but return his grin as he kissed me one more time before pushing me away, saying, \u201cWhat are you waiting for then, woman? Get your shit, lets go!\u201d He swatted me on my ass as I turned.</p><p>Laughing, I walked away from him and packed up my overnight bag with everything I\u2019d need to get ready for work the next day. Then I took my wet clothes out of the washer and threw them in the basket to take with me to dry, and tossed my other load to be washed into another basket. I didn\u2019t have a chance to even reach for one to carry it to the car before the guys came in, grabbed my stuff, and loaded it for me.</p><p>Hmm. A girl could get used to this!</p><p>My cell phone rang in my pocket and I dug it out to see that Allie was calling me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Al!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, someone\u2019s in a good mood,\u201d she drawled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surrounded by hot guys that are cleaning my house. Who wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d I asked her, my glee evident in my voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me, right?\u201d Allie sounded incredulous.</p><p>\u201cNope! Well, they were cleaning, but now we\u2019re gonna head back over to Luke and</p><p>Brandon\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys gonna do then?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I was thinking about taking stuff with me to cook dinner over there for them as a thank you for cleaning my house today,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cOoh, what are you cooking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I could almost hear Allie salivating through the phone. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, I was thinking maybe tequila lime chicken with some Spanish rice or maybe stuffed manicotti? What do you think they\u2019d like better?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, God, Emma. Please make tequila lime chicken and invite me! I haven\u2019t had that in so long and its my favorite meal you make!\u201d Allie was begging and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her.</p><p>I met Luke as he was walking back in the front door and asked if Allie could come to dinner out at his house. He shrugged and nodded, and then asked what we were having for dinner. I told him, and he went right back out the door, yelling at Brandon and Jackson that they were actually getting a kick ass dinner for once.</p><p>I gave Allie Luke\u2019s address and hung up with her as I walked into the kitchen to gather the ingredients that I would need for dinner.</p><p>After everything was loaded, including the four of us, we headed out to Luke\u2019s. He reached over and pulled my hand to his thigh, locking his fingers with mine while he drove. I smiled up at him, and my heart clutched when he smiled back and winked before turning back to the road.</p> <p>For the first time in a very long time, I actually felt like this was something good, something that might stand a chance, even if I didn\u2019t agree with how domineering he could be. He made me feel special, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve never had before. With D.B. Brad, he made me feel like I should feel privileged that he was letting me hang around. Sex with him was when he wanted it, on his terms, and I never got anything out of it. N-e-v-e-r. Unless I did it myself. I used to swear I was getting carpal tunnel from double clicking my own mouse just to get anything from sex with him!</p><p>That one time that he was being an asshole and trying to push my buttons, he had spanked me and was shocked when it made me hot. He called me a whore and left. It wasn\u2019t a week later that I walked into his apartment and caught him red-handed with his neighbor. And by red-handed, I mean literally. They were painted head to toe with red body paint. At least I hope that\u2019s what it was. If not? That bastard has issues that he needs addressed. Stat!</p><p>We got to Luke\u2019s and the guys helped unload the car. Allie pulled up about ten minutes after us and helped me get my laundry started. There was a mountain of laundry piled up in front of the washer, so I grabbed a bunch and threw it in with mine. Men.</p><p>Allie asked if she could help me with dinner, and I agreed, but she really didn\u2019t do much of anything. She was too busy staring at Brandon. When she wasn\u2019t staring at Brandon, she was staring at Jackson. When she was staring at Jackson, Brandon was staring at her, a slightly disgruntled expression on his face. That made me wonder a bit, but I wasn\u2019t going to say anything.</p><p>After I got dinner done, we all sat at the table to eat. No one said much, aside from telling me how good it was. For a while, the only sound was the clinking of the silverware and one of the guys occasionally asking for someone to pass something.</p> <p>I felt surprisingly content, sitting at Luke and Brandon\u2019s table, eating with a group of people that I\u2019d only known for a short time, aside from Allie. The more I had pulled away from Luke, the more he had drawn me back in, and I found myself dangerously close to being completely in love with him. I was half afraid I already was. Scratch that. I knew I was. Yikes!</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Luke\u2019s voice broke into my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I asked, turning to look at him.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d he asked me, a small smile playing about the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were staring at me and you looked a little startled at first, and then a little concerned. I was just making sure there was nothing wrong.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, embarrassed that I was caught starting at him, and even more embarrassed that I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d been doing it!</p><p>We finished eating and Allie and I cleaned up the dinner mess, but Luke and Brandon actually did the dishes. Jackson disappeared out the front door with his cell phone and Doug and Allie followed, Allie grabbing the Frisbee sitting in Doug\u2019s toy basket on the way out.</p><p>I finished my laundry and threw another load in for Luke and Brandon. I took the basket of clean clothes out to the couch to fold, holding up the guys\u2019 clothes to see whose was whose. I gave up after a minute because everything I held up was Brandon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing Brandon\u2019s laundry, Emma?\u201d Luke asked me, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was both of yours, and it was just sitting in front of the washer. So I threw some in with mine and then started another load of it. Its not a big deal.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>Brandon, being a smartass, said, \u201cWhen you get done with my laundry, can you change my sheets on my bed?\u201d</p><p>I finished folding the clothes, grabbed all of Brandon\u2019s up in my arms, and walked into the kitchen to stand next to him. He opened his arms to take them from me, and as soon as I saw my opening, I punched him in the stomach, making his breath wheeze out as he doubled over.</p><p>He moaned. \u201cWhy the hell did you do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou deserved it, asshat!\u201d Luke said, laughing and giving me an appreciative look.</p><p>I winked at Luke and headed outside to play with Doug with Allie.</p><p>The rest of the evening passed in a blur. We stayed outside, enjoying the crisp, cool, fall weather, and when darkness started falling, Luke started a bonfire in the concrete fire pit sitting in the middle of a large patio area just off the back deck. The fire was surrounded by thickly cushioned benches and adirondack style chairs. We all moved to the patio around the fire, relaxing. Luke disappeared inside and came back out with the stuff to make s\u2019mores.</p><p>After stuffing ourselves with the ooey-gooey goodness of chocolate, marshmallow, and graham crackers, Allie stood up to leave.</p><p>I laughed when Brandon pulled her down on his lap, refusing to let her leave. She laughed and tried to get up, but he wouldn\u2019t let her. She gave in when he started tickling her and leaned back against him, gasping for breath. I couldn\u2019t help but smile to myself because they looked good together, but I didn\u2019t think either one of them would ever settle down. Allie was too free spirited, and Brandon was too...Brandon.</p><p>Jackson was quiet for the most part, but I saw him watching Allie with a speculative look gleaming in his eyes a time or two.</p><p>When it started getting late, we all headed inside. I couldn\u2019t keep from yawning and Luke kept laughing at me and teasing that I was getting old if I couldn\u2019t stay up past ten thirty. Of course, then I had to tell him about himself, especially because he\u2019s older than me...</p><p>Allie was standing by the door, her keys in hand, and I walked over to give her a hug and say goodbye. As we stood there , Brandon came up and put his arm around Allie. We both looked at him, waiting for whatever crazy shit would come out next. Instead, he surprised us both.</p><p>\u201cAllie, you don\u2019t, uh...you don\u2019t have to leave.\u201d Brandon said hesitantly. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room here, and you could have my bed if you wanted. I\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Brandon could be so sweet sometimes!</p><p>Jackson piped up from the couch where he was lounging. \u201cYeah, Brandon, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get to sleep on the couch because that\u2019s where I\u2019m sleeping and I\u2019m not sharing!\u201d He winked at Allie before adding, \u201cWith you, at least. Allie can share the couch with me. Or, better yet! Allie and I\u2019ll sleep in your bed and you can have the couch as you so graciously offered!\u201d He was grinning ear to ear by this point.</p><p>Brandon stiffened, glaring at Jackson who just laughed at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rolled my eyes, then turned to Allie. \u201cYou gonna stay and put these boys out of their misery?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She raised her eyebrow at me, a sly grin spreading across her face. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll stay. But sorry, Jackson, I\u2019m not sharing the couch with you. You and Brandon could share his bed...\u201d she trailed off, laughing as Brandon and Jackson looked at each other in disgust.</p><p>Brandon spoke up again. \u201cAllie you can sleep with me in my bed. I promise I\u2019ll behave!\u201d</p><p>Allie glanced at me and I covered my mouth with my hand to hide my smile. I knew Allie all too well.</p> <p>She walked up close to Brandon, their chests almost touching, before she lightly placed her hands on his chest, sliding them upwards to encircle his neck. With gently pressure, she pulled his head down. Placing her lips next to his ear, she said softly (but not so softly that everyone couldn\u2019t hear), \u201cWho said I wanted you to behave, lover?\u201d</p><p>She then traced her tongue lightly down the curve of his ear to his neck before pulling back and walking towards the hallway. Halfway there, I saw her bite her lip as she met Jackson\u2019s gaze, and I could see the hesitation and almost longing in her eyes but she continued down the hall.</p><p>Brandon stood frozen, though his breathing had become heavy, and I visibly saw him swallow hard before he took off in a rush after Allie.</p><p>I heard laughter and turned to see Luke standing beside the couch, watching everything unfold. Jackson was scowling, and Luke clapped his hand to his shoulder as he walked by him in my direction. He grabbed my hand and started pulling me towards the stairs, Doug trailing behind us.</p><p>I turned to Jackson as I stepped up onto the first stair. \u201cFor what its worth? She thinks you\u2019re hot, too. We talked while we were outside with Doug, and she\u2019s confused. She\u2019s really attracted to you, but she\u2019s also attracted to Brandon. Don\u2019t count yourself out just</p> <p>yet, Jackson.\u201d</p><p>I started climbing the stairs again, following Luke who had stopped when I did.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Jackson\u2019s voice stopped me again. \u201cCall me Jacks. All my closest friends and family do. And...thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Jacks. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Luke and I headed to bed. Of course, our good night kiss became a good night fondle, which turned into a good night fuck that had me screaming so loud when I came, we heard Brandon (or it could have been Allie?) thumping something against the ceiling in a non-verbal \u2018could you keep it down please?\u2019 kind of way.</p><p>I drifted off to sleep wrapped up in Luke\u2019s arms, his body pressed to the length of mine, thinking that it\u2019d turned out to be a pretty good weekend after all.</p> <p>Chapter 13</p><p>You know, I realized that time goes a lot faster when you actually allow yourself to have a life outside of babysitting your niece and nephew and living vicariously through your best friend and (sadly) little brother and sister.</p><p>Halloween was Friday, which gave me exactly five days to figure out a costume. Allie had decided that she was going to throw a party and costumes were required. I didn\u2019t have a problem with that because, like I said before, Halloween is one of my favorite holidays. You get to dress up in whatever you want, be whoever you want, AND you get CANDY! Win-win, baby!</p><p>Luke kept asking me what I was going to be, and I had a couple ideas, but I almost wanted to surprise him. That was going to be a little tough, though, because ever since that weekend a couple weeks ago when we carved pumpkins and...well, it was an interesting and very full weekend. Anyway, since then, we hadn\u2019t really spent any time apart. He brought me to work, and somehow managed to schedule his appointments and such at the shop so he would be done at the same time I was. Sometimes we stayed at my house, but generally we stayed at his and Brandon\u2019s house.</p><p>Jackson had stayed just a couple days more and then had flown back out to L.A. for work. I made Luke call him and invite him back for Allie\u2019s Halloween Party and he had said he would try, but wasn\u2019t very hopeful that he would make it.</p><p>Allie and Brandon have hung out with us quite a bit since that weekend, but I haven\u2019t noticed any real romancing going on. Allie swore that they didn\u2019t even do anything the night she slept in his bed. She confided in me that she felt guilty because Jackson was sitting on the couch right down the hall. I told her she was screwed either way. (Pun intended!) She didn\u2019t find me amusing.</p><p>My work phone rang on my desk, breaking into my musings. \u201cGood afternoon, Floyd Grim\u2019s office, may I help you?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then a quick indrawn breath that almost turned into panting.</p> <p>I hung the phone up after saying hello a few more times. Obviously someone was there but didn\u2019t want to talk. I\u2019d been getting hang up calls or heavy breathing calls for a while, but I really hadn\u2019t thought anything of it because it didn\u2019t happen very often. Here lately, though, I\u2019d been getting two or three a day and it was starting to creep me out.</p><p>I mentioned it to Floyd who just chalked it up to pranksters. We\u2019d been pretty busy with clients, lately, and I was swamped, so I didn\u2019t dwell on it.</p><p>At the end of the day, I closed up the office and headed outside to meet Luke. Except Luke wasn\u2019t there; Jackson was leaning up against a silver SUV, apparently waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cJacks! Hey! What are you doing here?\u201d I asked him, smiling and giving him a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cLuke got held up with a tattoo, so he asked me to come pick you up. I just got into town about an hour ago. I have a surprise but you have to wait until we get back to Skin Deep with the boys.\u201d He smiled at me secretively.</p><p>We pulled up at the shop and I practically ran inside, dragging Jackson with me. As soon as we got through the door, I stopped beside him and looked up. \u201cWell?\u201d I waved my hand at him, silently telling him to get on with it.</p><p>He laughed again and fondly kissed my forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute. But I\u2019m not telling you yet.\u201d</p><p>I pouted.</p><p>\u201cHey! What\u2019d I tell you about touching my woman, Beckett?\u201d I heard Luke yell behind us. I turned and went to him, sighing when he folded me into his warm embrace.</p><p>Jackson walked over and, out of the blue, kissed Luke on his forehead. Luke scowled in mock anger and punched Jackson in the arm. Jackson laughed and retorted, \u201cYeah, I know you were just jealous of my kiss.\u201d He made a show of wiping his lips off. \u201cBut damn, man, Emma feels much nicer against my lips.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the bantering between the two of them. It got worse when Brandon came out from the back and joined in. When we settled down a bit, Jackson cleared his throat and his face turned serious.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was telling Emma that I have a surprise. So I guess I\u2019ll just get it over with. I bought the property next door to you, Luke, and I\u2019m moving back here. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll crash at your house until the house is built, but...I miss my friends.\u201d He shrugged and I could tell there was something more that he wasn\u2019t telling us, but I wasn\u2019t going to pry. That was probably something that Luke would need to do. And then I could pry it out of him...</p><p>\u201cHell, yes!\u201d Luke shouted.</p><p>\u201cBout damn time!\u201d Brandon yelled over Luke.</p><p>Jackson stood there and grinned at them, then turned and winked at me. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m buying dinner to celebrate!\u201d</p><p>We all went to Griff\u2019s because it was right down the street and one of all of our favorite places. We sat and ate and the guys drank beer. We stayed later than dinner, because Monday nights were karaoke nights and we were laughing our asses off at Willy (town drunk, remember him?) singing There\u2019s a Tear in My Beer while he stumbled around the stage. He almost fell off twice, but by the grace of God or some invisible wire we couldn\u2019t see, he managed to stay up there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>About an hour into karaoke, they were calling up the next singer and I heard my name over the speaker. I froze, looking around in confusion and panic. No one had left my table so who the hell had put my name in?</p><p>I heard laughter up by the stage and looked up to see my brother standing there, bumping fists with the karaoke guy.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon up here, Emma! I know you can sing, little one!\u201d Jeremy Boggs was the only one who\u2019d done karaoke at Griff\u2019s for the last five years and he\u2019s good at it. Always brings a crowd, and he\u2019s gotten me up there a time or two. But no way in hell on earth was he gonna get me up there in front of the guys!</p><p>I glared at Calland before pushing against Luke, silently asking him to let me out of the booth. He got to his feet quickly, moving out of my way as I shoved past him with fire in my eyes, heading toward my brother.</p> <p>When I got closer to him, he bolted, running past me so quickly that I couldn\u2019t grab him. He headed back to the table and sat down beside Luke. Before I could turn and head back to the table, Jeremy leaned down and grabbed the back of my sweater.</p><p>\u201cHold up! Get your pretty little ass up here, girly. You aren\u2019t going anywhere until you sing.\u201d</p><p>I sighed as people started chanting my name, led by Jeremy on the mic. I closed my eyes for a second before heading up on stage. I yanked the microphone out of Jeremy\u2019s hands and glared at him, which had him backing away with his hands up in mock surrender.</p><p>I nodded my head at him as he headed back to his setup and he cued up my song. If I sang karaoke, I always started with this song, because it was one of my favorites to sing. The opening notes of Black Velvet by Alannah Myles began pouring out of the speakers and I lost myself for the moment in the music. I loved to sing, and I always got stage fright so bad, but once I got going, I didn\u2019t want to stop.</p><p>I closed my eyes and focused on the song, and when I opened them, I never focused on anyone. I mostly kept my gaze on the clock at the back of the room above the hallway to the bathrooms. I completely ignored the table where Luke, Brandon, Jackson, and Calland were sitting. When I finished the song, my voice fading out as the last notes sounded, the room filled with clapping and whistles, the loudest of which were coming from the table where the guys were.</p> <p>I smiled shyly and handed the mic back to Jeremy, who was grinning from ear to ear. He asked if I was going to do another one later and I shook my head no. I\u2019d had enough of the spotlight tonight. I headed back to the table and was met halfway across the floor by Luke, who grabbed me up in his arms and kissed me.</p><p>\u201cWhoa....\u201d I breathed against his lips when he barely pulled away. He grinned at me and kissed me again.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d I asked him softly, smiling back at him.</p><p>\u201cCause you\u2019re so damn beautiful and talented and every note you sang sent shivers through me,\u201d Luke replied, resting his forehead against mine.</p><p>I pulled back a bit and rolled my eyes at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you were listening to,</p><p>but it wasn\u2019t that good. Let\u2019s go home, okay?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at me again. \u201cI know what I heard and you were good. But yeah...let\u2019s go home. I love how you call it that, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t read too much into it, lover boy. Figure of speech.\u201d I shook my head at him and started walking toward the table again.</p><p>\u201cNah...I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Luke was still grinning at me, and I ignored his words.</p><p>Stepping up to the table, I pointed my finger at Calland, who was gazing at me innocently.</p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t give me that look, Calland Andrew. You\u2019re an asshole. Why? I don\u2019t know. I keep hoping you\u2019ll grow out of it one of these days, but no! You\u2019re still a spoiled little ass!\u201d I threw my hands up, giving up because there\u2019s nothing else I could say. I\u2019d said it all before. It didn\u2019t matter. It was never gonna change.</p><p>We gathered our things and headed out to the parking lot. Calland actually was sweet for once and gave me a slight one-armed hug before punching me in my arm and heading back into the bar. Apparently he was trolling tonight. Brandon rode with Jackson and I got into the car with Luke and we all headed home. Er...to Luke and Brandon\u2019s house. Damnit!</p><p>Halfway home, Luke reached over and ran his fingers lightly up my thigh to where my hand was resting. He twined his fingers in mine and gave my hand a sweet little squeeze. I smiled up at him, and turned on the radio. Usher\u2019s Scream came on. Have you ever listened to the words of that song? Its dirty! But so HOT!</p><p>I caught Luke mouthing the words, and that sent tendrils of heat curling through my body. I pressed my thighs together as Luke softly sang, Now relax and get on your back, if you wanna scream...I stared straight ahead, unaware that my fingers were steadily tightening on Luke\u2019s. I didn\u2019t realize that I had gasped, either, when he sang, If you want it done right, I hope you\u2019re ready to go all night...</p> <p>I laid my head back against the seat, letting his warm, soft voice wash over me, the words of the song creating a pulsating beat between my thighs that was begging for relief. I slowly slid my free hand between my thighs, moaning softly at the slight pressure of my fingertips against my aching flesh. Luke\u2019s harsh groan broke through the haze of desire wrapped around me and I sat straight up, jerking my hand away from myself guiltily. I closed my eyes, afraid to look at him.</p><p>Luke jerked the car to the side of the road, and I looked at him in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Luke? Why are we-\u201d Luke stopped the rest of my words with his lips. He kissed me roughly and deeply, not caring about the traffic passing by as we sat on the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cGod, Emma...I gotta get you home, baby,\u201d Luke gritted out between clenched teeth as he pulled back from me.</p><p>I just nodded, unable to speak. He jerked the car back into gear and pulled back into traffic, flooring it. I said a little prayer that the No-Ticket Gods would be good to us and they must have been in a giving mood because we made it back to Luke\u2019s in record time without getting pulled over.</p><p>Luke jerked to a stop in front of his house, barely getting the car in park before he reached over and hauled me into his lap. It was a really tight fit, but I didn\u2019t care. All that mattered was that I was straddled over Luke, pressing into his hardness that fit so perfectly between my thighs. I moaned out a thanks to the Skirt Gods, too, glad that I had decided to wear one today to work as Luke slid his hands up under it and tore (LITERALLY! OHMIGOD!) my panties away from my hips. Making quick work of his zipper, he pushed up into me and pulled my hips down at the same time, slamming every inch of his thick, hard, length inside me as deep as it would go.</p><p>I rode him hard, gripping the headrest of the seat tightly to anchor myself as I did, loving the feel of his hands hard on my hips, his heat scalding me deep between my thighs. I thrust myself down on his hardness one last time, screaming as my orgasm shot through me, coming so hard I saw stars. I heard Luke\u2019s shout as he stiffened and poured himself into me, crushing my hips tighter to his as he rocked his hips in short, sharp thrusts, drawing out our pleasure until we were both gasping for breath and limp.</p><p>I lay slumped on top of him for a minute before we both realized that there was a constant beeping noise all around us. I pulled up and away from Luke, sitting in the passenger seat again and the noise stopped. Oh, shit! I\u2019d been laying on the horn with my ass! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We looked at each other and busted out laughing before putting our clothes right and getting out of the car to go inside. When we got in the front door, both Brandon and Jackson were sitting on the couch, laughing so hard they had tears in their eyes.</p><p>Luke glared at them, though his lips were still twitching with laughter, and I couldn\u2019t help but grin shamelessly.</p><p>Of course my shameless grin turned into a heated flush as Brandon started stuttering, \u201cWe...we knew you must be finished when the horn stopped...stopped beeping and just held!\u201d He double over with laughter again, but Jackson took over.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we knew when they were getting close, too! Beep...beep...beep...beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!\u201d</p> <p>I collapsed into the chair and buried my face in my hands. I could even feel the tips of my ears burning, and I knew I was red from head to toe in embarrassment. I felt Luke come stand beside me, his hand rubbing my back, trying to comfort me. I looked up at him and my embarrassment faded as he grinned down at me.</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders and muttered, \u201cIt was so worth it...\u201d before I stood up and we headed up the stairs to go to bed, Brandon and Jackson\u2019s laughter following us the whole way.</p><p>The next day, Luke took me to my house after work to grab some more clothes. I threw a few things into my duffel and then gasped in shock when Luke grabbed the bag out of my hand and started going through my drawers, methodically emptying each one into it.</p><p>\u201cLuke! What are you doing?\u201d I cried, trying to take the bag from him. He moved it out of my reach and once my drawers were empty, he turned toward my closet. I\u2019m not sure how he was thinking he\u2019d get anything else into my bulging duffel, but I wasn\u2019t about to let him try to shove my good work clothes into it as well. When he opened the closet door, I rushed up behind him and jerked the bag out of his hand. He shrugged and, spying my suitcase on the top shelf of my closet, pulled it down and unzipped it so he could start loading it up.</p><p>\u201cLuke! Stop! I don\u2019t need this many clothes!\u201d I steadily tried to close the suitcase, but he wasn\u2019t having it.</p> <p>\u201cEmma, baby, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to keep coming back here every couple days when we\u2019re gonna just stay at my place. Just get all your clothes.\u201d Luke said this to me in a matter-of-fact tone, and I couldn\u2019t help but gape at him. What the hell was he getting at?</p><p>\u201cLuke, if I have no clothes here, I\u2019ll just have to move them all back here when we stay here. You act like I\u2019m moving in with you!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cYou are. Now pack!\u201d He smiled at me and started pulling stuff out of my closet and tossing into the suitcase on the bed.</p><p>I stood there, my mouth opening and closing like a fish before the red film descended over my eyes. \u201cLucas Tyler Crimshaw, you are seriously mistaken if you think you are just gonna move me out of my house and into yours without us even discussing it. I\u2019m not moving in with you. You can leave now. Do you hear me?\u201d I shrieked, my voice getting higher and louder with every word. \u201cLeave!\u201d</p><p>Luke turned slowly to look at me, his eyebrows raised high in astonishment, eyes wide open and blinking. That didn\u2019t last long, though, and his eyes were suddenly blazing with heat. He dropped my clothes in a heap on the floor (Damnit, now I\u2019m gonna have to iron!) and stalked me as I nervously backed away from him. The backs of my legs hit edge of my bed and I sat down hard on the edge of my suitcase.</p><p>My fingers began twisting in my lap as Luke crowded me, not saying a word. He reached out and</p> <p>wrapped his fingers in my ponytail, jerking my head back as he stood over me. I let out a gasp, unable to hide the spark of fear in my eyes; I was afraid I had pushed him too far.</p><p>Luke lowered his head until his lips barely brushed mine as he spoke, each word clear and concise, sending shivers down my spine, and making me gasp for breath. \u201cYou. Are. Moving. In. With. Me. I want you in my bed, every night. I want to wake up with you in my arms every morning. And sugar? Next time you order me around, I wont take it so lightly. I\u2019ll have you tied up in no time and you will feel the bite of my hand as I spank that tight little ass of yours until its hot and red and you\u2019re screaming for me to fuck the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, and it sounded loud in the silence following his words. Then he continued. \u201cI saw the fear in your eyes, Emma. I\u2019d never hurt you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, instinctively needing to tell him that I knew that, that I trusted him implicitly. I opened my mouth to tell him with words too, but he lightly pressed his finger to my lips, effectively stopping me.</p><p>\u201cA little fear is good, though, baby. I like when you run. But know this- I\u2019ll always catch you. And if you run for too long, then you\u2019ll face the consequences. You wanted to see my darkness, Emma. You haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\u201d He pulled his finger back from my lips and pressed his mouth to mine again, sinking his teeth into my lower lip before laving it with his tongue.</p><p>I moaned, my hands coming up to pull him closer into me. I tried to deepen the kiss but he wouldn\u2019t let me, teasing me with his tongue and sharp nips of his teeth, driving me wild.</p><p>He pulled back from me. \u201cI want you to live with me. Will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, we haven\u2019t known each other that long-\u201d</p> <p>He cut me off. \u201cNo excuses, Emma. Will you?\u201d</p><p>I was left with no choice, and deep inside, I really didn\u2019t mind. He was so fuckin\u2019 hot! \u201cYeah, Luke. I\u2019ll move in. But I\u2019m not giving up my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever said you had to, sugar.\u201d He leaned close in and pressed his lips to mine again, whispering, \u201cThank you, baby. You\u2019ve made me a very happy man.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him and pushed him away to finish packing up my clothes. Since he had packed most of my wardrobe up already, I finished the closet, and headed into the bathroom to pack up a few more things there. When I walked back into the bedroom, Luke had already lugged my suitcase and duffel out to the car and I stood there by my bed, feeling a little unsettled, but knowing that my life was taking the turn that I had always dreamed of.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Emma?\u201d Luke said from behind me.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m...good.\u201d I said it softly, but I realized I meant it.</p><p>Luke sighed, walking over to wrap his arms around my waist and press himself to my back. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be an overbearing ass, sugar. I...if you don\u2019t want to move in to my house, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll move in here with you. But we\u2019re gonna live together no matter what, because I don\u2019t want to be apart from you.\u201d</p><p>I turned in his arms and, raising my eyes to his, I asked, \u201cWhy, Luke? Why is it so important that we do this so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t figured it out yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shook my head in confusion. He leaned in and kissed me lightly, telling me between kisses, \u201cThen...I\u2019m...Not...Telling.\u201d</p><p>Ugh. Men.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Allie walked into my office at work on Wednesday evening and like a freight train, the idea for my Halloween costume hit me. I jumped out of my chair and ran around the counter to hug her, kissing her loudly on the cheek as she yelled, \u201cHey! What the hell?\u201d</p><p>I released her, grinning and nodding my head at her while she looked at me like I was crazy. Then, like always, she had my back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever it is that has put that evil light in your eyes, I\u2019m in! Now what is it?\u201d</p><p>I started breaking my idea down to her, and she immediately jumped in with both feet, tweaking my idea and taking it to places I hadn\u2019t thought of. \u201cAllie? You...are a genius!\u201d</p><p>I called Luke to let him know not to pick me up tonight because I was going to Allie\u2019s. He asked what we were going to do, but of course, I wouldn\u2019t tell him. I hung up, telling him that Allie would bring me home later, but I didn\u2019t know what time.</p><p>Allie and I spent the evening putting our plans into place, and when she took me home at midnight, we were giggling gleefully and praying that Friday came quick.</p> <p>When Friday came, I was almost giddy with excitement, and asked Floyd if I could leave at noon. He agreed, and I called Luke to let him know that I was leaving work, and that I would meet him at the party that night. He and Brandon and Jackson had refused to tell us what they were going to wear for costumes since Allie and I wouldn\u2019t tell them.</p><p>Allie picked me up and we headed first to the hall she had rented for the party to decorate. It was a big open room, with a smaller kitchen/banquet area attached and we went crazy with spider webs, caution tape, fake blood, and everything else we would find. We hung black material over the windows in the big open area to darken it, and placed black lights at intervals on the tables and around the room. We also filled a few cylindrical vases with tonic water and sat them on the tables. Instant glow lamps! Tonic water glows under black light, fyi. Allie had hired Jeremy to come in and DJ for the party tonight, and he was setting up in the corner with a little lamp over his computer and equipment so he could see to do his job.</p><p>We left a large area for dancing and did a little bit of decorating in the smaller room, setting up the snack/drink area so it was ready for the food to be put out when it was time. We had enlisted my mom and Jenna to help with the food, and Allie and I had each made a few things, too. I\u2019d been up late the night before making buffalo chicken dip, which I know isn\u2019t scary or Halloween themed, but it is orange colored and frankly, a party isn\u2019t a party without that shit!</p><p>We also set up a bar area and Leah agreed to come in and \u201cbartend\u201d for us for a bit. We had gotten the things to make Black Apples, which is blackberry schnapps, apple pucker, 7up, and sweet &amp; sour mix (Yum!), Axe Murderers, which is (Drunk City) amaretto, gin, rum, Southern Comfort, tequila, Triple Sec, vodka, 7up, grenadine, and pineapple juice, Ghostini\u2019s, which are simple but delicious martinis made with vodka, melon liqueur, and sour mix, and my favorite punch of all time! It was called simply Halloween Brew and was vodka (I went big with the 110 proof), 7up, lime sherbet, and dry ice to make it look like it was smoking.</p><p>Once we finally got everything ready to go, we rushed back to Allie\u2019s house to get ourselves dressed. We had found long, billowy, hooded cloaks to wear over our costumes so we could hide them until we were ready to surprise everyone. Well, not really everyone. Our goal was to drive the guys insane, and I think Allie and I were definitely on point.</p> <p>We headed back to the hall about fifteen minutes before everyone was due to begin arriving. My mom, Jenna, and Leah were all there already, setting up the food and getting drinks ready. They raised their eyebrows at us when we refused to show them our costumes, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>My mom was dressed as Julia Child, wearing a button up blouse and long, slim skirt with a gravy spattered apron tied around her waist, brown curly wig, and a bottle of wine sitting at her side. She also had a rolling pin and spatula tucked into her waistband.</p><p>Jenna was wearing a long, black trench coat that she kept tightly closed. She looked beautiful with her hair perfectly coiffed, and her makeup flawlessly done. We asked her what she was supposed to be, and we lost it when she simply reached down and tore open the coat (which she had apparently modified with Velcro) to reveal a flesh covered body suit with stuffed pantyhose attached to resemble long, stretched out boobs with pasties on the nipples that hovered around her belly button, and an afro wig attached to her pelvic area.</p><p>Leah was...well, not creative. But I guess if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. She was wearing her red and white high school cheerleading uniform, but she had modified the skirt so it was barely covering her ass, and turned the top into a bra. Instead of wearing sneakers, she had on thigh high red boots with stiletto heels that were at least six inches tall. She looked like a high school hooker. She had installed herself behind the table we had designated as the \u201cbar\u201d and had even put a small jar in front of her that said \u2018TIPS\u2019 in heavy black letters.</p><p>Allie looked at me and whispered, \u201cShe does realize that we\u2019re throwing a party with an open bar and she\u2019s not really working, right?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. Ten to one, that jar would be full twice over by midnight.</p> <p>People began arriving and Allie and I stood by the door, greeting them as they came in. We kept our hoods pulled low so no one could really see our faces. We had just abandoned our posts to head over to Leah to get drinks when we saw Leah\u2019s jaw drop and heard her gasp, \u201cOh, holy shit!\u201d</p><p>Allie and I spun around and we grabbed onto each other to keep our knees from buckling at the sight standing just inside the door.</p><p>Luke was standing there in a tight, ribbed black tank that was tucked into camouflage pants. The pants were tucked into black combat boots that laced up his shins, and he had a camouflage ball cap turned backwards on his head. Silver dog tags gleamed against the darkness of his shirt where they lay against his chest. His tattoos stood out in stark relief on his skin and he looked dangerous and sexy and I wanted to jump him where he stood.</p><p>Jackson was standing beside Luke, shirtless, with faded, ripped jeans slung low on his hips. He had steel-toed boots on his feet and a tool belt around his waist. He had a hard hat on his head that had something written on it, but I couldn\u2019t quite make it out. I also saw that he had varied items shoved into the loops and pouches of the tool belt. He smirked and took a couple steps toward us so we could see the details of his costume. His hat said \u2018Women\u2019s Tool Kit\u2019 on it and his belt was filled with condoms, flavored lube, and various vibrators. Oh. My. God.</p><p>I heard a choked sound beside me and looked at Allie. I couldn\u2019t tell if she wanted to laugh or drool as she stared at Brandon. He was standing there in nothing but a pair of leather flip flops and black Calvin Klein boxer briefs.</p><p>His costume, or lack thereof, broke us out of our daze, and we smiled as they walked closer to us, moving out of the way as more people came through the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you supposed to be?\u201d Allie asked Brandon.</p><p>\u201cAn underwear model, of course,\u201d Brandon replied, striking a pose and flexing his muscles.</p> <p>I rolled my eyes and looked back at Luke. He was peering intently at Allie and me, trying to get a good look at our faces. I stepped back away from him and Allie followed. Without a word we walked into the big room. Allie nodded at Jeremy, who we had enlisted to help with our plan to bring the guys to their knees, and he hit a button, filling the room with Kid Rock\u2019s So Hott.</p><p>As the intro played, the guys followed us, attempting to get close enough to see what we were dressed in. On cue (we worked this out earlier), Leah abandoned her bar position and pulled all three of them back from us, pushing them into chairs by the closest table. In the meager light afforded by the lamp on the DJ table and the glowing vases on the tables, we could see the guys look at each other in confusion, but that changed quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allie and I dropped the hoods of the cloaks off of our faces as the lyrics began, each of us rolling our hips, our eyes locked on our targets. Well, my target was Luke; I was a little confused as to Allie\u2019s, but I assumed it was a two for one deal tonight, since both Jackson and Brandon were sitting there and, well, she was hot for them both.</p><p>Kid was singing, \u2018You got a body like the devil and you smell like sex, I can tell you\u2019re trouble but I\u2019m still obsessed\u2019 and our audience had grown. Everyone at the party had crowded in to watch what we were doing. I was getting extremely nervous because, honestly, I hadn\u2019t thought much about other people seeing us do this. It was too late to back out now, so I took a deep breath and continued.</p><p>The chorus of the song hit and we started releasing the toggle buttons holding the sides of the cloaks together, making sure we didn\u2019t wiggle too much and reveal it all too soon. It was hard to hold back because the beat and the words, \u2018So hot, I don\u2019t wanna be your friend, I want to fuck you like I\u2019m never gonna see you again\u2019 made me want to dance my clothes off.</p><p>Kid Rock\u2019s voice trailed off and the beat changed. We started moving a little bit more, both of us getting lost in the music as Halestorm\u2019s I Get Off started in. As soon as she started singing the lyrics of the chorus, Allie and I threw off the cloaks completely and started really dancing, rolling and dipping our hips, our hands running up our bodies into our hair as we moved slowly towards the guys.</p> <p>Their eyes about popped out of their heads as they took in what we were wearing. Allie was dressed in a black leather strapless sheath. The hem of the dress hit the top of her thighs, barely covering her ass, and she wore torn fishnet stockings with spike-heeled, knee high black leather boots. Her hands were covered with fingerless black leather gloves, and she\u2019d found a spiked collar to wear as a choker around her neck. She\u2019d spiked her hair out all over her head, and the purple streaks were now fire engine red.</p><p>We\u2019d both gone heavy on the makeup, rocker chick style, and both had painted our lips blood red and glossed them with my favorite MAC Lipglass (that shit is the bomb!). I\u2019d left my hair down but had pinned the sides back from my face. I left my bang area down since they\u2019re sideswept anyway, and let the hair curve down over my eye a bit. It looked pretty damn sexy in the mirror but was driving me nuts. I felt like I was blind in one eye.</p><p>I\u2019d gone all out on my outfit, and it had set my savings back a bit. By the looks on their faces, though, it was worth it. I was wearing a black satin corset that plumped my girls up dangerously. I mean, they\u2019re pretty good size anyway, but the corset made them scandalous! It had red lace insets down the front and laced in the back with red satin ribbon. I paired it with tiny little pair of black leather shorts over red fishnet hose, and thigh-high black leather boots. The heels on my boots weren\u2019t spike heeled, but were a little thicker and stacked. I picked them because we all know how graceful I am, and I would probably have broken an ankle in spike heels. I was still a little worried about these boots, though, because they had a four inch heel.</p><p>I\u2019d left my arms and hands bare, and painted my nails blood red to match my lips. I\u2019d also wrapped a silver choker chain around my neck, and attached a thin, silver-studded, black leather leash to it. I was currently running the end of the leash down my body between my breasts while swaying, rolling, and dipping my hips to the beat.</p><p>Allie and I looked at each other and she gave me a small nod; then we turned our backs to the guys to continue dancing. We had kind of choreographed our costume reveal, and it wasn\u2019t anything spectacular, just something to get a rise. We miscalculated just what kind of rise we would get, though.</p> <p>I squealed as my cloak was wrapped around me from behind before I was lifted in the air and thrown over a hard shoulder. I realized that it wasn\u2019t too bad of a position to be in when I came face to face with Luke\u2019s lower back, just above his deliciously tight, camo-covered ass. So I did what any sane woman would do and reached down to yank his shirt out of his pants and kiss the skin I bared.</p><p>I yelped as he smacked my ass, and then bit him when he growled at me to behave. I started hollering for Allie, trying to see where she was. A light came on and Luke set me on my feet. I looked around and realized that we were in the men\u2019s bathroom.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to see much more or to say anything, because Luke pressed me back against the wall and slammed his lips down on mine, pushing his tongue past my lips as he kneed my thighs apart to press his thigh between them. I gasped into his mouth as his leg pressed against my clit, and I thrust my hips forward to increase the friction.</p><p>He pulled back from me and whispered in my ear, \u201cCan we leave now?\u201d</p><p>I giggled. I couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cNo, we have to stay for the party! Umm...Luke, where\u2019s Allie?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and grinned before saying, \u201cWell, if the two of you dancing around in basically no clothes did anything to my brother like it did me, then I\u2019d say she\u2019s having a good time. But its probably an even better time because Jacks got to her before Brandon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I gasped, pushing away from Luke to go try to find Allie. He chuckled and followed me out into the small room.</p><p>He turned to get a drink from the bar as I made a bee line for Allie, who I saw just coming in the door from outside. She looked pissed, and she had leaves in her hair and her lipgloss was missing. Brandon and Jackson ambled in behind her, both looking smug, and I found Allie\u2019s missing lipgloss. It was smeared across their lips. Yes, I said their. As in Brandon\u2019s. AND Jackson\u2019s. Whoa.</p><p>Allie stomped by me, brushing her hands through her hair to dislodge the leaves. I gave her a shocked smile, before whispering, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna need details later.\u201d She gave me a grim smile back and nodded sharply before disappearing into the bathroom.</p><p>The rest of the night passed in a blur of drinking, dancing, and fending off wandering hands. Every time I turned around, Luke was sliding his hands everywhere he could get them, and I noticed Brandon and Jackson doing the same to Allie, even though she did not look happy about their attention. I felt a little odd about Jackson being all over Allie, but I think it was more just because of...well, you know. That night. Which I hadn\u2019t told Allie about yet.</p><p>But I was also just worried that she was going to get herself into something that she might not be ready for. Even though she was about as wild as they come.</p><p>The party was a success, and after we cleaned up the hall, we all headed out. My mom and Jenna stayed behind to help, but Noah had gone home to relieve the babysitter, and Leah had left with the horse\u2019s ass. No, seriously. There were a couple of guys that dressed in one of those two piece horse costumes, and she took the ass end home. He was pretty cute for an ass, though, so I guess I couldn\u2019t blame her. (And by the way, I was right. She was holding onto the full tip jar and had a wad of ones stuffed in her bra as she headed out the door.)</p><p>Allie was told by Brandon that she was coming home with all of us and surprised me when she didn\u2019t put up a fight about it.</p><p>I woke up the next morning stretched out on top of Luke. I couldn\u2019t remember how I got there, but figured he couldn\u2019t be very comfortable. I slid slowly and carefully off to the side and he shifted, turning onto his side with his back to me. God, he\u2019s so gorgeous.</p> <p>Since he was still deep asleep, I took the chance to finally get a close look at his tattoos. I\u2019ve seen him naked so many times now, but I\u2019ve never had the chance to really see what they all were. The first time I had seen him shirtless, I was drawn to the small silver hoops piercing his nipples, but I was still intrigued by the swirls of ink patterning his skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On his back was a sweet ass phoenix. The design was tribal and done in all black with red accents through the wings and tail. The head was situated at the base of his neck, and the wings were slightly spread, spanning the length of his broad shoulders before tapering down as if they were closing or folding in on itself. The tail was angled and curved, and I reached out to let my fingers trace the line of it as it disappeared around his left side that was currently pressed into the mattress. Tribal markings swirled and jutted down his back and around the top curve of his shoulder, blending seamlessly into the phoenix design.</p><p>The right side of his body was mostly unmarked, with the exception of the tribal design swirled down his arm from his shoulder, but there were lines of script spanning his ribcage under his right arm. I sat up gingerly and pulled his arm slowly back to reveal the words beautifully scripted with small precise lettering in five straight lines.</p><p>You\u2019ve got to take the good with the bad</p><p>Smile with the sad</p> <p>Love what you\u2019ve got and remember what you had</p><p>Always forgive but never forget</p><p>Learn from mistakes but never regret</p><p>The words touched me with the truth of them. I pulled back from him as he shifted in his sleep again, this time rolling toward me but remaining on his back, his right arm laid over his head on the pillow. The tribal design that flowed out from the phoenix on his back curved up over his shoulder and continued down his chest, stomach and side, before disappearing underneath the sheet draped over his hips. I pulled the sheet down a bit, wanting to see that gorgeous spot where they stopped, which was just shy of his hip bone.</p><p>In the spikes and swirls of the tribal design weaving down his arm, different sized black and red nautical stars were interspersed. On the inside of his left forearm, inside a spiked, curving swirl, he had more words scripted in even smaller letters, but no less precise. A small black and red star rested at the upper curve of the first line, and a second star was placed just below the last letter of the last line. I pulled his arm closer to me so I could see.</p> <p>Lost in darkness, steeped in dreams</p><p>Blackened eyes and silent screams</p><p>Start and wake, now shaken free</p><p>Stand in faith and no more flee</p><p>While the other lines had touched me, these made my heart squeeze painfully as tears sprang to my eyes. I knew without a doubt that they were words that Luke had written himself.</p><p>My eyes jerked to meet Luke\u2019s as his hand came up, his thumb wiping away a tear sliding down my cheek.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, his voice gravelly and low with sleep. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head before answering. \u201cNothing. Just looking...reading your tattoos.\u201d I pointed at his arm. \u201cThis one is yours, isn\u2019t it. About your life?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated before answering. \u201cYeah, but its not meant to be sad. Its more about the strength to stand up for myself and for my brother. That strength got me where I am today. And right now, I wouldn\u2019t change it for anything in the world, Emma. Not if it meant that I wouldn\u2019t have met you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes against the emotions choking me, squeezing my heart. He pulled me to him, laying me across his chest as he kissed the top of my head. Of their own volition, I felt my lips part and the words slipped out.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Luke.\u201d I felt him tense underneath me before his hands resumed their leisurely movement down my back.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Luke replied.</p><p>And then he just laid there stroking me. And saying nothing. Nothing more. Not a word, nor three little ones.</p><p>Chapter 15</p> <p>I tried to shake off the fact that Luke hadn\u2019t said anything when I\u2019d blurted that I loved him. I told myself that it didn\u2019t matter, that I didn\u2019t need to hear those words. If only I\u2019d believe my own lies...</p><p>The morning after the party, I had gone downstairs to make some breakfast. I froze on the last stair in surprise when I saw Allie curled up with Doug on the couch. I walked over and sat beside her, shaking her shoulder gently. The last I had saw of her at the party was hanging upside down over the shoulder of one of the guys.</p><p>\u201cAllie...wake up!\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cHmmm....?\u201d Allie stretched, blinking her eyes at me to clear the sleep from them.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you on the couch? Where\u2019s Jackson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I think he\u2019s in bed with Brandon,\u201d she said, yawning. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering why you were out here and not smushed in between them somewhere. So, the plan worked! Er, well at least for me it did!\u201d I grinned down at her and she smiled sleepily back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard. You think he\u2019s God or something,\u201d Allie said dryly.</p><p>\u201cNo-\u201d I started, but she interrupted me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, seriously. I think you called him that like two thousand times, screaming at the top of your lungs.\u201d She broke down laughing, and only laughed harder when I yanked the pillow out from under her head and smacked her in the face with it.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at her and asked, \u201cSo? Details! Luke said that it was Jackson that carted you off and Brandon was hot on his heels. What happened after they carried us off like cavemen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacks grabbed me and threw me over his shoulder, bouncing me along until we got outside. Then he and Brandon took turns yelling at me. Assholes,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why were they yelling at you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey kept saying that no one else needed to see my goods dressed up like that. Of course, I yelled back at them because who the fuck are they to tell me who can see what? If I want to show off my chimichanga to the world, then I fuckin\u2019 will!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so that explains why you looked so pissed when you came stomping back inside. Now cut the crap and tell me why they were wearing your lipgloss on their lips and you had leaves in your hair. AND why you didn\u2019t put up a fuss about coming here last night.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and then sat up to give me more room to sit down beside her. \u201cI was right in the middle of yelling at them and Jacks just leaned in and kissed me. I heard him mumble something about hot bitches that didn\u2019t know when to shut up and then his lips were on mine, his tongue was in my mouth, and I was completely like...holyshitfuckdamn! And then it turned into a holyshitfuckdamnohmigod when Brandon ripped me out of Jacks\u2019 arms and HE kissed me! We ended up in a pile of leaves on the grass and everything was fan-fuckin\u2019-tastic until they pulled back and both asked me if I was going to come in and change! Ugh!\u201d</p><p>She and I laughed and traded stories back and forth quietly until the guys all started ambling in from different directions in the house. Then we got up and made breakfast and just enjoyed the weekend together.</p><p>In the weeks that followed the Halloween party, Luke and I spent pretty much all of our free time together. He never complained about Sunday breakfast at my parents\u2019 house; even Brandon and Jackson tagged along. Brandon was always the first to the car to go over there, and I teased him that he was sweet on my mom\u2019s cooking, to which he replied that it was more that he couldn\u2019t wait to see what my brother and I would argue and fight over each week. Jackson admitted that that was primarily the reason he went, as well.</p><p>I tried to just ignore Calland so I wouldn\u2019t give them more to laugh at, but I couldn\u2019t help it that my brother was such an asshole. But I could not sit back and let him have his way about everything. We had enough of that growing up. My sisters and I had dubbed it the \u201cPenis Rule\u201d and my family had ran with it. Calland was fond of saying, \u2018He who has the penis makes the rules\u2019 and, my parents, Lord love them, thought it was hilarious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This rule was brought up last week at breakfast, and was more than likely the reason that neither Brandon, nor Jackson, would ever miss another one. Well, that and the scalloped potato incident...</p><p>Last week we had all gone over to my parents\u2019 house for breakfast. Allie had come, as per usual. There were very few Sunday breakfasts that she\u2019s missed in all the years we\u2019ve been friends, and they\u2019ve been mostly in the last couple of years. Since all three of the guys have been coming, she\u2019s started showing up like clockwork again, which my mother adores.</p><p>My mom had made a big batch of scalloped potatoes for dinner on Saturday night, which all of us kids love. After breakfast, I had asked my mom if I could take the leftovers home with me, and (of course) she said I could. I reached in the fridge to get them and sat them on the counter to grab my purse and give hugs and goodbyes. The guys had all headed outside with my dad to look at something he wanted to show them, and when I turned to grab the potatoes, they were gone.</p><p>I spent a good five minutes looking everywhere for them, and it hit me. I headed out to the garage yelling for my brother. When I got out there, he was standing just outside the garage with the bowl in his hands. I had stomped over to him and demanded that he give me the potatoes. That\u2019s when things went to hell and I ended up being brunt of about a million jokes, not to mention the 2,000 and counting hits on the Youtube video that my dear brother-in-law, Noah, had so kindly posted.</p> <p>He said it was too funny not to post, what with Calland opening the lid and licking the potatoes inside the bowl so I wouldn\u2019t want them. Which made me stomp and tattle to my mother (don\u2019t judge me), and then Calland had told me I could have them if I could get them from him, but I couldn\u2019t cross the imaginary line he marked across the driveway with his foot. Long story short, I chased him around the driveway screaming like a banshee trying to get the potatoes while everyone laughed at me. (I didn\u2019t get the potatoes back.)</p><p>Since then, I\u2019d tried not to let my brother get a rise out of me, but it never turned out well. Thanksgiving was next week and he was threatening to hide the homemade mac n\u2019 cheese from me. Asshole. Always.</p><p>The Monday before Thanksgiving was hell for some reason. I drove myself to work because Luke had told me that morning after his shower (we were running late, so I didn\u2019t get to share it with him) that he would be working late tonight.</p><p>The phones were ringing off the hook and Floyd was out of the office for the week. I only had to work Monday and Tuesday, because I have an awesome boss and got to take Wednesday, Thursday (obviously), and Friday off for the holiday. I was looking forward to having a five day weekend and getting to spend some time down at Luke\u2019s shop with him. I\u2019d even tentatively picked out a new one that I wanted Luke to give me, but I hadn\u2019t asked him about it yet.</p><p>My phone rang again and I put the client currently crying on my shoulder about her case on hold while I answered the second line.</p> <p>\u201cFloyd Grim\u2019s office, can I help you?\u201d I said into the phone.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot to say good morning, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? This is Floyd Grim\u2019s office...is there something I can help you with?\u201d I tried again, not sure I really heard what I thought I did.</p><p>\u201cYou always say good morning or good afternoon. You didn\u2019t say it, sweetheart. And you should have.\u201d The voice continued speaking in a harsh whisper, deep, guttural, and chilling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...sorry? Is there...can I help you?\u201d I stammered, caught off guard by his words.</p><p>\u201cI call you all the time to hear your voice. Figured it was time I actually spoke to you. I\u2019m going to miss hearing you while you\u2019re out on holiday, my love.\u201d</p> <p>I really didn\u2019t know what to say, and he was starting to freak me out. \u201cSir, this is a law office and if you aren\u2019t calling to speak to someone in that capacity, then I have to ask that you not call again. Good day, sir,\u201d I said quickly and hung the phone up.</p><p>My phone beeped, reminding me that I had another call on hold, and I jumped. Laughing at myself, I picked up the phone and tried to calm the poor lady down. After promising that Floyd would call her at the beginning of next week, I hung up and immersed myself in the million and two other things that needed my attention before I closed the office for the holiday tomorrow.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think much of that weird phone call until I was tucked under Luke\u2019s arm in bed that night. It hit me that the creepy guy had said he called all the time to hear my voice, and I wondered if he was the one that kept calling and hanging up. I made a mental note to speak to Floyd about it when he got back on Monday and drifted off to sleep.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d a voice whispered in my ear.</p><p>I jerked up and winced, rubbing my forehead where it had connected with Brandon\u2019s chin. Pause...rewind...Brandon?</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I shrieked as I scrambled for the sheet to cover my naked breasts as I glared at Brandon sitting calmly on the edge of the bed where I was laying, rubbing his face where my head had hit while he grinned unapologetically at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Brandon? Where\u2019s Luke?\u201d I yelled at him.</p><p>\u201cHe called and said he wanted to let you sleep a bit but he forgot to the reset the alarm for you. He had to go in early because we were getting some new supplies in that he had to be there for. Asked that I wake you up. So, wake up!\u201d He sounded entirely too cheerful, and I suspected that he was up to something. I just wasn\u2019t awake enough to figure out what.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m awake! So, get the hell outta here so I can get up!\u201d I shooed him out with one hand, the other tightly clasping the sheet to me so he wouldn\u2019t get another peep show.</p><p>He got up and walked to the door, throwing one last parting shot over his shoulder. \u201cNice rack, by the way. Now get in the kitchen and make me some pancakes, woman!\u201d</p><p>I lobbed a pillow at him but he ducked out the door into the hallway before it connected and I sat there shaking my head at his audacity, listening to his laughter fade as he ran down the stairs.</p><p>I showered and got ready for work, foregoing my usual attire for a tight fitting pair of faded jeans and an oversized hot pink hoodie. Floyd didn\u2019t care if I went casual sometimes, and I really wasn\u2019t anticipating much traffic in the office this close to the holiday.</p><p>I headed to the office still grinning at the image of Brandon\u2019s face as I left him sitting at the table. He\u2019d been in his bedroom when I came down and I had knocked on his door, telling him his pancakes were getting cold. He\u2019d come flying out of his room, babbling that he had been kidding, but since I was so nice and really made him pancakes then he was going to love me for all time and Luke could just get over it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think Luke would have anything to get over, since I didn\u2019t make him pancakes. Instead, I had popped a couple of blueberry waffles I had found stuffed in the back of the freezer into the toaster and slapped them down on a plate in front of him, laughing out right at the shocked and almost pained expression on his face when he realized he really wasn\u2019t getting what he wanted.</p><p>Tuesday was a decently slow day and I was finishing up lunch at my desk when my cell phone chimed in my purse. I looked at it and smiled when I saw that Luke had texted.</p><p>Hey, sugar. Sorry I didn\u2019t get to see your smiling face this morning. I miss you.</p><p>I hit reply and began to type. It\u2019s okay. I just wish I could have seen your face when Brandon told you what I did to him this morning! =) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma? What do you mean what you did to him? Should I be jealous?</p><p>No! Luke, come on! Seriously? That\u2019s why I hated texts because you never really could tell when someone was playing around unless they came out and said it.</p><p>No. You know who you belong with. I\u2019ll just spend even more time tonight making sure you know it. In fact...</p><p>What? I replied when he didn\u2019t say anything else.</p> <p>It was about fifteen minutes later when I got the reply, and it made a shiver work its way up my spine.</p><p>Just be ready, baby.</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief as I closed up the office for the week and headed out to my car. Luke had texted about twenty minutes ago, letting me know to head over to Skin Deep because he was still finishing up a client and had another one booked.</p><p>I got out to my car and completely melted when I saw the white rose tucked onto my windshield. I grabbed it and held it to my nose, smiling at the thought of Luke sneaking over to do something sweet like that.</p><p>I pulled up at Luke\u2019s shop and headed inside, clutching the rose in my hand. He was standing behind the counter, finishing up the aftercare instructions with his client, and when the man walked away, I went directly to him and wrapped my arms around him, tipping my face up for his kiss.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for the rose, Luke. You\u2019re so sweet...\u201d I whispered to him.</p><p>Luke drew himself out of my arms, pushing me back and holding me at arms length with his hands on my shoulders. \u201cWhat rose?\u201d</p><p>I blinked up at him in confusion. \u201cThe white rose you left on my windshield today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, I didn\u2019t leave the shop all day today. I\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...okay? Well someone left me a rose on my car. Oh, God! What if it was meant for someone else and they put it on the wrong car? That\u2019s so sad...\u201d I shook my head and then shrugged. \u201cWell, its pretty anyway.\u201d</p><p>Luke pulled me in and kissed my forehead before calling his client back. He shot me a look of concern over his shoulder as he walked away.</p> <p>I wandered back down the hallway to Brandon\u2019s office to see what he was doing. He was sitting at an angled drawing table, sketching out a design. I peered over his shoulder, watching as he shaded a curving line.</p><p>\u201cIts really good, Bran,\u201d I said by his ear.</p><p>He jumped, twisting around on his stool to stare at me in surprise. \u201cEmma! I didn\u2019t hear you come in. What\u2019s shakin\u2019, bacon?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and rolled my eyes at him. \u201cNothing, Luke just took someone back so I wandered down here to see what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, just working on a design for this lady. This is the fifth time I\u2019ve drawn something because she keeps Googling tattoos on the internet and changing her mind. If she doesn\u2019t like this one I think I\u2019m going to scream and tell her to get fucked!\u201d He grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. You\u2019re too nice to do that. Well, you\u2019re nice to other people, anyway.\u201d I grinned back at him.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of nice, you witch! How could you toy with my stomach\u2019s emotions like that? You promised pancakes and left me with frozen waffles! You could have at least buttered them and put syrup on \u2018em!\u201d Brandon whined, pouting like a child with his lips stuck out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied laughing. \u201cThat was just funny! You should have seen the look on your face!\u201d</p> <p>We sat in companionable silence as Brandon worked on his drawing, stopping every so often to see what I thought about something he had added. Luke popped his head in a little later and I looked at my watch, surprised to see that an hour had gone by.</p><p>\u201cReady, guys?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded, and with a devilish twinkle in my eye, nudged Brandon with my shoulder as I asked Luke, \u201cSo, did Brandon tell you what he complimented me on this morning?\u201d</p><p>Brandon\u2019s head came up with a jerk, his eyes widening as he looked at me with an I\u2019m-gonna-kill-you-you-bitch look. I laughed as Luke turned to Brandon, asking him what I was talking about.</p><p>My grin widened as I interjected Brandon\u2019s stammering. \u201cHe came to get me up this morning. Maybe next time you\u2019ll make sure I have a shirt on or something before you send someone in and then I wont get complimented on my \u2018nice rack\u2019!\u201d</p><p>I laughed as Luke swatted Brandon in the back of the head. \u201cYou ass! I told you not to go in, just to knock on the door and she\u2019d get up! You ogled my girlfriend\u2019s tits? Man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, dude...ogled? What are you, eighty? And I only saw them for a second. Trust me, didn\u2019t give me a stiffy, just maybe half a bone! She\u2019s hot and she has a nice pair but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon! You\u2019re digging a hole here, man!\u201d I said, laughing even harder at Luke glaring at Brandon and Brandon trying to justify himself.</p><p>\u201cLuke, its okay. He really didn\u2019t have time to see anything and I got him back. Ask him about the pancakes this morning and I\u2019m gonna go stop by Griff\u2019s and get us a pizza to take home for dinner. Meet you guys there.\u201d I stood on tiptoe to kiss him before heading out to my car.</p><p>As I walked away, I heard Luke say, \u201cYou saw my girlfriend\u2019s girls and she made you pancakes? You are so dead!\u201d</p><p>I waited for the pizza at Griff\u2019s and then swung by my house to grab my mail on the way home. Leah had been staying there since I was living at Luke\u2019s now, and Calland even crashes there sometimes if he\u2019s close by instead of going home to his apartment. Leah has been collecting my mail for me and putting it in the decorative bowl on the sideboard table by the door. I keep reminding myself that I need to go ahead and just change my address, but I was a little afraid to take that last step.</p><p>I got to the house and Luke was walking down the stairs, fresh out of the shower when I walked in the door. Brandon was watching tv on the couch with Doug, who was cuddled up on his lap. Geesh. Over one hundred pounds and he thinks he\u2019s a lapdog.</p><p>I sat the pizza down and Brandon pushed Doug off his lap before we all crowded around the table and ate. I had just taken a drink of my pop when Luke glanced at me and asked, \u201cSo you tortured my brother with frozen waffles this morning after he ogled (he glared at Brandon as he said it) you in my bed?\u201d</p><p>I choked and barely managed to swallow the mouthful of pop as I started laughing. \u201cYeah. His face was classic!\u201d</p><p>Luke smiled at me while Brandon glared at me and said, \u201cYou owe me pancakes, woman. And this time they better be REAL pancakes. With blueberries. And whip cream!\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him. We finished eating dinner and Brandon pushed back from the table, winking at me and disappearing into his bedroom. He came out a few minutes later wearing tight, dark rinse jeans and a tight white t-shirt with the shop\u2019s logo written across the chest in tribal style black lettering. He\u2019d put on his black leather boots and had his black leather jacket in his hand, his car keys in the other.</p><p>\u201cGoing out for a while. Don\u2019t wait up!\u201d he said teasingly, before he grinned at us and walked out of the house.</p><p>Luke and I cleaned up dinner and I headed upstairs to take a shower while he lounged on the couch for a bit. I lingered under the hot water, and when I finally stepped out of the shower to dry, there was a large towel laying on the sink counter and my clothes that I had brought in with me were gone. Under the towel was my corset from my Halloween costume and a very small pair of black lace panties that Luke must have dug through my drawer to find. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anticipation shot through me when I realized that Luke was making good on his words from earlier. I put on the outfit and took the time to brush out my hair and twist it into a knot on top of my head. I brushed my teeth and when I reached for the doorknob to leave the bathroom, there was a black satin scarf hanging on it with a note stuck to it that said, \u2018put me on and open the door, but don\u2019t move.\u2019</p><p>My pulse sped up as I complied, covering my eyes with the silky material and tying it at the back of my head. I reached out with my hand to open the door, and I barely turned the knob before I felt it slowly open towards me and Luke\u2019s hand touched mine. He checked the blindfold to make sure I couldn\u2019t see anything and led me into the hallway. From the way he turned me, I could tell he was leading me toward the bedroom.</p><p>When we finally stopped walking, I felt Luke\u2019s lips press against mine in a fleeting kiss, barely there and gone in a heartbeat, before placing tiny kisses along my jaw line until his lips were by my ear. \u201cDo you trust me, baby?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get my throat to work, so I nodded. \u201cNo, Emma. Tell me, out loud. Do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d I whispered.</p><p>His lips brushed my ear with every word, making me shiver as he said, \u201cGood. If anything gets too much, just tell me and I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>His lips pulled away from my ear and I heard him move around the room. I stood still, not knowing where exactly I was in the room and unwilling to risk face planting (again) in front of Luke. I felt the air swirl by my shoulder a split second before I felt Luke\u2019s hands settle something cold and metallic around my neck. I gasped at the coolness resting on my flushed skin and raised my hand to feel what it was. Before I could get my hand all the way up, Luke grabbed my fingers, tsk-ing under this breath.</p><p>\u201cAh-ah, Emma. Stay still and no touching.\u201d</p><p>I gasped as his hand came down sharply on my ass with a stinging slap, then rubbed it gently. He turned me and one of his hands grasped my hip as the other urged me to bend forward. I instinctively put my hands out to catch myself and felt the softness of the mattress give beneath my palms. He pressed me down until I was bent over the bed, cheek against the coverlet, my arms trapped under me. He whispered for me not to move and I felt him draw away from me.</p><p>I heard him walk away and come back to me after a second, his hand reaching down to bend my legs one at a time, guiding them until I was kneeling on some sort of padded bench. He ran his hands between my thighs and down them, sliding my legs further apart on the bench, before tracing back up until his fingers brushed the lace that was quickly becoming drenched at the juncture of my thighs.</p><p>I jerked at the light contact, pushing back against his hand, moaning softly and wordlessly entreating him to press harder, deeper into my heat. Instead, I felt the stinging heat of his hand on my ass again, harder this time than it was before, and it made that secret part of me clench and spasm, the dark seduction of it pulling me under.</p><p>Luke\u2019s breath hissed through his teeth before I heard him growl, \u201cYou\u2019re not listening, Emma. Don\u2019t. Move.\u201d</p><p>At the low, barely controlled heat in his voice, I writhed against the bed, my hips thrusting forward, seeking to ease the ache between my thighs. My lips parted as I gasped for breath and my heart pounded with desire. I moaned loudly when Luke shoved his fingers beneath the lace covering my tender flesh and slid them deep inside me without warning, thrusting them in and out roughly once, twice, before pulling them out and sliding them forward to circle over the hard bud of my clit.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I groaned as he quit my aching flesh, wanting, no- needing to feel him thrusting into me again.</p><p>\u201cMmmm...you taste so good, sugar,\u201d Luke groaned behind me, and the mental image of him sucking my wetness off his fingers made me moan and buck my hips again, which in turn, meant I felt the sting of his palm meeting my tender flesh once more.</p><p>I cried out at the contact, but not in pain. I heard Luke groan again, and then he grasped the sides of my panties and ripped the lace until I was bare to his gaze. I knew that he was staring at the pale globes of my ass and the wetness I knew was glistening on my silky pink folds peeking from between my thighs. I arched my back, thrusting my ass further up in the air, sliding my legs apart as far as I could before my knees hit the solid arms of the bench.</p><p>Luke growled and I got the reaction I wanted. He smacked my ass again, spanking me on each cheek until the burning reached a fever pitch and I was moaning uncontrollably. I could feel myself slipping under, lost in the spell of pleasure/pain that, until now, had been forbidden to me. Luke stopped the stinging slaps and gently rubbed the reddened skin for a minute, then ran his fingers lightly over the parted flesh between my thighs, dipping in to play in the wetness there, before his hands spread me wide and I felt his tongue spear into me, fucking in and out of my heat with deft strokes, slicking against every inch of me and firing all my nerve endings until I was screaming with the need to shatter on his tongue.</p><p>The beginnings of my orgasm started pulsating deep inside me and when Luke felt me clench on his tongue, he pulled away immediately, leaving me gasping and shrieking in disbelief as I felt those glorious waves subside with nothing feeding them any longer. My body felt empty and ached with fever pitch for the release that he denied me so cruelly. I whimpered in the back of my throat before I gave in and started begging.</p><p>\u201cLuke, please, baby, please, please, please...oh, God!\u201d I moaned, wiggling my hips and trying to bring my thighs together, anything to alleviate the aching, throbbing flesh there.</p><p>I pressed my hands into the mattress beneath me and started pushing myself up, intending to do what, I wasn\u2019t sure, but the feel of Luke\u2019s hands roughly pushing me back down made me gasp before a small sob escaped between my parted lips, borne purely out of frustration and need.</p><p>Immediately, Luke was up and over me, breathing into my ear as he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby, are you okay? We\u2019ll stop, I promise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke! No, please don\u2019t stop! I just need you, please, fuck me, put your tongue back on me, something! Anything! Just make me come!\u201d I moaned, arching myself up into the hardness of him over me. The thick length of him pressing against the denim of his jeans rubbed against my bare ass and I arched even more, trying to bring him in line with my aching mons, and he chuckled in my ear.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want me to stop, then you\u2019re in trouble. I told you not to move, sugar. You need to come?\u201d he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I shouted (Seriously, I needed to get off!)</p><p>Luke pulled away from me, still laughing at me (which was starting to piss me off...I was a woman on the edge and if he didn\u2019t do something soon then I was about to have a date with the shower head. Or the bedpost. Or whatever I could get my hands on, including my hands!)</p><p>Smack! Luke\u2019s palm began heating my ass again and I squirmed, thrusting my ass into each stinging slap, not realizing that I was begging him under my breath not to stop. I screamed when his hand moved and slapped the tender flesh between my thighs, the sharpness tingling over my clit and sending me over the edge without warning. Luke\u2019s fingers circled briskly over my clit as I came and came, prolonging the wrenching spasms</p><p>shivering through my body.</p><p>When I finally calmed, Luke slid his hands around my waist and lifted me up off the bed before turning me in his arms and laying me down on the bed. I let him move me around where he wanted me, still unable to move and blinded by the black satin still covering my eyes. He moved my arms above my head and held them there, locked together in one of his hands. I heard something clink before a cool metal bracelet snapped into place on my right wrist and then another snapped onto my left wrist without pause. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I said tentatively, completely turned on but a little anxious at being locked down on the bed. I moved my hands experimentally and found that the cuffs weren\u2019t too tight and I could reach up and wrap my hands around the slats comprising the headboard of Luke\u2019s bed.</p><p>He moved up between my thighs, spreading my legs high and wide and holding them there with his knees, leaving my smooth, wet, secret folds bare to his gaze. I moaned low in my throat at the feeling of helplessness that washed over me; I was spread open for him to do whatever he wanted to me and there was nothing I could do about it. It was thrilling and scary at the same time and it was driving me wild.</p><p>I felt him lean to the side for a moment, fumbling with something on the nightstand before he was over me again, still holding me open and helpless. He dipped his fingers into my heat again, plying the wetness there over my clit, sliding up and down over it before pushing them slowly deep inside me. I moaned, clenching my inner muscles around his invading fingers, and he pulled them out quickly.</p><p>I gasped as something blazed a trail of liquid fire down my stomach, stopping just short of my cleft. Whatever it was, it was hot, really hot, but not so hot that it was burning me. It almost felt like if you were to accidentally spill candle wax on your...holy shit! Was that what it was? Ohmigod...</p><p>Luke\u2019s lips followed the trail, licking and nipping my skin along my ribcage and down my stomach. I felt the heat splash onto my inner thighs, making me jump and thrust my hips up at the same time. My breath whooshed out of me when I felt Luke move again, and this time something ice cold, dripping wet, and hard slid down my skin, following the trail of wax down my body, but it didn\u2019t stop there. The iciness slipped down over my clit, spreading my folds even more before dipping slightly inside me where it rested for a second, melting and pooling in the heat of my body.</p><p>I moaned, lost in the sensations of hot and cold, and Luke reached up and pulled the blindfold off my eyes. I immediately stared down the length of my body, entranced by the wax drippings on my skin and the slightly wet tracks left on my skin from the ice, but mostly by the sight of Luke\u2019s hard length, jutting up from the juncture of his thighs, long and thick, the tip weeping with the evidence of his desire.</p><p>As I watched, Luke pressed my thighs back further, opening me up even more before dipping the tip of himself into my hot, wet tightness, thrusting forward smoothly until he was seated as deep inside as he could get. I closed my eyes but opened them again at Luke\u2019s harsh directive.</p><p>\u201cWatch me, Emma, watch me inside you. Don\u2019t close your eyes, baby,\u201d Luke groaned, beginning a smooth, sliding rhythm in and out of me.</p><p>I watched, helpless to do otherwise, entranced by the sight of his thick, ruddy hardness cleaving into my soft, wet heat over and over again. Luke\u2019s hips began to thrust faster, his skin slapping loudly against mine in the silence broken only by our quickened breaths and soft moans.</p><p>I gripped the slats of the headboard above my head, wishing I was free to touch him, pulling against them as my body strained and rushed toward that shattering moment of release, my hips thrusting up to meet his downward strokes, again and again before we both broke, Luke moaning loudly and me screaming out my release as my body convulsed around his, feeling him pulsing and throbbing deep inside as he filled me.</p><p>Luke released my hands from the cuffs and we cleaned up before we wrapped our arms around one another and fell into an exhausted but satisfied slumber.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Thanksgiving dawned bright and early and I woke with a smile on my face, the memories of last night washing over me and making me ache with want again. Luke was still sleeping beside me, and I carefully threw my leg over him after moving the sheet back, sliding my growing wetness against his slumbering length, loving the feel of it as it started thickening against me.</p><p>Before it fully engorged, I guided it into my heat, moaning softly at the feel of it stretching me as it hardened. Luke twitched under me, his hands coming up to grasp my hips as he blinked his sleepy but gorgeous eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cMmmm, sugar...what a way to wake up.\u201d He smiled but it faltered as I squeezed him with my inner muscles and began sliding up and down on him, riding his hardness. We moved together, making love slowly and thoroughly before collapsing beside each other, tenderly kissing and touching softly as our bodies cooled.</p><p>We laid there catching our breath before rising to get ready for the day. I was a little nervous about taking Luke and Brandon to my parents\u2019 house for Thanksgiving, though I knew I shouldn\u2019t be. I mean, they\u2019ve been coming to Sunday breakfast for a while now, and if that hadn\u2019t made them run for the hills then I should be in the clear, right? I was already giving thanks that Jackson wouldn\u2019t be subjected to the craziness, but I knew my family, and holidays around the Jensen house are anything but normal.</p><p>Take last year, for example. My father, God love him, decided that he was going to deep fry the turkey, so he went out and bought one of those fancy turkey fryer thingies. The turkey came out black (I mean BLACK!) on the outside, but was actually the most delicious turkey we\u2019d had. Doesn\u2019t sound bad, I know, but then, since he had gallons of peanut oil left over, he started frying everything he could get his hands on. We\u2019re talking scoops of stuffing that he dumped into the oil, scoops of macaroni and cheese, cheese sticks that he had found in the back of the freezer, pieces of sliced turkey that he breaded with Andy\u2019s Hot and Spicy chicken breading (that was actually good, by the way) and whatever else he could get his hands on. Mom drew the line at the green bean casserole and cranberry jelly, much to Dad\u2019s dismay.</p><p>The only good thing that came out of that Thanksgiving was that we now have fry nights where we all chip in and bring over different foods and Mom (Dad gave up) fries everything up and we all stuff ourselves sick. But, back to the not normal part of Thanksgiving last year. Since everyone tried pretty much everything Dad fried (like we had a choice), the evening turned into Night of the Living Flatulence and Bathroom Runs; and Mom and Dad only have one bathroom. People did things that night in the woods at the back of the yard that we don\u2019t speak of. Ever.</p><p>After we got showered and dressed, Luke and I headed downstairs to make sure Brandon was up and ready. I had no idea where he had disappeared to last night, and frankly, I was glad he had been gone. The things that Luke had made me scream...</p><p>Brandon was coming out of his bedroom, fully dressed, bright-eyed, and bushy tailed. Okay, the last one was Doug, who was following Brandon, wagging his whole back end like mad while trying to walk. It made him look like an unsteady, malformed duck. I laughed when he waddled his way over to me and sat on his haunches at my feet, tongue lolling out of his mouth as he cocked his head at me.</p><p>I shook my head at him and grinned at Luke, who was laughing at Doug. \u201cHe wants to come for Thanksgiving dinner, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cOkay. He can come. Mom and Dad won\u2019t mind, especially because they love labs, and the kids will adore him.\u201d I looked back at Doug again. \u201cYou wanna go bye-bye, Doug?\u201d I cooed.</p><p>He jumped up and started prancing around me in wide circles, stopping by the front door with every rotation. Luke handed me his leash to put in my purse and we all headed out to the car. I grabbed the Bourbon Banana Nut Bread that I had made in the slow cooker (yummy) from where I had hidden it in the canned vegetable cabinet. This was the second one that I had made because the guys hadn\u2019t taken me seriously when I told them not to eat it because it was for Thanksgiving. It was gone in less than an hour.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We pulled up at my parents\u2019 house and traipsed into the madness, Doug barking like mad at the kids running crazy through the living room, chasing each other with Nerf dart guns. My brother came around the corner with my sister, Leah, under his arm in a headlock. She had her arms wrapped around his waist, holding on for dear life and was screaming at him to stop. Apparently whatever she had done was bad enough that Noah had her jean clad legs tucked up under each of his arms, helping my brother carry her through the house.</p><p>Luke and Brandon looked at each other for a second before grinning and taking off to see where Calland and Noah were taking Leah. I walked into the kitchen behind them, covering my ears when Leah shrieked as Calland dunked her head into the sink full of dishwater. Noah dropped her legs and Calland stood her up. She looked like a drowned rat with rabies or something. Bubbles dripped down her face and her hair was plastered to her head. Mascara was running down her cheeks in little black rivulets.</p><p>My mom and Jenna were standing side by side at the stove, each stirring something briskly. Without a beat, Mom looked over her shoulder and said, \u201cTold you, you shouldn\u2019t have done that. And you shouldn\u2019t have worn makeup today, raccoon eyes. Go clean up, its almost time to eat.\u201d</p><p>Leah stomped her foot and stormed out, screaming, \u201cFUCKING PENIS RULE!\u201d as she left the room.</p> <p>I glanced at my brother-in-law, figuring I would get the straightest answer out of him. \u201cSo what\u2019d she do, Noah?\u201d</p><p>Not a man of many words, he simply replied, \u201cWhipped cream and water balloons.\u201d</p><p>I nodded at him as if I knew what the hell he was talking about. Because, sadly, I did. When we were younger, Jenna had come up with the idea of filling water balloons with those aerosol cans of whipped cream to get back at Calland for something he and his friends had done. It was messy but so worth it, and really was done in defense. Poor Jenna was in the bath when Calland had taken her favorite bra, wetted it down in the kitchen sink, and then froze it. By the time Jenna got out of the tub and primped herself up, the bra was frozen stiff. We never did understand why she hadn\u2019t just grabbed another bra or thrown that one in the dryer. Instead, she stood in the bathroom screaming at Calland while she used the blow dryer to thaw it out.</p><p>Calland finally stopped laughing enough to take over Noah\u2019s story. Not that Noah was telling the story any longer, but again, he\u2019s a man of few words. Very few.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Calland began, still chuckling. \u201cLeah got the bright idea to surprise me and Noah by hitting us with balloons filled with whipped cream while we were pulling the Christmas tree out of the attic for Mom. Being the ditzoid she is, she didn\u2019t fill them up enough so they just bounced off of us. That\u2019s why she got dunked!\u201d He hooted with laughter again, holding his stomach and wiping tears away as he sputtered about the way Leah had looked after he stuck her head in the sink. Noah was smiling too, but he was more reserved about his glee.</p> <p>I raised my eyebrows and shook my head when Luke and Brandon both slapped high-fives with Calland and Noah, and when Luke caught my eye, he just grinned and shrugged. They disappeared toward the garage with my brother and I heard Brandon asking for details on how to fill the balloons for maximum splattage. Guess I need to watch my back at home from now on.</p><p>I turned to my mom and asked her if she needed my help with anything. She told me to take over stirring the gravy for her before she asked, \u201cEmma? Did I hear a dog barking when you guys came in?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh! I forgot about Doug with everything going on! \u201cUm...well? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind if we brought Doug. He\u2019s Luke\u2019s-\u201d I shut up because it was pointless to talk to her anymore since she\u2019d ran out of the kitchen calling for him.</p><p>Jenna and I looked at each other and shrugged as we heard Mom start cooing to Doug in the living room. Leah came in shaking her head and stood beside us as we heard the click-click-click of Doug\u2019s nails on the wood floors as he followed my Mom back into the kitchen like she was the greatest thing since sliced bread. His goofy doggy grin was plastered across his furry face as he thumped his ass down on the floor as if waiting for something.</p><p>Mom peeked over my shoulder, finally decreeing that the gravy I\u2019d been stirring was done before she shooed us away from the stove. Then we all watched in confusion as she set about filling a small plate with little portions of ham, mashed potatoes and gravy, macaroni and cheese, stuffing, and even a deviled egg. When she was done, we all stared, dumbfounded with eyes wide and mouths gaping, as she plopped herself down on a chair at the kitchen table, pulling the one out beside her and patting it for Doug to hop up on.</p><p>Doug complied, looking every bit the sophisticate as he sat tall and proud on the chair. My mom began feeding him small bites of food from a fork, and Doug, being the perfect polite gentleman, was calmly and gently closing his lips over the fork, his little front teeth lightly scraping the morsels off the tines before chewing, swallowing, and patiently waiting for the next bite.</p> <p>I felt heat at my back an instant before I heard Luke whisper in my ear, \u201cIs your mom feeding my dog from a FORK at the kitchen TABLE? Oh, God. She\u2019s feeding him egg. Is that egg? That\u2019s egg. Oh, shit, he\u2019s staying here tonight. Seriously, he\u2019s not coming home with us because his egg farts are the worst!\u201d</p><p>I giggled, turning my head to look at him and when I did, I noticed that everyone in the family had gathered silently in the kitchen, including my niece and nephew, watching my crazy mother feed a huge yellow lab at the kitchen table like it was an everyday thing.</p><p>The silence finally registered with my mom. Either that or she felt all of our eyes boring into her in disbelief. She looked up and glared at each of us before saying, \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve never seen a dog eat Thanksgiving dinner before? It IS a holiday, you know, and he\u2019s part of the family now, too. I\u2019m just sad that he can\u2019t have the turkey, too, but its bad for dogs. Now all of you, go wash up for dinner, and Calland, you can set the dining room table. Leah, you help. Emma and Jenna, start carrying food into the dining room. Move!\u201d</p><p>We all sprang into action, and so the day went. You\u2019d swear that Doug was one of Mom\u2019s grandchildren, the way she spoiled him and doted on him as well as Hayden and Jarrod. Thanksgiving dinner with everyone crowded around the table went off with only minor hiccups, those mainly being Calland throwing the dinner rolls at everyone instead of passing the basket around, Calland refusing to let me have any mac &amp; cheese until my mom threatened to beat him with a wooden spoon (again), and Calland teaching Hayden how to fling peas across the table at her mom with her spoon. (Sensing a pattern here?)</p><p>After dinner and dessert was done, everything cleaned up, and the leftovers designated (I got ALL of the mac &amp; cheese, bitches! Muahahahaha!), the guys headed into the living room to watch football, the kids took Doug out back to play, and me, my mom, and my sisters all sat in the kitchen playing double solitaire.</p><p>We spent a few pleasant hours just enjoying everyone\u2019s company before we started to disperse. Everyone was giving hugs and kisses and punches (that was Calland, go figure) and grabbing their designated bag of leftovers. I helped my sister and Noah get everything into their car, including a miraculously half-asleep Hayden, and headed back in to get my stuff and say bye to my mom and dad. When I got to the door, Mom was hugging Luke and Brandon and pushing them out towards me. Luke had my coat over his arm and Brandon had my bag of leftovers, but I didn\u2019t see Doug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gave her a quick hug, telling her Happy Thanksgiving and thanking her for a great dinner before I asked about Doug. \u201cUm, Mom? We need to-\u201d</p><p>She pushed me toward Luke with a smile and wave, shouting, \u201cHappy Thanksgiving! Thanks for coming and spending the day with us, come back soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>I shouted to be heard over her. \u201cMom! We need to get Doug! Remember? The dog you fed at the kitchen table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, Emma. Bye now!\u201d With that, she turned and shut the door in our faces.</p> <p>I turned to Luke, a bemused expression on my face and nodded as he sputtered, \u201cDid? Did she just-? She just stole my dog!\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his hand and Brandon\u2019s, pulling them towards the car as I said, \u201cYep. She did. We\u2019ll come get him tomorrow. Let\u2019s go home and watch a movie or something, okay?\u201d We got in and Luke started backing down the drive. \u201cBesides,\u201d I continued, \u201cshe fed him eggs with dinner, remember?\u201d</p><p>Luke nodded his head as he drove away from my parents\u2019 house and Doug, a slow grin spreading across his face and Brandon started laughing. \u201cOh, yes. She did, didn\u2019t she.\u201d</p><p>My phone rang around one in the morning when Luke and I were snuggled up together in bed. When I answered, my mom shouted, \u201cEmma! Come get this dog! Oh, God, he keeps farting and its stinking up the whole house! Seriously! Your poor dad is wearing a clothespin on his nose!\u201d</p><p>I just laughed and simply said, \u201cGoodnight, Mom. Happy Thanksgiving!\u201d before I hung up on her and cuddled back up to Luke.</p> <p>Chapter 17</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Floyd Grim\u2019s office, how can I help you?\u201d It was the Monday after Thanksgiving and everything was back to normal. Well, as normal as could be with the wacky people in my life.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart. Did you have a good Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>That weird raspy voiced creepy guy was calling me again! \u201cCan I help you, sir?\u201d I asked, hesitantly. Although I had told him about the weird hang up calls and the other calls Creepy had made to the office, Floyd wasn\u2019t in the office with me at that moment. He was down in Domestic Relations Court on a custody case that was scheduled for a half-day trial, which meant he wouldn\u2019t be back in the office until around noon, unless they settled early. Given the case that it was, I had no hopes of that happening.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to check on my beautiful girl and to wish her a Happy Thanksgiving. Did you get the rose I left for you last Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God. He had been to my work? That was him? I tried to keep my voice calm as I asked again, \u201cSir, is there something I can help you with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me, Emma. I asked you a question. Did you get my rose?\u201d His voice began to rise, still retaining its raspy quality, and becoming even more creepy, if that was possible.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not sure what you are talking about, sir. Now, if-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO! You lie, Emma. You lie and you got my rose because I saw you get it. I saw the way you smiled when you held it up to your nose and smelled it. It smelled beautiful, just like you. Why did you lie to me, Emma? Why?\u201d His voice was plaintive, almost whiny now.</p><p>I took a deep breath, panicking as his words began to sink in. He\u2019d seen me pick up the rose? He was watching me? Oh, shit... \u201cSir, if there\u2019s nothing I can help you with or you aren\u2019t calling for an appointment, I must insist that you not call here anymore.\u201d I couldn\u2019t mask the shakiness of my voice, and I prayed that he wouldn\u2019t pick up on it, wouldn\u2019t know how much he was affecting me.</p><p>I replaced the phone onto its cradle, trying to make myself believe that the man wasn\u2019t shrieking in rage when I\u2019d done so. The phone rang again immediately after I lifted my hand from it and I jumped, jerking my hand back and letting out a shriek. I didn\u2019t want to answer it, but I had no choice.</p><p>\u201cHel-hello? Floyd Grim\u2019s office?\u201d I stuttered into the phone.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>Allie\u2019s voice rang through the line and I shuddered in relief. \u201cAllie! Oh, thank God!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, sweetie? What happened?\u201d she asked, her voice rising with concern.</p><p>I explained quickly about the phone call I\u2019d just received and she hung up as soon as I was done, telling me she\u2019d be at the office in minute before she clicked off the phone. When she got there (she must have broken land speed records getting there) I was still shaken. I picked up the phone at her urging and called the police to make a report. They weren\u2019t very helpful, the officer on duty only reluctantly taking a report down to have on file and gave me the report number quickly before hanging up on me.</p><p>I turned to Allie, shaking my head in disbelief and rage.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now? They took the report, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he didn\u2019t want to. He just kept telling me that there\u2019s really nothing that they can do because he didn\u2019t threaten me and hasn\u2019t caused me harm in any way. I explained that he\u2019d been calling repeatedly, but he said the same thing basically. I have no number that shows up on the Caller ID to prove that all the hang ups were him and blah blah blah...grr!\u201d I threw my hands up.</p><p>Allie stayed with me, saying that she had had her mom go take over at her store so she could be there with me. When Floyd came in the office, looking tired but satisfied (he won his case), I filled him in. He was concerned and told me that he\u2019d be getting me some sort of recording device for my phone system.</p><p>The next morning, he\u2019d left a box sitting on my desk and I hooked everything up, impressed by the gadget that allowed me to record my phone conversations by pressing a little button on the little box that I attached to the hands free/headset outlet on the phone. It made me feel a little more secure having that option, but I didn\u2019t get any more calls for the rest of the week.</p><p>On Friday night, I had Luke swing me by my house to check on it. I\u2019d finally moved out everything that I wanted and told Leah that she could live there as long as she had the utilities switched over into her name and made the mortgage payments on time. She\u2019d been pretty good about it so far, and for being such a ditz, she really was responsible.</p><p>I grabbed the few pieces of mail that hadn\u2019t been forwarded to Luke\u2019s house and we headed home. I thumbed through the mail, most of it junk, as Luke drove us home. One of the envelopes was plain white with my name typed on it, no address, and no return address. I felt a chill skitter down my spine as I turned it over in my hands a couple times before I took a deep breath and opened it. My breath whooshed out on a sigh of relief when I pulled out a brightly colored piece of paper with birthday party information printed on it for an old friend of mine and Allie\u2019s son\u2019s third birthday.</p><p>Shaking my head at myself, I tossed all the mail into my purse and reached over to grab Luke\u2019s hand. When we got home, Brandon and Allie were sitting on the couch with Doug laying at their feet and Jackson was in the kitchen making microwave popcorn.</p><p>I grinned at Jackson before trotting over and giving him a hug. \u201cHey! When did you get back? Did you have a good Thanksgiving?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>Luke walked over and did the one-armed-macho-man-hug thing with Jackson while he replied to my questions. \u201cI got in about an hour ago and yeah, it was okay. Not as fun as yours sounded, though!\u201d</p><p>I grinned at him and we spent the rest of the evening trading stories and watching movies. I curled up with Luke in the oversized armchair and Allie sat between Brandon and Jackson. I could have sworn there was a few times that I saw Allie slap hands away from her. I\u2019m not sure whose hands they were, but judging by the red creeping over Allie\u2019s cheeks, she wasn\u2019t totally against them touching her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked at the clock, surprised to see that it was almost two in the morning, stretched and climbed off of Luke. He stared up at me, asking if I was ready for bed. I nodded and we said our goodnights before heading up the stairs. I turned to look at Allie and winked, then waggled my brows at her. She glared at me, well, tried to anyway, but her lips twitched and she winked back.</p><p>We got up early the next morning and I went over to Jenna\u2019s house for a while since Luke had a couple things to do at the stop. When I got there, Noah and Jarrod had gone out for a \u201cmen\u2019s day\u201d and Hayden was begging Jenna to have a \u201cgrill\u2019s day\u201d and let her give her a makeover. Seeing the potential for mega laughs at my sister\u2019s expense, I joined in with Hayden\u2019s cajoling and we cracked Jenna in about five minutes.</p><p>We headed upstairs to Jenna\u2019s en suite and plopped her down at the stool in front of her vanity. I played assistant to Hayden, handing her items, but I drew the line at the curling iron. No way was I getting blamed for burn marks across the forehead! Hayden used her little hands to basically tie Jenna\u2019s hair in knots all over her head, and then proceeded to make Jenna look like a whorish clown with makeup. She ended up with hot pink lipstick (who even uses that these days anyway?) surrounding her entire mouth, including her lips and teeth, lime green eyeshadow (Jenna and I seriously needed to talk about her makeup bag) smeared across her eyelids and high into her eyebrows, and red stripes of blush decorating her cheeks.</p><p>Hayden picked up Jenna\u2019s eyeliner and pointed it toward her mother\u2019s face. Jenna squeezed her eyes shut, bravely allowing her to attempt to put it on. I snickered behind my hand, earning me a glare from Jenna, when Hayden colored over her mom\u2019s eyes, then her forehead, like she was using a crayon.</p> <p>She stood back with a flourish and nodded at her mom like she was an artist acknowledging her latest masterpiece. I grabbed my cell phone out of my pocket and snapped a few quick pics, trying not to laugh out loud at Jenna\u2019s face when she looked in the mirror. I had to leave the room when Jenna struggled to tell Hayden that she made her mommy look very pretty but it was too fancy to wear around the house. She finally got the okay to wash her face off and Hayden and I went downstairs while Jenna cleaned herself up.</p><p>\u201cAun\u2019 Emmy?\u201d Hayden piped up in her little voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby doll?\u201d I asked her, giving her a quick squeeze as she cuddled into my side on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhas\u2019 a gorgamsm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d I asked her, not understanding what she said.</p> <p>\u201cA gorgamsm. I heared Mommy talkin\u2019 bout it on the \u2018pone. Whas\u2019 is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not sure, honey. What did Mommy say about it on the phone?\u201d I asked, kinda scared about the answer I would get.</p><p>\u201cHers said it was sumfing that my Daddy gived her an\u2019 it was \u2018mazin\u2019 an\u2019 made her toes curled up. If I have a gorgamsm will my toes curled up, too?\u201d</p><p>I choked, completely at a loss as to what to tell her, but thankfully Jenna came down the stairs then. I quickly jumped up and told Hayden that she should ask her mother about that one before I kissed her cheek, patted Jenna\u2019s arm as I ran past, and bolted out the door.</p><p>I headed downtown to Skin Deep, intending to surprise Luke. He was supposed to call me when he was done and on his way back home and I would meet him there, but I figured, what the hell? Maybe we could leave together if he got done before Brandon and I would just let him use my car to get home in.</p><p>I parked the car and headed inside. There was a young couple waiting in the lobby and I smiled at them as I walked past the counter and headed toward Luke\u2019s studio. I froze in the open doorway as I surveyed the scene before me.</p> <p>A colorfully tattooed and artfully pierced woman was leaning into Luke\u2019s chest, her arms wrapped around his neck, and Luke\u2019s hands were on her hips. She was a couple inches taller than me, her arms sleeved in bright colors, her eyebrow, lip, and nose pierced, and she was built like a wet dream. (Well, what I imagined would make a man have a wet dream...what? Its better than a brick shithouse!) She had long black hair, deep brown eyes, and she was gorgeous, exotic looking, and putting her lips on Luke!</p><p>My stomach flipped and my heart thudded painfully in my chest as I spun on my heel and raced for the front of the shop. I ran into Brandon as he was coming out from behind the counter and he grabbed my shoulders, frantically asking me what was wrong. I hadn\u2019t realized I was crying until he asked me why I was, but I didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I wrenched myself away from him, running flat out for the door as I heard Luke shout my name behind me. I threw myself into my car and tore out of the lot, trying to force myself to not look back, but I didn\u2019t listen. I saw Luke run out into the street behind me in my rearview mirror, watching as he threw his arms up in the air and then hung his head before I jerked my eyes away from the mirror to try to concentrate on the road.</p><p>My cell phone began to ring in my purse on the seat beside me and I ignored it. Without realizing it, I found myself in the parking lot of Allie\u2019s shop. I wiped the tears away as best I could and walked inside.</p><p>I waved and shook my head at the girl ringing someone out at the counter when she stared at me in concern, opening her mouth to say something. I found Allie in her office going through some boxes that someone had apparently brought in as a donation. She looked up at me in surprise, a smile beginning and quickly fading from her face as she took in my appearance.</p><p>I\u2019m not a pretty crier, never have been. Women in movies cry pretty, their faces don\u2019t get red, their noses don\u2019t run...why can\u2019t it be like that in real life? When I cry, my eyes swell and become bloodshot and demon red, my face turns splotchy, and my nose runs like a faucet. I can\u2019t hide it when I\u2019ve been upset.</p><p>Without a word, Allie dropped what she was holding in her hands, walked over to me, and enfolded me in her arms, rocking me slightly from side to side. I buried my face in her shoulder, letting the tears fall uncontrollably for a few minutes before they subsided into hiccupping little sobs.</p><p>She pulled back from me, wiping my tears away with her thumbs before asking, \u201cWhat happened, sugarbear? Tell Auntie Allie...\u201d</p> <p>I gave her the short version of the story and without a beat she went out front and shut her store down for the day. I followed her to her house, still blinking away the tears, and ignoring my phone that had been ringing nonstop.</p><p>Allie and I sat curled up on the couch together with huge portions of our special sundaes in our hands. She shook her head at me as if trying to understand and began asking questions again.</p><p>\u201cSo you walked in and saw her kiss Luke?\u201d</p><p>I nodded pathetically, taking a big bite of ice cream and wine cooler even though I felt like getting sick. \u201cShe had her arms all around his neck and everything and his hands were on her hips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, maybe it wasn\u2019t what it looked like?\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>I shook my head and glared at her. \u201cNo, it was exactly what it looked like! I trusted him, Allie! I let him get under my skin after I even told him I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea. I...I told him I loved him, Allie. He told me that he was different, that he wanted me, that I was his. But I\u2019m stupid. I knew better! I knew that I\u2019d end up getting hurt. He\u2019s just like Douche Bag Brad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say when you told him you loved him?\u201d Allie asked me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe said, \u2018I know\u2019, that ass! I opened myself up and that\u2019s all he said! Cryptic caveman douche bag asshole...\u201d I muttered.</p><p>I sat my bowl down on her coffee table, leaving the remains of my ice cream to melt. I leaned back and closed my eyes, opening them again immediately when all I saw was Luke and that bitch standing together. I glanced at my phone, wondering if I should turn it on again, but deciding that I wasn\u2019t going to. If my family needed me, they would know exactly how to find me.</p><p>Allie patted my hand and got up to take our bowls into the kitchen. I heard her phone ring and heard her answer it, speaking softly to someone on the other line. I pushed myself up off the couch to go to the bathroom to blow my nose and wipe my face, but I froze when I passed the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNo, Brandon, don\u2019t tell him she\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>I waited to see what else she would say, wishing I could hear Brandon\u2019s side of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t want to talk to him or see him right now. And I don\u2019t blame her! How could he do-\u201d she cut off in mid-sentence.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. You aren\u2019t going to tell me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Well...I don\u2019t know. You know what\u2019s going on, you know him better than me. If you say it wasn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>She was driving me nuts allowing him to speak over her. I really wanted to hear what she\u2019d been getting ready to say!</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll try. I can\u2019t make any promises, but I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, bye.\u201d</p><p>I hurried toward the bathroom before Allie could turn and see me eavesdropping on her conversation. I heard her call my name and hollered back at her. She stood behind me in the doorway of the bathroom and I looked at her in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cEmma...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Allie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that you don\u2019t want to talk to him? Just see what he has to say?\u201d Allie was pleading with me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. Why would I want to put myself through that, Allie? Who\u2019s side are you on anyway?\u201d I knew she was on mine but Brandon must have told her something in order for her to be trying so hard to get me to talk to Luke.</p><p>\u201cYours, Emma! But I think you should talk to him! Give him a chance to explain some things to you, that what you saw wasn\u2019t what you thought it was!\u201d She slapped her hand over her mouth with a gasp and I narrowed my eyes at her in the mirror.</p><p>I turned around to face her, and asked, \u201cHave you been talking to him? I know you talked to Brandon because I heard you. Is he putting you up to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...well, not really. He asked me to talk to you to try to get you to listen to Luke. Emma, he explained everything to me and there\u2019s no way you saw what you thought you saw. If you don\u2019t want to talk to Luke, at least talk to Brandon, okay?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and nodded, opening them and grabbing her arm before she could escape. \u201cBrandon! I\u2019ll talk to Brandon, but not Luke. I mean it, Allie.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and pulled away from me, already digging her phone out of her pocket. About fifteen minutes later, there was a knock on Allie\u2019s front door and Brandon came in when she opened it. He strode immediately to my side talking a mile a minute.</p><p>\u201cEmma, I didn\u2019t bring him here, he followed me. Please don\u2019t be mad at me! I didn\u2019t even know he had run out of the shop into his car until I pulled up here and he pulled up, too. I got him to stop outside and let me come in and talk to you first, but I don\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma!\u201d Luke interrupted Brandon, yelling my name as he flung open Allie\u2019s door and strode in like he owned the place. \u201cEmma, sugar, please talk to me!\u201d</p> <p>He came and knelt in front of where I was sitting on the couch. I sat back away from him and pulled my hand away as he tried to grab it in his.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I don\u2019t have anything to say to you. I saw enough for myself, thank you.\u201d My voice was icy but it was taking everything I had in me not to break down and cry at the sight of him there in front of me. Damn him for being so fucking gorgeous!</p><p>\u201cEmma, it wasn\u2019t what you thought it was. I promise, baby. Jadalee is a girl that Brandon and I have known for a long time. She works for me sometimes when she\u2019s in town, which isn\u2019t that often because she moved down to Miami to open her own shop. She\u2019s back just for a bit while her mom is having surgery.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice was soft, cajoling.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t excuse the fact, or tell me why, you were standing there with your hands on her, her hands on you, and her lips on yours, Luke! Seriously! How stupid do you think I am? I\u2019ve been through this before with Douche Bag and you knew that! I refuse to let that happen to myself again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, it wasn\u2019t what you thought it was, even though I wish it was,\u201d a snarky voice said from the doorway.</p><p>Every eye in the room flew to the front door where the dark haired bitch was standing, leaning nonchalantly against the jamb like she belonged there. I let out a gasp and watched as a million things happened at once.</p><p>Allie\u2019s faced darkened with rage and she took a step toward the front door; Brandon jumped to intercept her. Luke sprang to his feet, his mouth opening and closing like a fish, and I sat there in stunned silence, wondering what the hell I\u2019d done to deserve this.</p><p>Jadalee pulled away from the door frame and wandered over to the couch where she plopped herself down by my side. I glared at her before transferring it to Luke, who had fallen to his knees in front of me again.</p><p>He gently took my hands in his before saying softly, \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to see her, and I really was not intending on her walking in here like she owned the place,\u201d his voice hardened and he glared at Jadalee before continuing, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and she\u2019ll tell you that. Brandon can tell you, too.\u201d</p><p>Jadalee rolled her eyes and said, \u201cHe really didn\u2019t do anything. In fact, if you\u2019d stuck around long enough, you would have seen that his hands were pushing me off of him. I had just come in and had given him a hug. Yeah, so I tried to kiss him, but so what? We\u2019ve done way more than that before-\u201d she broke off at Luke\u2019s growl, shooting him a cheeky smile.</p><p>Luke started talking before she could dig herself, and him, deeper. \u201cYes, before you ask, we had done things in the past, but that\u2019s what it is, Emma. The past. One I told her implicitly would not be happening. Ever. Again. Because I am so completely and totally in love with my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>I felt the tears brimming in my eyes spill over and beginning running down my cheeks and he reached up to wipe them away. \u201cEmma, I love you. Haven\u2019t you figured that out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you sure have a funny way of showing it, asshole,\u201d I muttered, pushing his hands away from my face and wiping my eyes with my sleeves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you, sugar. Forgive me? Please?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes against the pleading, yet hopeful look in his, and whispered, \u201cI love you, Luke. But I just need to think for a minute, okay?\u201d I opened my eyes and looked at him, watching as his face brightened for a brief second before it fell.</p><p>He nodded once, sharply, before standing up and, inclining his head to Allie and Brandon, stalked out the front door. I heard his car start and then the squeal of tires as he peeled away from the curb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, as entertaining as this has all been, Brandon? Could you give me a ride back to the shop? I seem to have been stranded in enemy territory,\u201d Jadalee drawled, lithely getting to her feet and walking to the door.</p><p>\u201cJadalee, if you wouldn\u2019t be such a bitch all the time, then maybe you wouldn\u2019t end up in enemy territory so much.\u201d Brandon\u2019s voice cut sharply through the tense silence hanging heavy in the room.</p><p>My eyes widened and then narrowed dangerously at her as she turned to me and began speaking.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, you\u2019re stupid if you let this come between you two. Nothing happened in the shop, he pushed me away. And in the ten or so years that I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s never called any girl his girlfriend, nor said I love you to anyone but Brandon. I\u2019d get your head out of your ass if I were you, but keep this in mind. You fuck things up with him? I\u2019ll be standing right behind you waiting to pick up the pieces, enjoying every minute of him being back in my bed, in my body.\u201d</p> <p>With that, she turned to leave again but my words stopped her causing her to whirl and step back, every one of them coated in ice and dripping with contempt and truth. \u201cIf you think for one second that you will EVER get your slutty, whorish hands on him again, you are sadly mistaken.\u201d I stood, walking slowly toward her, satisfaction coursing through me when she took a nervous step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not controlling and selfish, so I won\u2019t say that there\u2019s no room in his life for you, because IF you\u2019ve been a FRIEND to him for so long, then it\u2019s not my place to tell you to fuck off. That\u2019s his choice, and frankly, I\u2019d be concerned right now if I were you. But what I will tell you is this: I\u2019m drawing the line, here and now. You so much as drop an eyelash over it and You. Will. Regret. It. Luke\u2019s mine.\u201d I smiled sweetly at her and raised my hand, wiggling my fingers at her and finishing with, \u201cBuh-bye, now! Have a nice day!\u201d before I turned my back on her and walked into the kitchen.</p><p>I heard Brandon murmuring something to Allie and then the soft click of the door as it closed behind them. I stood where I was, breathing deeply and trying to calm my shaking nerves. I jumped when Allie grabbed me from behind, jumping up and down and shrieking in my ear.</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOD, Emma! You are friggin\u2019 awesome! She\u2019s a bitch but you just out-bitched her! I mean, capital B-I-T-C-H and don\u2019t you forget it! I\u2019ve never seen you like that before...well, okay, maybe once or twice when some idiot got on your nerves, but not like that! God, I love you...can I have your baby?\u201d</p><p>I laughed and wrapped my arms around her, hugging her close for a second. \u201cAllie, I love you, too, and yes, you can have my baby. Save me the pain, anyway. Thank you, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled back from me, asking, \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor just being you and being my bestest friend in the whole wide world,\u201d I told her, grinning.</p><p>I had Allie drop me back off to my car in the parking lot of her shop, promising that I would call her later, once I\u2019d talked to Luke. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and powered it on, ruefully noting that I had ten voice mails, twenty-seven missed calls, and two dozen or so text messages. Most of them were from Luke, but a couple were my sisters, my mom, my brother, and even Brandon.</p><p>Ignoring all the messages, I called Brandon, who picked up immediately. Wasting no time on pleasantries, I asked, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d was all he said before I hung up on him.</p><p>I headed home.</p> <p>Chapter 18</p><p>I pulled into the drive and parked, but didn\u2019t get out right away. Leaning my forehead against the steering wheel, I braced myself before I blew out a breath and headed inside.</p><p>I opened the door and went in, looking for Luke. I caught a glimpse of his dark hair out the kitchen window on the deck, so I quietly slipped out the door behind him. My heart clutched when I saw him, sitting there dejectedly with his head in his hands, elbows braced on his knees. I walked around the front of him, sinking to my knees and gently raising his face to mine.</p><p>\u201cLuke.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and mine started to fill with tears at the raw pain etched across his face. \u201cBaby, I trust you and I believe that nothing happened with Saw. I know I told you I needed time to think, but I know there\u2019s nothing to think about. I love you, Luke. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened, revealing the intense, gorgeous smoky blue-grey depths that I\u2019d fallen for, and he smiled briefly before asking, \u201cSaw?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to contain my smile when I said, \u201cYou know, Skank-Ass-Whore. Saw. That\u2019s my nickname for-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, Emma.\u201d He gave me another small smile before his face fell again and he reached up, skimming his thumb down my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sugar. I really was pushing her away. She just caught me off guard after I gave her a hug, and then she just reached up and planted a kiss on me...I was excited to see her. I hadn\u2019t seen her in about a year, and I wanted to tell her about you, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShhh, its okay, Luke. Like I said, I trust you. And, um...don\u2019t be mad, but I kinda told her that she\u2019d regret it if she ever touched you again, and also kinda sorta hinted that you\u2019d be mad at her and tell her to fuck off.\u201d I winced as soon as the words left my mouth, rushing to continue. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t be friends with her or whatever, I mean, you totally can be friends with whoever you want to be friends with, but I can\u2019t help it if she touches you again and I have to jump on her back and thump her forehead into the concrete about a half million times before she gets the message, but you know what I mean, right? I\u2019m not-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d Luke said, his voice low and soft.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I asked, half afraid of what he was going to say.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d That\u2019s what I said, but it\u2019s not what I did. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to take away your friendship with her, Luke. She\u2019s been in your life a lot longer than I have. As long as she respects the boundaries, then everything should be fine. I...um...also told her you were mine.\u201d</p><p>I looked into his eyes, smiling tentatively at him while he blinked down at me.</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d he asked, the beginnings of a smile playing around the edges of his lips.</p><p>I nodded slowly at him while he brought his hands up to cup my face. \u201cEmma, I think you\u2019re too good for me,\u201d he said roughly, continuing over my protest, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to try to live up to you. I\u2019m so sorry, baby. I think I went a little crazy when I heard you make that little choking sound and then you ran away from me...you wouldn\u2019t answer your phone, wouldn\u2019t talk to me, and all I kept thinking was that I\u2019d fucked up one of the only good things I\u2019ve ever had in my life. God, I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d</p><p>I brought my hands up to touch his face, pulling it close to mine and laying my lips softly on his. He groaned deep in his throat before crushing me to him, sweeping his tongue between my lips and devouring me like he was starving for my taste. He gathered me up in his arms, pulling me off my knees and into his lap without breaking the kiss, his hands roaming every inch of my back, thighs, and ass, setting me on fire just as much as letting me feel his reassurance that he was there with me, for me.</p><p>I pushed against his chest with my hands, breaking the kiss to catch my breath for a moment. He caught my eyes and I melted when he whispered, \u201cI love you, Emma.\u201d I leaned my forehead against his, completely in awe with the fact that he\u2019d finally said it, that this was real. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I whispered back, kissing him again. I shook my head at him and gave him a small smile. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you waited until we were fighting to tell me you love me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders sheepishly, saying softly, \u201c I was waiting for you to realize it on your own. I shouldn\u2019t have, though. I should have just told you.\u201d He closed his eyes and sighed, holding me even closer to him.</p><p>We didn\u2019t sit there in silence for too long before Luke pulled me into the house and started stripping my clothes off of me before we\u2019d barely cleared the door. In fact, we didn\u2019t make it out of the kitchen before he lifted me up, sat me on the counter, and was buried balls deep in my dripping wetness. I wrapped my legs around his thighs, holding on for dear life as he pounded into me, over and over before we both exploded, the waves of release crashing over us, wrenching us under and drowning us in earth-shattering pleasure.</p><p>We stood there wrapped in each other, trying to catch our breath when the front door opened, admitting Brandon and Jackson who froze in their tracks, their eyes wide with shock.</p> <p>Of course, that didn\u2019t last long. \u201cJesus H., man! I eat on that counter!\u201d Brandon wailed, but there was no mistaking the look of relief in his eyes that belied the pained expression on his face.</p><p>Jackson just winked, a secretive smile playing about his lips before he grabbed Brandon and walked backwards out the door. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna give you a minute to get your clothes. Just holler when its clear.\u201d He shut the door softly behind them.</p><p>Luke and I looked at each other and busted out laughing before he kissed me gently and pulled out of me, helping me down off the counter so we could grab our clothes. Once we were dressed again, he strode to the door, opening it wide and laughing when Brandon stumbled, almost falling, from leaning on the door trying to eavesdrop.</p><p>We spent the rest of the evening hanging out with Brandon, Jackson, and Allie, who showed up about twenty minutes after the guys did. I called my mom and my sisters to see what they had wanted, and was surprised when they said that Luke had been by all three of their houses to see if I was there. What shocked me even more was the fact that Luke had never been to Jenna\u2019s house, so how the hell had he known where to go? I called Calland, as well. Luke hadn\u2019t gotten to him; he was just wanting to know if he could borrow my house for a party. Shaking my head I told him no, and told him not to even bother calling Leah because I would be letting her know that I said no, too, to which he replied by calling me a selfish bitch and hanging up on me.</p><p>Luke wasn\u2019t far from my side for the rest of the weekend, and I wasn\u2019t complaining. I was almost sorry that I had to go back to work and wouldn\u2019t be able to see him until that evening. Christmas was right around the corner and I was hoping that the time would go by quickly because Floyd always gave me the week off between Christmas and New Years. I know, kick ass boss!</p> <p>I was finishing setting up a conference with a client when my other line rang. I answered the phone, pleasantly surprised to hear Luke\u2019s warm voice come through the line.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. Just wanted to call and tell you that I love you. Busy?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYeah, a little busy, but I\u2019m always glad to hear your voice. I love you, too, by the way.\u201d My other line rang and I quickly got off the phone with Luke before answering.</p><p>After giving my usual greeting, I listened to the silence stretching out on the line. \u201cHello? Anyone there? Floyd Grim\u2019s office...can I help you?\u201d I shrugged my shoulders, but before I could replace the phone on the cradle, a low, gravelly laugh came through. From reflex, I jerked it back up to my ear, again saying hello.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Emma, I had high hopes for you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, it was Creepy. I reached up and clicked on the recorder that Floyd had gotten me; this was the first time I\u2019d had to use it. I remained silent, not wanting to say anything, and really not wanting to stay on the phone with him, but I was hoping he would keep talking and give me some kind of clue as to who he was or why he kept calling me.</p> <p>The voice chuckled before continuing. \u201cTurns out I was wrong. You\u2019re just like all the others. All the other whores and tramps who say one thing and then do the other. Did you enjoy fucking him this weekend? Huh? Did ya?\u201d</p><p>My breath was coming in pants, and my hands were shaking. The little bell on the door chimed as Floyd walked in, and when he saw my pale face and my white-knuckled grip on the phone, he dropped the files in his hands and rushed around the counter to yank the phone out of my hand.</p><p>\u201cThis is Floyd Grim, and I suggest you find another attorney to call. Do not call my secretary again.\u201d He slammed the phone down and turned to me, patting my back and asking if I was okay.</p><p>I nodded and he glanced at me worriedly before scooping up his files and taking them back to his office.</p><p>The rest of the day passed without incident until I slipped and mentioned it at dinner that night.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the fuck are you talking about, Emma?\u201d Luke yelled.</p><p>\u201cYou should have said something earlier, babe,\u201d Jackson interjected.</p><p>I turned my eyes to Brandon, asking silently for him to help me. He glared at me before turning away, refusing to look at me.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve never had a problem like this before, and it\u2019s not been an issue until a couple weeks ago when he called and told me about the...\u201d I broke off, realizing that Luke\u2019s face was blood red and all three of them looked ready to blow.</p><p>I winced when Luke growled at me, \u201cTold you about the what, Emma? How long? Tell me how long this has been going on, that you decided wasn\u2019t important enough to mention. How long!\u201d he bellowed the last words and I flinched, jerking back in my chair.</p><p>I blinked up at him, not afraid of him, but more afraid of what he would say. I swallowed audibly, and sent Jackson a grateful glance when he put his hand on my knee, squeezing gently in reassurance. \u201cA while, I guess,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI was getting hang up calls a lot, and I thought I had mentioned those to you. Anyway, he...he called a couple weeks ago and told me that the rose I found on my car was from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking hell!\u201d Luke exploded, shoving away from the table and slamming outside.</p><p>I started to follow him but stopped when Jackson put his hand back on me to keep me still. He nodded to Brandon who stood and went after Luke. As he passed my chair, he hesitated and lightly touched my shoulder before going out the door.</p><p>I looked over at Jackson with tears brimming in my eyes. \u201cJacks...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, babe. But he loves you and you just told him basically that someone is threatening you. He\u2019s not going to take that lightly. None of us are. We all love you, Emma.\u201d He raised his hand when my eyes widened and continued, \u201cIn different ways. You know that, babe. Sure we did...what we did, but we all know that was a one time thing. Luke and I made that deal years ago. Brandon looks at you like the sister he\u2019s never had, and you definitely dealt us a blow tonight. Don\u2019t keep stuff like that from us. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wiping my eyes and turning to see Luke and Brandon walk back through the door. Without a word, Luke came over to me, jerked me out of my chair and into his arms, and held me so tightly I couldn\u2019t breath. I patted his shoulder awkwardly and he loosened his grip, moving back to look me in the face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hide stuff from me, Emma. I love you so much, the thought of something happening to you, or even just scaring you...it drives me insane. Okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Luke. I\u2019ll tell you everything, I promise, and won\u2019t keep anything from you. You do have to understand that I never really was keeping this from you. I just didn\u2019t think to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and let me go. We all sat back down at the table and I told them everything, every detail about the phone calls and the recorder device that my boss had gotten me. We talked a bit longer and then headed to bed. Luke held me and made love to me like I would break, until I finally rolled him over and started riding him, plunging myself down onto his hardness over and over again until he gripped my hips and began thrusting up to meet my hips.</p><p>I arched myself back over him, leaning back and bracing my hands on his thighs behind me. My hair brushed his knees and calves and I heard him groan and growl at the dual sensations. I looked down the line of my body to that place where we joined and watched him disappear into me again and again before letting my eyes find his face. I felt my inner muscles clench around him when I noticed his hot gaze locked on that spot, lost in the sight of his hard, thick length impaling the soft, bare, pink folds of my sex.</p><p>I shifted my weight a bit, bringing one of my hands around and sliding it down my body until my fingers dipped into my cleft, finding and circling my clit. The sight of my fingers playing there made Luke wild and he let loose a yell as he slammed into me, spasming inside me over and over again as the combination of his release and my fingers brought me, making him jerk and twitch as my muscles clamped around him, milking his hard flesh.</p> <p>I collapsed forward onto his chest and his arms came around me, holding me tightly to him as he murmured into my hair, \u201cI love you, Emma.\u201d</p><p>I nuzzled his throat and whispered back, \u201cI love you, too, Lucas.\u201d His chest rumbled beneath me as he chuckled at the use of his given name.</p><p>Luke shifted and rolled until we were on our sides, facing each other, our legs tangled together, and the waning hardness of him still buried deep inside me. He kissed my lips gently and we drifted off to sleep.</p><p>I woke up the next morning with the alarm, surprised to see that neither of us had moved in the night. Even more surprising, Luke\u2019s then not-so-hard length was still inside me, but was rapidly becoming his oh-so-very-hard length. I looked at Luke\u2019s face, seeing his gorgeous eyes blink sleepily open and a grin spread across his face.</p><p>I rushed in to work twenty minutes late to see Floyd standing over my desk with a worried expression on his face.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Floyd! I got held up a little this morning.\u201d I smiled at him, hoping he wouldn\u2019t be mad for me being late.</p><p>He smiled and shook his head at me, telling me it was fine before it was business as usual. I had just a week to go before I got to take off for Christmas break, but we had a lot to get done before then. The phones were ringing off the hook and poor Floyd was booked solid with court appearances and client meetings.</p><p>Two hours shy of closing time, the phone rang and I smiled when I heard Mrs. Allen\u2019s crackly voice on the other end.</p><p>\u201cEmma? Honey, is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Allen, how are you? I haven\u2019t heard from you in a while, so I assume everything has been going well? How\u2019s Fluffers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I\u2019ve been okay until now. Fluffers went missing again, but that stupid old fart Doc brought him back to me. Do you know what he did, Emma? He SHAVED poor Fluffers! And I think he bleached him or something cause he\u2019s not grey anymore, he\u2019s WHITE! He doesn\u2019t even look like my cat anymore, but its him. Do I need to bring him out to you so you can see him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr, um...no, Mrs. Allen, that wont be necessary.\u201d She continued before I could say another word.</p><p>\u201cI can take pictures and bring them to you, dear, that way you have the evidence when you get that lovely Mr. Grim to sue the ever loving pants off Doc, that no good bastard. Fluffers just had a couple burrs in his coat that I was fixin\u2019 to get out. There was no need to torture the poor boy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Allen, if he had burrs in his fur, then Doc was doing a good thing by shaving Fluffers. That way he doesn\u2019t get matted worse, and besides, I thought Fluffers was a white cat? You can\u2019t sue him for those things, since he was helping you. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay, dear. If you\u2019re sure...\u201d Mrs. Allen sounded doubtful, but I didn\u2019t give her time to come up with anything else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, Mrs. Allen. You have a nice day and a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year if I don\u2019t talk to you before then, okay? Bye-bye!\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I hung up the phone and turned back to the trial brief I was typing. About thirty minutes before closing time, Jackson walked into the office, stopping at the counter in front of me.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d he said, smiling down at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jacks! What are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke\u2019s got a late appointment again and didn\u2019t want you walking out by yourself. So I said I\u2019d pick you up. Plus, I need your opinion on something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I just have to finish up a couple things and then we can go.\u201d I turned back to my computer and finished up in record time. I hopped up and grabbed my coat and purse and we walked outside. He grabbed my keys out of my hand and locked the door behind us before herding me into his car.</p><p>Instead of going to Skin Deep like I figured we would, we headed home. When we got inside, he motioned to the kitchen table and I went and sat down, waiting patiently for him to join me. He pulled something out of a tube he had leaned up against the corner of the living room and spread it out over the table.</p><p>I gasped when I looked over the blueprint he had laid out, my eyes racing over every detail. \u201cIs this for your house that you\u2019re building next door?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just had a couple things I wanted a woman\u2019s perspective on.\u201d</p><p>I teased him a bit, winking and asking, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be asking Allie then?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me and said, \u201cShe\u2019ll get to voice her opinion eventually, especially if she\u2019s gonna live there one day.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows at him, asking silently for more information. After a minute he complied.</p><p>\u201cWell, I know we talked before about Allie, but I just...I really like her, Emma. But there\u2019s Brandon and I don\u2019t know exactly where he fits in with everything.\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI think things will work themselves out. Just be patient, Jacks. So! What did you want my opinion on?\u201d I rubbed my hands together in glee, excited to be able to get to help actually design a house that was going to be built.</p><p>We sat there for a while, throwing ideas back and forth, and at one point during a slightly heated conversation, he had come up behind me at the table, leaning over my shoulder and pointing at the blueprints. We both looked up at the door when it opened and Luke and Brandon walked in. I smiled at them, and Luke quirked his brow at Jackson leaning over me, his hand braced on my shoulder. I glanced up at Jackson and laughed when he waggled his brows at Luke before patting my shoulder and moving back so I could get up.</p><p>I went to Luke, raising my lips for his kiss as he smiled and said, \u201cJacks, you ass! You tryin\u2019 to get fresh with my woman?\u201d</p><p>I laughed even harder when Jackson replied, \u201cHell yeah, I am! She\u2019s too good for you, needs someone macho like me!\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at their banter and reached around to snatch the pizza boxes out of Brandon\u2019s hands that I hadn\u2019t noticed until now. He\u2019d been trying to maneuver around Luke and sneak away with dinner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d he whined. \u201cThat\u2019s my dinner!\u201d</p><p>Luke turned around and smacked him upside the back of the head, muttering, \u201cGreedy pig,\u201d before we all headed in to the living room to eat and watch some TV.</p><p>My cell phone chimed in my purse sitting on the counter and I got up off the couch, gathering up used paper plates, napkins, and discarded pizza crusts and carrying it all to the kitchen. I threw away all the trash and fed poor slobbering Doug the pizza crusts before I grabbed my cell and went back to sit with Luke. I slid my finger across the screen to open the home page of my phone to see that it was a text that had come through. I opened it.</p><p>Hey, its your favorite brother. Got a sec?</p> <p>I laughed before replying, You\u2019re my only brother, jerk off. What\u2019s up?</p><p>Well, remember how you said that I couldn\u2019t have a party at your house?</p><p>I groaned, knowing that this was probably gonna be bad. Yeah, I remember. But you didn\u2019t listen, right?</p><p>Not exactly? You\u2019ll get over it but I do have to tell you that I sent the carpet cleaner people over to clean the carpet where this chick Exorcist-ed the living room. I even paid for it myself. Just FYI. Later.</p><p>I sighed and called Leah, who picked up immediately and started talking before I could.</p> <p>\u201cI know that you said he couldn\u2019t have the party and I told him no but then he came over and we were hanging out and he asked if his buddy could come and I said yes but my friend wanted to come hang because he was here and then it snowballed and the stupid bitch drank three bottles of red wine and Exorcist-ed the living room-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah!\u201d I shouted, trying to get her to shut up. \u201cBreathe for a second, geez. Calland texted me. Did the stain come out of the carpet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cDid anything get broken?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAhh...nope? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Its over and done with so...just be responsible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Emma!\u201d</p><p>I got off the phone with her and Luke reached over, snagging my phone so he could see the texts from my brother. He sniggered and passed the phone to the other guys before I jumped up and snatched it back. I swear, they\u2019re like little kids.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cLuke, I promise, there\u2019s nothing for you to do, so don\u2019t bother coming down here, okay? I\u2019ll just see you when you pick me up from work. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and turned to the officer that had come back into my office at work. He handed me a report, which I laid on my desk with the other three already there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ms. Jensen, but beyond the reports there\u2019s nothing else for us to do. No one knows who he is and he\u2019s obviously masked his number so its not showing up on the Caller ID. You\u2019ve done well with recording the conversations and I would watch it because it sounds like he\u2019s escalating. Just call if you need anything, okay ma\u2018am?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and thanked the officer again, smiling as he left the office. As soon as he cleared the door, my face fell. It was the week before Christmas and Creepy had decided to step up his game. He\u2019s called me almost everyday, but today, not to mention the past three days, he\u2019s become increasingly more agitated and vulgar on the phone. I\u2019d made reports every time and was keeping a file on it. Floyd was going insane with worry, and I think he would have sent me away if I hadn\u2019t talked him out of it.</p><p>As it was, the only reason I got to finish out the week was because next week was Christmas and the office would be closed. I just had to make it through Tuesday at noon, which is when we\u2019d close the office. I\u2019d get Wednesday (Christmas Eve), Thursday (Christmas), and Friday off next week, and then the complete following week, returning to work on the fifth of January.</p> <p>I think we were all hoping that the time away would make him get bored and leave me the hell alone. It was driving me nuts that I had no idea who this guy was and how the hell he knew me, although every time I heard his voice it felt like something was niggling the back of my mind, something that I just couldn\u2019t put my finger on. Luke was about five seconds away from locking me up in a tower somewhere and Brandon and Jackson were totally on his side.</p><p>Luke and I had gotten into an argument last night because he found out that I hadn\u2019t told my family anything, and he assumed that I hadn\u2019t told Allie. Noah was the only one who\u2019d known, other than Allie, who\u2019d already been threatened with death if she told, and I\u2019d sworn him to secrecy. The only reason he knew was because the guys at the station knew I was his sister-in-law and had told him about everything. Luke had blown his top and actually called every single member of my family at quarter after eleven last night to tell them. My parents were pissed off at me, Leah had sobbed like I had died, Jenna had mother-henned me to death (Yes, apparently its even possible to do over the phone), but the one that got to me the most was Calland, who shockingly had been so sweet, asking if I was okay. Of course then he threatened, and I quote, \u2018to castrate the mother fucker who decided to fuck with his sister.\u2019</p><p>I managed to get by with promising to tell Allie today, and that\u2019s only because she was coming out to the house tonight. God knows what he\u2019d have done if he knew she already knew. I\u2019d then tried, unsuccessfully I might add, to shift the focus from me by asking Brandon and Jackson point blank about what was going on with Allie. They\u2019d steadfastly refused to take the bait, remaining stoic and brooding about my situation.</p><p>Oh, well. I sighed and picked up the pad of paper that I had stashed in my desk drawer. I\u2019d made a list of gifts that I wanted to get everyone and had been marking them off as I found them. I only had three more people to buy for, and go figure, they were the ones I lived with. I had a few ideas about Luke and Brandon, but was completely at a loss at what to get Jackson. I\u2019d even gone so far as to ask him, which was no help. Of course, teasing him that I was going to get him Allie in a big red bow didn\u2019t help my cause.</p><p>Mom was easy; I\u2019d gotten her a gift card to use to buy books for her Kindle and stashed it in the pocket of an oversized hoodie sweatshirt with her favorite NFL team on it. I\u2019d also gotten her an adorable yellow lab figurine that looked just like Doug who, even though she refused to let him spend the night again unless he\u2019d been people food free for at least two days prior, was still her favorite four legged grandchild.</p><p>Dad was pretty easy, too. There was a new war game that had come out and he\u2019d wanted it to play on his Xbox 360 with all his buddies. I know, I know, he\u2019s a little old for that, right? Well, my brother had gotten him hooked and far be it for me to tell him any different. I\u2019d also gotten him a new tshirt that said, \u2018The beatings will continue until morale improves,\u2019 which, believe it or not, he\u2019d said to us quite often growing up.</p><p>Calland had gotten the same game as I got Dad so they could play together, and I\u2019d found Leah a really cute outfit and a pair of earrings that she\u2019d been gushing over. Jenna and Noah were probably the easiest. I\u2019d only had to print up a coupon book on the computer with vouchers for babysitting and a gift card to their favorite restaurant. The kids were spoiled by everyone, and I was no different, which is why I\u2019d already bought them at least six gifts each.</p><p>I\u2019d found Allie a few funky scarves that I knew she\u2019d turn into a skirt, as well as a gorgeous silver necklace with a teardrop shaped black onyx and diamond accent pendant. Hell, I\u2019d even bought Doug a few new squeaky toys, bones, and new collar! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d hidden all the presents in the cupboards above the washer and dryer in the laundry room because, since I\u2019d moved in, no one but me has touched the laundry. Gee, how\u2019d I get so lucky? I just needed to get the last few things as well as some wrapping paper and gift tags so I could get everything wrapped. That\u2019s always been my favorite thing at Christmas, besides getting presents. I loved to pull everything out and stack it around me and blare Christmas music while I wrapped everything at once.</p><p>The door chimed, pulling me out of my thoughts and I looked up to see Luke standing in front of me. I looked up at the clock, surprised to see that it was after closing time. I straightened up my desk and locked up the drawers, taking care to hide my Christmas gift list so he couldn\u2019t see the ideas I had jotted down. I needed to figure out a way to hijack Allie for a bit this weekend so she could help me shop.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I asked him as I stood up and rounded the counter. Before I could get all the way around, he had me in his arms, holding me so tight I could hardly breathe.</p><p>I tapped his shoulder, whispering, \u201cLuke...can\u2019t...breathe,\u201d and he let me go immediately, apologizing. I smiled at him telling him it was okay before he grabbed my hand and we headed out to the car.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t get any more calls, thank God, for the remainder of the week. On Saturday morning, I roped Allie into going to the mall with me, hoping that we could get everything and get back to the house to hide it or wrap it before the guys got back home. I had been a little worried about Jackson being there since he doesn\u2019t work on weekends, but he\u2019d decided to head down to the shop with Brandon and Luke.</p><p>After the fifteenth store, Allie pulled out of my desperate grasp as I hauled her towards another, planting her feet and shouting, \u201cNO!\u201d</p><p>I turned around in surprise (and complete embarrassment, truth be told) and asked her what the hell was wrong with her.</p><p>\u201cEmma, you keep second guessing everything. It\u2019s fine! They\u2019ll love everything you get them no matter what it is, so just pick something already! Cheese and rice, woman!\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, smiling ruefully at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know...I just want them to have the perfect gifts, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. And you will. Now, pick a guy and let\u2019s get one of them done, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm...\u201d I thought for a minute. \u201cWell, I guess let\u2019s start with Jacks. You know? I think I\u2019ve got it! Let\u2019s go hit that print shop place that we saw.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, I\u2019d finally picked something out for all three of the guys and my Christmas shopping was officially over. Whew! Allie and I headed back to the house and she helped me carry my bags in while I ran into the laundry room to hide her gifts so she couldn\u2019t find them. She was going to help me with my wrapping, so we lugged everything up into Luke\u2019s...er, my?...bedroom and popped in a Christmas CD before we plopped ourselves down in the middle of the floor, surrounded by mountains of shopping bags and boxes and about ten tubes of wrapping paper.</p><p>My theme this year was red, white, blue, silver and penguins because I found the cutest little wraps with penguins all over them. I\u2019d also gone crazy with bags of bows and about twelve different gift tags. We dove in and started wrapping presents; it only took us about an hour and a half between the two of us and then we carted them all downstairs to put under the tree that I\u2019d finally gotten Luke and Brandon to drag out of the closet and put up.</p><p>Allie and I were standing beside each other, grinning with our accomplishment, when the guys walked in. Their eyes all lit up when they saw the tree and Brandon went running to his room before coming out with an armful of presents wrapped haphazardly and putting them under the tree with mine. I turned to Luke and Jackson with expectant eyes, pouting exaggeratedly when they each shook their heads and walked away.</p><p>We decided that we were going to order Chinese food and Jackson and Brandon offered to go get it. When they returned, we all crowded around the table and ate, enjoying each other\u2019s company. Of course that didn\u2019t last long when talk turned to the phone calls I\u2019d been getting at work from Creepy.</p> <p>Brandon had said something and I froze in panic when Allie opened her mouth, saying, \u201cWell, when she told me about all the hang-ups and heavy breathing I told her she should call and make a report. She did then but they-\u201d she broke off, her eyes growing huge and her hand clapping over her mouth in horror.</p><p>I glared at her, promising retribution would come soon, when Luke jumped to his feet, knocking his chair over as he yelled, \u201cYou knew? You knew that this was happening back then and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Without giving her a chance to reply, he turned to me and bellowed, \u201cAnd YOU! I can\u2019t believe you let me think that you hadn\u2019t told her, that you hadn\u2019t told anyone! What is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>I stood up, pushing my chair back and rounding the table to put my arm around Allie as I pointed my finger at Luke and said, \u201cYou stop. Right now, before you say something you\u2019ll end up regretting, Lucas Tyler Crimshaw. Yes, okay? I told Allie but you know what? We were just starting to see each other, so why would I have told you? I\u2019ve already told you that I should have told you about the phone calls more recently and I promised to keep you informed if anything else happened. Okay? Are we done? Can we get back to eating now?\u201d</p><p>Brandon and Jackson hadn\u2019t said anything during the outburst and I pulled away from Allie to take my seat again, but not before I pinched her arm just as a reminder that I was still pissed she had let the cat out of the bag. Luke dropped his head in his hands for a second before he looked up and mumbled an apology to everyone.</p><p>Then I couldn\u2019t help but smile as he peered up at me and said, \u201cI really am sorry. I just love you so damn much...it makes me a little crazy.\u201d</p><p>Allie\u2019s jaw hit the table and I laughed, absolutely one hundred percent in love with him, not that I wasn\u2019t already. We all finished dinner and the rest of the evening was lightened considerably by Luke\u2019s admission at the table. Allie stayed around for a while before she took off, stating that she had plans in the morning that she couldn\u2019t be late for.</p><p>This made Brandon and Jackson both puff up and ask her questions, which she laughed off, telling them, \u201cdon\u2019t you worry your pretty little heads about what it is boys,\u201d before she kissed them each on the cheek and sashayed out the door. They gave each other dirty looks and Luke and I laughed at them as he pulled me toward the stairs.</p><p>I\u2019d barely gotten through the door and shut it behind me before Luke had me pinned against it, his hand in my hair, jerking it back while he fastened his teeth in my shoulder. It shot me straight to the OHMIGOD zone and I let out a moan at the pleasure coursing through every inch of my body. When he released my skin, I pushed back against him and turned in his arms, winding mine around his neck as I pressed my body against his.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it with you and doors?\u201d I asked, my voice husky with thick with desire.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe it\u2019s the animal you bring out in me. Rowr...\u201d He waggled his eyebrows at me while he swiped his hand at me, his fingers curled into a claw.</p><p>I burst out laughing, completely taken aback by his \u201ccat\u201d impersonation he\u2019d just tossed out of nowhere. He grinned before laughing with me while walking backwards with me in his arms towards the bed. When we got there, I didn\u2019t give him the chance to do anything. I pushed against his chest and he fell back on the mattress, bouncing a little at the abruptness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His arms came out to grab me and I danced out of his reach, wagging my finger at him and sing-songing, \u201cAh-ah-ah!\u201d</p><p>He growled at me and tried to grab me again and I slapped at his hands, telling him no. He pouted, his bottom lip sticking out, and crossed his arms over his chest. I rolled my eyes at him before darting in and biting his bottom lip between my teeth, flicking my tongue over the coolness of the silver hoop piercing the flesh there. He moaned deep in his throat and brought his hands up, but I jumped back again out of reach.</p><p>\u201cEmma! Damnit, woman! What kind of game are you playing? Get over here, now!\u201d Luke sounded almost desperate but I wasn\u2019t going to give in. I wanted to tease him a bit, make him beg for a change.</p><p>I walked over to the closet and pulled out a couple of silk ties that I\u2019d found stashed in the back of Luke\u2019s things. His eyes widened as I came back to the bed and after telling him to strip, motioned for him to lie back on the bed. He did, not hesitating at all, his breath leaving him on a gasp as I crawled onto the bed and straddled him. I raised his arms above his head and tied each of his wrists to the slatted headboard with one of the ties. Giving them a good tug to make sure they\u2019d hold, I moved away, satisfied that he was at my mercy.</p><p>I stripped my own clothes off slowly, turning my back and swiveling my hips as I shucked my jeans and panties, loving the sound of his groan behind me. Taking it just a little further into the torture realm, I spread my legs a little before bending over to pick up my clothes, allowing him an unobstructed view of my ass and swollen, wet nether lips for a second. I turned when I heard the headboard groan ominously, shaking my head as I saw Luke trying desperately to get his hands free.</p><p>I crawled back up on the bed after making a pit stop by my dresser, and straddled his chest, closing my eyes at the feel of his heat pressed against my moist secret flesh.</p><p>\u201cEmma, baby...what are you doing to me?\u201d Luke rasped, his voice deeper and thicker than usual, letting me know how much he wanted me, as if the rock hard, huge length of him standing at attention behind where I was perched wasn\u2019t enough indication.</p><p>\u201cShhh...just...relax...\u201d I said slowly, drawing out the words as I ran my hand down my body, tweaking my nipple before continuing south, \u201c and enjoy.\u201d</p><p>I slid my finger into the wetness between my thighs, circling my clit a couple times while I rocked my hips against his chest, before bringing my other hand up to allow Luke to see what was coming next. His breathing turned harsh as I flipped the switch and the soft, jelly coated, egg shaped bullet with a little finger-like protrusion at the tip buzzed to life. I ran the tip of it down my body, letting it tickle against each of my nipples before pushing it against my wet, pink folds, moaning loudly as the vibrations rolled through my tender flesh.</p><p>I rubbed it through my folds, my wetness glistening on the toy in the light, and Luke\u2019s moans came in earnest, growling through his lips almost constantly. Then I smiled at him, a small, naughty smile, when he started begging.</p><p>\u201cBaby, please...come closer so I can lick it, or move back and let me fuck you while you do that...God, Emma, please!\u201d His eyes had turned wild, his skin felt feverish against mine, and I loved every bit of it.</p><p>I closed my eyes and threw my head back in pleasure, basking in the rush of pure feminine power I felt at the thought that Luke was wild for me...for ME! I never in a million years would have imagined finding the (cheesy line alert, just FYI) man of my dreams. Especially not in a tattoo shop, of all places! And not only that, he made me feel beautiful and unselfconscious, and I\u2019ve never had that before.</p><p>Luke\u2019s hips bucking beneath me brought me out of my thoughts and I gave in a little, sliding forward enough that his mouth could reach me. I barely moved the toy out of the way before his tongue swiped through my folds, laving me from top to bottom and back up again before dancing around my clit. I moaned and rode his mouth for a minute, but pulled back when I felt my orgasm rushing forward. I didn\u2019t want it to be over too quickly.</p><p>He growled at me and strained against his bindings, trying to get his head close enough to put his mouth on me again. I sat on his chest, rocking my hips against him while I played the toy against my clit, bringing myself close to the edge again and again while Luke begged me to touch him or to let him touch me.</p><p>When my thighs were shaking with the effort of holding my release at bay, I raised myself up and turned around, carefully placing my knees on the outside of Luke\u2019s shoulders, lowering my hips over his face until I felt him bury his tongue inside me. He moaned into my wet flesh as I leaned down and took his hard length between my lips, sucking it deep and running my tongue up the length of it as I pulled back.</p><p>I lightly nipped him with my teeth when he stilled against me, telling him without words to get back to work. He vigorously tongued me, flicking the tip of it over my clit before thrusting it inside me, fucking me with it while he thrust his hips up, fucking my mouth at the same time. I moaned with my lips wrapped around him and his hips bucked involuntarily at the feel of it. He began circling my clit again and didn\u2019t stop until I broke, screaming my release around his hardness still thrusting between my lips.</p><p>As soon as I came, I pulled away from him, turning to release his hands from the ties. As soon as the knots loosened, he had me on my back, his length buried deep inside and beginning a pounding rhythm that had me ready to explode again within seconds. As I crested, raking my nails uncontrollably down his back, he came, shouting and moaning and jerking inside me as he spilled headlong into ecstasy.</p><p>We laid there, gasping for breath for a minute before he pulled back to look at me, grinning down at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did that come from?\u201d was his reply.</p><p>I just shrugged my shoulders, gave him a saucy grin, and kissed him.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>\u201cThanks, Floyd!\u201d I exclaimed as I looked into the brightly wrapped package he had left on my desk. He\u2019d gotten me a box of my favorite chocolates and given me a nice Christmas bonus check. I jumped up out of my seat and hugged him, smiling as he laughed at my exuberance.</p> <p>Ever since I\u2019d started working for him, we\u2019d gotten each other gifts for Christmas, and it was always the same thing every year. Like clockwork, I knew that he\u2019d give me my bonus in a box of my favorite chocolates, and he knew that I\u2019d give him two boxes of his favorite chocolate covered cherries and a gift card for him and his wife\u2019s favorite restaurant. His wife always called me after Christmas break to thank me and tell me what she ordered. She\u2019s working her way through the menu and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ordered the same thing twice yet.</p><p>It was Tuesday and I was getting ready to close the office for Christmas break. I just had a couple things left to do, but Floyd was leaving already so he could go finish getting a couple presents for his grandkids. His wife usually does all that kind of shopping, but she\u2019d missed a couple things and he had to pick them up. He\u2019d already brought all his wife\u2019s gifts into the office for me to wrap, and had loaded them into his car to take home. That was another tradition in the office that was started the first year I worked for him. I didn\u2019t mind though. Did I mention he was a kick ass boss?</p><p>I finished cleaning up my desk and locked the door, making sure I put the sign in the door that said when we\u2019d be back in the office before I headed out to my car. I\u2019d driven myself to work because there was no reason for Luke to drop me off since I was only working for three hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I did go to the shop, though, instead of going home, intending to spend the day with Luke and Brandon. Jackson had a few meetings today, so he wouldn\u2019t be around and the only one at home was Doug. Not that I minded his company but Brandon had fed him egg salad yesterday, so I was trying to avoid him until the danger had passed. By that I mean that I wanted to be able to walk through the house without a gas mask on.</p><p>I walked into the shop and said hi to Brandon who was helping someone at the counter before heading back to Luke\u2019s studio. The door was open and he was sitting on his stool talking to Jadalee who was standing across the room looking at a picture of a tattoo that Luke had just done. I ignored her and went to Luke, who jumped up and pulled me into his arms, kissing me thoroughly.</p><p>I pulled back and shot a glance under my lashes toward Jadalee who was standing with her fists clenched. I couldn\u2019t help it; it made me smile. And when I say smile, I mean actually that I grinned from ear to ear while I turned my head and actually looked at her. There ain\u2019t no shame in my game! Boo-ya, bitch!</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re officially on Christmas vacation!\u201d Luke said, grinning right along with me. \u201cDoes this mean that I get you all day every day until you go back?\u201d He looked so hopeful and happy, but I couldn\u2019t resist teasing him.</p> <p>\u201cWell, Allie asked me to stay at her house for a few days, so I told her that I would. And then its tradition to spend at least four nights with my mom and dad right after Christmas, so...\u201d I let my words trail off, giving him what I hoped was a rueful expression.</p><p>His face fell but then he tried so valiantly to hide it and put on a happy front that I couldn\u2019t keep it up anymore. I broke down and laughed, yelling, \u201cI\u2019m kidding, geez! Yes, you have me for all the time you want me until I go back to work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou little witch...\u201d he growled, stalking toward me.</p><p>I squealed and turned to flee but started laughing when he snagged me around my waist and lifted me up against his chest, burying his face in my neck. I laughed even harder when Jadalee rolled her eyes and stomped out of the room, muttering to herself.</p><p>I pushed against Luke and he released me. \u201cListen, I was thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Luke interrupted me, saying, \u201cOh, Lord, that\u2019s bad. Does your head hurt?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him and smacked his shoulder as he laughed at me. \u201cSeriously, focus. I think I want you to tattoo me again.\u201d</p><p>He quit laughing, his eyes growing wide with excitement. \u201cReally? What do you want? Where do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want it right now and I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s why I was thinking that I would let you just draw something for me and give me your ideas of where it should go. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that you trust me an awful lot, sugar, and that turns me on. Want me to close the door and you can ride me while I go ahead and give you a new tattoo on your titty?\u201d He waggled his eyebrows at me, grinning like a loon.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cVery funny, ha ha. Well?\u201d</p> <p>He turned serious, wrapping his arms around me and kissing my forehead before saying, \u201cI was being serious when I said you trust me an awful lot. And it does turn me on...just fyi. But, yeah, I can do that. I\u2019d love to do that for you, sugar. And I just plain love you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and kissed him gently, whispering, \u201cI just plain love you, too. Now go draw me a tattoo, bitch!\u201d I smacked his ass and turned to sashay out the door, but that didn\u2019t work. His eyes gleamed and I gulped.</p><p>I squealed and took off out the door to the lobby as Luke lunged for me, hiding behind Brandon who started laughing, along with the people waiting for tattoos or piercing or whatever. Luke chased me and we looked like two little kids playing around. I was using poor Brandon as a shield, my fingers twisted in the sides of his shirt, moving him every which way to counter Luke\u2019s grabs. Brandon was laughing uncontrollably, especially when Luke\u2019s hands would miss me and grab his sides, inadvertently tickling him.</p><p>Of course, since I\u2019d just found out how ticklish Brandon was, I couldn\u2019t resist pulling my fingers out of his shirt and tickling him mercilessly until Luke got a hold of me and pulled me away, lifting me in his arms and throwing me over his shoulder. I hung there, upside down and grinning, while he called his next client back. The woman followed him, laughing as I propped myself up a bit on his back and introduced myself to her as he strode down the hall to his studio.</p><p>I stayed at the shop until they closed and then Jackson met us at Griff\u2019s for dinner, a little karaoke, and maybe a few drinks. Karaoke night was usually Monday night at Griff\u2019s but the band that he had booked as a special before Christmas act cancelled at the last minute because they broke up, so Jeremy had come in to cover and do karaoke/dance party night instead. Weird for a Tuesday night, but hey. Who am I to complain?</p><p>We were finishing up our dinner (I\u2019d ordered the pizza rolls, as usual...yum!), when Jadalee came through the door, walking over to Jeremy with an exaggerated sway of her hips. I snorted as I watched her lean over and thrust her boobs out, trying to seduce poor Jeremy, I suppose. Too bad she\u2019s barking up the wrong tree...he\u2019s been happily married to his high school sweetheart for fourteen years and they have six kids.</p><p>She apparently picked out a song to sing, and since no one else had put a name in after the last guy who\u2019d been up there, she went ahead and took the stage with the microphone. I shook my head when the notes for Avril Lavigne\u2019s Girlfriend started and Jadalee began to sing. She sucked. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, she wasn\u2019t horrible, but she definitely shouldn\u2019t quit her day job. She bounced around the stage, but her eyes were for Luke, who, bless his heart, was shaking with laughter.</p><p>I nudged him to let me out of the booth and went up to talk to Jeremy. I shook my head when he asked if I wanted my usual start off song, and whispered in his ear what I wanted. He didn\u2019t have it, but thank God he\u2019s one of them hi-tech kinda karaoke guys, so he was able to tap into the bar\u2019s wi-fi and get what I wanted.</p> <p>I smirked as Jadalee sashayed off the stage, a little embarrassed for her since only a couple people clapped for her. And because I was about to blow her out of the water. I didn\u2019t even have an ounce of stage fright tonight, because this was gonna be good.</p><p>The beat started, giving me my starting notes and I belted out the lyrics to Halestorm\u2019s It\u2019s Not You, and I was singing it directly to Jadalee. Of course I played with the lyrics a little bit, but I was making a point.</p><p>Instead of singing I\u2019m or Me during the chorus, I was singing, \u2018He\u2019s in love with somebody, Found someone who completes him, Oh-he\u2019s in love with somebody, oh yeah, and it\u2019s not you!\u2019, and I was singing it directly to Jadalee. Not to toot my own horn or anything, but I was rocking it, too. I got a standing ovation from everyone in the bar, with the exception of Jadalee, who stormed out of the bar like her ass was on fire.</p><p>Christmas Eve day was spent just hanging out with the guys and Allie, who had come over to do our Christmas together since she would be spending the day with her family tomorrow, on Christmas Day. We watched movies and played outside in the snow that had started falling in the middle of the night, sticking and coating everything with sparkling white. I was so happy that we were going to have a white Christmas!</p><p>Before she left, we exchanged gifts. She loved everything I gave her and I was ecstatic with what she\u2019d gotten me. It was a killer pair of black suede peep-toe stilettos, with a tapering stacked, patent leather four and a half inch heel. I loved them and couldn\u2019t wait to wear them! She\u2019d also given me a gift card to buy more books for my Kindle, because she knows how much I love to read. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She also exchanged gifts with the guys and even bought Doug a new chew toy. It was in the shape of a rubber chicken but it was stuffed and had its stretchy wings clasped together and long chicken legs. She showed us how you put your finger in the clasped wings and pull back on the legs before letting go and the thing took off like a slingshot, cock-a-doodle-dooing all the way.</p><p>Luke and I laughed and nudged each other speculatively when Brandon and Jackson both cornered Allie under the mistletoe, kissing her breathless before they let her leave. She stumbled to her car, looking dazed, sitting there for a minute shaking her head before shrugging, waving goodbye to me, and pulling away.</p><p>We woke up Christmas morning early because Brandon was pounding on our door like a five year old, hollering, \u201cWake up! Its Christmas! Open presents! Now!\u201d</p><p>Luke rolled over me, kissing me gently and whispering, \u201cMerry Christmas, baby. Our very first Christmas together...I love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmmm...Merry Christmas to you, too, my love. I love you so much...\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>We kissed softly for a few minutes before the pounding started at the door again. \u201cIf you guys aren\u2019t out of that bed and downstairs in five minutes, I\u2019m coming in and it wont be pretty!\u201d Brandon hollered.</p><p>We laughed and got out of bed, stumbling bleary eyed down the stairs to sit on the couch by a blinking, sleepy-eyed Jackson who was glaring at Brandon between blinks. Brandon was practically hopping with excitement as he started doling out presents to everyone, making a pile for himself by the coffee table. Doug even had a growing pile on the floor in front of him, between his outstretched paws.</p><p>Once all the presents were handed out that needed to be, we started opening. Even Doug got into the spirit, selecting one of his gifts before holding it between his paws and tearing the paper off with his teeth. The one he picked turned out to be a huge rawhide bone that I had gotten him, so I assume he\u2019d been able to smell it through the wrap and that\u2019s why he picked it. I helped him with the rest of his before I opened any more of mine.</p><p>Jackson had gotten me a gorgeous red cable knit cashmere sweater with a cowl neck and a kick ass pair of black skinny jeans. He admitted that he had snuck into my closet and looked at my sizes so he could get it right.</p> <p>Brandon had gotten me a beautiful pair of diamond stud earrings, which I told him was too much. He just blushed and told me to shut up and enjoy them.</p><p>I opened Luke\u2019s presents last. He\u2019d gotten me a gift card to Victoria\u2019s Secret (who\u2019s she kidding anyway? She doesn\u2019t have any secrets left...) which I figured was more of a gift for him; a beautiful gold necklace with a diamond pendent; and in the last box was a card that said simply, \u2018Go to the laundry room.\u2019</p><p>I looked at him quizzically, but he just smiled, giving nothing away. I got up and walked into the laundry room, smiling at Brandon and Jackson who were still thanking me for their gifts. I\u2019d gotten Jackson a large framed black and white picture of the Los Angeles downtown skyline at night. I\u2019d told him it was for his new house, just in case he missed the big city now that he\u2019d moved back. I\u2019d also given him a couple new button down work shirts.</p><p>I\u2019d gotten Brandon a new bottle of his favorite cologne, because he\u2019d mentioned that he was running low in passing one day. I\u2019d also gotten him a couple new long sleeved t-shirts with funny sayings on them.</p><p>Luke was the hardest one to buy for and had taken me the longest to figure something out. I\u2019d finally bought him a couple new Henley\u2019s, a pair of jeans, and four tickets for the Jeff Dunham show tomorrow night in Dayton. Yes, four, because I couldn\u2019t leave the other two out, especially because they all sit around and watch the DVD\u2019s of the guy all the time and laugh their asses off.</p><p>I walked into the laundry room as directed and found another small box. I opened it and found another note. This one said, \u2018I love you. You\u2019ll find it with Hairy.\u2019 I paused for a moment, completely confused before it struck me that Hairy could be Doug. I headed back into the living room to find the guys all sitting on the couch, Brandon and Jackson smirking and Luke looking like he was about to puke. Weird.</p> <p>I turned to find Doug sitting pretty-as-you-please in the oversized armchair, with a basket handle clamped between his jaws. I quirked an eyebrow and walked over to him. I tried to take the basket from him but he wouldn\u2019t let it go, so I settled for opening it instead. When I folded back the lid, there was a note taped to it that said, \u2018Well?\u2019 Even more confused, I reached into the basket and pulled out a little white box. My heart started pounding as I opened it to find an absolutely breathtakingly gorgeous princess cut diamond ring. It had to be at least a carat, and had probably another carat\u2019s worth of round diamonds framing the square of the center stone and extending down the sides of the white gold band.</p><p>I took the ring out of the box with shaking fingers and looked up at Luke. I gasped as he stood up, walked over to me, got down on one knee...and repeated the question written on the card that Doug was holding on the basket.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat\u2019s how you\u2019re gonna do it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not taking no for an answer, so you might as well put it on and just say yes...\u201d he drawled.</p><p>I made him wait for two hours. Okay, I lied. It was more like two minutes. But hey, he went to Jared, and he got the Neil Lane collection, and, truth be told, my dad had actually kinda proposed to my mom like that back in the day. So I said yes.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>After everyone cleaned up their presents and got ready, we all headed over to my mom and dad\u2019s house. Jackson had spoken to his mom on the way over, and she had expressed how sad she was that he hadn\u2019t come back to her house for Christmas, but she understood why he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d been in meetings almost nonstop with work and with the builders for his house, and if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he was staying with us, we probably wouldn\u2019t see him, either.</p> <p>While he was talking to his mom, I had called Allie to tell her the news. I had to pull the phone away from my ear because she shrieked so loudly, and we talked for a minute longer before I finally was able to get off the phone, promising that she would get to see the ring A.S.A.P.</p><p>We pulled up and the kids came running out, still in their pajamas, which got them yelled at for being out in the snow with no coat or clothes. I ushered them back in the house and the guys followed, all carting the bags and bags of gifts that we had for everyone.</p><p>Once we\u2019d all opened our gifts, cleaned up, and helped mom get Christmas dinner on the table, we all sat down and ate. Calland for once was on his best behavior, with the exception of his outburst at the table when he was the first to notice my ring. I\u2019d begged the guys not to say anything and they\u2019d reluctantly agreed, figuring that I\u2019d be shouting it to the rooftops, but I just wanted to see how long it would take them to notice.</p><p>I had been reaching for more macaroni and cheese when Calland, with a mouthful of food, hollered, \u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d before grabbing my hand, knocking macaroni all over the table. \u201cHoly shit, Emma, did you knock off a jewelry store? Are you-\u201d he turned to Luke. \u201cDid you propose to my sister?\u201d</p><p>Luke had nodded and my mom and sisters had squealed and surrounded me to see the ring. I can\u2019t believe no one had noticed it earlier because I kept staring at it, honestly just loving the way it sparkled and shined on my finger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d waited for my dad to say something, but the jig was up when he just sat there with a shit eating grin on his face. The truth came out then. Luke had actually gone to my father to ask his permission to marry me, and had even told him about the whole elaborate plan he\u2019d thought up to propose. In return, my dad had shared the story of how he\u2019d proposed to my mom, which was hiding the ring in the pocket of a bathrobe he\u2019d gotten her for Christmas. When she\u2019d opened it and tried it on at the urging of dad and his parents (he\u2019d done it at their house), she\u2019d automatically stuck her hands in the pockets, and found the ring. Apparently, when she pulled it out and looked at it in surprise, my dad had just said, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>I guess Luke didn\u2019t want to mess with a good thing since it turned out so well between my parents and had scrapped his original plan, instead tweaking my dad\u2019s proposal to my mom to fit us. Now that I knew the reasoning behind it, it made Luke\u2019s off-the-wall proposal that much sweeter.</p><p>We stayed until evening, playing games and just generally having a good time, before we headed home and just hung out. All in all, it was the best Christmas ever.</p><p>The week between Christmas and New Year flew by and, for once, I was excited about New Year\u2019s Eve. Allie, Leah, Jenna, and I all had gotten together to go shopping for outfits to wear to the party that was happening down at Griff\u2019s. Jenna had arranged for a babysitter, and we\u2019d all planned on taking cabs in the event that everyone decided to drink.</p> <p>New Year\u2019s Eve came and all of us girls got together at Jenna\u2019s house to get dolled up and then we were going to meet up with the guys at the bar. After we all got done primping, we were standing together in the mirror.</p><p>Allie, with raised eyebrows, breathed, \u201cWe\u2019re fuckin\u2019 HOT!\u201d</p><p>Every one of us nodded, because we looked damn good. I couldn\u2019t wait for the guys to see us...</p><p>Jenna was wearing a silver dress that was almost like a shirt; it bloused at the top, tightening and draping into a mini skirt that hit mid-thigh. The sleeves were three-quarter length, but were split from the shoulder to just below her elbow before coming to a stop in a black jeweled band on her forearm. She\u2019d paired it with a sexy pair of strappy black stilettos and had piled her hair on top of her head in a messy but precise twist.</p><p>Leah was wearing a black mini skirt with a white and black corset type strapless top, with a killer pair of black suede peep toe stiletto booties. She\u2019d left her hair down, tumbling in waves over her shoulders to the middle of her back.</p> <p>Allie was wearing a silver sheath dress that fit her like a second skin. It had a black lace overlay and a high neckline in the front, but when she turned, it basically had no back, coming to a stop dangerously low over the beginning swell of her ass. She\u2019d gone with a strappy, silver pair of stilettos that made her legs look a million miles long, and her spiky hair (all black for once) was liberally sprayed with silver glitter.</p><p>Since I didn\u2019t do dresses very often, I\u2019d gone with a long black form fitting top that left one whole shoulder and arm bare, and clasped with a silver jewel over the other. On the side that clasped at my shoulder, it had a small gather of material that fell on either side of my shoulder to drape loosely down my side. It came to about mid-thigh, and I\u2019d paired it with a really cute pair of silver skinny jeans . I\u2019d worn the kickass heels that Allie had gotten me for Christmas and Allie had loosely French braided my hair at each side of my head before gathering it into a messy knot at the back of my head.</p><p>Satisfied that we were going to drive the guys wild, we all piled into Jenna\u2019s car and headed out to the bar. When we got there, things were just starting to heat up; people were dancing, drinks were flowing, and it looked like everyone was having a blast. We walked to the table we had reserved (our usual booth was too small for all of us) where the guys were all sitting, and all four of us gasped when we caught sight of them. We thought we were hot? Shit...we didn\u2019t have anything on them!</p><p>Noah was wearing a black button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up over dark grey jeans and black leather boots.</p><p>Jackson was wearing a red button down shirt with a tribal skull on the pocket and the same design emblazoned across the whole back of it. He\u2019d also rolled up his sleeves and buttoned them up with the tabs on the shirt sleeves. Even I had to say that his ass looked delicious in a tight pair of black jeans, and he\u2019d worn black boots with silver buckles.</p><p>Brandon wore a white and black striped short sleeve button down over a black thermal long sleeve, pairing them with a well worn pair of faded jeans and black and white sneakers. He had a black ball cap turned backwards on his head, and a pair of diamond studs flashed in both his ears.</p> <p>And Luke...he looked extra yummy in a black button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up like Jackson and Noah. His shirt had a sweet silver tribal looking cross on the back of it, almost like the one he had worn for our date when we\u2019d first gone out. He\u2019d gone with his grey boot cut jeans that fit him perfectly, and his black boots with silver buckles as well.</p><p>The guys turned and caught sight of us, their jaws all dropping, which made each of us grin as we looked at each other knowingly. Leah waved at them and winked at us before she trotted off to the bar in search of someone to nab as her date for the evening.</p><p>We danced and drank champagne and the evening flew by. We all gathered back at the table to grab the noise makers that Griff had put on every table and headed outside with most of the patrons of the bar. We all fanned out, Luke keeping me close by his side and waited for the countdown. All at once, voices began counting down from ten and everyone joined in, shouting into the dark night. When the town clock struck midnight and everyone yelled Happy New Year!, Luke pulled me into him and kissed me deeply, stealing my breath and making me weak with want.</p><p>He pulled back and whispered, \u201cHappy New Year, baby. I love you...\u201d just as the fireworks started exploding in the sky. I tipped my head back to watch and started laughing in amazement as soft white snowflakes started drifting down over us. Luke pulled me back against him and kissed me while the sky lit up with color bursts and the streets became dusted in white.</p><p>Luke and I trudged back inside, our cheeks reddened from the cold...and maybe a little flushed with good old fashioned lust! We made sure everyone was covered to get home or where they needed to go and made our excuses, both so eager to get out of there and get our hands on each other.</p><p>We pulled up to the house, both running for the door, collapsing against it as our lips met, kissing and undressing each other as we fumbled to the couch, falling over onto the cushions. When our lips parted for a second to catch our breath, Luke\u2019s eyes lit up and he sat up, pulling me up with him. I opened my mouth to ask him what he was doing, but didn\u2019t say anything as he smiled and shook his head, entreating me silently to trust him.</p><p>He led me, both of us naked, to the back door, grabbing a couple thick towels off the dryer in the laundry room where I\u2019d left them after pulling them out of the dryer earlier. I let out a gasp as he pulled me out into the frigid night air, running quickly to the hot tub where he pulled back the cover releasing the steam and heat rising from the top of the water. He turned on the jets and we got in, sinking our bodies down in the hot water as snow continued to fall around us.</p><p>He pulled me onto his lap, our lips meeting in a slow and tangling kiss, our tongues sliding against each other, teeth nipping at lips, breath mingling and steaming in the night air. Nothing was rushed; Luke\u2019s hands roamed my body slowly, taking the time to touch every inch of me, caressing and stroking, stoking the flames of desire burning through me higher and higher. I pulled him even closer to me, rocking my hips against him, loving the feel of his velvety hardness slicking through my tender folds, but he pulled away from me when I tried to sink onto the tip of him.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kissing me one more time before releasing my lips slowly, he lifted me out of the water, my skin steaming in the coldness, so hot that the snow melted upon impact with my body. He pressed me back, my hips on the edge of the tub, my back laying on the towels piled on the decking. I shivered, not really cold because the heat had seeped into every inch of me, warming me from the outside as my desire heated me from the inside.</p><p>I gasped, the sound turning into a long low moan as Luke moved between my thighs, his lips finding my center unerringly, lightly kissing the hot, wet folds before gently parting them with the tip of his tongue. His hands moved my legs apart, spreading them, and me, wide, his eyes locked on that secret part of me his actions revealed. I heard his breath whisper out between his lips before his tongue followed, tasting me softly again.</p><p>He slowly loved me with his mouth, touching and tasting every inch of my tender flesh, dipping inside of me, swirling around the hardened nub that was standing at attention, begging for his touch. He finally licked through my folds with the flat of his hot, wet tongue, pressing firmly against my clit then closing his lips over it, sucking on it with gentle pulls. I brought my hands up and thrust them into his hair, twisting my fingers into the thick, wet strands and holding him tightly against that aching part of me.</p><p>I urged him to move faster, but he resisted, steadily dragging his tongue through my dripping heat, up and down, again and again until the pressure built and built and built...with one final sweep of his tongue he sent me falling over the edge in the hardest, softest, most intense, shattering, beautiful orgasm I\u2019d ever had in my life. Sounds contradictory, I know, because he made me come so hard, but at the same time, he\u2019d done it so softly and sweetly...it was like...I have no words.</p><p>Luke slid his hands beneath my shoulders and lifted my seemingly boneless body back into the steaming hot water, cuddling me in his lap. I could feel his thick, hard length bobbing against my thigh and I shifted so I was straddling his lap, facing the backyard. I reached between my wide spread thighs and guided him into me, sinking down slowly over him, letting his hardness stretch and fill me until he was buried balls deep in the tight fist of my body.</p><p>I sat still in his lap, letting my body acclimate to the invasion of his, our mouths mating slowly and sensuously. I laved the hard silver ring threaded through his lip, the contrast of the cold metal against the heat of my tongue sending shivers down my spine. When Luke\u2019s hands came up to bracket my waist, just above my hips, I leaned back, trusting him and the buoyancy of the water to hold me up. I stretched out, laying back in the water, letting Luke set the pace of our lovemaking.</p><p>He used his hands on my hips to move me, pushing me toward the middle of the hot tub as he stood in the middle and began thrusting into me. I put my arms down in the water, finding the edge of the hard plastic seat and bracing myself against it as the waves lapped my body. He set a steady rhythm, not too fast and not too slow, rolling his hips against mine so that every hardened inch of him stroked that special place inside me, causing my breath to hitch and my arms and legs to tremble.</p><p>I cried out as he pulled out of me, reaching for him to guide him back inside, but he turned me away from him, forcing me to kneel on the bench that I\u2019d just been bracing my arms on. He pushed me forward slightly as he took himself in hand and guided his length back into my depths, thrusting home and making both of us groan in relief. I felt his hand come around the front of me, searching for something before he shifted us both on the bench.</p><p>I came apart in his hands as he thrust into me, hard and fast, while the jet he had positioned me in front of pounded against my clit, bringing me to the edge and pushing me over again and again until I was screaming and sobbing into the cold night air, lost completely to the ecstasy thrumming through me, begging him to come because it was too much. With one last heaving thrust, he slammed himself into me and let go, yelling out his release and it echoed through the night with mine.</p><p>Luke and I collapsed into the water, our breath coming in gasps. After a minute or two, he pulled me up and we stepped out onto the deck, grabbing our towels and wrapping them around us as we ran for the door, leaving wet footprints in the snow on the deck.</p><p>We made love again in the shower before washing each other off and collapsing into the bed, wrapped up in each other and thoroughly worn out. Just like Christmas, it had turned out to be the best New Years Eve ever!</p><p>When I woke in the morning, my body felt deliciously sore as I stretched, grinning as I looked at Luke sleeping beside me. I quietly and carefully slid out from underneath his arm and threw on some clothes before padding barefoot downstairs to make my favorite guys a banging New Year\u2019s breakfast.</p><p>After I got done cooking, I went over to the couch where Jackson was sleeping and shook him awake before going down the hall to get Brandon up. I was shocked when the door opened immediately and he grinned at me, rubbing his belly like he\u2019d known all along what I was doing. Then again, he has a nose for food, so his eyes probably popped open as soon as the bacon hit the frying pan!</p><p>I headed upstairs to get Luke, but he met me on the stairs, leaning in for a very nice kiss before following me back into the kitchen. We all ate every morsel I\u2019d prepared and then they actually cleaned everything up for me while Doug and I reclined on the couch. My mom called to see if we were going to stop over and I told her we would probably be by after a bit.</p><p>Luke, Brandon, and Jackson all played Xbox for a bit while I read on my Kindle. We left the house and headed to my parents\u2019 house. Mom always makes a big pot of pork and sauerkraut, which I think is disgusting. Every year she tries and tries to get me to take just one bite because she swears it will bring me good luck for the year. I always refuse.</p><p>Until this year...Luke and my mom ganged up on me and I didn\u2019t stand a chance. I could have held out but Luke whispered in my ear that he wouldn\u2019t touch me for a month if I didn\u2019t take one bite. He started out with a week, and I had whispered back that I could handle that. Then he upped it to two weeks. I wavered a little at that, but then he said a month and refused to kiss me when I asked. So I plugged my nose and took a small bite. Very small.</p><p>We didn\u2019t stay long at my parents\u2019 house, and headed home so I could do some laundry and get back in the mindset to head back to work after the weekend.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>I went in to work on Monday morning to find that the furnace had quit. Floyd had called someone but they wouldn\u2019t be there for at least three to four hours from what he was told, so I was bundled up in my sweater and my coat, with my gloves on . I got a few weird looks as clients came in the door for their appointments, but that changed within a few minutes as they waited.</p><p>The phone was ringing off the hook and I hadn\u2019t had a chance to even listen to the voice mail from the week we were gone, yet. It was almost one before the furnace guy showed up and finally got the heat working again. Hallelujah!</p><p>The phones slowed down a bit after he left and I started listening to the sixteen voice mails that people had left. I was surprised, because usually after being gone for a week, we\u2019d have a lot more messages, but then again, I did change the voice mail message to indicate that we would be gone. Maybe that\u2019s why the phone had rang so much today!</p><p>My breath caught on the sixth message, when the raspy voice of Creepy came on the line.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart. You know, I\u2019m getting impatient because you haven\u2019t been to work all week. And I want to, no I NEED to see you, to hear your voice. I hope you had a good Christmas. I know you had a good New Year because I saw you with your fucking lips attached to that mother fucker\u2019s face! You better have enjoyed it, because it will be the last time you embarrass me like that. Until next time, sweet Emma.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hit the save button with a shaking hand and finished listening to the rest of the voice mails before I caught Floyd as he was finishing up with another client and let him listen to it. He shook his head and told me to call the police again. I called and made yet another report and then called Luke so I wouldn\u2019t get yelled at for keeping things from him again. I calmed him down enough to keep him from rushing over to the office and sitting with me all day, because I knew that he had booked himself solid with clients to make up for the holidays.</p><p>I hung up the phone with Luke and sat there staring at my hands. I felt sick to my stomach, and wondered why this was happening and who the hell it could be. I felt tears well up in my eyes as I thought about how picture perfect everything had been last week. Now I felt like there was a shadow hanging over the memories, the sickening knowledge that someone had watched, intruded on a special moment, tarnishing the glow of that memory.</p><p>I sat up in my chair and started replaying the phone conversations and messages that I had recorded and saved, hoping that something would stand out to me, give me some kind of idea as to who this psycho sicko was. I mean, was it just by chance that he was at the bar and saw me? Did he know where I live? He knew what kind of car I drove, but the more questions swirled in my head and the more I listened to his words, I realized that I was no closer to figuring anything out. It was making me crazy and I was beginning to feel a little helpless at the fact that there was this unknown entity watching me and there was nothing I could do about it.</p><p>I closed the office at five and walked out with Floyd. He usually is never in the office when I am leaving for the day, but he stuck around to make sure I was okay. He\u2019s such a softie.</p> <p>Creepy was never far from my mind over the next couple of weeks. He hadn\u2019t called since last week and he didn\u2019t talk long then. In fact, the only thing he\u2019d really said was that it was time for me to come home. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what he meant but I had called Leah and asked that she stay at mom and dad\u2019s for a bit, just in case.</p><p>Luke was beside himself with worry and I think if he could have gotten away with it, he would have set up shop in the office beside me. He and Jackson and Brandon and even Calland, believe it or not, had begun stopping by the office at random times just to check on me and ask if he\u2019d made any kind of contact. I think we were all a little relieved when day after day I\u2019d been able to say no.</p><p>When a month went by without any calls from Creepy, we decided to celebrate a little and since he\u2019d been so sweet over the past few weeks, I\u2019d invited my brother to come with. Of course Allie was coming; she\u2019d always been a permanent fixture in my life but she\u2019d been around even more lately. Her, Brandon, and Jackson had become like a trio of best friends who were inseparable, but there was an air of tension around them. In my opinion (and I shared it often) it was all sexual and she should just frickin\u2019 give it up already. Together or separate, whichever, she just needed to fuck them and then maybe they could all relax a little.</p><p>The doorbell rang and I answered the door to find Calland standing there, his left arm holding a sleeping bag and pillow, his right thrown casually around the shoulders of a tiny brunette girl. She was really cute in that aww-you\u2019re-so-young-and-have-no-clue-about-real-life kinda way, but I didn\u2019t say anything, just raised my brow at him as I let them in.</p><p>We\u2019d decided to have a slumber party, adult drunken style. And before you ask, no, I really have no clue who came up with that idea, nor did I know just what it was supposed to entail, other than the fact that no one was allowed to leave and we had about a million different drinking games written out on index cards in a bowl on the table. What I did know for sure is that we\u2019d gotten so much booze that we could get a small third world country drunk on the fumes.</p> <p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Allie shouted, standing up on a chair at the kitchen table. \u201cWelcome to the first annual Crimshaw Family and Whoever the Hell Else We Wanna Invite Drunken Fest Sleepover! I really don\u2019t know why I\u2019m standing on a chair and shouting at you like I\u2019m the fuckin\u2019 emcee or something, but it is what it is. So this here\u2019s tha\u2019 rules, yo! You drink? You sleep here. You breathe in the smell of booze? You sleep here. Basically, you sleep here! Next rule. We play games. You don\u2019t play? You\u2019re fired and must sit outside in the cold, naked, for an hour.\u201d</p><p>We all laughed at that, especially because of the way Allie was acting. I mean, there was only me, Luke, Brandon, Jackson, Calland, Allie, and Calland\u2019s little woman, who\u2019d quietly said her name was Buffy (WTF?).</p><p>She continued, \u201cNow, without further ado, I\u2019m gonna stick my little hand here into this big ol\u2019 bowl of make ya puke games and pick one out. Then we\u2019re gonna play! Oh! One more last rule and it\u2019s a big one. DO NOT GIVE DOUG ANY EGGS! No booze either, but PLEASE! NO EGGS!\u201d</p><p>With that, she reached into the bowl and pulled out a card, squealing before she read out loud, \u201cChooser\u2019s choice! Make your own game! YES!\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and looked at Luke in mock horror, knowing that things were about to get really weird and crazy. Allie thought for a bit and came up with a game that involved constantly changing the rules, which meant that within twenty minutes, we were all on the way to being shit faced drunk.</p><p>I raised my hand, sure that that was what the new rule was before you could talk. \u201cUmm, okay, so I say its time for a new game. Who\u2019s with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-uh-uh,\u201d Allie sing-songed. \u201cDrink, bitch. You didn\u2019t say drunk duck before you spoke. Raising your hand was like three rules ago. So HA!\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes again (for like the sixteen billionth time that night) and chugged my...to be honest, I\u2019d given up keeping track of what I was drinking about four cups ago. It was good, I knew that much. Either that or my taste buds were burned off from the liquor...</p><p>Luke and Brandon both spoke up beside me and agreed that it was time for a new game. I stood up and grabbed the bowl from the center of the table, passing it to...ugh...Buffy for her to choose the new game. She held up the card before screaming (really, she whispered but it was louder than she usually whispered so I guess it counted as a scream for her), \u201cQuarters!\u201d</p><p>We all took turns for about ten minutes trying to bounce a quarter into a glass before we got bored again. Then Calland got the bright idea to forego the cards and play a drinking game he called, Watch the Movie and Get One. It made sense when he explained it a little more. The premise of the game was basically to watch the movie The Hangover and you had to drink any time one of the following happened in the movie: Someone takes a drink, someone cusses, someone gets hurt, you see nudity of any kind. We made him stop at four because we all knew that just those alone would have us shit faced in the first half hour!</p><p>So we moved the bottles to the coffee table and all crowded on to the couches and chairs. Luke and I curled up in the armchair, Calland and...don\u2019t make me say it...sat together on the love seat, while Allie sat between Brandon and Jackson on the couch. Luke grabbed the remote and hit play and true to the name of the game, we were all going to have hellacious hangovers tomorrow.</p><p>By the end of the movie (I think it was the end...I only had one working eyeball left), my head was swimming. I\u2019d given up and yelled uncle not even twenty minutes into the movie because I didn\u2019t want to get to the puking drunk point. I hate puking and I avoid it at all costs, so no way in hell was I doing anything that might bring me to that! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke was snoring beside me, his arms and legs sprawled out and his head lolled back so far it looked like his neck was broken. If I weren\u2019t so buzzed I think I might have been a little more concerned or considerate and help him fix it, but...</p><p>I tried to focus on the room, seeing if I was the only one left awake. My eyes (eye?) blinked and tried to focus when I saw Allie straddling Brandon as he kissed down her chest, and Jackson was pressed to her back, her head turned toward him over her shoulder as their mouths ate at each other. I shook my head (bad idea) and tried to find my brother and his whatever she was.</p><p>When I finally was able to see them, I couldn\u2019t help but snort and maybe hiccup a little when I saw Calland passed out face first in what\u2019s-her-face\u2019s lap while Doug was sitting on his back eating pieces of popcorn he\u2019d sniffed out in the girl\u2019s hair.</p><p>I closed my eyes when I heard a low moan come from the vicinity of the couch. I held up my hand, though I wasn\u2019t quite sure why because they sure as hell weren\u2019t paying attention to me, and cleared my throat. \u201cUmm...\u2018scuse me? Not passed out people in the room! If one of you would be so nice to try and get me up in my room we\u2019d be gratefully happy. Me and Mr. Snoozypants here...\u201d I hiccupped again and opened my eyes when I heard Allie laugh, but they fell closed again immediately.</p> <p>When I opened my eyes again, I bolted up in bed as fear chased down my spine. A high-pitched scream ripped through the house again and I threw myself out of bed and ran down the stairs to see what the hell was happening. I didn\u2019t even realize that Luke was behind me until I heard him snort in disbelief as Allie, followed by Jackson and Brandon, all stumbled into the room.</p><p>I looked at the couch which is where I determined the screams had come from since they\u2019d died down to non-stop whimpers, and smacked my forehead with my hand. Oh, God.</p><p>Buffy...nope, still not any better in the light of day and sober...was lying paralyzed on the couch, her eyes locked unblinkingly on the large yellow lab sitting smack dab in the middle of her chest looking down into her face. Her mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water and I leaned closer to hear what she was saying.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what does it want? Help me!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I stepped closer to the loveseat, tripping over my brother who was sprawled on the floor in front of her, still sleeping like the dead. I caught myself and peered down over Doug\u2019s head to see if I could figure out what had him transfixed. I nodded my head and reached down into the brunette hair of the poor girl. I pulled my hand back again and tossed Doug the piece of popcorn I\u2019d dug out of her hair and he jumped down off of her as soon as he swallowed it.</p> <p>\u201cSee? All better,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe seriously was that intense about a piece of popcorn? I thought he was attacking me!\u201d she shrieked. She leaned down and smacked my brother, yelling at him to get up and take her home, away from crazy dogs and freaky people.</p><p>When Calland finally got up and, grumbling, headed out to take...her...home, I turned to Allie who was trying to shuffle nonchalantly back into Brandon\u2019s bedroom. I raised my eyebrow at her and she turned her head every which way but backwards trying to avoid my gaze, before I shrugged and let her escape. I would definitely find out the details of whatever happened later.</p><p>Luke came up behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist, kissing my neck and asking me to come back to bed with him. So I did. Boy was I glad I did!</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Six o\u2019clock and it was finally time for me to go home! I\u2019d had a client call and ask if they could come in late to sign some papers that we\u2019d drawn up and he\u2019d not made it in until quarter \u2018til six. I\u2019d driven to work today because I knew I\u2019d be a little late, so I headed out to my car, pulling my cell phone out and calling Luke to let him know I\u2019d be there shortly.</p> <p>It was almost April and the weather had actually warmed up just a bit like spring, but had turned dreary and drastically cold again today. Typical Ohio weather. I pulled my sweater close to me as I walked toward my car, the wind cutting through my thin slacks.</p><p>Luke and I had settled into a routine over the last couple months, and it honestly was the best feeling in the world. I was in love with a wonderful man who treated me like a freakin\u2019 queen, made love to me whenever and wherever he could, and we\u2019d started planning our wedding.</p><p>Jackson\u2019s plans for his house were almost finished and they would begin breaking ground in two weeks, as long as the weather held. He and Brandon were walking around like they\u2019d lost their best friend because, well...they kinda had. After the drunken fest back in January things had been different with them. Allie was pushing them away but they didn\u2019t want to be pushed and I couldn\u2019t get her to tell me what the hell was wrong with her. She had finally given me details about what happened that night since I\u2019d seen her making out with both of them, but she still swore that nothing else really happened. She said that they just all made out, a lot of kissing, heavy petting, and then sleeping. I didn\u2019t know if I believed her completely or not, but I figured she probably was telling the truth because Brandon\u2019s big mouth hadn\u2019t shouted otherwise.</p><p>Calland had dropped that girl off and never saw her again. I think he realized she was in over her head with him and he\u2019s gone through probably twenty more girls since then. I keep telling him to grow up and not be such a whore, but he doesn\u2019t listen. Doesn\u2019t even listen when I tell him his dick is gonna shrivel up and fall off if he isn\u2019t careful.</p><p>I reached my car and hit the unlock button on my key fob to get in. Before I could get the door open, I felt a hand tap my shoulder. When I turned my head to see who it was, I cried out at the sharp pain that burst through my head and my world went black.</p><p>The drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet woke me up and I groggily reached out to shake Luke awake and make him go fix it. My hand kept going, encountering nothing but empty space and I froze, fuzzy memories slamming back into place. I brought my hand up to touch the side of my head, near my temple, wincing when with pain when I touched it, my hand coming away wet. Panting in fear, I scrambled up and opened my eyes, my back against a cold, hard concrete wall. I couldn\u2019t see anything because the room I was in was pitch black.</p><p>I opened my mouth to scream and realized that my lips wouldn\u2019t open. My hand flew up to my face, feeling the slick stickiness of some kind of tape across my mouth. I fumbled around, trying to find the edge of the tape with my fingertips so I could pull it off. I could hear the muffled sound of whimpering and I looked around in panic before I realized that it was me. I finally located the edge of the tape and lightly scraped with my fingernails to raise it in order to peel it off, but in my panicked haste, I scraped too deeply, wincing when my nails jabbed into my own cheek.</p><p>I was picking at the edge to loosen it some more when I heard the scrape of footsteps somewhere above me. I froze, crouching down against the wall at my back and staring hard into the darkness, trying to discern where I was, or to see if there was anything around me that I could use as a weapon. When I heard the footsteps stop and a door open, I quickly laid back down, frantically trying to calm my breathing and remember how I was laying when I woke up.</p> <p>My mind was racing, trying to formulate some kind of plan but all I could come up with was to pretend I was asleep until I could figure something out. I heard heavy stomps coming down what sounded like wooden stairs so I was presuming I was in a basement of some type. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I closed my eyes and laid still, trying to regulate my breathing, but I was breathing so hard I had little hope of it working. I flinched without meaning to when a bright light streamed out of the darkness against my eyelids and the footsteps moved toward me.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re awake, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>His raspy voice sent shivers through me and I knew for certain that Creepy had taken his game to a whole new level. I could feel myself tensing, my anger rising. I was pissed off at myself for letting my guard down, for feeling safe again when I should have known better. And I was pissed to the fucking tits that this crazy asshole had gotten his hands on me.</p><p>My skin crawled as thoughts bombarded me from every direction, my stomach turned queasy. I hadn\u2019t thought to check the state of my clothes. I knew I had them on, but were they torn? Opened? Was I missing anything? Did he touch me? Oh, God, had he gone further than that?</p> <p>I gave up the pretense of sleeping, both of us knowing full and well that I was awake. I opened my eyes, squinting and blinking in the brightness of the flashlight aimed directly in my face. I tried to see beyond the beam of light, but he was just a shadow in the darkness behind it. I sat up and scooted back against the wall again, pressing my back to it and bringing my knees up protectively in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI cant believe I finally have you here. Jesus, do you know how long I\u2019ve waited for this?\u201d He chuckled, the sound sending chills down my spine. \u201cAnd here you are, so beautiful, so silent.\u201d He stepped closer to me and I tensed before he continued speaking. \u201cWhat did you do to yourself there, sweetheart? Trying to take the tape off? I\u2019ll help you with that but you have to close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slightly, cringing when it made me dizzy.</p><p>The man\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cYes, you will close your eyes or I\u2019ll fuckin\u2019 knock you out again, Emma. Do it. NOW.\u201d</p><p>Not seeing any other choice, I squeezed my eyes shut, whimpering when his rough fingers touched my face, gripping the edge of the tape and ripping it viciously off of my mouth. I screamed at the instant intense pain that seared across my face, bringing my hands up to cover my burning lips. I felt wetness there, and opened my eyes, only to shut them tightly again as he backhanded me across the face.</p> <p>Holding my face gingerly between my palms, I stammered, \u201cWhat..what do you want wi-with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out. Keep your fucking eyes closed,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>I cried out again as he thrust some kind of material against my face, pushing it so hard against my face that my head jerked back and cracked against the concrete of the wall behind me. Without caring, he tied the fabric tightly over my eyes, my hair tangled up in the knot and making my eyes water even more than they already had been from earlier.</p><p>After he blindfolded me he jerked me to my feet. I stumbled and he caught me, his hands roughly grabbing at my shoulders, so hard I knew that I would be bruised. Inside my head I laughed at myself, knowing that bruised shoulders were the least of my worries right now.</p><p>He shoved me back against the wall, his hand sliding to encircle my throat, pressing up and squeezing until I was gasping for air. I felt him slide his other hand down my shoulder onto my breast, pinching the tender globe so fiercely that I screamed.</p><p>His breath bathed hotly over my ear, the fetid stench of it curling into my nose and making me gag as he whispered, \u201cSee what happens to bad little girls who fuck around with trash? You\u2019re mine, Emma. I told you that and you chose to keep flaunting your indiscretions in my face. Did you think I\u2019d just go away? Leave you alone?\u201d He squeezed my throat even tighter, and I gasped as everything went grey and fuzzy as I started to slip under.</p> <p>Apparently sensing that I was to the point of passing out, he released me and I slid down the wall, gulping air in between dry heaves. My stomach was rebelling but nothing was coming up, and I almost counted it as a blessing.</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d I gasped. \u201cLet me go. I don\u2019t even know who you are and I wont say anything. I promise, just let me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you sure beg pretty. What are you gonna do for me, sweetheart, to make me want to do that? Any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>I knew what he was hinting at and there was no way in hell I was going there, but then it hit me. If I could get him close enough I could possibly take him by surprise. He\u2019d left my hands untied, and my feet weren\u2019t bound either.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I whispered, \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>I heard his breath quicken, could imagine the thoughts rolling through his nasty mind, and swallowed back the bile that started to rise in my throat.</p><p>\u201cFor starters, I think that I\u2019ll fuck that traitorous little mouth of yours. How about that, little one?\u201d He stepped toward me again, the scrape of his boots giving him away, allowing me to brace myself. I heard the rasp of a zipper being released and a small whimper escaped through my lips. \u201cNow, I gotta tell you, sweetheart, you try anything funny and you\u2019ll regret it. I\u2019ve got a knife with your name on it right here, and while I\u2019d hate to mark up that gorgeous face of yours, I won\u2019t hesitate to do it. Bring your hand up here and hold my dick, bitch.\u201d He laughed as he reached for my arm, jerking it up until my fingers brushed hot, turgid skin.</p><p>Fighting against the nausea, I allowed him to wrap my fingers around that insignificant part of him, holding my fingers tightly in his grasp as he thrust himself against my hand. He finally dropped his hand after a minute, his hips moving in a stuttering see-saw motion. As soon as he dropped his hand, I closed my fingers around him in a punishing grip, digging my nails into his most tender flesh and bringing my other hand up to grab, twist, and yank down violently on his balls.</p> <p>I heard an inhuman scream and my ears rang as his hands flailed wildly, landing a solid hit against the side of my head, thankfully on the opposite side from where he\u2019d hit me earlier. I jumped to my feet, shoving against him with all my might and trying to do as much damage as possible before he fell backwards, and I let go, turning to run as I ripped the blindfold off.</p><p>He\u2019d dropped the flashlight when he\u2019d caught me and I\u2019d ended up kicking it when I jumped up, so now it was spinning wildly on the floor and I tried desperately to catch a glimpse of the stairs in the rotating flashes of light. Knowing I had only seconds, I took off across the room, hoping that I could find the stairs and make it up them before he got up again.</p><p>By some miracle I found them and pounded up them at breakneck speed, throwing myself through the door at the top. I lost my balance and fell, scrambling to my feet as I heard him bellow down below, his heavy footsteps sounding like thunderclaps as he hit the bottom of the stairs. Whirling, I took off again and found myself in a kitchen, but I couldn\u2019t see a way out. My heart was pounding and I was gasping for air, but I tamped down the panic threatening to overtake me and reached for the butcher block of knives sitting in plain view on the counter.</p><p>As soon as the blade I chose cleared the wooden block it was sitting in, I heard him step into the room. He stopped in the doorway, his face a mask of fury. He\u2019d neglected to shove himself back into his pants...either that or he was in too much pain to do it...and I could see with sickening clarity the damage I\u2019d wrought. It hung there, already bruising, a bloody and limp mess.</p><p>I raised the knife, holding it tightly in my hand. \u201cYou. Little. Bitch,\u201d he growled at me. \u201cYou will pay for that. And oh, oopsie! You\u2019ve seen my face now, so do you think you\u2019re getting away from me now? Uh-uh...I don\u2019t think so, sweetheart. Drop the knife and get over here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stayed where I was, the knife wavering slightly in my trembling hand. I forced myself to study his face, memorizing every inch of it, forcing myself to think...where had I seen him before?</p><p>I straightened a bit as it hit me, my hand steadying as I still held the knife up. \u201cJohn Frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ho ho! Look who finally figured it out! What do we have for her, Johnny?\u201d John yelled.</p><p>\u201cWhy, John? You were a client of Floyd\u2019s, he helped you out! I helped you!\u201d My voice rose with every word and I fought to calm myself, not wanting to set him off. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a cell phone lying on the microwave stand not five feet from me. God, if only I could get to it...</p> <p>\u201cYou were so nice to me, Emma. You know, I\u2019d just lost my mom and my brother to that fucking car accident. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I called every attorney in the book almost, trying to find someone who would give me the time of day to help me out. Everyone...all them bitches...just pushed me to the side, take a message, take a message, blah blah blah...but you were nice. You explained things to me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, saying, \u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m there for, John. You came in and we started the process, didn\u2019t we? Getting everything probated and working on the personal injury side of things from the accident? You remember, right?\u201d I tried to keep my voice steady and my breath caught as he closed his eyes for a second.</p><p>I took that time to silently step to the side, closer to the microwave stand where the cell phone was. I stopped again as his eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cYou did. You helped me, you made me feel special.\u201d His eyes flashed and his face hardened again. \u201cBut I was just another fucking job to you. I asked you out after everything and you laughed at me. LAUGHED!\u201d</p><p>I winced and tried to calm him down again. \u201cNo, John, I didn\u2019t laugh at you. I smiled at you. Smiled...remember?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head but I could see that he was confused. \u201cNo, you laughed. You told me that you wouldn\u2019t go out with me and I wanted you. No, I fuckin\u2019 needed you! I didn\u2019t have anyone else and once you were done and everything was settled, you chalked me up and moved on to the next. We had something special, you dirty, fucking bitch!\u201d He was screaming now, bouncing on the balls of his feet, and I could read the intent in his eyes just as he lunged toward me.</p><p>I moved quickly, jumping to the side and swiping the cell phone from the stand with one hand as I blindly struck out with the knife in the other. I screamed as my arm was caught in a vice grip, fingers digging painfully into the pressure points in my wrist until my fingers went lax, releasing the knife to clatter to the floor. I don\u2019t know how but I managed to hold on to the phone and keep it tucked out of view as he backhanded me across the face again. I felt my skin split on my cheekbone, and then my mouth filled with blood as he hit me again, my teeth tearing into the tender inside of my cheek and lips.</p><p>The second blow spun me around and knocked me down to the floor. I saw him bend down to grab me again and kicked out with my foot, grinning maniacally as my heel connected with his nose, a spray of hot blood splattering my face. While he was dazed, I shoved my hand under the microwave stand with the cell phone in it, thanking God that it was an old flip phone with actual buttons to push. I started yelling, trying to cover up any sounds the phone might make while I blindly felt for the correct buttons to push, praying that my fingers found 911.</p><p>I felt John\u2019s hand slam down on my thigh, tightening as he tried to pull me to him as he knelt on the floor where he\u2019d dropped. I rolled, scrambling for purchase on the tile floor and finding none, but I managed to get my face close enough to see under the stand where the phone screen was lit up with 911. I hit send and let the phone go, leaving it hidden beneath.</p><p>I felt strangely disconnected from myself during the rest of the ordeal. Like I was watching myself, not in my body; I\u2019d retreated to a safe place inside myself where I couldn\u2019t feel the blows raining down on me.</p><p>I watched, dazed, as my mouth opened and I screamed the monster\u2019s name over and over and over again, screaming and sobbing and begging all the while, but I was doing it in a calculative way. I knew that the dispatcher would be listening. I knew she\u2019d begin tracing the number, looking up the name that I was sobbing and screaming.</p> <p>Just as I knew that she would run to the bathroom and puke her guts up, crying into the toilet at the horrendous things she had heard afterward.</p><p>Facts of life. You know, like one and one is two. The sky is blue. A can of camouflage spray paint has only one color in it, so its not really camouflage. The camouflage only comes together when you have one can of each color of camouflage paint. Dogs have fur. The dispatcher puking and crying was one, too. That\u2019s how I knew she would.</p><p>What I didn\u2019t know, though, was how I was going to survive what was happening to my body so far below me. The monster was on top of me, beating me with his fists and ripping my clothes away. He wanted to rape me, but I\u2019d effectively made sure that wouldn\u2019t happen when I maimed him in the basement. His fury exploded and I watched in horrified numbness as he grabbed the knife I\u2019d dropped on the floor and impaled my side, the blade sliding through my flesh and lodging in the floor beneath me, while his other hand circled my throat and pressed down.</p><p>I watched as my blood pooled beneath me and began to spread, making macabre designs on the tile. I watched as I floated...away...and the darkness swallowed me down.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>A steady beeping was the first thing to break into my consciousness. I heard it faintly, a constant sound in my ear before the darkness claimed me again. Then, low voices...voices that sounded vaguely familiar...pulled me up from the depths, and I struggled to get to the surface, to see who they were, but pain washed over me and I let the darkness pull me back down. It was safe there. Nothing hurt there.</p><p>\u201cEmma? Sugar, its time to get up. You\u2019ve been out long enough. Come back to me now. Emma!\u201d</p><p>The voice was deep, rich...sensual. And so damn familiar it made my heart ache. I forced myself through the fuzziness, blinking my eyes slowly. The room was mostly dark, a dim light casting a glow across the face of the man sitting beside my bed, his head resting on the mattress beside me. God, he was so beautiful, even looking like he hadn\u2019t shaved for a month, let alone slept.</p> <p>I tried to speak, but couldn\u2019t force any words past my lips. A small gasp did come out and that was enough. Luke\u2019s head jerked up, his eyes going wide.</p><p>\u201cOh, God...you\u2019re awake! Emma! Baby, I love you, hang on...I gotta get someone-\u201d he jumped up and ran for the door, throwing it open and yelling, \u201cShe\u2019s awake!\u201d before running back to me, kneeling at the side of my bed.</p><p>I looked around for a minute, taking in the hospital room around me. I was hooked up to all kinds of monitors and foreign looking machines. An IV was slowly dripping fluid into my arm, and I figured that was the only reason I wasn\u2019t screaming in pain. Luke shifted, bringing my gaze back to him.</p><p>He was watching my face, his eyes shining with so much love and excitement and...pain. He sat back as a nurse dressed in cheery looking scrubs bustled in, a woman in a white lab coat hot on her heels. They stopped on either side of my bed, checking machines, smiling, and talking a mile a minute.</p><p>\u201cEmma? I\u2019m Dr. Hart and this is your nurse, Sarah. You\u2019ve been in a coma for two weeks and we\u2019ve been trying to get you back. Don\u2019t try to talk, because you\u2019re throat has had some trauma and is still pretty bruised. Are you in any pain?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head slightly, wincing at the pinch of pain I felt in my neck. I opened my mouth, intending to ask exactly what injuries that psycho monster had inflicted, but sighed in frustration when the doctor shook her head at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sure you have some questions, and then we\u2019ll leave you to your reunion with lover boy over here. He\u2019s not left your side the entire time, and the waiting room is full of people who\u2019ve been camped out for days waiting on you to wake up. Since I don\u2019t want you talking just yet, I\u2019ll ask the questions, and you can blink once for no and twice for yes. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I blinked twice. The nurse moved away from the bed to check on something and Luke slid his chair back to my side again, gingerly taking my hand in his.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what happened, Emma?\u201d Dr. Hart asked.</p> <p>I blinked twice, and then once. I knew what happened, but there was some parts that was fuzzy. Like, what happened when everything went black? I assume the cops came because I woke up in the hospital, very thankful to be alive, now that I think about it. But when did they get there? Had he...had he done anything...? I shut my eyes tight against the thought.</p><p>Dr. Hart cleared her throat and I opened my eyes to look at her again. \u201cDo you remember how you were taken?\u201d Two blinks.</p><p>\u201cHow about how you got to the kitchen where they found you, remember that?\u201d Two blinks again.</p><p>\u201cEmma, do you remember him stabbing you?\u201d Two blinks.</p><p>\u201cHow about calling 911?\u201d Two blinks again.</p> <p>I really wished she\u2019d get to the parts that I didn\u2019t remember. I hated not knowing what had happened, but at the same time, I was relieved...and almost wished I didn\u2019t remember the whole ordeal.</p><p>\u201cEmma...do you remember him choking you?\u201d Two blinks.</p><p>\u201cWhat about after that? Did he do anything that you remember after that?\u201d One blink.</p><p>\u201cOkay. It might be hard to hear, but do you want me to tell you what happened?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated for a second, and then blinked twice. Luke\u2019s chair scraped the floor as he stood quickly, shoving the chair back from his legs. He leaned down and lightly touched his lips to my forehead, murmuring that he\u2019d be back in a minute. A frown furrowed my brows, but I nodded slightly and he strode out into the hall.</p><p>Dr. Hart perched on the edge of the chair that Luke had just vacated and took a deep breath. She flipped open my chart and proceeded to tell me what had happened after I blacked out.</p> <p>From what they could tell, I had passed out from oxygen deprivation and loss of blood. Once my 911 call had come through to dispatch, they had traced the number to the address and the police, fire, and squad were sent out. Apparently the dispatcher was able to hear everything that was going on because Creepy was very talkative, even when I was out. She was able to radio the first officers on scene and tell them everything that was happening.</p><p>Shockingly, the front door of the house was unlocked so they were able to sneak into the house and arrest John Frank as he sat astride my unconscious, bloody, and badly beaten body. The doctor had swallowed thickly before telling me that he\u2019d been punching my breasts and pinching them violently as he ranted that I\u2019d emasculated him. After she told me this and then clarified that there had been no sexual assault whatsoever other than to my breasts, I breathed a sigh of relief, thankful that he hadn\u2019t been able to do more to me, and then smiled with deep satisfaction over the injuries I had caused him.</p><p>Dr. Hart said he\u2019d had to be treated before incarcerated, because I\u2019d ruptured one of his testicles, and his penis had been lacerated from my nails. He was now in jail awaiting trial, and the judge had ordered that bond be set at $200,000.00 because he was considered a flight risk, not to mention the severity of the crime.</p><p>The doctor had then inventoried my injuries for me. I had a gash on the side of my head that required eight stitches from when he initially hit me and put me in his car. I had severe bruising on my throat, shoulders, arms, legs, breasts, and face, including two black eyes. I had a split lip, lacerations on the inside of my mouth, a broken nose, two cracked ribs, and a knot on the back of my head where it\u2019d hit the concrete wall, which caused a concussion. Thankfully, though, when he\u2019d stabbed me, he\u2019d missed all my vital organs; the blade had slid in, almost nicking my ribs, but had passed through only my flesh before piercing through the other side. I had twenty-five stitches on the front of my side, and thirteen on the back. Because of all the injuries and blood I\u2019d lost, they\u2019d kept me in an induced coma but tried to bring me out of it after a week. Apparently I hadn\u2019t wanted to.</p><p>When Dr. Hart got done telling me everything, she checked the dressings on my head and side, as well as my vitals and everything. She finished and she and the nurse both patted my hand and left the room. I closed my eyes for a second, feeling them well with tears. I blinked them back when Luke came back in the room, my mom and dad right behind him.</p><p>I smiled tremulously at them, the tears that threatened spilling over and running down my cheeks unchecked. They approached the bed, my dad leaning in to kiss my forehead gently, my mom sitting carefully on the bed beside me, laying her cheek lightly against mine. We all sat there in silence for a moment, before they pulled back and asked how I was feeling. We visited for a bit, mom filling me in on everything that\u2019s happened since, dad sitting quietly by my side, until I looked around, realizing that Luke wasn\u2019t in the room. I raised my eyebrows in question, gesturing with my hand for someone to tell me where he went.</p><p>My mom smiled at me. \u201cHe\u2019s a good boy, Emma. Stayed by your side this whole time. I think he even tore the town apart looking for you. I\u2019m glad you found him.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, and it turned into a grin when my dad grunted his agreement. My grin didn\u2019t last long because of the pain, but I managed to whisper, \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>My parents only stayed a few minutes more before they took their leave, kissing me on my forehead and promising to send Luke in. He was by my side in an instant, holding my hand as I drifted off into an exhausted, but healing, sleep.</p><p>They kept me in the hospital for observation for another week. By the time they let me go, my room was stuffed to the gills with cards, flowers, balloons, and other gifts from all my visitors. Allie, Brandon, Jackson, and all my family visited every day. Hayden and Jarrod had both cried the first time they saw me and Luke had helped them sit carefully on the bed beside me so I could hold them. Allie would come sit with me every evening and we\u2019d play cards or talk, or even just sit in silence, enjoying each other\u2019s company. Luke never left my side unless someone else was in the room with me. I don\u2019t think he actually wanted to leave me even then, but I made him go home and take a shower and get some sleep.</p><p>Calland smuggled in chicken fettucini alfredo and black tie mousse cake from Manny\u2019s for me but got caught by my nurse coming in the door. He begged and pleaded (which surprised me) for her to let him give it to me and she \u201cgave in\u201c to him. Neither my nurse nor I had the heart to tell him that I was allowed to eat whatever I wanted now. Hey, I was just impressed that he actually remembered my favorite meal from my favorite restaurant, and he sprung for dessert!</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief as Luke pulled up at the house and came around to help me in. They\u2019d taken all the stitches out and my bruises were all fading. My ribs, my nose, my head, and my side were the things that still hurt the most, but it was manageable if I took my time with everything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grinned as the front door opened before I could turn the knob and tears filled my eyes as I looked at my whole family, all my friends, and even my boss filling the living room, yelling welcome home and holding signs with different messages for me.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>My welcome home party was great, but exhausting. Everyone stayed for a while eating, drinking, and generally just hanging out while taking turns talking to me and hugging me constantly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever felt so loved in my life!</p><p>When everyone had cleared out except for Allie and the guys, Allie came and sat next to me on the couch while the guys cleaned everything up.</p> <p>\u201cEmma...\u201d Allie began, haltingly. Her eyes began to swim with tears and I shook my head at her, silently pleading for no more crying. She blinked rapidly, trying to keep them from falling.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t being heartless; I just knew that if she started crying I would, too. But I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d stop.</p><p>Allie cleared her throat and began again. \u201cWhen Luke called me, asking if you\u2019d called me, I just got this overwhelming feeling that something wasn\u2019t right. It really...I just...God, Em, I didn\u2019t know what to think. And then Brandon called and said that Luke was going apeshit nuts because he\u2019d gone down to the office and found your car still sitting there with the doors unlocked and the keys kicked under it...I couldn\u2019t even hardly understand him.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes for a second. It was hard to hear, hard to think about, but at the same time, I wanted to know what had happened while I was gone.</p><p>\u201cI flew over here. Your parents and sisters and Calland were here, and Noah, of course, and your poor mom was trying to calm Luke down. Even Jackson was going crazy! I think what had gotten Luke the most was the fact that they found blood splattered on the car and on the ground. I guess it was from when he hit you?\u201d She blinked quickly again, but it didn\u2019t help. The tears were flowing down her cheeks and my eyes were starting to water, too.</p> <p>\u201cI guess...I just...I wanted you to know that he didn\u2019t give up on you. WE didn\u2019t give up on you. But most especially, the fact that if you didn\u2019t know it already, Luke is head over heels in love with you and he wasn\u2019t letting you go without a fight.\u201d</p><p>I smiled a watery smile at her while she reached out and grabbed my hand, holding it tightly. \u201cHe almost got arrested...did you know that?\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened and I gaped at her in shock. \u201cWhat? No! I didn\u2019t know that...what happened?\u201d</p><p>Allie grinned, wiping her eyes with her fingertips. \u201cHe was going crazy trying to get to you while they were unloading you from the ambulance and getting you in a treatment room. He was yelling your name like mad, yelling at them to let him go with you, jumping up and over people...it was insane. They called security on him and the only thing that saved him was Noah jumping in and flashing his badge, promising that he would get him under control. He did...barely...but he finally calmed down when they let him sit beside you. He didn\u2019t ever leave your side. Brandon and Jackson came in to see you whenever the nurses would allow, and then camped out in the waiting room along with all of us. It was a loooong two weeks!\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in fond disbelief, glancing over my shoulder to where Luke was putting food away in the kitchen. He looked up and caught my eye, winking and grinning back at me.</p><p>Allie finally left around midnight, saying she needed to get a couple things done at home before work in the morning. I shrieked as Luke lifted me off the couch into his arms and carried me upstairs to bed. Doug followed but was sorely disappointed when Luke told him he wasn\u2019t allowed in tonight. Poor thing hadn\u2019t left my side since I came back home. He huffed out a big doggy sigh and padded back downstairs, more than likely to crawl into bed with Brandon or to sit on Jackson on the couch.</p> <p>I crawled into bed after stripping my clothes off, not bothering to put any pajamas on. Luke made quick work of his own clothes and slid into bed beside me, gathering me into his arms gently. We hadn\u2019t been alone, really alone, in three weeks. Honestly, I just wanted to wrap myself up in him and let him help me forget.</p><p>I tilted my head up, my lips finding his in the darkness. He kissed me softly, sweetly, his lips brushing back and forth across mine. I tried to deepen the kiss but he wouldn\u2019t let me. I pressed myself against his warmth, loving the feel of his hardness against my softness. He let the kiss deepen a little at a time, holding back for my sake, not wanting to spook me.</p><p>I finally had enough of his gentleness; I wanted him to make me feel alive and loved! I wanted it all, just like it was before. I pushed against his chest and pressed him back to the bed, rising up over him and straddling his hips with my thighs. I slowly slid my slickness against the hard heat of him, smiling in the darkness at his primal groan that rolled through the room.</p><p>He brought his hands up to grip my hips, his fingers tightening before releasing almost immediately. I growled in my throat and grabbed his hands, pulling them back to my hips and pressing his fingers into my flesh. He made a sound of protest and tried to pull away.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I half-yelled. \u201cStop treating me like I\u2019m going to break! I\u2019m sore but I need this...I need YOU! Goddamn, it! Fuck me already!\u201d</p><p>I heard his breath release on a gasp. \u201cEmma...I don\u2019t want to hurt you, baby. Your side...you just had the stitches out and you still have the cracked ribs. We can be gentle tonight, sugar...don\u2019t rush it.\u201d He was murmuring softly to me, trying to placate me.</p><p>\u201cLuke, that\u2019s not what I want. I told you what I want.\u201d My tone brooked no argument, but I could still tell that he wanted to argue. So I did what I had to. I positioned myself, wincing a little when my ribs twinged, and even as Luke started to protest, I slid down onto him, seating myself fully over his hardness. I started to move, slamming myself down on him, trying to adjust to a rhythm that would allow me to move without hurting.</p><p>Luke, sensing that I was hurting a bit, began thrusting up into me, holding me still with his hands on my hips. I allowed him to set the pace, content to feel his strong thrusts between my thighs until they were trembling and I was hanging on the edge, ready to explode. My head thrown back, I went over, cresting and riding the waves as my body clenched rhythmically around his hot, thrusting length, bringing him over the edge with me, coming hard and slamming himself home one last time as he filled me.</p> <p>As soon as he quit shuddering beneath me, he sat up, gently taking me in his arms and laying me beside him. I heard him swear softly before leaning up over me.</p><p>\u201cEmma...you were hurting and I didn\u2019t want that to happen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, its fine. I just...I wanted it normal. Okay?\u201d I closed my eyes against the tears that were welling.</p><p>Leaning down and resting his forehead against mine, Luke whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby. I love you so much...I...God, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>I just wrapped my arms around him, holding tight as we drifted off to sleep.</p><p>I spent the next couple of weeks lounging around the house and around Skin Deep as much as Luke would allow. I wasn\u2019t allowed to go back to work yet, and as sad as that made me, I didn\u2019t think I was ready to go back just yet. Floyd had called in a \u201cFloater\u201d which is basically a temporary secretary, someone who fills in whenever and wherever needed, either in attorneys offices or in the court offices. She\u2019d called me a couple times to get clarification on a couple things, and sure, she was nice enough, but was lacking that people person vibe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allie finally came to my rescue on the third week that I\u2019d been home with nothing to do. It was Friday night and Luke had a late appointment planned. Brandon had a couple piercings that he was going to do and was going to stick around to ride home with Luke. Jackson had had to go back to L.A. for a couple meetings and wouldn\u2019t be back until late Sunday night. I was almost pulling my hair out with boredom, and even poor Doug had taken to hiding from me because I wouldn\u2019t leave him alone. Maybe I went too far playing dress up with him but, geez! There\u2019s only so much cleaning you can do around a house, only so much thumb twiddling, only so many baths...</p><p>So yeah, Allie saved me. I didn\u2019t even care that she was dragging me to a Down &amp; Dirty party to be her assistant, which is something I usually tried to get out of. We pulled up to the house where the party was to be held and I recognized the neighborhood as my sister\u2019s. Speaking of, Jenna walked down the sidewalk, grinning and holding her arms out to hug me as I got out of the car.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Em, hey, Allie! My neighbor decided to have a fun party and invited me. I wasn\u2019t going to come but then I found out that Allie was going to be the party rep so I couldn\u2019t turn it down. I called Allie last week to make sure she would be the one showing up and she told me she was going to try to get you here, too. I\u2019m glad she did!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too. I think I was going crazy. Did you know that Luke and Brandon have exactly 242 DVD\u2019s? I didn\u2019t either. Until I alphabetized them.\u201d</p><p>That made them look at me weird for a minute, but it was quickly forgotten as we headed inside and lost ourselves for a couple hours in the land of Nipple Dip, Slick Dick, Jack Rabbits and Turtle Tools.</p><p>On Monday, since I wasn\u2019t allowed to go back to work until after my doctor\u2019s appointment the next day, I headed into Skin Deep with Luke and Brandon. The lobby started to fill up with their clients and even a couple walk-ins, so I stationed myself behind the counter and answered the phone, scheduled some appointments, and generally got people where they needed to be, when they needed to be there.</p><p>That night while we were lying in bed, Luke turned to me with an earnest look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUmmm...that look kinda scares me. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing. I was just kinda thinking...it actually helped having you there at the shop today. So, would you maybe think about not going back to work for Floyd and just working at the shop with me? I mean, I\u2019ll pay you, but you really don\u2019t even have to work if you don\u2019t want to...\u201d He trailed off, looking really uncertain.</p><p>It surprised me that he brought it up, especially because I had been toying with the idea of asking him if I could help out at the shop. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to work for Floyd anymore; he was a great boss and I really would miss that job. Honestly, it was more just the fact that I liked being there with Luke and Brandon, helping out my boys. And I guess if I was being completely honest, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to face the parking lot where I was taken yet.</p><p>I made a noncommittal sound and turned over, pretending to fall asleep. I had to hold my breath to keep from laughing when Luke let out a loud sigh, muttering to himself about ungrateful women. I fell asleep with a smile on my face, thinking that I\u2019d let him stew for a bit before I accepted his offer.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I screamed. \u201cFor the last fucking time, I am NOT, I REPEAT- NOT going to get a tattoo of Luke\u2019s penis on my ass! So QUIT suggesting it, Brandon!\u201d</p><p>I glared at Brandon as he leaned against the wall behind the counter, laughing so hard his face was turning red. Luke had been coming up with ideas for my tattoo like I had asked him to back around Christmas, and Brandon had decided to start chiming in with ideas and, let me tell ya, none of them were usable.</p> <p>It\u2019d been four months since I was attacked outside Floyd\u2019s office. I had never actually went back to work for Floyd, though I did help him out from time to time when he called. He was in the process of trying to find another secretary to take my place, but for now was using the floater pool. I don\u2019t think he was very happy with it, but he couldn\u2019t blame me for not returning full time.</p><p>I\u2019d taken Luke up on his offer and now basically was the front woman for Skin Deep. I handled all the scheduling, supply ordering, and even took over the books. The shop was busier than ever and Luke had even hired a couple of the part time guys on for full time. Needless to say, Jadalee wasn\u2019t one of them, even though she was back home again to help her mom. She pretty much stayed away from the shop, although she had actually come and apologized to me for the way she acted. Being the nice person that I am, I graciously accepted it before extending an invitation to my wedding. Where I\u2019d be marrying Luke. (Hee hee hee...)</p><p>Allie spent quite a bit of time at the shop and at our house, which was almost a given because she was helping me plan the wedding. We had finally set the date for next spring and I\u2019d even picked out my colors. I was going with hot pink and black with silver accents, and that\u2019s only because I found a pair of stiletto heels that I HAD to have and wanted to wear them with my wedding dress for the wedding (whenever I finally found one I liked). They were hot pink with a black skull and crossbones design on the back of the heel area. The skull had a little silver bow on its head! I loved them so much that I was going to make that my wedding theme but Jenna threatened to disown me if I did. I conceded the theme but I\u2019m still wearing the shoes.</p><p>Allie also spent quite a bit of time with Brandon and Jackson, but swore that they were all just friends. I wished she\u2019d finally just come to terms with the fact that she was in love with them both and do something about it. I think she just couldn\u2019t get her mind around the fact that you weren\u2019t supposed to be in love with more than one person. I wasn\u2019t sure how she couldn\u2019t because her parents were major hippies and touted \u201cFree Love\u201d all throughout our childhood...thank God they\u2019d mellowed over the years. I shuddered at the unbidden thought of them having an orgy that flitted through my mind. Ugh.</p><p>I shook my head to clear it and grabbed the stack of drawings Luke held out to me. He leaned in and kissed me sweetly on my lips before smacking Brandon upside his head as he walked past him, leading his next client into his studio. I shuffled through them and my breath whooshed out on a sigh as I saw it. It was perfect and I couldn\u2019t wait for Luke to tattoo it!</p><p>He\u2019d drawn a single feather with stunning and intricate detail. The top of the feather looked like it was being blown away, almost disintegrating, but instead of there being nothing, a multitude of small birds flowed from it, interspersed with stars of varying sizes. I decided then and there that I would have it put on my shoulder blade, but I wanted the birds and stars to go up over my shoulder.</p><p>I looked at the drawing again, and noted that I had missed one small detail. Along the spine of the feather in small script were the words \u2018Always Ever\u2019. I felt tears prick my eyes as I realized that Luke hadn\u2019t forgotten the story I\u2019d told him a long time ago about Jarrod when he was little. My mom had told him one day that she loved him and would always and forever. Since he was barely two at the time, he had responded with Always Ever, not getting the for in forever. From that point on, that was the little saying we had all used to say I love you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>I waited (impatiently, might I add) for Luke to finish up with his client and as soon as he got near the counter, I jumped into his arms, kissing him deeply. He kissed me back for a minute before pulling back and looking at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, but...\u201d He grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cJust because I love you and because you drew me the perfect tattoo and because you listen when I talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find one that you like?\u201d He set me on my feet and grabbed the stack, looking at the one I\u2019d left on top. He smiled down at me as I burrowed into his side. \u201cI figured this would be the one. Don\u2019t know why I even drew any of the others up afterwards.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I still cant get them, you know.\u201d I grinned up at him mischievously as he laughed and hugged me close.</p><p>\u201cAnd to think you were yelling at Allie about not getting one the first time you walked into my shop. Scared to death...\u201d he trailed off, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. And look what it got me. I\u2019m stuck with you, Brandon, Jackson, and Doug for the rest of my life. What\u2019d I do to deserve that?\u201d I asked teasingly.</p><p>\u201cYou complainin\u2019, sugar?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so. Now lets go stick some needles in you!\u201d I laughed as he pulled me down the hall into his studio.</p><p>It hurt way worse than my first one, but I got my tattoo. I was in love with it almost as much as I was with Luke.</p><p>And for the record...sex in the tattoo studio is HOT. Just sayin\u2019. </p>  </body></html>"]
