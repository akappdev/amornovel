She might regard him as her hero, or she may place him so high on a pedestal that no object of her affection could ever compare. To me, my father deserved more than respect, or loyalty, or even love. I had a reverence for him. He was more than Superman; he was God.</p><p>One of my earliest memories was of two men cowering in my father\u2019s office as he spoke words I didn\u2019t understand. His verdict was always final and never argued with. Not even death could touch him.</p> <p>When I answered my phone on December fourteenth, that reality came to an end.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d my mother sighed, \u201che doesn\u2019t have much time. You should come now.\u201d</p><p>I set the phone beside me on the bed, careful to keep my hands from trembling so much that it tumbled to the floor. The past few weeks had been an alternate universe for me, as I had been faced with one horrible cal after another. The first from a nurse at the hospital informing me of my father\u2019s car accident. My number was the most recently dialed on his cel phone, leaving me with the horrifying task of being the one to break the news to my mother. In his last days, when reports of no improvement were replaced with gentle suggestions to prepare for the inevitable, I was thankful to be at the receiving end of the phone cal s.</p><p>It felt strange to walk across the room and grab my coat and keys. The tasks seemed too mundane to begin the journey to say goodbye to my father. I lamented the ordinary life that seemed so long ago as I walked out to my car and turned the ignition.</p><p>My father had risen to the top of the shipping industry ruling with an iron fist, but I knew the gentle side of him. The man that left important meetings to take my trivial phone cal s, kissed my scrapes, and rewrote fairytales so that the princess always saved the prince. Now he lay helpless in his bed, fading away in the vast bedroom he shared with my mother.</p> <p>Our housekeeper, Agatha, greeted me at the front door. \u201cYour mother\u2019s expecting you, Love. You best get upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Agatha took my coat, and then I climbed the stairs, feeling the bile rise higher in my throat with every step.</p><p>His private nurse brushed past me as I entered the room, and I winced at the sight of him. His face was sal ow with a thin sheen of perspiration, and his usual y clean shaven jaw was darkened with whiskers that crowded his parched lips. My mother spoke soft, comforting words to him as his chest heaved with every labored breath. The muted beeps and humming of the pumps and monitors were the background music to my worst nightmare.</p><p>Like the other times I\u2019d visited my father since his accident, my legs transformed into deep-seeded roots that tunneled through my shoes and plunged into the wooden floor. I couldn\u2019t go forward or retreat.</p><p>My mother looked up with weary heartbreak in her eyes. \u201cNina,\u201d she cal ed. \u201cCome, dear.\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted to summon me forward but my feet wouldn\u2019t move. She sighed in understanding and walked toward me, her arm stil reaching out in front of her. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of my father\u2019s feeble attempts to breathe as she cupped her fingers around each of my shoulders and eased me forward. After a few reluctant steps, I stopped again.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Peeling my shoes from the floor, I let her guide me to his bedside. My first instinct was to help him, but the only thing left to do was to wait for his suffering to end.</p><p>\u201cJack, darling,\u201d my mother said in a soothing tone. \u201cNina\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>After watching him struggle for sufficient breath, I leaned down to whisper in his ear. \u201cI\u2019m here, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>His breath skipped a bit and he mumbled inaudibly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to talk. Just rest.\u201d My shaking fingers reached out to his hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCynthia?\u201d My father\u2019s attorney and friend, Thomas Rosen, cal ed to my mother from the back corner of the room. With a pained expression she glanced at my father, clutched me to her chest for a moment, and then quietly walked to Thomas\u2019 side. Their voices became a stream of humming no louder than the machines attached to my father.</p><p>He sucked in another breath while I tenderly swept his salt and pepper hair away from his moist brow. \u201cNeen...,\u201d he swal owed, \u201cNina.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes wandered to my mother, who was in silent conversation, searching her face one last time for a sign of hope. Seeing the sorrow in her eyes, I looked back to my father and prepared to say goodbye.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d I began, but words failed me. My eyes closed as the urge to ease his suffering grew insistent. A faltering breath escaped from my chest and I started again. \u201cI should tel you that it\u2019s okay...that you don\u2019t have to stay for me, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His breathing slowed. He was listening to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want be the one to let you go, Daddy. I want you to get better. But, I know that you\u2019re tired. So if you want to sleep...I\u2019l be okay.\u201d The corners of his mouth shook as they attempted to turn up.</p><p>My mouth smiled as my face crumpled around it. \u201cI\u2019l miss you, Daddy. I\u2019m going to miss you so much.\u201d I sucked in another breath and he did the same, but his was different this time. He had no more fight left in him.</p><p>I glanced back to my mother, who watched me with heavy, wet eyes. He took in another deep breath and slowly exhaled. His life slipped away as the last bit of oxygen left his lungs. The sound reminded me of a tire losing air, slow and level until there was nothing left. His body relaxed, and his eyes became vacant and unfocused.</p><p>The nurse silenced the solid tone of the heart monitor while I scanned his peaceful face. The realization that my father was gone washed over me in waves. My insides wrenched, and my arms and legs felt foreign, as if they no longer belonged to me. I nodded and smiled, ignoring the tears that spil ed over my cheeks. He trusted my words, and so he let go.</p><p>Thomas touched my shoulder and moved to the head of the bed. He reached over to place his hands over my father\u2019s eyes and whispered something beautiful in Hebrew. I leaned over my father\u2019s chest and hugged him. For the first time in my life, he didn\u2019t hug me back.</p><p>Looking down to my hands, I scanned the obituary from the funeral. Separated by a dash, the dates of my father\u2019s birth and death were displayed in elegant font on the front cover. I grimaced with the recognition that such a short line of ink was meant to signify his life.</p><p>The paper fit snugly in the inside pocket of my coat just as the wet sloshing of bus tires approached, slowing to a stop in front of me.</p><p>The door opened, but I didn\u2019t look up. The sounds of commuters stepping out onto the sidewalk never came. My neighbors had little need for public transportation, specifical y so late in the evening. Those that used it at al were the hired service that worked in the colossal residences nearby.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>The bus driver cleared his throat to get my attention, and when I failed to acknowledge him, the door swept shut. The air breaks released, and the bus slowly pul ed away from the curb. I tried not to think about the day that had just taken place, but my memory became saturated with it.</p><p>Just as I did in childhood, I rocked back and forth to comfort myself. The warm peach hue had long since left my fingers, reminding me of my father\u2019s folded hands as he lay in his coffin.</p><p>A frigid breath of air flooded my lungs and my chest heaved, giving way to the sob that had been clawing its way to the surface. I had thought moments before that my eyes couldn\u2019t cry anymore, and I wondered how much more I would have to endure before my body would final y be too exhausted to continue.</p><p>\u201cCold night, huh?\u201d</p><p>I sniffed and shot an annoyed glance to the man settling into the space next to me. I hadn\u2019t heard him approach. He breathed on his hands, rubbed them together and then offered a reassuring grin.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I answered.</p><p>He looked down at his watch and sighed. \u201cDamn it,\u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201cGuess we missed the last bus.\u201d</p><p>He pul ed a cel phone from the pocket of his black motorcycle jacket and dialed. He greeted someone and then requested a taxi.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to share a cab?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I peered over at him, immediately suspicious. His blue-grey eyes narrowed as he raised one eyebrow at my expression. I must have looked like a maniac, and he was reconsidering his offer.</p><p>I folded my arms, suddenly feeling the discomfort of winter breaking through my coat, seeping into my skin, piercing through to my bones. I had to get back to school; I stil had a paper to write.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you,\u201d I said with a shaky voice.</p><p>After an awkward moment of silence, the man spoke again. \u201cYou work around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I hesitated to continue the conversation but found myself curious. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>How odd. He didn\u2019t look like hired help. I glanced at his watch out of the corner of my eye. Definitely not help.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cI\u2019m...involved in the home security sector,\u201d he nodded, seeming to agree with himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a student,\u201d I offered, trying to clear the ridiculous quivering in my voice.</p><p>He stared at me with an expression I couldn\u2019t quite decipher, and then looked forward again. He was older than I, though not by more than five or six years. I wondered if he knew who I was. There was a glimmer of familiarity in his eyes, though I couldn\u2019t quite place it.</p><p>His cel phone vibrated, and he opened it to read a text message. He attempted to hide an emotion and then snapped the phone closed without replying, and didn\u2019t speak again until the cab arrived.</p><p>He opened the door for me, and I scooted over to the farthest end of the seat while he slid in behind the driver.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d the cabbie asked in a throaty voice.</p><p>\u201cBrown University,\u201d I instructed. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-Huh. One stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d my unanticipated companion said.</p><p>I noted that he was careful not to mention his address, and that struck me as odd. Maybe it wasn\u2019t odd at al ; maybe I was more curious about him than I would have liked to admit. I was surprised that I had noticed anything at the moment, and found myself grateful to this stranger for the diversion he\u2019d inadvertently created for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jared by the way,\u201d he grinned, holding his hand out to take mine.</p><p>\u201cNina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, your hands are freezing!\u201d he said, clasping his other hand over mine.</p><p>I pul ed my hand away, noting his exceptional y warm grip. I watched him for a moment, listening to any inner voices that might have sensed danger, but the only feeling that stood out was curiosity.</p><p>After the realization of his offense, he apologized with a smal smile. I tucked my hair behind my ears and stared out the window. The wind whipped around outside, blowing the col ecting flakes across the road like white snakes slithering ahead. I shivered at the image and pul ed my coat tighter around me.</p><p>\u201cBrown, huh?\u201d Jared asked. His cel phone vibrated in his pocket and he flipped it open once again.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBrown.\u201d He continued to look at me so I offered more, \u201cBusiness major.\u201d</p><p>The residual frustration from the unwanted cal er melted away once our eyes met. It seemed as if he\u2019d just noticed I\u2019d been crying.</p><p>\u201cAre you al right?\u201d</p><p>I looked down, picking at my nails. \u201cWe buried my father today.\u201d It occurred to me that I had no idea why I was sharing such personal information with a stranger.</p><p>\u201cYou were close,\u201d Jared said. It was more of a statement than a question.</p><p>I waited for the expected pity in his eyes, but there was none. My relief caused me to smile which in turn made a grin turn up one side of his mouth. I noticed then that he had a nice face. It was more than nice, now that it had come to my attention. He was quite attractive, real y....</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your place?\u201d The cabbie squawked. I peeled my eyes from Jared and pointed in the direction of my dorm. \u201cEast Andrews Hal .\u201d</p><p>The cab pul ed in, and Jared automatical y stepped out. As soon as his door had shut, mine opened.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, Nina.\u201d There was an edge to his words. It went beyond politeness or even sincerity. He spoke the words with conviction.</p><p>I nodded and side-stepped toward my dorm. He paused before getting into the cab to smile at me once more, and for the first time in weeks I felt something other than hol ow. I watched the cab pul away and then turned against the wind to walk toward Andrews.</p><p>Once inside my room, I noticed my appearance in the mirror and gasped. Good God, it was no wonder that Jared felt compel ed to come to my aide! I looked like a homeless, desperate crack addict overdue for my next fix! My brush ripped through my blonde bob and I pul ed my bangs straight back, pinning them away from my face. I went to the sink and scrubbed away the smeared mascara and streaky foundation.</p><p>With a frown, I pul ed my cel phone from my pocket and pressed the speed dial to cal my mother.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cBack in my room, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cGood. You know I don\u2019t like for you to take the bus. Robert could have driven you. Take two of those pil s I gave you today, al right? They\u2019l help you sleep.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. My mother: the frequent flier of Providence drug stores.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l probably fal asleep the second my head hits the pil ow.\u201d Not the pure truth, but it would do to keep my personal pharmacist at bay.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Darling. Sleep wel .\u201d</p><p>My dorm room seemed smal er. The white wal s were pitiful y empty on my side. Feeling I was being watched, I peeked across the room at my roommate. Her side of the room was covered in posters of teddy bears and team colors. My decor consisted of an ornamental frame on my night table displaying a picture of me and my parents at high school graduation just a few months before.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your mom?\u201d Beth asked from under her baby pink comforter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s...sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d I sighed. My conclusive tone seemed to relax Beth, and while I changed into my pajamas I noticed her breathing even out.</p><p>I sat on my bed and pul ed myself against the pil ows. My thoughts effortlessly moved toward the last hour. Jared\u2019s grin kept my mind occupied for awhile, but before long my thoughts brought me back to the funeral. I rol ed onto my side and curled into a bal , trying to cry quietly. Relief final y replaced the crushing grief as I slipped out of consciousness.</p> <p>I turned to the side and blinked my eyes, noting the large, red numbers on the clock. Five A.M. had come quickly. My eyes felt swol en and scratchy.</p><p>It was then that I realized my dreams had been cruel. There would be no miracles, and my father was stil gone.</p><p>The finale of the worst experience of my life hadn\u2019t ended with what was supposed to be my closure.</p><p>I clambered from my bed and opened my laptop, determined to finish my term paper by eight. The screen lit up, and I peered over at Beth, her head buried under her pil ow. My fingers tapped out the next cross-reference and soon began a muted symphony of clicking against the keyboard.</p><p>The paragraphs formed swiftly and I finished by a quarter after seven. With a click of the mouse, the printer lurched and buzzed with its new task. I looked over at Beth, knowing a newspaper press wouldn\u2019t wake her. I gathered my toiletries to make my daily commute down the hal to the showers.</p> <p>Red-faced and sufficiently exfoliated, I tightened my robe and walked down the hal . While brushing my teeth over the quaint sink in our room, Beth sat up in bed and stretched out her arms. Her chin-length auburn hair was smashed in some places, and stuck out in others.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she chirped. Then reality set in. \u201cOh...I mean....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Beth. It is a nice morning.\u201d Glancing out the window, I noticed the sky was looking bleaker from the onset, but I wasn\u2019t going to mention that.</p><p>Beth smiled and began making her bed, setting her stuffed animals haphazardly in front of her fril y pil ow.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to the game Saturday?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d</p> <p>She usual y invited me to go, and at times insisted I go, always in her cheery, pleasant voice. Beth hailed from the south. She worked hard and had been awarded numerous scholarships to make her escape from the smal Oklahoma town she cal ed home. Her side of the room was covered in trophies, sashes and crowns from the numerous pageants she\u2019d entered and won. She wasn\u2019t the typical beauty queen. Although beautiful, she seemed very introverted\u2014a trait she was trying desperately to break away from. She explained to me the day we moved in that the pageants were a necessary evil for tuition.</p><p>\u201cWel , I\u2019l give you a break this week if you decide to opt out. I\u2019d understand with finals and...everything else,\u201d she conceded without looking in my direction.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>I pul ed my hair back into a smal burst of ponytail at the nape of my neck, looking like a bouquet of wheat shooting out from the back of my head. I sighed at my closet and gave myself a pep talk before dressing in the inevitable layers: one after another; bra, tank top, undershirt, sweater, socks, jeans, boots, coat\u2014and not always in that order.</p><p>With my backpack bursting at the seams, I pul ed up the handle and angled the bag onto its wheels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going early for coffee.\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled as she booted up her laptop. \u201cGood luck getting that thing across the ice.\u201d</p><p>I stepped out of the elevator into the hal way wondering if Beth was right about the weather. I held my breath and pushed the door open, waiting for the freezing temperature to sting my face. The wind blew the heavy glass door against me, working against the already pitiful pressure I had managed with one hand. Using my arm and shoulder, I forced the door open and gasped at the frigid burst of air burning my face.</p> <p>I stumbled into the dining hal the student populace affectionately and appropriately dubbed \u201cThe Ratty\u201d, and brushed off my coat. Shuffling across the muted tile floor, I made a bee-line for the coffee pot. Dark, brown liquid created the steam that would help me function that early in the morning.</p><p>Out of habit, I reached for my favorite hazelnut creamer and two packets of Splenda.</p><p>\u201cThat stuff is death in a package, you know,\u201d Kim said from behind me.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like my mother,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you came today. Sucks that your dad died during finals.\u201d</p><p>Kim was never one for holding back or mincing words. I usual y found it very refreshing, but I hadn\u2019t had time to brace myself before the words left her lips, and my ribs wrenched in response.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Kim watched me for a moment, and then shoved a blueberry corn muffin at my face.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, uncrossing my eyes from looking at the muffin. \u201cNo, thanks. I need to get to class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l walk with you,\u201d she said, pul ing the muffin back.</p><p>Kim pul ed a faded, red plaid hunter\u2019s cap complete with ear covers over her short brown hair. If I thought I could laugh, I would have.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kim,\u201d I said, attempting to make my voice sound cautious.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, stopping in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I shook my head, deciding to leave it alone.</p><p>If any hat could be made for Kim, it was the ridiculous atrocity she\u2019d placed on her head. Kim was above average in height, a head tal er than my five feet, seven inches. Her short, caramel- colored hair framed her face in care free waves. Crazy and unpredictable as she was, people were drawn to her. I knew we would be friends the moment I met her in the hal way of Andrews; I couldn\u2019t fathom having someone more interesting in my life.</p><p>Kim walked with me across campus to class, keeping my mind from more somber thoughts by regaling me with her most recent week of fantastic mishaps and blunders. She never failed to entertain me with her unbridled honesty and lack of brain-to-mouth filter.</p><p>Once in class, Kim leaned toward me and kept her voice low. \u201cSo, the funeral....\u201d</p><p>I squirmed in my seat. \u201cI...don\u2019t real y want to....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Yeah. So...it was yesterday?\u201d Unlike Beth, Kim didn\u2019t avoid unpleasantness. At times she seemed to slam face first into it with a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt was very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Kim echoed, nodding. \u201cI tried to cal you last night. You didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get in until late. I missed the last bus and ended up taking a cab.\u201d</p><p>Kim eyed me with disbelief. \u201cThe last bus? I didn\u2019t know public transportation had a curfew.\u201d I considered that for a moment before she continued.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you drive? Your mother picked you up, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ended up sharing a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Kim. Not with my mom,\u201d I deadpanned. \u201cI met a man at the bus stop. We both missed the bus.\u201d I didn\u2019t confess that I\u2019d had a momentary conscious black out and let the bus pul away.</p><p>\u201cYou shared a cab with some random guy at the bus stop? Interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone\u2019s stories end with a dramatic punch line like yours. We just shared a cab,\u201d I said, trying to make my answer sound final.</p><p>\u201cWas he old?\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Kim. He was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask if he was nice. So...he was cute, young...and?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s funeral was yesterday, Kim. I was a mess,\u201d I said, feeling my eyebrows pul together.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I asked, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cCal your dad \u2018Jack\u2019? I thought you were close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. We were. I don\u2019t know...because that\u2019s his name?\u201d Kim stared at me, unimpressed with my answer. I began again, \u201cIt\u2019s always felt weird cal ing him Dad to other people. Just like I wouldn\u2019t cal a boyfriend \u2018Honey\u2019 to you. It\u2019s just...personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , you are the authority on weird.\u201d</p><p>Kim nodded, unaffected by my insult. \u201cSo who was the mystery guy? Does he go here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. His stop was after mine,\u201d I murmured, rol ing my pen between my fingers.</p><p>Because my stop was first, I was curious if he resided near the university, and if I might run into him again. I cringed at the thought of that prospect.</p><p>What would I possibly say to him? \u201cHi, Jared. Remember me? The Alice Cooper look-alike that you shared an awkward cab ride with for twenty minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the face?\u201d Kim\u2019s expression screwed in a way I could only assume mirrored my own.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just...,\u201d I shrugged, \u201che probably thought I was nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could possibly be the most boring story I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Kim said, deflated.</p><p>\u201cI tried to spare you the non-details. He did have a nice smile, though,\u201d I mused.</p><p>Kim looked up at me with renewed interest and opened her mouth to say something, but Professor Hunter walked in the room. I hadn\u2019t noticed the numerous empty seats. Some of the students were tossing their papers on his desk and leaving the way they came instead of meandering to their seats as usual.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you stil doing here? Turn in your papers and get out. Your grades wil be posted on the web site. Happy Holidays,\u201d he said to those of us stil peppered across the room.</p><p>As finals week came to an end, the nightly ritual of curling into a bal to cry seemed to be a permanent fixture in my life. The first week of break, I had a bit more control over the emptiness when it hit. After that, there were a few nights that I escaped the sadness al together. The grief found new strength Christmas night, but to my relief fal ing asleep without tears became a bit easier after the holidays came to a close.</p><p>I found it disconcerting that although time provided some relief, I was also further from when Jack was a part of my life. Each passing day was that much longer since I\u2019d been able to cal him or hear his voice. With time, relief and apprehension intertwined.</p><p>When the spring semester began, Jared had become a blurred image from a day I wanted to file away, so it was a surprise to see him standing a few feet away from me in line at the Urban Outfitters off campus. I wasn\u2019t confident that it was him at first, but when he accepted his receipt from the sales person and turned, I stared at him long enough to be certain. He didn\u2019t suffer from the same hesitation that I did.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyebrows rise while I tried to think of something besides \u2018yes\u2019 to reply with. My mouth opened, but nothing came out.</p><p>He pointed at his chest like he was speaking to a deaf mute. \u201cI\u2019m Jared. We shared a cab?\u201d He patiently waited for me to recal his face, and I realized I hadn\u2019t forgotten an inch of it.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was you,\u201d I said, trying a polite smile. Something was wrong with my throat. It felt dry, and as if I was drowning in my own saliva at the same time. I swal owed hard and tried to remember how not to be a ridiculous teenaged undergrad.</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression skipped from relief to elation as a broad smile appeared across his face. A warm feeling bubbled up from my chest into my face, and I felt the heat release from my cheeks.</p><p>Oh, God, don\u2019t blush! I thought to myself. But it was too late. I had no idea how to recover. \u201cYou seem to be having a better day. Made it to the bus on time and al that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cHow is the security business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d A glimmer touched his eyes that I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to translate.</p><p>Our attention was simultaneously drawn to the phone vibrating in his jacket pocket. He smiled apologetical y before reaching down to silence the distraction.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a pleasant Christmas?\u201d I tried not to cringe once the words left my mouth. Ugh. So unimaginative, I thought.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he quoted.</p><p>I smiled at his teasing. He seemed so comfortable around me. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was confidence or that he was just one of those people that could carry on a conversation with anyone and make them feel he\u2019d known them for years.</p><p>I raised the silver sweater tunic in my hands. \u201cBirthday shopping for my mother.\u201d</p><p>A man behind me cleared his throat, and I realized that we were holding up the line. Jared smiled and took a step backward toward the register. I realized our conversation wasn\u2019t over, and I turned my attention to the red-haired girl behind the counter, trying to conceal my enthusiasm.</p><p>She handed me the receipt, and Jared accompanied me outside. He stared down into my eyes, warmly scanning my face. I didn\u2019t remember him being quite so tal . He towered over me, at least six feet two inches. How had I not noticed the incredible color of his eyes? They seemed to glow as he watched me fidget.</p><p>\u201cAre you from Providence?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said, seeming amused by my awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cDid you go to Brown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>If his eyes weren\u2019t so animated by the conversation, I would have guessed by his short answers that it was my cue to excuse myself with my tail tucked between my legs.</p><p>\u201cReal y? I\u2019m trying to place you. It seems like we\u2019ve met before.\u201d Did I just issue him a pick up line? Fantastic, I\u2019ve now sunk to the level of desperate teenage boys everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s not something I would forget,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just going to grab a bite to eat at the end of the block. Would you join me?\u201d</p><p>I thought I had said yes, but he continued to stare at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes? I mean yes. That would be great.\u201d I tried to smile through my humiliation and wondered if I was always so articulately clumsy. I couldn\u2019t imagine why he was stil speaking to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We walked to the end of the block to cross the street at the light. Jared guided me forward with his hand on the smal of my back, and looked al around us as we crossed. I stifled a giggle; he reminded me of the President\u2019s security detail. The only thing missing was a communication device in his ear and standard issue black Ray-Bans.</p><p>Jared once again opened the door for me. I had seen the restaurant several times, with it being close to campus, but I\u2019d never ventured in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l like it,\u201d he assured me. I paused in a thought wondering if I\u2019d said anything out loud.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Blaze,\u201d the hostess said, motioning to us that she could seat us immediately. The waitress appeared a few moments later, and Jared waited for me to order.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019l have a Dr. Pepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake that two,\u201d Jared said, raising two fingers. His eyes didn\u2019t stray from mine.</p><p>The waitress nodded and left us to each other. I was curious if he would have ordered a beer had he not asked a toddler to accompany him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I thanked you for getting me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActual y, you did,\u201d he said, putting his elbows on the table and crossing his arms.</p> <p>\u201cOh. That night is sort of a blur,\u201d I grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you lost your dad, Nina. I\u2019m glad I was there.\u201d</p><p>I tucked my hair behind my ears. \u201cI\u2019m glad you were there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t the safest idea...sitting alone in the dark. Lots of crazies out there,\u201d his tone was casual, but underneath I caught a hint of anxiousness.</p><p>\u201cI grew up in that neighborhood. It\u2019s safe, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s always safe until something bad happens.\u201d</p> <p>The waitress brought our drinks and asked if we were ready to order. Once again, Jared waited for me to begin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l have the Greek salad,\u201d I said. I glanced over at Jared, who studied me with raised eyebrows and a wry smile. I wasn\u2019t about to be one of those girls, \u201cAnd the linguine.\u201d</p><p>The waitress turned her attention to Jared. \u201cFor you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l have the house salad with blue cheese and the Shrimp Scampi. And would you bring us some of those sweet potato fries, please?\u201d he said, handing the menu to the waitress. Once she left I looked around the restaurant and then peeked over at Jared, who stil hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off me.</p><p>I floundered for conversation under his stare. Jared\u2019s eyes were an incredible blue-grey; they almost glowed against his lightly bronzed skin. His thick brown eyebrows sat atop his almond-shaped eyes and were just slightly darker than his strategical y messy dark blonde hair. His natural highlights glimmered in the early afternoon sun that broke through the windows. He was clearly more than just attractive. I wondered again why he was stil speaking to me.</p><p>\u201cSweet potato fries?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re famous. Wel , they\u2019re famous to me. You have to dip them in these little sauces they give you to ful y appreciate them. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet potato fries,\u201d I said, stil unsure.</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cTrust me.\u201d His cel phone vibrated, and he flipped it open. It was more than a text message this time; he masked an irritated look and pressed it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cRyel,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Righ-el? I was fairly sure that was his last name, but I couldn\u2019t be certain. He lowered his voice and tilted his head away from me. He was unhappy with the cal er, but it was only the tone I could understand; he was speaking what I guessed to be Russian. He was devastatingly handsome, kind, and spoke a second language. If the sweet potato fries turned out to be al that he\u2019d promised, I might have fal en out of my chair.</p><p>He became impatient with the person on the other end of the line and hung up the phone.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he said.</p><p>I shook my head, fielding his apology. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I just inadvertently learned two new things about you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were stil focused on mine, but they were a bit fogged over as if his attention was divided between me and the problem with the cal er.</p><p>\u201cRyel?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMy last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd was that....Russian you were speaking?\u201d I raised my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he sighed. His shoulders relaxed as he exhaled. \u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone speak a second language these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only speak two?\u201d I said, feigning dissatisfaction.</p><p>He laughed, and a new twinge formed in my chest. I couldn\u2019t get over his smile and how remarkable it was, as if he had come straight out of a magazine.</p><p>\u201cI took French in high school. It didn\u2019t stick,\u201d I said, feeling inferior.</p><p>\u201cMy dad spoke fluently. I learned from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your family is from Russia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...no,\u201d Jared said, looking uncomfortable with the question.</p><p>\u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re very popular. Business must be fantastic.\u201d</p><p>His eyes tightened as he studied my face. \u201cBusiness is...,\u201d his eyes softened and he leaned in a bit towards me, meeting my gaze, \u201cbetter than it\u2019s been in a long time.\u201d</p><p>I forced myself to breathe. It felt unnatural when he looked at me like that. \u201cSo you enjoy what you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days more than others,\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd today?\u201d</p><p>He smiled again. Something was amusing him about our conversation, and I wasn\u2019t in on the joke. \u201cToday\u2019s a good day.\u201d</p><p>My attention was diverted to the waitress walking up behind him, bringing our sweet potato fries and salads. Jared looked down at the table and then to me with a calculating grin.</p><p>\u201cFeeling brave?\u201d</p><p>I leaned over to get a better look inside the woven bowl. \u201cYou\u2019re making me awful y nervous over a basket of fries. These should be some earth shattering potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly, potatoes that deserve an introduction.\u201d We both laughed. He picked up a few and dipped them in a cup of strange looking goo.</p><p>\u201cNo ketchup?\u201d I asked, eyeing the misshapen spear in my hand.</p><p>Jared wrinkled his nose. \u201cKetchup is for those who don\u2019t want to taste their food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKetchup is for suckers.\u201d I concentrated on the basket, my eyebrows pressed together.</p><p>Laughter erupted from his throat, and I plunged my fry into the sauce. He took a bite and watched me raise my hand to my mouth. His expression grew playful y anxious as I chewed.</p><p>\u201cNot...bad. Pretty good, actual y,\u201d I said, nodding as I swal owed.</p><p>His face was triumphant. We joked and laughed as we eliminated the remaining fries, and politely discussed the weather through our salads. After we finished our entr\u00e9es, he eyed my empty plate and nodded his head in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI like a girl with an appetite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling we\u2019l be good friends, then,\u201d I laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the first non-Ratty meal I\u2019ve eaten since I\u2019ve been back to school. Thanks for bringing me here.\u201d</p><p>Jared beamed. \u201cIt was absolutely my pleasure. I\u2019m glad we ran into each other.\u201d</p><p>The waitress brought the ticket and Jared scooped it up, placed his card in the pouch and handed it back to her. He looked as if he\u2019d just won the lottery. I couldn\u2019t believe that my enjoyment of some alternately flavored french fries had made him so cheerful.</p><p>He helped me with my coat. I wasn\u2019t the type of girl to enjoy gal antry, but the casual way he went about it made me a tad giddy. I picked up my Urban Outfitters bag, and he fol owed me outside.</p><p>\u201cYou walked?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cI walked.\u201d I tucked my hair behind my ears and waited for him to be chivalrous again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting colder. Do you mind if I drive you?\u201d he asked, shoving his hands in his jeans pockets.</p><p>The grin that swept across my face was uncontainable. \u201cDo you remember where I live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrews, right?\u201d he said. I nodded, and he seemed pleased that he could give me the correct answer. \u201cI\u2019m this way,\u201d he said, directing me down the street.</p><p>Jared parked beside the curb next to my dorm, and I subliminal y wil ed him to ask for my number, for another date, anything. I didn\u2019t want to have to wait so long this time before I saw him again.</p><p>\u201cThanks again,\u201d I said, stal ing.</p><p>He smiled, but it wasn\u2019t as broad as it was during lunch. He seemed to be as disappointed as I was that our brief encounter was over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Truly, the pleasure was mine.\u201d</p><p>He stepped out and less than a second later, opened my door. I stood to face him and after a smal pause, began making the walk to my dorm. A sense of urgency overcame my nervousness and I turned on my heels.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t moved. Standing in front of his black Escalade, he looked exactly like a security guard. The glass was blacked out, and it looked more like a scene in the Middle East than on a quiet Providence street.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I pul ed my cel phone from my purse to ask for his number, but the words left me. I gulped as his eyes pierced through mine. I didn\u2019t know if the attraction was mutual, but on my end at least, it was intense.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l run into each other again,\u201d he said, grinning. I started to argue, but what could I say? If I wondered aloud how soon that would be, I would sound more desperate than I wanted.</p><p>\u201cIt was good to see you again, Nina,\u201d he said, before disappearing behind the dark tint of his windows.</p><p>I smiled and waved, then continued my trek to Andrews.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Invitation(s)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining again,\u201d Kim grumbled. \u201cThat\u2019s something new and different.\u201d She lit her cigarette and jostled her knees back and forth to ward off the cold. I gave her a disapproving look. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real y disgusting. My father smoked cigars. I just don\u2019t get the appeal.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThere is no appeal. I\u2019m a non-conformist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a masochist,\u201d I said, rol ing my eyes.</p><p>We waited outside for Beth to finish her class, planning to kidnap her to the nearest coffee shop off campus. A group of students emerged in mass exodus, and I scanned each face. I noticed a shaggy-haired boy break away from the river of students and smile at Kim.</p><p>\u201cHey, Josh,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kimmie. Did you get the calculus homework finished?\u201d</p><p>Kim shrugged. \u201cI\u2019l do it before class.\u201d</p><p>Josh\u2019s friends meandered closer to us and talked among themselves.</p><p>\u201cNina, this is Josh. We went to high school together in Quincy. He wants to be me when he grows up,\u201d Kim teased, playful y punching him in the arm.</p><p>Josh laughed and shook my hand. \u201cOnly if I get to wear a hat like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Josh.\u201d</p><p>Josh pointed to each of his friends. \u201cTucker...Chad...Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Tucker and Chad nodded in typical boy fashion, but Ryan reached his hand out, first to Kim and then to me.</p><p>\u201cHi... hi,\u201d he said to each of us. His eyes lingered on me for a moment.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to The Gate later for pizza if you want to come,\u201d Josh said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already made plans with another girlfriend of ours, but maybe next time,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>Josh nodded and Chad fol owed him as he left. Ryan stayed for just a moment and then trailed behind them.</p><p>Kim looked at me with her eyebrows raised. \u201cWel . Who says there\u2019s no such thing as love at first sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit it,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Beth joined us a few moments later.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time! Gah!\u201d Kim said in her typical dramatic fashion.</p><p>Beth laughed. \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d she asked just as Ryan turned to look at us again.</p><p>\u201cRyan. Friend of a friend. Isn\u2019t he dreamy?\u201d Kim said as she nestled against Beth\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so...weird!\u201d Beth giggled, pushing Kim away.</p><p>Beth and I huddled under an umbrel a while Kim walked in the rain unaffected. We reached Kim\u2019s elderly Sentra and climbed in, Beth taking the back seat. Kim pretended to say a little prayer and turned the ignition. After a few sickly whirring noises, the engine erupted and Beth clapped.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you,\u201d Kim said, ducking her head in little bows.</p><p>We crowded the counter and Beth and Kim both scanned the menu.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l have a Grande Caf\u00e9 Misto, please.\u201d I heard Kim sigh beside me. Unlike me, she refused to have the same drink twice.</p><p>I settled into my chair, cupping my drink with both hands. The wind and rain had picked up, and was intermittently beating against the large glass window. Just as Beth sat beside me, the bel above the door clanged and I automatical y glanced up.</p><p>It was him.</p><p>Beth noticed me staring past her and she twisted to see Jared walking to the counter. \u201cAre you okay, Nina?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Kim sat down and traded glances with Beth, then pivoted in her seat to see what I couldn\u2019t peel my eyes from.</p><p>The girl behind the counter cooed. \u201cWel , if it isn\u2019t Jared Ryel. Long time no see. How have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are good, Katie. I\u2019l have the usual,\u201d he replied, indifferent to her flirting.</p><p>By the time Jared casual y turned our way al three of us were staring at him. I was expecting an uncomfortable expression at our gawking, but he smiled.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Beth asked, clearly impressed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jared,\u201d Kim said, leaning in and grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cJared. Who\u2019s J \u2013?\u201d Beth whispered.</p><p>\u201cSssh!\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Jared cal ed. I thought I detected uncertainty in his voice.</p><p>As soon as his eyes met mine, I immediately felt lost. As usual, Kim saved me.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Jared,\u201d Kim said with an impish grin.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he confirmed, slowly walking the few feet to our table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Kim,\u201d she reached over and took his hand, shaking it vigorously and not at al lady-like.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...nice to meet you,\u201d Jared said, glancing at her briefly before returning his eyes to mine. Confusion draped over his face, and he leaned his head a few inches to the side before speaking to me. \u201cIs everything al right here?\u201d</p><p>From my peripheral I could see Beth\u2019s eyebrows press together and her eyes shift to me, confused by Jared\u2019s behavior.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s great,\u201d I murmured, setting my cup on the table. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been...fine. Am I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s loud voice rose an octave. \u201cOf course not! Would you like to join us?\u201d</p><p>Jared looked at me for a moment and I smiled at him, waiting. I felt a strange adrenaline rush; afraid he would say yes and terrified he would say no.</p><p>He looked back to Kim and sighed. \u201cI should be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you stay? Just for a minute?\u201d I asked, hopeful.</p> <p>Jared sighed with what sounded like relief. He looked around him and then pul ed a chair to our table. I couldn\u2019t contain the excitement I felt and my mouth instantly spread into a smile.</p><p>\u201cHow could I say no to that?\u201d he asked. I felt my ears get hot.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s very persuasive,\u201d Kim said flatly, eyeing me.</p><p>I ignored her to introduce both of them properly. \u201cJared, Kim Pol ock. Kim...Jared Ryel. And this is my roommate, Bethany Layne.\u201d</p><p>Jared extended his hand across the table and briefly shook Beth\u2019s hand.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s just Beth.\u201d</p> <p>Jared nodded. \u201cNice to meet you, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...how do you know each other?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cI got her a cab,\u201d he said, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cHe did. The night of Jack\u2019s....we shared a cab,\u201d I said, trying to keep the conversation on Jared instead of the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Beth said. I could see the confusion on her face. It occurred to me that I would have quite a bit of explaining to do later.</p><p>\u201cAnd we had lunch,\u201d Jared added.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Kim asked, turning to me for confirmation.</p><p>Jared chuckled. \u201cI can see it was interesting enough to share.\u201d</p> <p>I fingered the lid of my coffee cup. \u201cHe introduced me to that Blaze place on Thayer. It was real y good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was the company more than anything,\u201d Jared said, his eyes softening.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you two had a great time,\u201d Beth chirped. She had gotten over the fact that I hadn\u2019t let her in on the news and had become slightly over- enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d he said, his eyes focused on mine. \u201cIt was good to see you again, Nina, but I have to get going.\u201d He stood up and returned the chair to its proper place. I stiffened. I wanted to ask him when I would see him again, but couldn\u2019t find the courage. I settled for relaying my feelings with a disappointed frown.</p><p>To my relief, he noticed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l see you soon,\u201d he reassured me, amused at my deflated expression.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I nodded once.</p><p>He strode out just as marvelously as he came in, and I crumpled into the back of my chair. My muscles complained, I hadn\u2019t noticed I was so tense. I sipped my coffee and took a deep, relaxing breath.</p><p>I had gone from never knowing he existed to inexplicably running into him. My life was suddenly ful of these little miraculous surprises, moments I was finding so much happiness in that I was already wondering when the next one would come.</p><p>My friends\u2019 eyes bored into me. I looked up, conscious of their burning curiosity.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I prompted, smiling innocently.</p><p>\u201cOh please, Nigh. Like you\u2019re not swimming in your own freakily potent pheromones right now,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s real y cute,\u201d Beth added.</p><p>\u201cI guess...if you like the type,\u201d I mused, trying to keep my cool.</p><p>\u201cIf...?\u201d Beth cried. \u201cYou mean the wel -dressed, gorgeous, movie-star type that is polite and interested in you? You mean that type?\u201d</p><p>Kim laughed. \u201cYou are being ridiculously calm about this, considering while he was here you had the personality of a clam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could have shot coffee out of her nose and he stil would have stayed,\u201d Beth giggled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not cute. He\u2019s angelic,\u201d I sighed, dwel ing on every detail of him.</p><p>Kim joined Beth\u2019s giggling and al three of us erupted in laughter.</p><p>Over the next few days, every time I stepped off campus I watched for him. Beth and I went for coffee more than once, and I was shameful y preoccupied. I would answer when prompted and nod my head in the acceptable places of conversation, but we both knew I was anticipating my next moment with Jared.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe how annoying I\u2019d become over a man I barely knew. I was not one of those girls who became wrapped up in such things, and truth be told I lost patience easily with those that did. When I caught myself searching for him in every store, every restaurant and coffee shop I frequented, a scolding was in order.</p><p>Five days of this ridiculous behavior paid off.</p><p>The sun disappeared behind the horizon as Beth and I waited by pump four of Eastside Shel gas station. I yawned out of boredom, listening to the pump clicking with every dol ar put in. Beth wrinkled her nose at the smel and I mirrored her expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just love this smel and you look like you just took a whiff of an Oklahoma pig farm. Bringing back harsh memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d She looked up and a large grin spread across her face.</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought you were going to be a poor sport,\u201d I said, surprised at her expression.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jared,\u201d Beth said, smug.</p><p>I flipped around and there he was, standing on the other side of the pump looking just as stunned and elated as I felt.</p><p>\u201cThis is getting spooky,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cHi to you, too,\u201d I said, letting my delight to see him show.</p><p>\u201cHow are classes going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGood. How\u2019s business?\u201d I smiled. I\u2019m getting better at this, thank God, I thought. I final y felt somewhat normal around him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good day,\u201d he said, smiling his incredible smile. It absolutely was. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice car,\u201d he gestured with a nod.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>One of the few grandiose things my father had purchased for me was my white BMW. He had bought it as a graduation present, and aside from the Peridot and diamond ring he had bought for my sixteenth birthday, it was my most prized possession. Normal y I didn\u2019t put much stock in the ostentatious things my father purchased, but this was special; it had been given with the proud-father expression that I relished.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He cocked his head, confused at my question.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re headed to a hot date or something.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo...no date. How about you? Anyone forcing strange cuisine on you this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do that for just anyone,\u201d I said, raising an eyebrow. I was impressed with how I sounded, so much braver than I felt.</p><p>He beamed. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>I pul ed my receipt from the gas pump and looked at Beth, who pretended not to watch. He walked over to me, stuffing his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cHow would you like to put that to the test, then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIs that a chal enge or are you asking me to dinner?\u201d I prompted, looking him square in the eye. I didn\u2019t know where my sudden courage and sass came from, but it was less humiliating than the gaucheness I demonstrated the last two times I had seen him.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d he smiled. He leaned against my car, just inches from me. I tried to seem relaxed, although my heart was pounding in my chest over his proximity.</p><p>My face twisted into a frown as I realized my dilemma. \u201cI have study group tonight.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look ruffled, to my chagrin. \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d</p><p>He walked back to his Escalade and left without another word. I flipped around to Beth and she ducked into the passenger side. The door slammed behind me as I sat next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief. \u201cYou passed up a date with him for study group? You\u2019ve wanted to run into him for a week!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just break my plans anytime he asks me out. How would that look?\u201d I insisted, frowning at the thought of him thinking I was that accessible.</p><p>Beth shrugged. \u201cWho cares?\u201d</p><p>I started my car. \u201cBeth! Be serious. He won\u2019t give me his number,\u201d I shoved my gear shift into drive and pul ed forward, \u201cand he just shows up out of nowhere and asks me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nuts! You like him. He asks you out. You tel him no? There is something wrong with you, Nina!\u201d</p><p>Back at Andrews, I had to deal with it from both sides.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Kim shrieked.</p><p>\u201cUgh! Not you, too!\u201d</p><p>The smugness on Beth\u2019s face radiated throughout the entire room. \u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to study. You two are studying tonight,\u201d I reasoned, mostly to myself.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t if I had a date,\u201d Beth said, crossing her legs on her bed.</p><p>\u201cI bet you would if said date asked you ninety minutes before study group,\u201d I rebutted.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kim said, spreading her arms between us. \u201cNigh\u2019s right. Prose before bros.\u201d</p><p>Beth rol ed her eyes as she packed her various study items and I folded my notes and stuffed them into my coat pocket.</p><p>Kim snapped her fingers. \u201cLet\u2019s go, ladies. I don\u2019t want to close The Rock down at 2 A.M. like last time.\u201d</p><p>We headed to the John D. Rockefel er library, ducking our heads to hide from the bitter wind. Just as we crossed the street, the snow began to fal in large flakes. The dead grass crinkled under our feet as we cut across to save steps. Beth begged us to drive, but Kim insisted we walk so she could smoke.</p><p>Beth hooked her arm around mine. \u201cBrown needs to generate some type of smal transportation system to get us from here to there more easily.</p><p>Like a trailer hitched to a four-wheeler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Oklahoma, let\u2019s hire a hay rack ride. Brown needs culture,\u201d Kim deadpanned.</p><p>Beth narrowed her eyes at Kim. \u201cIt was just a suggestion. I\u2019m freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to Kim, she\u2019s not even wearing a heavy coat,\u201d I said, my teeth beginning to chatter.</p><p>\u201cYou two are babies, gah!\u201d Kim groaned.</p><p>\u201cIt does sound like a hay ride,\u201d Beth giggled.</p><p>When we arrived, our study group was already waiting on us. Carrie and Tracey\u2014from the basketbal team\u2014sat on one couch. On the adjacent couch sat Kim\u2019s friends Justin and Kristi. Lisa, a pre-med student, barely noticed our arrival, and beside her was someone I recognized right away.</p><p>Ryan had a head ful of dark hair and he was barely tal er than I. Because his t-shirt was a bit tight, I noticed his athletic build. His basebal cap was pul ed low over his eyes, so I could see only his perfect, white smile, and a deep dimple on his left cheek. The other girls in the group seemed to appreciate his presence.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, being al responsible!\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cJosh was going to come, but he ended up going on a date,\u201d Ryan explained, pul ing up his cap to display his bright green eyes.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Kim hummed, angling her neck so I would get the ful effect of her accusing expression.</p><p>Beth did the same.</p><p>Ryan was suddenly uncomfortable, his eyes darting back and forth between the three of us. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I grumbled, shouldering past Beth.</p><p>I sat in the chasm between Ryan and Lisa. While everyone discussed their notes and how confused they were, Ryan turned to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking chemistry? Do you get any of this?\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you having problems with?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not having any problems, are you?\u201d</p><p>Feeling caught, I smiled and then erased a line toward the top of his paper. I explained his mistake and started writing it down in my own girlie script. \u201cDo you see how I got there?\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded, stil unsure. \u201cI see how you got there, getting there on my own is the persistent problem.\u201d</p><p>As the night wore one, I erased quite a bit on Ryan\u2019s paper. We had hundreds of tiny shreds of decimated eraser al over us. His patience and humor made the night go much faster, although I worked on his chemistry and didn\u2019t study the notes I had brought.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you helping me,\u201d Ryan said, folding his paper into his book.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much I helped, but you\u2019re welcome. We have study group here twice a week, come anytime.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face lit up. \u201cI wil . Thanks. Uh...some of us guys are going out for drinks this weekend. It\u2019d be cool if you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are only a handful of places I can get in to.\u201d</p><p>Ryan winked at me. \u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>It sounded harmless enough. \u201cThat sounds fun. I\u2019l see what the girls are doing.\u201d</p><p>Kim looked at her watch and yawned. \u201cStick a fork in me. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNigh, are you ready?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cNigh?\u201d Ryan asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s a nickname they came up with to torture me. Don\u2019t cal me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kim and I stood, waiting for Beth to gather her miniature office supply store.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I don\u2019t bring anything,\u201d Kim said, gesturing to Beth.</p><p>\u201cYou borrowed my pen!\u201d Beth objected.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right,\u201d Kim said, tossing the pen into Beth\u2019s bag. \u201cAl packed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beth rol ed her eyes and looked at me. \u201cWil you put some tape on her mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think tape would help,\u201d I grinned.</p><p>We walked back to Andrews and Kim waved goodbye, continuing to her room. I col apsed on my bed as Beth gathered her things to head to the showers. As I traced the imperfections of the ceiling with my eyes, my mind drifted to Jared. Not only had I gone from never seeing him to running into him regularly; it was as if I was seeing him at wil .</p><p>\u201cRyan asked you out for this weekend?\u201d Beth burst in, towel-drying her hair.</p> <p>\u201cNo. He asked us out for this weekend. I guess some of his friends are going for drinks; he asked us to come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she asked, suddenly interested.</p><p>\u201cI said it sounded like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go?\u201d she squealed.</p><p>\u201cI guess you do,\u201d I chuckled, rol ing my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYes! I do! You wanna go? Please say yes!\u201d she dropped to her knees beside me on my bed.</p><p>\u201cI want to go,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>Beth tackled me. \u201cThank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome! Now get off!\u201d I laughed.</p><p>The next day was warmer, a good day to take a walk off-campus. Providence transformed from a beautiful crystal ine city of white into the soiled, wet mess the cars and mud quickly created. The pristine snow had become a grey-brown sludge lining the roadways and sidewalks. I happily slipped on my black and white fleur de lis galoshes and stomped through the slush in hopes of proving my sheer-wil theory concerning Jared.</p><p>After an hour of walking, the sun no longer kept me warm. I slipped into the first coffee shop I came upon and ordered the largest size they offered, thawing by the window.</p> <p>It occurred to me how ridiculous I had become; walking around in near-arctic temperatures to see if Jared would materialize. I was the future savvy CEO of Providence\u2019s premiere shipping company for the love of al things holy! What kind of crack pot had I turned into? Over a boy? An incredibly attractive, intel igent, courteous, wel -dressed, fantastical y-smel ing boy. But he was just a boy. Man. Boy. They were al boys.</p><p>When the blood circulated again in my fingertips, I made my way back to the school. It was closer to sunset than I would have liked so far from campus, so I quickened my pace.</p><p>Two blocks from the school, I pressed the button at the light and kept my distance from the corner, fearful of the inevitable splashing of the cars passing by. The light changed and I trotted across, noting that the warmth from my coffee was waning.</p><p>Before I made it to the half-way point of the cross walk, a car horn blared beside me. I jumped, and my eyes darted to the light. It was stil green. I turned to glare at the offending vehicle, but my eyes widened when a black Escalade came into view. Jared waved, quivering from a barrage of laughter.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I was annoyed or euphoric, but the mixture of emotions propel ed me to the passenger side of his car. I whipped open his door and climbed in.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me to death!\u201d I said, slamming the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Jared exclaimed, trying to keep the corners of his mouth from turning up.</p><p>The light turned green and he looked at me. \u201cYou want a ride?\u201d</p> <p>I stared at him blank-faced. \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m in your car.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and pul ed forward.</p><p>\u201cYou look frozen,\u201d he said, touching the end of my nose. That one tap sent adrenaline running throughout my body and I felt nothing but warmth. He reached for the knobs under his radio and twisted the heat to its highest setting.</p><p>\u201cI went for a walk,\u201d I said, unable to subdue the ridiculous grin on my face.</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d he frowned, disapproving.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you on your way to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo pick up a client.\u201d He shifted uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>\u201cAre you always this vague?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re ful of piss and vinegar today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I remind you that you honked at me in the middle of a busy street? I could have been kil ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful. The light was on our side.\u201d I dwel ed on how he said \u2018our\u2019 for a moment.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not discount the possible rabid motorists flying through the wet intersection. My hesitation caused by your honking could have led to some serious sidewalk chalk drawings.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed. \u201cAre you sure you shouldn\u2019t apply for law school? You have quite an imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having drinks with some friends. I would invite you, but I assume you\u2019l be there,\u201d I watched for a guilty or stunned expression at my comment, but I was quickly disappointed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not old enough to drink,\u201d he grimaced, ignoring my accusation.</p><p>I leaned closer to him. \u201cWe don\u2019t tel the bartender that,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression twisted into frustration. \u201cAm I going to have to make an appointment with you for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s cal ed a date.\u201d</p><p>He smiled his amazing smile and I tried not to gasp. It was hard being candid with him when he was so stunning. I felt like I had car-jacked a film star.</p><p>\u201cWould you like my number?\u201d I asked without thinking. A wave of embarrassment washed over me as soon as the words left my mouth.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away; instead he let out a long sigh. I felt the heat rise on my face, starting at my neck and surpassing my eyes until it scorched the roots of my hair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to give you my number, I just meant....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you al right?\u201d Jared said. He watched me as if he thought I would break down into tears at any moment.</p><p>I could only nod as he slowed to a stop behind Andrews. I didn\u2019t dare look at him. I fumbled with the handle and then felt his hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d He reached around to gently hold my jaw and turned me to face him. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I...I think I misunderstood,\u201d I bit my lip, drawing his attention to them.</p><p>He leaned in closer; his eyes stil focused on my mouth. When he was just a few inches from me, he shook his head and pul ed back.</p><p>The blood rushed in from every inch of my body and my feet tingled as the adrenaline rushed through them and then disappeared. I had been wrong. What I had taken to be flirtation or attraction must have been more of a fondness for me. He looked at me as a little sister, and I had made my misconception al too clear.</p><p>I opened the door, hopping out into a shal ow puddle. The motor of the Escalade stil hummed behind me as I pressed the door closed and walked to Andrews, too humiliated to look back.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Suspicion(s)</p><p>I didn\u2019t leave campus again until Beth, Kim and I met Ryan and his friends for drinks in a pub downtown. When we arrived, I saw that it was less of a pub and more of a dingy hole in the wal , but it would serve our purpose.</p><p>Tucker nodded to the bartender. \u201cHey, Tozzi.\u201d</p><p>Tozzi eyed our group as he dried the inside of a glass and nodded.</p><p>We began with a shot and toasted to our mascot, \u201cTO THE BIG BROWN BEAR!!\u201d</p><p>I lost count of how many drinks I\u2019d had, it was easy to do that with an open tab at the bar and Tucker ordering round after round. My cheeks were beginning to complain from the constant giggling and smiling, so I made fish faces to stretch them out. Ryan squeezed and pul ed at my face as he laughed, having far more to drink than I had.</p><p>Ryan spoke as quietly as a drunk person was capable, brushing my bangs from my eyes and laughing as if he should be hiccupping tiny bubbles with every word. \u201cDid I tel you how beautiful you look tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA few times,\u201d I replied.</p><p>He grabbed each side of my face and pressed his forehead against mine. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came, Nina. I never have this much fun.\u201d</p><p>Beth had just volunteered to cal a cab when the door opened and I saw them. Jared walked in with a platinum-blonde beauty. She was al of five feet four inches and clearly younger than I. Her lips were plush, snowy banks glittering under her icy blue eyes. She moved with the confidence and precision of a runway model, disregarding our table as she strode by. Her hair was board-straight, barely grazing her shoulders, and her thick bangs hung just above her eyes. A tiny diamond piercing sparkled in the crease of her left nostril. I\u2019d never seen anything like her in real life before.</p><p>She looked like punk rock Barbie with her heavy eye makeup, skin-tight clothing and knee-high boots.</p><p>Jared ignored us, too, as he fol owed her to the bar, and I felt something catch in my throat when he sat next to his companion.</p><p>Kim grabbed my shoulder. \u201cDoes he know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I choked out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ryan asked, seeing our reaction to the fair-haired couple at the bar.</p><p>\u201cThat is the guy that\u2019s been pursuing Nina,\u201d Kim said, eyeing Jared with disgust.</p><p>Ryan looked at me and nodded in Jared\u2019s direction. \u201cYou\u2019re dating that guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stood up from the table. The door was just a few steps away, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of them.</p><p>Tozzi took one look at the blonde Jared was with and shook his head. Jared whispered something in his ear, slid something across the counter and the bartender walked away without further argument. The girl\u2014and she was a girl\u2014looked up at Jared with an annoyed expression. I was instantly angry. He had chosen to be with her and she was bored with him.</p><p>Beth stumbled back to the table. \u201cCab\u2019s on its way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait outside,\u201d Kim said, pul ing me with her.</p><p>Just before I looked away, Jared raised his eyes to meet mine. I was glad that he had seen me, then he wouldn\u2019t be so surprised at the fury I would unleash on him the next time we happened upon each other. My anger gave me the distraction I needed to turn away. I shook my head in heated disbelief that he\u2019d shown up with such a fake looking sl\u2014 My arm pul ed in the wrong direction. \u201cNina, don\u2019t go,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here with her?\u201d Beth sneered.</p><p>I looked down at my arm and then glared up at Jared. He removed his gentle hold on me so as not to offend me further. \u201cJust...wait a minute. It\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cYes, you do. If you would just give me a moment to explain....\u201d</p><p>In the next moment Ryan was standing beside me, eyeing Jared. \u201cShe\u2019s leaving. You need to step back,\u201d Ryan said in a low, hostile voice.</p><p>Jared turned his head away from us, laughing off the threat. He turned to look directly at Ryan, and I recoiled as his eyes turned from warm pools to steely blue.</p><p>After a few tense moments, Jared looked down at me. His eyes softened again. \u201cNina, I don\u2019t want you to leave upset. Just hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I wil ,\u201d I said, turning away from him. His hand shot out to catch my arm once more. Ryan grabbed Jared\u2019s arm and I could see that in seconds the situation was going to escalate.</p><p>A petite hand shot out and gripped Ryan\u2019s wrist, bending it back just enough to incapacitate him. Ryan cried out in pain.</p><p>A feminine but firm voice came from behind Jared. \u201cI\u2019m just going to tel you this once. Don\u2019t put your hands on my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay! Okay!\u201d Ryan begged.</p><p>\u201cAl right, Claire, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Jared murmured, watching me. He sighed at the horror that emanated from my eyes as I watched her draw her hand back from Ryan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThis is my little sister, Claire,\u201d Jared explained with chagrin.</p><p>My eyes shot a confused look at Claire, searching for some sort of offense taken by her, but there was none. He was tel ing the truth.</p><p>\u201cYour sister?\u201d I asked. From my peripheral vision, I could see Ryan rubbing his wrist.</p><p>Claire watched Ryan, seeming both irritated and concerned, almost as if she had regretted hurting him. Jared noticed the way she looked at Ryan as wel , and they traded a strange glance.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to think...,\u201d Jared trailed off, looking at me, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. About the other day, it\u2019s difficult....\u201d</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes and made her way to the bar. Jared whispered in her ear as she passed.</p><p>\u201cBehave yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Claire made herself comfortable on the bar stool and ordered a water, keeping to herself. After a few moments, her eyes flashed to Ryan and then back down to her drink.</p><p>Jared turned to me again, obviously wanting to pick up where we left off. His eyes wandered beside me to where Ryan was stil standing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ryan,\u201d I whispered, touching his arm. I noticed Jared stare at my hand as if it would burst into flames.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Ryan repeated, stil rubbing his wrist. I didn\u2019t miss the edge of uneasiness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Ryan walked with Kim and Beth to the wal beside the door to join the rest of the group we came with. They al made a poor attempt to pretend they were watching for the cab.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Jared?\u201d I snapped my head back to meet his eyes. He muttered something under his breath, briefly surveying the room ful of people that were staring at us. I cocked my head and leaned so that I was somewhat in his line of sight. \u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to think I was with Claire. She insisted on coming in,\u201d he said, looking back to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re here at al ,\u201d I crossed my arms and glared at him.</p><p>Jared noted the stubborn set of my chin and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m here because of what happened the other day. The look on your face when you walked away...I couldn\u2019t just let you think that I didn\u2019t....that I wasn\u2019t....,\u201d he was struggling with the truth, and it was aggravating me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust say it!\u201d</p><p>He winced at my tone. \u201cI have these...feelings for you. And when I saw you over here, with that same look on your face, I was afraid you\u2019d never speak to me again if I didn\u2019t explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have feelings for me?\u201d</p><p>His face fel . \u201cI can\u2019t get you out of my head.\u201d</p> <p>That simple sentence had my heart pounding through my chest. He lightly cupped my jaw and brushed his thumb against my cheek. His touch sent a jolt of electricity throughout my body from my head to my toes.</p><p>A sultry guitar solo played from the jukebox. I knew the song vaguely, but wasn\u2019t paying enough attention to it to figure it out. Jared\u2019s mouth turned up into a half-smile, and he pul ed on both of my hands.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said.</p><p>He walked backwards and led me to the smal wooden dance floor. Pul ing me close to his chest, his eyes never left mine. Everyone in the room must have been staring at us through the smoky haze, but I couldn\u2019t disengage my gaze from his, even for a moment. He wrapped his arms around my middle, and I slid my hands up his arms, stopping at his shoulders.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if we were even dancing, with al of my focus on the fact that our bodies were so close. He broke his stare and leaned down to press his lips to my hair. I pressed my cheek against his chest and closed my eyes.</p> <p>He tightened his grip, and every inch of me that was in contact with him burned in a wonderful way. I looked up and my eyes stal ed on his lips, the bottom a bit ful er than the top. I bit my lip in anticipation, the alcohol dissolving al of my inhibitions.</p><p>His body stiffened and I turned to fol ow his glare to the bar. One of the older men stil loitering in the pub had approached Claire.</p><p>The man reached for Claire and Jared\u2019s grip on me tightened, stepping just slightly in front of me in a protective stance.</p><p>The man leaned over and patted Claire on the back. He laughed loudly and attempted to whisper into her ear. Claire was staring ahead, her body rigid; seeing just half of her expression it was obvious that she was about to lose her temper. The man lost his balance and used Claire to right himself.</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2014,\u201d Jared warned, but it was too late.</p><p>In the same second, she knocked the man\u2019s legs out from under him with incredible speed and then stood up on the rung of her bar stool, slamming his head, cheek down, to the bar. The wood made a cracking noise with the force of her blow, and the man wailed in pain. He flailed his arms, reaching above him for Claire\u2019s face, but she quickly reached around with her other hand and grabbed his fingers, wrenching them back. The bones in his fingers snapped and I recoiled, even though I stil hadn\u2019t quite processed what was going on. The man\u2019s blood-curdling scream sent the bartender running over to try to separate them.</p> <p>Claire leaned down and yel ed over the music into his ear. \u201cWas that good for you, Baby?\u201d and then slowly licked his cheek. Claire released her grip, and he slithered down to the floor. The entire room seemed frozen in time.</p><p>Jared heaved an exasperated sigh. He looked at me with a tired ache in his eyes, and then let me go. He walked over to Claire, grabbed her arm and then ushered her out.</p><p>\u201cShe broke my damn fingers!\u201d the man howled, cradling his arm to his chest.</p><p>Several of the older patrons rushed to his side and helped him up while he moaned in pain. Beth grabbed my hand and pul ed me out of the pub.</p><p>The cab waited for us outside in a cloud of exhaust.</p><p>I looked around, but Jared had disappeared.</p><p>Beth tugged at my coat frantical y. \u201cGet in, Nina, before the cops get here!\u201d</p><p>I ducked into the cab and my ears were fil ed with shrieking and chattering in high tones. I wasn\u2019t listening to any of it; I was too confused about what I had seen. Jared wasn\u2019t surprised at al that his teenaged-sister had broken the hand of a ful grown man as if he was made of glass.</p> <p>I went over it in my head; the memory seemed more like a kung fu movie than something that had unfolded in front of my eyes. Tiny, delicate Claire seemed to have superhuman strength and speed, and Jared\u2019s reaction didn\u2019t make sense. He didn\u2019t act to protect her, and yet he seemed to know that carnage was on the horizon; he even shielded me from it.</p><p>\u201cNina! Are you listening to me? Wasn\u2019t that incredible? The way she just\u2014,\u201d Beth set in motion with a series of karate chops and then jerked her hand forward in the same motion Claire used to slam the man\u2019s head into the bar, grunting with each move. Beth giggled with delight while I shuddered at the recol ection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to meet her on a dark playground, I\u2019l tel you that,\u201d Kim joked.</p><p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s al of ninety-five pounds and when she grabbed my hand, I couldn\u2019t break free. What is she? Sixteen? Seventeen? She isn\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to be in high school, stil ,\u201d Beth said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s old enough to drive, though. Did you see her car?\u201d Kim added.</p><p>I perked up, then. \u201cYou saw them leave?\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded. \u201cShe took off down the street in some kind of sports car; Jared was with her. They looked like they were arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a Lotus,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cIt was a phantom black Lotus Exige S two-sixty. Nice, nice car,\u201d Ryan mused. \u201cIt costs over twelve-grand just for the paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Josh\u2019s dad have one?\u201d Kim asked, elbowing Ryan.</p><p>Ryan shook his head with raised eyebrows.</p><p>Kim looked at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing she wasn\u2019t his date, Nigh. That would have been one short catfight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Beth prodded. Her giggling had tapered off. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019l see him again, I\u2019m sure of it. You should have seen the way he looked at you when you were dancing together.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but notice Ryan frown at Beth\u2019s words.</p><p>My attention was drawn to the passing lights outside my window. Seeing him again was exactly what I wanted, but my sense of self-preservation cried foul. The entire situation was one big red flag, but did I believe Jared was dangerous?</p><p>Something about Jared\u2019s eyes assured me that in the short time I\u2019d known him, he was safe. Every piece of me that had been guided by my father to be reasonable and wary was screaming run, but I knew I would intentional y try to cross paths with him at the earliest moment fate al owed. The moment of sadness in his eyes before he left me played out over and over in my head. I had to see him again.</p><p>The next study group session, Ryan col apsed in the chair beside me. He teetered his pencil between his fingers while I went over my notes.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Ryan whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that guy the other night?\u201d</p><p>I feigned a confused expression. \u201cWhat guy?\u201d</p><p>He smirked at me. \u201cYou know who I\u2019m talking about. That Jared guy. Are you dating him?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNo, not real y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>I kept my eyes on my paper. \u201cI\u2019ve gone to lunch with him once, he\u2019s given me a ride home a few times, and I\u2019ve see him around town...,\u201d I was purposeful y vague. I didn\u2019t know where the conversation was headed.</p><p>\u201cSo what was that, at the pub? Why did he show up with his sister to tel you he wasn\u2019t there with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him to get that figured out, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going to talk to him?\u201d His voice was growing impatient with my answers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ryan. Why?\u201d I said, unable to conceal my irritation with his line of questioning.</p><p>Ryan squirmed in his seat and then turned to face me. \u201cI wanted to ask you...if...you know... if you wanted to grab dinner sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I rubbed my forehead, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot on my plate right now.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded indifferently. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d ask. I didn\u2019t know if you and that guy were....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about Jared,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he came there to check up on you?\u201d</p><p>I contemplated that for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe. I\u2019ve been running into him a lot, lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to think of it as fate stepping in,\u201d I mused.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face twisted to petulance. \u201cSounds like stalking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk, trying to fight over a girl you barely know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had his hands on you,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I smiled, nudging him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You know that guy\u2019s got to be bad news, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d Ryan scowled at my words, but I shrugged off his skepticism. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. There\u2019s something in his eyes.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head in disapproval. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to get hurt. His little sister is insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you on that one.\u201d</p><p>We both laughed and then Ryan shrugged. \u201cMaybe once you get things al sorted out with your stalker, you\u2019l reconsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmHmm,\u201d he said, trying to appear interested in his algebra book.</p><p>Beth began gathering her plethora of organizational aides and Kim stood up and stretched. The rest of the group disbanded as Kim, Beth, Ryan and I walked out of the library together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cI could eat,\u201d Beth chimed in.</p><p>Ryan turned to me. \u201cIs an after study snack out of the question?\u201d</p><p>They al eyed me expectantly. \u201cLet\u2019s eat,\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>Ryan and Kim went over possible plans for the weekend over pancakes and hash browns while Beth and I discussed our intentions to attend the basketbal game. Even with the ever-growing puzzle that was Jared, life was a shade of ordinary again. I felt the unease I\u2019d been feeling for weeks slowly dissipate into the greasy air.</p><p>While walking out to the car I noticed a short, squat man walking paral el to us. Ryan veered to the outside of our group, positioning himself between us and the stranger. The man arrived at Kim\u2019s Sentra the same moment that we did.</p><p>\u201cAre you Nina Grey?\u201d The man asked me in a hoarse voice. I felt my body tense.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Ryan asked, stepping forward.</p><p>The man noted Ryan\u2019s presence but spoke only to me. \u201cI was an associate of your father\u2019s. My name is Charles Dawson. It\u2019s important that I speak with you.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, the mention of my father created a stabbing sensation in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI would like to speak with you alone, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, his squinty eyes shifting from each of my friends and then back to me.</p><p>\u201cNina, do you know this guy?\u201d Ryan asked, jerking his thumb at Mr. Dawson.</p><p>I studied his face for a moment. He wore an expensive suit like the hundreds of other men I\u2019d seen in my father\u2019s company through the years, but his face wasn\u2019t familiar.</p><p>I tried to be polite. \u201cI-I don\u2019t think I do, sir. I\u2019m not sure I could help you.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Dawson took a step toward me and Ryan did the same.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with your father for some time, now. It\u2019s come to my attention that he\u2019s passed away.\u201d</p><p>I worked to separate my lips long enough to form the words. \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father had agreed to sign over some property to me, and I was wondering if you were at al familiar with our transaction?\u201d</p><p>Kim spoke up. \u201cNina, this is probably not the appropriate time to\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d rather speak to my father\u2019s attorney, Thomas Rosen,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cHe is with Rosen and Barnes in Kennedy Plaza. I\u2019m sure he wil be able to assist you.\u201d I turned to get into the car, but the man took several quick steps to thwart my efforts. He held my door and his face turned grave.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s of the utmost importance, Nina. I\u2019ve exhausted al of my options, and I\u2019m asking for your help.\u201d His eyes darted to Ryan and then back to me. Mr.</p><p>Dawson kept his voice low, \u201cJack has a safe. Maybe you\u2019ve seen it? My papers are there in that safe and I need to obtain them right away.\u201d</p><p>The already uncomfortable feeling that I was experiencing grew as the man inched closer to me. I heard Kim make wide strides to intercede, but Ryan beat her to it, stepping between me and the stranger. I slid into my seat and shut the door while Kim wheeled around, hurrying to start the car.</p><p>Ryan paused for a moment, eyeing the man, and then joined Beth in the back seat. I saw Ryan\u2019s arm slide between my shoulder and the door, reaching to press down the lock.</p><p>Mr. Dawson leaned down to peer at me through the glass. \u201cI need those papers, Nina. It would be wise of you to help me.\u201d He pul ed out a card and held it against the window with his palm. I scanned it quickly and attempted to smile.</p><p>No one spoke until we were almost back to the school parking lot.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone else think that was completely creepy?\u201d Beth shrieked.</p><p>\u201cBeth! You scared the crap outta me!\u201d Kim said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to cal Mr. Rosen tomorrow, and then I\u2019m going to cal my mother,\u201d I said, fidgeting.</p><p>Beth nodded with wide eyes. \u201cYour mom is gonna freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>Kim waved and set off to Andrews while Beth and I said our goodbyes to Ryan.</p><p>Beth patted Ryan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m glad you were there, Ryan. That guy was...I don\u2019t think he would have let Nina in the car had you not been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d I said, hugging him.</p><p>Ryan pul ed back to look at me, stil keeping me enveloped in his arms. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you,\u201d he said, brushing my bangs away from my eyes.</p><p>I took a step back and glanced at Beth, whose eyes were bouncing back and forth between Ryan and me. He scratched the back of his head nervously. \u201cYeah, wel ...guess I better head back to the dorm. I\u2019l see you ladies at our next study group.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee ya!\u201d Beth chirped.</p><p>I smiled and waved to him as he turned to walk away.</p><p>Beth grabbed my arm and pul ed me along with her as she walked. \u201cNeeenah! What are you going to do about him? He\u2019s in love with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not,\u201d I said, glowering at her. \u201cHe just hasn\u2019t accepted our strictly platonic relationship, yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you think he wil ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, nodding once.</p><p>\u201cOr you hope he wil ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wil .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re in love with Jared?\u201d she grinned.</p> <p>\u201cI barely know Jared!\u201d I said, irritated. \u201cBeth, you have to hear how ridiculous you sound right now. Ryan loves me, I love Jared. I\u2019ve known them both for about two seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are in denial.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to see my mother tomorrow. Do you want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have a meeting.\u201d</p><p>I raised one eyebrow. \u201cWhat kind of meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about it, you\u2019l laugh at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTel me, Beth. I won\u2019t laugh,\u201d I said, hooking my arm around hers.</p><p>She pressed her lips together and then sighed in resignation. \u201cWe\u2019re starting a group for students from Oklahoma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many are there?\u201d My words were involuntarily tinged with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cA few!\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>I fought a grin. \u201cAre you going to have square dances and fight with the Native American Club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not funny.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled and looked away. \u201cThat was pretty funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the parking meter was invented in Oklahoma? And the shopping cart...? Invented in Oklahoma, too! The yield sign, the autopilot, voicemail! Al because of Oklahomans. Bil Gates was inspired by an article penned by Ed Roberts, an Oklahoman. We have affordable housing, natural gas, Wil Rogers, and the Sooners!</p> <p>\u201cThe Oklahoma jokes are getting real y old. We\u2019re not a bunch of hil bil ies...you\u2019re friends with me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cYes, Beth! Yes, we\u2019re friends! You\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t say anything else about Oklahoma.\u201d I could feel my eyes widen in bewilderment. Beth was upset with me.</p><p>\u201cAnd that goes for Kim, too,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for Kim, but don\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d</p><p>Beth tried not to smile, but giggled, anyway. I smiled apologetical y and we hugged just outside of our dorm room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, but I love you, anyway,\u201d I giggled.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. I wouldn\u2019t rather be shacked up with any other Yankee,\u201d she said in a horrible southern drawl.</p><p>The next morning Beth decided to rise early and head out with me for coffee. I felt closer to her after our understanding the night before, and she seemed to be in an uncharacteristical y good mood for being up so early.</p><p>Classes went by without delay. Before I knew it, I was sitting in my room alone, thinking about Jared and his unexplained appearances in my life. My mind abruptly switched to Mr. Dawson. I picked up my cel phone and dialed Thomas\u2019 office. His secretary answered and informed me that he was out for the day. I hung up, frustrated.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t recal a secret safe or any important real estate deal my father was involved in, which wasn\u2019t exactly surprising. I was typical y clueless about my father\u2019s business dealings and had grateful y remained that way. That was before strange men started fol owing me around, though. At least one person thought I had access to that file. I had to know why it was so important.</p><p>I burst through the door of my parents\u2019 home and cal ed for Agatha.</p><p>\u201cYes, Nina love! What\u2019s the racket about?\u201d she answered, scurrying around the corner.</p><p>\u201cIs Mother home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at Crestwood, planning something \u2018er other. You know how busy she keeps these days.\u201d</p><p>Of course she would be out. Immediately after Jack\u2019s funeral, my mother immersed herself into every group, every organization, and every charity she could find. She had several meetings a day and, although it was at times frustrating being unable to reach her, I was appreciative of her time wel spent away from my dorm room.</p><p>After an hour of thumbing through my mother\u2019s mail and snooping in every closet downstairs, I headed to Jack\u2019s office. It was the most obvious place to look, so I assumed I wouldn\u2019t find anything that would be of help. I took my hand off the knob and had almost convinced myself to look elsewhere, but I wheeled around and shoved myself through the door.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>His mahogany desk and swivel chair sat commandingly in the center of the room. Hundreds of books including tax law, encyclopedias, poetry, the classics and Dr. Seuss lined the back wal .</p><p>I crossed his plush, imported rug and planted myself in the desk chair. The last papers he had looked over before his accident lay strewn on one side, and unopened envelopes on the other. I started with those. Opening one after another, I sifted through statements, invitations, requests and letters. Seeing nothing of interest, I pitched them into the wastebasket under the desk.</p><p>Just as I was about to put the letter opener back inside the drawer, the inscription caught my eye. My mother had purchased it for me so I could give it to Jack for his birthday. The inscription read simply, \u201cTo Daddy Love, Nina\u201d. I ran my finger over the words affectionately and shoved it into my back pocket. My mother wouldn\u2019t miss it.</p><p>My eyes flitted to a two-inch stack of papers with sign here stickers poking out in various bright colors. I thumbed through them, but didn\u2019t see anything about properties.</p><p>I pul ed his lower desk drawer open and thumbed through every file, but I saw nothing of importance. Searching the remaining drawers, I rifled through old photos, envelopes, paperwork from the last ten years of tax filings, and a set of car keys. I slammed the last drawer shut and puffed.</p><p>My eyes wandered over to the file cabinets along the left wal . I started with the highest drawer in the cabinet closest to the back wal and searched for anything pertaining to properties, commercial or otherwise. I began to feel possessed. Every time I shut a drawer, I stifled a sob. Each drawer was slammed harder and harder. Only one cabinet wouldn\u2019t open.</p><p>While searching through the last drawer my hands began to shake. Upon finding no suspicious evidence or anything related to Mr. Dawson I kicked the drawer shut, causing the cabinet to rock back and forth.</p><p>\u201cAGH!\u201d I stomped, bal ing my hands into fists at my sides.</p><p>I paced in a smal circle for a minute, and then made my way to the desk chair and col apsed. A smal bronze frame sat to my left. It was of me and Jack when I was about four years old. We had gone on vacation to the Grand Canyon and I had fal en. I looked closer to verify my bandaged knee and smiled. I was sitting on my father\u2019s lap; he had just finished cleaning up the dirt and blood and used a colorful bandage from my mother\u2019s purse.</p><p>He kissed my knee and told me that it was al better, and even though the sting remained, I nodded my head in belief.</p><p>The colors were al so vivid, as was my memory. My eyes fil ed with tears and I looked around, horrified that I was in Jack\u2019s office and at what I was doing there. Mr. Dawson, a complete stranger, had made me doubt my father. I wiped my face and quickly straightened his desk. The door slammed behind me as I quickly descended the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMiss Nina?\u201d Agatha cal ed after me, but I raced past her, too intent on escaping the shame that I felt.</p><p>I yanked my BMW into gear and flew down the driveway into the street. Tears streamed down my face and I felt my body shudder in the same sobs I had worked so hard to rid myself of. Too many questions and no answers, everything that had made sense died with my father.</p><p>The flickering street lamps flew by as I sped down the road. As I passed the bus stop where I\u2019d first met Jared. I noticed someone sitting on the bench and slammed on my brakes. I jerked the gear into reverse and my car made a grievous whirring noise as I back-tracked. My tires screeched to a halt straight across from where Jared sat.</p><p>Shoving my way out of the car, I stomped to the middle of the street. \u201cAre you fol owing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you al right?\u201d he asked, concern overshadowing his flawless features.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, damn it?\u201d I yel ed.</p><p>He stood up and held his arms out to me, but I shook my head. He stopped and furrowed his brow. \u201cNina, come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want answers, Jared. You show up in my life, tel me you have these feelings for me. You won\u2019t give me your number, and you al but refused mine.\u201d I took a step toward him, and he a step toward me.</p><p>\u201cNina, I know you\u2019re upset, but it\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d His voice was calm and soothing, almost too much so, as if he was trying to talk me down from a ledge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing in the middle of the street bawling my eyes out and yel ing at you, Jared! Why aren\u2019t you asking me what\u2019s wrong? Why don\u2019t you ever ask me questions?\u201d Jared thought for a moment, seeming surprised at my observation. He took another step toward me with outstretched arms, begging to hold me.</p><p>\u201cIs it feelings you have for me? Or are you just fol owing me around because you feel sorry for me? Is it because I\u2019m some tragic, fatherless basket case that you\u2019ve decided to make a charity project out of?\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned angry and his arms lowered. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>As he took another step, his face for once didn\u2019t try to hide emotion. His eyes ached for me to come to him; I could see that my tears caused him pain. I leaned into his arms and he wrapped them around me without hesitation.</p><p>I relaxed in his embrace for a moment, the warmth of his arms provided instant comfort.</p><p>He leaned down to press his cheek against my temple. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just feelings, Nina. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>I peered up at him with damp eyes. \u201cThen why haven\u2019t you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. I shook my head at first, but he pul ed me closer to him and his eyes begged me to confess my thoughts. \u201cTel me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you tried to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>He seemed stunned, and then his eyes settled on my lips. I watched as his expression changed from desire, to conflicted, to a decision. I didn\u2019t know what it al meant, so I closed my eyes and leaned into him, knowing his lips were just a few inches from mine. I felt his grip tighten and he held me at bay. My eyes popped open, humiliation crashing over me in waves. Adding to my already crippling embarrassment, tears once again spil ed over my cheeks.</p><p>His eyes closed tight and his face crumpled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to you.\u201d</p><p>The humiliation stil flamed my face, but it was now obscured by my anger. I\u2019d grown weary of his vague non-answers. He would offer a tiny bit of truth shrouded in confusing ambiguity and my patience had reached its limit.</p><p>Seeing the resentment in my eyes, Jared let out a frustrated sigh. He released me and walked across the street to an impressive black motorcycle parked behind the bench. Without looking back he turned the key, and with a push of the button the engine roared to life. The motor snarled as he revved it a few times before speeding off the sidewalk and down the street.</p><p>The weekend came and went. Beth and I attended the basketbal game and Kim, Beth and I joined Ryan, Josh, Tucker, and Chad for air hockey and nachos. I refused to talk about Jared, even with Beth. I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to explain what had happened that caused me to be so furious anytime they mentioned his name.</p><p>Ryan seemed to enjoy my change of heart. One night he cal ed to ask me for help with his chemistry, and we found ourselves sitting on the floor of my dorm room alone.</p><p>\u201cNo...it\u2019s....\u201d I pressed my lips together as I rewrote the last line.</p><p>\u201cChad said he failed this test last year,\u201d Ryan grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWel , Chad didn\u2019t have me for a tutor, now did he?\u201d I threw my pencil at him and it bounced to the floor.</p><p>\u201cTutor or not, this test is gonna suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your faith in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you reconsidered my offer, yet?\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I shrugged, playing dumb.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. It\u2019s okay if you haven\u2019t....you wil eventual y,\u201d he smiled wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain I won\u2019t be interested in dating for a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t skip a beat. \u201cI\u2019l wait.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The Ring</p><p>The next weeks proved to be fairly mundane. I hadn\u2019t seen Jared or Mr. Dawson, and Ryan\u2019s propositions had tapered off. Beth had been noticeably absent from our room. I hadn\u2019t even been sequestered for a bal game.</p><p>I didn\u2019t leave campus for further theory-testing walks, and I tried not to venture off campus in general. My feelings were conflicted at any given second between being desperate to see Jared again and cringing at thoughts of any chance run-ins. I committed to pushing him from my mind, even if I had to do it a thousand times a day.</p><p>At study group, Ryan and I took our normal spots to work together on his latest academic crisis. Kim passed the time by shooting rubber bands at Josh while Beth and the new girl, Nicole, compared notes.</p><p>Josh caught one of Kim\u2019s rubber missiles in mid-air and yawned. \u201cSo, when are we going out again?\u201d</p><p>Kim shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. When do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Nina\u2019s up to it,\u201d Beth hinted. The entire group stared at me with a mixture of pitiful and expectant expressions that I was desperate to deflect.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m up for it,\u201d I said, aiming for a casual tone.</p><p>In truth, going out again with the same people to the same place made me anxious that we were just asking for a repeat, and I wasn\u2019t ready to see Jared again. In the same moment, I worried that he wouldn\u2019t show. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Beth asked, leaning forward in her chair.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go tomorrow?\u201d Josh asked Ryan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there,\u201d Ryan said, nudging me.</p><p>\u201cOn a Tuesday? How much fun can a Tuesday night be?\u201d I groaned.</p> <p>\u201cAs fun as we make it,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>On our way back to Andrews, I grumbled to Beth about going out on a school night. She didn\u2019t seem fazed by the prospect, so I left it alone. When we lumbered into our room, my cel phone buzzed.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I yawned.</p><p>\u201cYou sound tired, Nina. Are you getting enough sleep?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI am. It\u2019s just been a long day,\u201d I said, peeling back my comforter.</p> <p>\u201cWel , I won\u2019t keep you long. I just wanted to tel you that Thomas cal ed me today. He wanted to apologize about not returning your cal . Did you cal him, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...yes. I did.\u201d I hadn\u2019t anticipated Thomas cal ing my mother.</p><p>\u201cWel ? What did you cal him about?\u201d</p><p>I decided that sticking as close to the truth as possible would be the best option. \u201cWel , I was in dad\u2019s office a few weeks ago and came across some unsigned papers. I didn\u2019t want to worry you with it, so I cal ed Mr. Rosen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in Dad\u2019s office? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I just miss him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom. It was something I needed to do on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t worry about those papers, Dear. They\u2019re nothing you need to concern yourself with. Thomas has copies of al of your father\u2019s papers in his office; they\u2019ve already been taken care of. I wasn\u2019t....ready to move them just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I said, thinking of the letter opener I\u2019d taken. She obviously hadn\u2019t noticed, yet. I wondered if she went into Jack\u2019s office at al . \u201cDid Daddy ever discuss an urgent properties deal with you?\u201d</p><p>My mother pondered that for a moment. \u201cA properties deal? Your father didn\u2019t deal with properties, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d I tried to make my voice sound idle to end the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l let Thomas know that I\u2019ve talked to you.\u201d She seemed to accept my explanation, but was obviously unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Mom. I\u2019m going to bed, now.\u201d</p> <p>I clicked my phone shut and noticed Beth staring at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tel her about the Dawson guy, did you?\u201d Beth said, towel and toiletries in hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t put that on her right now.\u201d</p><p>I clicked my fingernails together, waiting for Beth to return. Mr. Rosen chose to cal my mother instead of me. The thought flooded my mind with the disturbing words Mr. Dawson spoke, which in turn morphed into thoughts of my father being swindled posthumously. In that instant, I became angry beyond words and scrambled to my feet. Beth wouldn\u2019t return fast enough; the only comfort would be a distraction. Without a second thought, I grabbed my keys and bolted out the door.</p><p>My BMW weaved in and out of traffic just a bit over the speed limit. I figured if I could somehow get lost, trying to find my way back would be an excel ent distraction. I drove until the buildings were less familiar and then I stopped paying attention to the street signs. When I was no longer in Providence, I slowed down to make a u-turn to start the chal enge of finding my way home. I veered off a bit to the shoulder before making the turn, and then my car bobbled over an unseen object as I pul ed my steering wheel in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>I peered into my rearview mirror, searching for what I\u2019d run over to decide whether I should pul over to assess any damages. In the next moment I saw the reflective twisted metal and sighed.</p><p>I pul ed over to the side of the road and came to an abrupt stop. Realizing the situation I\u2019d gotten myself into, I let my forehead fal hard onto the steering wheel with a thud.</p><p>A flat tire on the side of an unknown road in the middle of the night was definitely a distraction.</p><p>I shoved open my door and walked around to look at the front passenger-side tire. Seeing the rubber pooled on the ground, I raked my fingers through my hair.</p><p>Fog blurred the street lights so my vision was limited. In quick strides I ducked back into my car to cal Beth. At the same time that I remembered I had left my purse behind, it dawned on me that I\u2019d also failed to bring my phone.</p><p>\u201cNina! You idiot!\u201d</p><p>Logic overrode panic. The sun would rise in a few hours and I could flag someone down to use their phone. I turned the heater on high and let the dry air fil the cab. When it was too hot to breathe I flipped back the ignition and turned off the car. Just moments later, I tugged my coat tighter around me. It was going to be a very long couple of hours before sunrise; it didn\u2019t take long at al for the stifling heat in the car to fade to mildly warm and then to an uncomfortable chil soon after.</p><p>Three quick raps on my window sent me an inch off my seat. I whipped around to see a man in a puffy blue coat standing just inches away. My hand flew up to the lock as he leaned down to look in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that, don\u2019t you think? I could have carjacked you by now,\u201d Jared said, grimacing at my pitiful efforts.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak, the fear sent adrenaline racing throughout my body and I experienced a dozen different emotions before I settled on relief.</p><p>\u201cOpen the trunk so I can get your spare,\u201d he said.</p><p>I reached for the button and the trunk sprung open with a pop. Scrambling out of my car, I watched while he pul ed out a jack and quickly assembled it, and then pul ed out the spare tire, carrying it to his make-shift workspace. I\u2019d always seen people rol ing tires around, but Jared lifted it out of my trunk as if it were a grocery bag.</p><p>He worked feverishly\u2014as if he were being timed\u2014pumping the jack, unscrewing the lug nuts and yanking off the flattened carcass of the old tire to immediately replace it with the spare. He repeated the process in reverse, tightening the lug nuts and spinning the tire. Once he finished lowering the car, he lobbed the flattened tire into my trunk, fol owed by the jack and tire iron.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Nina,\u201d he growled. He slammed the trunk shut and then wiped the grease from his hands onto his jeans.</p><p>\u201cJared....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go home,\u201d he said, avoiding my eyes. He turned his back on me, disappearing into the fog.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>I shook my head and scrambled around the front of my car, staring at the new tire to make sure I hadn\u2019t imagined everything I\u2019d just seen. My new, perfectly capable tire was fitted flawlessly to my car. I looked to the fog where Jared had disappeared and puffed. It was no longer an indefinite prospect that Jared was always waiting in the wings. I didn\u2019t know why or how he was doing it, but he was watching over me.</p><p>During the ride home my mind raced with theories and explanations. There was no way for him to explain it away. Jared had basical y admitted to fol owing me. Maybe that was why he was so irritated; I\u2019d managed to get myself in yet another situation that he would have to make clear that he was nearby. I should have been panicking\u2014anyone else would have repeated the word stalker over and over in her head\u2014but I only felt an overwhelming sense of calm. Beyond the calm I was even more shocked to discover that I was flattered.</p><p>Something else became clear to me: I had absolutely no common sense concerning Jared Ryel. I had become an irrational, ridiculous, sobbing fool and incredibly, he was stil in my life. I didn\u2019t care if he was a stalker or a miracle. The thought that he was always near me\u2014that he could have been watching me at that very moment\u2014sent euphoric shivers down my spine.</p><p>The next night, a knock at the door prompted Beth to grab her purse. When I swung open the door, Kim, Josh, Ryan, Tucker, Chad, Lisa, and Carrie were al standing in the hal .</p><p>\u201cWe held hands so they wouldn\u2019t get lost,\u201d Kim quipped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I said, turning to grab my keys and wal et. \u201cWe\u2019re not al going to fit in the Beemer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking my jeep,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d Beth chirped.</p><p>When I fol owed Beth through the door of the pub, I felt my body tense. I didn\u2019t relax until I finished scanning the room and saw that Jared was nowhere to be found. With my relaxation was also discontent, but Ryan\u2019s arm around my shoulders provided an immediate diversion. We took a table and Ryan fed quarters into the jukebox. Within an hour we were al on the wooden floor dancing to disco.</p><p>\u201cNext time, I\u2019m bringing a CD!\u201d Kim yel ed over the Bee Gees.</p><p>When we returned to our table, a slow song crooned from the juke box and Chad asked Beth to dance. She was beaming, and I watched him pul her gently by her hand to the dance floor. I felt the corners of my mouth turn up as I watched them, not being able to keep myself from the bittersweet memory of Jared\u2019s arms around me in the same space just a few weeks before.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. Dance with me,\u201d Ryan asked, pul ing at my hand.</p><p>I might have said no if he hadn\u2019t already had me half way to my feet. It had become a ful time job to keep him from getting the wrong idea about our friendship. I fol owed him to the dance floor and he secured his hands behind my back.</p><p>\u201cOh, cheer up. It\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Ryan smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking; I\u2019m concentrating on not tripping over your two left feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l catch you,\u201d he said, too close to my face.</p><p>\u201cGreat, then we\u2019d both fal ,\u201d I grinned.</p><p>Ryan hugged me to him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind fal ing to catch you.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed my chin on Ryan\u2019s shoulder until the song ended. He seemed to want to keep dancing but the next song was upbeat. He hesitated and then let me go, leading me back to the table by my hand.</p><p>We tabbed out after last cal , and Lisa and Carrie decided to take a cab to someone\u2019s apartment for an after party. Beth decided to ride with Chad once again and my heart leapt for her when I saw him lead her by the hand to his Jeep.</p><p>We quickly crossed against the light to the parking lot and Kim and Ryan giggled while I fumbled for my keys.</p><p>I cursed as my keys tumbled to the ground into a pot hole. I reached down to get them, but a dirty hand beat me there. Kim and Ryan were silent as I slowly stood to face the raggedy man in front of me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, holding my hand out for my keys. I noticed there were three other men with him, emerging from the shadows of the al ey.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he rasped. He had an unkempt brown beard and his black eyes were abnormal y deep-set. Upon first glance he appeared homeless, but his fingernails were too clean and his face wasn\u2019t nearly worn enough. Even growing up on the East Side, I had seen my share of the destitute on the docks with my father.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could spare some change for my trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr....sure,\u201d I said, looking at Kim and Ryan before I dug into my wal et. I handed him a ten dol ar bil and he glanced over to my BMW.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the key to this car is worth more than that,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>I reached into my wal et and handed him a twenty. \u201cThere. Please give me my keys,\u201d I said, holding out my hand.</p><p>He stared at me for a long moment, prompting Ryan to walk over to us. \u201cShe gave you some money. Give her back her keys.\u201d</p><p>The man looked Ryan over and then peered back at me. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite enough.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cHow much do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you have in your wal et?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d like that pretty green ring on your finger, too, baby dol ,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting her ring,\u201d Ryan said, stepping in between us.</p><p>\u201cBenson?\u201d the bearded man cal ed behind him. One of the men behind him nodded and signaled the others to move forward.</p><p>\u201cRyan....\u201d I whispered as he side-stepped to hide me behind him.</p><p>\u201cAw, look, Grahm. She\u2019s got a little bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Stu,\u201d the bearded man growled.</p><p>\u201cGive me the ring...and the money. And you can go,\u201d he said, spitting on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Grahm,\u201d Ryan shifted as he assessed the other men.</p><p>\u201cRyan....\u201d I warned, and then looked at the ring leader. \u201cListen, this is everything I have on me....\u201d I said, shoving at him several large bil s and more fives and ones. \u201cThis is everything in my wal et. Take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the ring,\u201d Grahm said in an obstinate tone.</p><p>I looked at Kim\u2019s horrified expression and then back at the thief. \u201cI... I can\u2019t give you my ring. My father gave it to me and he passed away recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very sad story,\u201d he mocked. \u201cGive me the ring.\u201d</p><p>I hid my shaking hand behind me, and looked around for someone, anyone that could help. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I swal owed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Grahm looked away momentarily to fol ow my line of sight and Ryan took the opportunity to attack.</p><p>Kim ran around the car. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>A scuffle ensued, with the other three jumping on Ryan. They were in a huddle, punching and kicking Ryan mercilessly.</p><p>I took a step toward the cluster. \u201cSTOP IT!\u201d</p><p>Ryan let out a muffled cry and stopped fighting. My hands flew to my mouth as I saw that Stu held a knife dripping with blood.</p><p>\u201cSTOP IT, PLEASE!\u201d I said.</p><p>The men were chuckling to each other; the brutality had ended with one last kick to Ryan\u2019s ribs. I stared in horror as he lay broken on the wet pavement. Just as he attempted to pul himself up to al fours, Stu used his boot to press Ryan\u2019s cheek back into the pavement.</p><p>\u201cAgh!\u201d Ryan groaned.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tel you to get up yet, did I?\u201d Stu said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The attention turned to my hand. I bal ed it into a fist; I wouldn\u2019t give up my father\u2019s ring. Grahm seemed to notice my decision and they al took a step forward, preparing to take it from me. Four sets of malevolent eyes shifted in unison as a familiar voice growled from behind me.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time you gentlemen moved on.\u201d</p><p>Jared strol ed past me, and the air escaped from my lungs with overwhelming relief.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d I said.</p> <p>He shot me a reassuring smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart. You don\u2019t have to give them your ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hel she\u2019s not. You want some of what this boy got?\u201d Stu warned.</p><p>Grahm eyed Jared suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019re Ryel\u2019s boy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>My blood ran cold as I looked down at Ryan\u2019s limp body. He was stil breathing, but in smal , shal ow gasps. I looked at Jared, terrified of what would happen to him.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, you can either leave now, with the money the lady has offered, or you can stay, without further use of your arms and legs. It\u2019s your choice. Either way, the ring won\u2019t be leaving her finger tonight.\u201d Jared\u2019s voice began polite, but as his offer ended it became low and frightening.</p> <p>Grahm chuckled as he lowered his head. Once his laughter ended, his eyes darted up, peering at Jared from under his brow. \u201cThen I guess we\u2019l just have to cut her hand off.\u201d</p><p>I froze.</p><p>Jared turned to me, his eyes steely-blue, and then he looked back at the men as he took a step towards them.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Jared sighed. \u201cNow you\u2019re just pissing me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of this,\u201d Benson said.</p><p>\u201cBenson, wait!\u201d Grahm ordered.</p> <p>Two of the men rushed Jared and just as a scream grew in my throat, I saw Jared pul one of them off his back and throw him across the lot\u2014an incredible distance, at least thirty yards\u2014against the stone wal of the al ey. The man\u2019s body flew into some trashcans with a loud crash. Benson flew back after Jared punched him in the face, and I recoiled when blood exploded from his nose. Stu ran at Jared with his knife, but Jared lithely dodged out of the way and caught the man\u2019s arm as he jabbed the knife at him. Jared pul ed Stu\u2019s arm to the side and quickly rammed his fist into his elbow from behind, hyper extending it until it snapped. Jared punched him again, this time in the face, and the man fel to the ground.</p><p>Grahm attempted to turn and run, but with amazing speed Jared reached out and grabbed his overcoat, stopping him in his tracks. The man whirled around and pushed Jared back against my car.</p><p>My hands flew up to my mouth.</p><p>Jared quickly spun to elbow Grahm in the side of his face. The bearded man plummeted to the ground; the blow causing him to thrash about in stifled groans.</p><p>When I gawked down at him, I noticed that his jaw appeared askew. He held it against his face with his hands, and moaned in agony.</p><p>Jared pul ed my car keys from the ground beside him and noticed a worn, black wal et next to them. He picked it up and it unfolded automatical y to reveal a large metal ic object.</p><p>\u201cAgh...this is not good,\u201d Jared said, rubbing his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is that? Is that his?\u201d I tried to get a better look as Jared stuffed it into his jacket pocket.</p> <p>Breathing heavily, Jared took a few steps closer to me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I...? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded but I could see blood oozing from a smal cut on his cheek bone, just below his eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared wiped the cut and glanced down at the blood smeared across the back of his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad. I have to get you out of here before the police show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s going to need a doctor,\u201d I said, rushing down to Ryan\u2019s side. He was stil breathing, but he\u2019d been beaten badly.</p><p>\u201cRyan? Can you hear me?\u201d I asked, but he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Jared nodded, and then effortlessly lifted Ryan into his arms to put him in the back seat of my car. Kim ran around to jump into the back and covered him with her coat.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look good, Nigh,\u201d Kim said, cradling him in her arms.</p><p>Jared opened the passenger side door. \u201cGet in, Nina, I\u2019l drive.\u201d</p><p>We flew through the darkness; making every red light a blurry afterthought. I wrapped my arms around my chest, finding it hard to breathe.</p><p>Jared rested his hand on my forearm. \u201cAre you hanging in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried about Ryan,\u201d I whispered, peeking back momentarily at my friend. Jared\u2019s hand gripped tighter.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay, Nina. Ryan\u2019s going to pul through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have...you could have been kil ed, Jared.\u201d</p><p>Jared raised an eyebrow, looking at me as if I were overreacting.</p><p>\u201cIt was necessary.\u201d His hand left my arm and gripped the steering wheel. \u201cThey\u2019re lucky I spared them their lives after he\u2014,\u201d he paused, seeing my expression. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry...I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. Least of al me.\u201d</p><p>When the scowl didn\u2019t leave my face, he shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong with me, Jared. You\u2019re bleeding, Ryan is...,\u201d I turned around, \u201cRyan? Can you hear me?\u201d I touched his battered face gently with my finger tips.</p><p>I could see Jared in my peripheral vision, his entire body tensed as if I was touching a live grenade.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get to the hospital!\u201d Kim begged, holding her fingers to his wrist.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Ryan. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I said, wincing when he did.</p><p>I had to turn back around to wipe my tears; I didn\u2019t want him to see me cry. Jared tucked my hair behind my ear, and with his warm thumb wiped the moisture away. I didn\u2019t notice that I was turning my ring mindlessly around my finger until Jared gently squeezed my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. It\u2019s going to be okay, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Ryan was whisked away to surgery and Kim, Jared and I were directed to the ICU waiting room. Jared sat beside me, brushing my bangs back from my eyes.</p><p>Kim sat on the adjacent couch, her knees shaking up and down. She bit her nails, staring straight ahead. \u201cI cal ed Beth half an hour ago! When are they going to get here?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at her; Ryan\u2019s blood was smeared on her shirt and jacket.</p><p>Beth, Josh and Chad filed into the waiting room, wide-eyed and breathless. Beth crashed into me, hugging me until I thought my ribs would break.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Nina!! Are you okay? Is Kim okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Beth put her hands to her mouth when she noticed the blood on Kim\u2019s clothing and shook her head. \u201cRyan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stil in surgery,\u201d Kim said. \u201cHe has some broken ribs, and they think the knife may have punctured his spleen. They\u2019l remove it if they can\u2019t get the bleeding stopped.\u201d</p><p>My eyes wel ed up with tears.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Josh sighed, rubbing his forehead in disbelief.</p><p>Beth hugged me as we both cried. She walked over to Kim and sat down. When Kim only offered a weak smile, Beth pul ed her into her arms.</p><p>Jared put his arm around me and led me back to the couch. Kim rehashed the account to the others until Josh interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just give him the damn ring, Nina?\u201d he asked in an accusatory tone.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t Nina\u2019s fault,\u201d Jared grimaced, squeezing me closer to his side.</p><p>\u201cHer father gave her that ring, Josh,\u201d Beth added.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a ring,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Jared looked into my eyes with an understanding expression; he didn\u2019t want me to feel worse than I already did. I didn\u2019t expect anyone to understand my attachment to the ring anymore than I expected them to understand my relationship with my father.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get away?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>I felt Jared shift uncomfortably beside me when Kim spoke, \u201cJared took al four of them on. He was amazing. Apparently he\u2019s taught his little sister everything she knows.\u201d</p><p>Al eyes darted to Jared, who leaned forward and clasped his hands together. \u201cI\u2019m in the security business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? In Iraq?\u201d Josh sneered.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Jared said, downplaying Kim\u2019s explanation.</p><p>I knew better. I had just glimpsed into a fraction of Jared\u2019s secret.</p><p>I jerked against Jared\u2019s shoulder when he whispered that Ryan was being wheeled into Intensive Care from recovery. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re safe,\u201d he whispered, pressing his lips to the top of my hair.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, wiping my eyes. \u201cI must have dozed off for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like an hour,\u201d Kim said with heavy eyes.</p><p>Jared squeezed me to him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t miss anything; you needed to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I yawned.</p><p>\u201cSeven thirty,\u201d Beth said, looking as exhausted as I felt.</p><p>The nurses pushed the stretcher down the hal with a barely-coherent Ryan attached to monitors and tubes. I ran into the hal way and grabbed his hand, walking with them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d My voice broke before I could attempt a braver tone.</p><p>Ryan mumbled something inaudible and I felt my face compress. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to talk.\u201d I choked at how familiar those words sounded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l be right down the hal , okay?\u201d I kissed his hand and he smiled, reaching his shaky fingers to brush my cheek with the back of his fingertips. I held his hand to my face for a moment, kissed it, then let go as they passed through the double doors.</p><p>The doors shut in my face, and I brought my hand to my mouth to stifle the cries. Beth came up behind me and Kim joined us, fol owed by Josh and Chad. We al huddled in the middle of the hal as we hugged and cried.</p><p>I had been nestled in Jared\u2019s warm arms for twenty minutes when a nurse came out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s resting now. If you would like to freshen up and come back later, he may be ready for visitors then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...how is he?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stil early, but he\u2019s young and healthy. I\u2019d say he\u2019s going to recover quite nicely,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>We shared a col ective sigh as she wheeled around and disappeared behind the double doors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head home. Cal me when he wakes up,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>\u201cCan I catch a ride with you?\u201d Kim asked. With that, Beth, Kim, Chad and Josh al stood up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>I nodded and stood up to hug her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l stay with her,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Beth smiled through her fatigue before Chad led her out by the hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted,\u201d Jared said. \u201cI should take you home.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI can\u2019t leave him here alone. I almost got him kil ed.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s faced twisted when he spoke. \u201cHe almost got himself kil ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried to keep them from attacking me!\u201d I said, offended.</p><p>\u201cFat lot of good it did him,\u201d Jared said dismissively, rol ing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know, Jared. If you hadn\u2019t shown up, Ryan would have bled out and I would have been left handed for the rest of my life, however brief.\u201d</p><p>Anger played out across his face and he stood up, stopping just inches from me. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny, Nina. You were in serious danger. Ryan should have diffused the situation instead of escalating it. He watches too much television. It\u2019s the ones that try to impress the girl who end up....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do that to impress me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis feelings for you clouded his judgment. He tried to be a hero....and here you are, feeling guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous?\u201d I said, incredulous.</p><p>Jared\u2019s rigid posture in the car replayed in my head. I was too worried to think about it at the time, but it made sense. He had mistaken my actions for intimacy. He thought Ryan and I were more than friends.</p><p>Jared rol ed his eyes. \u201cIf I were jealous, it wouldn\u2019t be for that. I\u2019m used to seeing you with someone else. It\u2019s just a matter of enduring it, now.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re used to it?\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t answer right away. He heaved an exasperated sigh and his jaws tensed.</p><p>\u201cI just meant from before. I\u2019ve had to see you with him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. At the pub, remember?\u201d Jared eyes wandered everywhere but into mine.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I said, stil unconvinced.</p><p>He took my hand and worry shadowed his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. For a moment I thought I wouldn\u2019t get there in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas your judgment clouded?\u201d I said acerbical y, stil incensed that he had snubbed Ryan\u2019s bravery.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he glowered, looking away from me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tel me the truth, are you?\u201d I pul ed my hand from his and crossed my arms.</p><p>Jared\u2019s head snapped back, and his eyes glared into mine. \u201cAnd what truth would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about. You took down four men\u2014on your own\u2014like they were little girls. The incomparable sense of timing you seem to have, the knowing where I am al the time....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where you are al the time...and my sense of timing tonight was almost nonexistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be honest with me or not?\u201d I stood there for a moment, and when Jared seemed to deliberate, I walked back to the couch.</p><p>Jared sighed in resignation and then sat beside me. \u201cI wanted to kiss you the other night. I knew that you were upset. I wanted to comfort you and I ended up just hurting you more.\u201d He winced. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention, Nina. I would\u2019ve given anything to lean into that kiss. It\u2019s just...complicated.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou knew that I was upset?\u201d</p><p>He looked down and sighed.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d I asked, exasperated.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up. \u201cI want you to be safe. I want you to be happy. I\u2019m figuring out the rest.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up. \u201cOkay?\u201d he said, searching my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>Jared\u2019s face was just a short distance from mine, so close that I could feel his warm breath gently blowing against my cheek. He stared at my lips, but I didn\u2019t dare move for fear he would pul back and I would have to suffer humiliation al over again. I took in a breath and he looked into my eyes.</p><p>He leaned closer to me an infinitesimal amount, and his phone buzzed. We both heaved out a sigh and he leaned back to retrieve his phone.</p> <p>\u201cRyel,\u201d he snapped. I heard a quick chattering on the line, and then he clicked his phone closed, shaking his head. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>He kissed my forehead, and the warmth of his lips blazed into my skin.</p><p>\u201cSee you around,\u201d he said, walking to the doorway.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I blurted out, scrambling to my feet. He turned to face me and I smiled. \u201cThank you. Thank you so much. For everything.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes grew soft and he took a few steps toward me. The warmth of his hands sunk into my shoulders, and his jaw tensed as a flood of emotion scrol ed across his face. His eyebrows pul ed in before he gingerly pul ed me to him and pressed his soft lips against mine. He ran his hands up my neck to my face where he held my cheeks in each of his hands. My surroundings vanished; the only thing I could focus on was the breathtaking heat against my mouth. An entire lifetime could have passed and stil the kiss ended too soon. He pul ed me tighter to his chest and then wheeled around, disappearing down the hal .</p> <p>I walked a few paces backwards and fel against the seat. The gravity of the situation pressed down on me with renewed strength. The danger, my fear, and the confusion about what I\u2019d seen\u2014what Jared was capable of\u2014were swimming around in my mind. I should have been insane with anxiety but I felt the same sense of calm I\u2019d felt on the side of the road the night before last. Ryan was going to be al right, my hand was stil firmly attached to my wrist, and Jack\u2019s gift was safely around my finger.</p><p>I felt a twinge of shame as I realized none of those things were the reason for my frame of mind. My lips stil tingled from the warmth of Jared\u2019s kiss.</p><p>I melted into the sofa, turning my head to press my cheek against the cushion for support. I was so fatigued it felt like work just to breathe.</p><p>My heavy eyes rose to the wal of windows along the waiting room. Cynthia\u2019s heels were quickly clicking down the hal .</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Disclosure</p><p>\u201cNina! For the love of Christ, why didn\u2019t you cal me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom. I wasn\u2019t hurt,\u201d I said, swaying as she tugged and pul ed on me to look me over.</p> <p>She clutched me into her arms tightly. \u201cNina Elizabeth Grey, if anything had happened to you, I swear to God... I swear to God, I would have never forgiven him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure those men wouldn\u2019t have cared if you forgave them or not, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a wry look and hugged me again. \u201cWel , it doesn\u2019t matter now. You\u2019re safe, that is what\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Beth cal you?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my eyes open.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean did Beth cal me?\u201d Her voice raised an octave. \u201cI\u2019m not al owed to see for myself that my only child is safe after she is...is attacked in the street by some junkie? Nina, you infuriate me sometimes! What were you doing at a bar, anyway? On that side of town, no less, you could have been kil ed! And you have the audacity to ask\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom! Okay! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d I pul ed her to me. She was very near hysterics. Usual y my mother didn\u2019t go to such extremes, but she had enough to agonize over without me being assaulted in dark al eys.</p><p>Cynthia pul ed away and held me at arm\u2019s length. \u201cWel , that\u2019s enough of that,\u201d she sighed, her typical poker face back into play. \u201cCome, Dear. I\u2019l send someone for your car.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay here and wait for Ryan to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re exhausted,\u201d she argued in vain. We both knew I wouldn\u2019t change my mind.</p><p>Cynthia patted my knee and stood. \u201cI expect you to be in your bed resting in four hours. No excuses, young lady.\u201d</p><p>I nodded as she clicked down the hal way. I rubbed my eyes and leaned back against my seat. The television was on a medical channel, something about insurance and prescriptions. It didn\u2019t take me long to lose interest.</p><p>Three hours later, the ICU nurse stood at my side. \u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I sat up and blinked my eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Jenny. I\u2019m Ryan\u2019s nurse,\u201d she smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s awake. He\u2019s asking for you.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and walked with her to the double doors. Before we made it through, a disheveled woman scampered down the hal toward us. She wore a brown waitress\u2019 uniform and her frizzy black hair failed miserably at staying in the messy bun she\u2019d fashioned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Ryan Scott! I was told he\u2019s in ICU?\u201d she puffed.</p><p>Jenny looked at me and then back to her. \u201cAre you his...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother! I\u2019m his mom. He\u2019s here? Is he okay?\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cI\u2019m Cal ie Scott. I\u2019d like to see him, please.\u201d</p><p>Jenny extended an apologetic smile and then turned to Cal ie. \u201cHe\u2019s here, Ms. Scott. I\u2019l show you to his room.\u201d</p><p>I trudged back to my seat, glancing at my watch. According to Cynthia, I had less than an hour to make my way home to rest. Unable to comply, I pul ed my phone from my pocket to cal in an explanation.</p><p>As I dialed, Jenny poked her head into the waiting room doorway. \u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHe would stil like to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I said, surprised. I fol owed quickly behind her through the double doors and we stopped three rooms down. When she pul ed back the heavy curtain, the rings grated across the metal bar.</p><p>She smiled to her left. \u201cI found her. She didn\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>I peered into the room and inwardly cringed at the tubes and wires leading from Ryan\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nigh,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>I managed a half grin. \u201cToday is the only day I\u2019l let you get away with that.\u201d</p><p>Ryan laughed and then winced.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, Baby,\u201d Cal ie said, searching for a place to touch him that wasn\u2019t attached to a monitor or IV pump. She settled on brushing back his hair.</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t fuss,\u201d he whispered, leaning away from her nervous stroking.</p><p>\u201cChad, Beth and Josh were here earlier; they\u2019l be back,\u201d I said, touching his foot.</p><p>Ryan nodded. \u201cIs Jared stil here?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, making the corners of Ryan\u2019s mouth turn up. I wasn\u2019t sure how much he had seen, or how much he remembered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s stalking you.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s not stalking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else do you explain him showing up out of nowhere?\u201d Ryan pressed.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s stalking you? Is this the man that attacked my son?\u201d Cal ie\u2019s face compressed with concern.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom. He\u2019s the guy that kept us al from getting kil ed,\u201d Ryan said, watching my face.</p><p>Cal ie looked to me, stil wanting answers.</p><p>I fidgeted under her stare. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine that came just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs usual,\u201d Ryan frowned. \u201cYou look like hel . Get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sleep later,\u201d I argued. Of course he would be worried about me while he was lying in a hospital bed.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep now. My mom\u2019s here, I don\u2019t need both of you whining over every little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t whine,\u201d I said, feigning insult.</p><p>\u201cYou can be kinda whiny,\u201d he smiled and tapped his cheek. I maneuvered around the tubes and wires to kiss the spot he had indicated. Being this close to someone covered in hospital paraphernalia caused my ribs to wrench in an al too familiar way. I bit my lip with apprehension.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he reached up an arm to brush my cheek with the back of his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fine. I\u2019d do it again if I had to.\u201d</p><p>My face fel at his words. I knew how he felt about me, and how it would end. I couldn\u2019t stand it if I ever hurt Ryan enough for him to hate me.</p><p>My hands grabbed his. \u201cYou just concentrate on getting wel before you start planning more knife fights, al right?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSweet dreams, Nina.\u201d</p><p>I walked into the dark, curtains drawn and al bulbs extinguished. Beth was stil cocooned inside her comforter breathing heavily. I peeled off my coat and fel face down onto my bed.</p><p>I tried to lay as stil as possible; I didn\u2019t want to let my mind wander. Al owing thoughts would mean envisioning the attack, the blood, the eyes of the man that would cut off my hand to take my ring; the chil ing sound of Ryan\u2019s cry when he was impaled and Kim\u2019s horrified expression in the car. I didn\u2019t even want to dwel on Jared\u2019s lips. I just wanted to sleep.</p><p>My eyes shot open to the sound of the door quietly pul ing closed.</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d I cal ed, listening for any motion from her side of the room. She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I leaned up on my elbows and blinked my eyes several times until I could see clearly that Beth\u2019s bed was empty and made. A note was on the back of the door, so I pushed myself slowly from the bed and ambled across the cold floor.</p><p>Went with Chad and Josh to the hospital. See you there. ~Beth Ryan wouldn\u2019t be at the hospital alone. Of course his mother might stil be there, but it was good that he would have his friends around him. Beth would be home late, I assumed. I looked at the clock.</p><p>Six o\u2019clock!</p><p>Scrambling from the bed, I rushed to change and brush my teeth, pul ing my hair haphazardly into a ponytail. Just as I grabbed my keys, my stomach growled. Going off campus alone immediately seemed like a bad idea, and hoping for something edible at the hospital was being overly optimistic.</p><p>Dinner at the Gate meant a long walk in the bitter cold outside, which would keep my mind off more troubling circumstances. I zipped up my coat and locked the door behind me.</p><p>Soon I was within a dozen yards of my destination. I was right; shivering with every step had been the perfect diversion from the night before. I puffed out a steamy breath of relief as my mind concentrated on the warmth and subsequent thaw the doors of The Gate assured me.</p><p>Before my hand reached the door handle, a man stepped from the shadows.</p><p>I jerked to a stop. \u201cMr. Dawson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the file?\u201d he asked, his eyes intent.</p><p>Stil on edge from the attack, my hands bal ed into fists and I shoved them in my pockets. I glanced at the door handle, seeing that it was just a foot or two from me.</p><p>I forced my body to relax. \u201cMr. Rosen isn\u2019t familiar with your transaction, but I could give you his number, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019l help me, then?\u201d his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why you would think this incessant harassment would encourage me to be of assistance to you at al .\u201d I was lying, of course. I knew how the intimidation game worked. I\u2019d seen my father win it many times.</p><p>\u201cNina, I\u2019ve told you what I\u2019m looking for. Your father and I\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere involved in a property deal. You\u2019ve said that,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m his daughter, not his business partner. Please cal Mr. Rosen.\u201d</p><p>I reached for the door, but Mr. Dawson grabbed my arm. With a quick jerk, he yanked me toward him. I gasped as he whispered in my ear with his guttural, growling voice. \u201cI\u2019m not playing games with you, little girl. Your father has documents and photos that I want. The last time I saw them, they were in a file in his office marked Port of Providence. I want that entire file, do you understand me? Unless you want mommy to have to deal with me later, I suggest you do as I ask.\u201d</p><p>Threatening my mother sent a courageous voice emanating from my throat, \u201cStay away from her!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Dawson snorted. \u201cJust like Jack...never know when to back down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father didn\u2019t back down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what got him kil ed!\u201d Mr. Dawson snarled, jerking my arm again.</p><p>I felt my eyes widen in stunned disbelief. His reply didn\u2019t make sense. My father died after his car accident.</p><p>Mr. Dawson sighed and loosened his grip. \u201cI\u2019m doin\u2019 you a favor, Peach. You don\u2019t want caught within a hundred yards of that package. There are more dangerous things than me out there wantin\u2019 it worse than I do. Bring it to me, and you and your mother wil have a lot less to worry about.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slipped away from my arm, and he disappeared into the shadows of the neighboring building. I leaned my head against the frosty glass door, trying to gain the courage to move. Once the adrenaline absorbed into my body, I sucked in a gasp of air and slid to the ground.</p><p>He didn\u2019t come. I was in danger, and Jared didn\u2019t come. I was surprised when the correlation hit me, and I wondered if I had just realized it or if I had known al along. The last time Mr. Dawson approached me, Jared was a no-show as wel , but I reasoned that Ryan had been there. Ryan had control ed the situation enough so that Jared wasn\u2019t needed. But this time I was alone. This time I needed him.</p><p>Someone pushed the door open against me. \u201cAre you al right?\u201d A short, dark haired boy with glasses came into view, poking his head through the semi-open door.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to come in?\u201d the boy asked, confused at his discovery.</p><p>I pushed myself off the ground. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I said, quickly turning toward Andrews. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t look back to see his inevitable bewildered expression; I was too intent on my mission. I would return to my mother\u2019s house and turn it upside down if I had to. I ran down the hal to the open elevator and tapped the button of my floor several times, leaning back against the rail. As the doors final y closed, my mother squeezed by them, causing them to jolt open once more.</p><p>\u201cI trust you\u2019ve slept,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d I asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cDo I need a reason?\u201d She was very nearly offended, but dismissed my question to address more important things. \u201cNina, honestly. You look frightful. How much sleep did you get?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough,\u201d I stepped out of the elevator and pul ed her with me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, reluctant to be dragged along.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home. Can I go home with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I was sure she was curious what had possessed me to make such an atypical request; I had treated our home like ground zero of a quarantined leper colony since the funeral.</p><p>I tugged at her coat to quicken her pace and she abruptly stopped. \u201cWhat is going on, Nina?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked, pul ing at her arm again.</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d she said, motioning to my hand on her arm. \u201cThis is what I mean. What is so urgent?\u201d</p><p>I exhaled in a frustrated puff. \u201cBeth is at the hospital and I don\u2019t want to be alone. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m being overly enthusiastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnthusiastic? Nina, you haven\u2019t tugged on my coat like that since you were five. Is there another reason you want to go home?\u201d</p><p>I stared at her blankly. I didn\u2019t want to lie to her again.</p><p>\u201cAl right,\u201d she sighed. \u201cRobert is waiting in the car.\u201d</p> <p>En route, Cynthia fiddled with her careful y placed French bun and asked generic questions about school. She was suspicious of my behavior, but as was the norm with my mother, she insisted on overlooking the obvious to obtain a false sense of security. She didn\u2019t speak for the rest of the trip home to keep from spoiling the il usion with trivial things like the truth.</p><p>Robert slowed when he entered our long drive. My mother smiled at him when he opened her door, and I fol owed behind her to the house.</p><p>Once inside, I peeled off my scarf, hat, coat, and final y my gloves. I rubbed the residual chil stil clinging to my arms, methodical y going over my plan in my mind.</p><p>\u201cNina, don\u2019t hover in doorways. It\u2019s rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going upstairs,\u201d I said in passing.</p><p>I rushed to my father\u2019s office, hoping my eyes would open to something I had missed before. I walked along the outer edges of the room and ran my hand along the surface of the wal , feeling the uneven texture with my fingertips. I tried not to concentrate on any one thing; I wanted to leave my mind open to any clues that I might have overlooked before.</p><p>My fingertips grazed the spines of my father\u2019s books. I pul ed a few of them out and looked behind them, knocking on the wal they stood against. I crawled under his desk and felt for anything abnormal.</p><p>When I found nothing, I returned to the wal s, the cabinets, and then the bookcase. I went over them al again, trying to see them a different way, to touch them differently, to appraise them for anything that seemed out of place. As my patience waned, so did my objectivity. I began plowing through the cabinets as I had before, slamming them shut and muttering under my breath.</p> <p>I sat on the floor against the front of Jack\u2019s desk and stared across the room with my elbows on my knees. The answers were here; I was missing something.</p><p>I lifted my chin in interest when my father\u2019s favorite painting caught my eye. I scrambled to my feet and reached under the edges of the large frame.</p><p>Determined, I reached closer to its center, knelt down and peered under it, and even pul ed it a bit from the wal . I didn\u2019t see anything remarkable, so I reached up blindly, hoping to find something that didn\u2019t belong. There was nothing.</p><p>I stomped in anger. \u201cDADDY!\u201d</p><p>I looked around the room with my hands defiantly on my hips, blowing my bangs from my face. There were four other paintings in the room. I rushed each one, mimicking the sweep I\u2019d just done with the larger painting. I ripped the fourth one off the wal and searched the backside of the frame.</p><p>Looking at the now-empty wal , I felt another scream of aggravation coming on.</p><p>How could there be nothing in his office? No safes, no secret doorways, no....</p><p>Keys. There were keys in Jack\u2019s desk. The first time I\u2019d searched his office I assumed they were his car keys. But the car he drove himself\u2014his Jag \u2014was totaled. Scrap metal. What were the keys to?</p><p>In my haste to get to the desk, my hip smashed into the corner with a loud crack. I stifled a cry and doubled over, using the desk to steady myself. I attempted to rub the sting away with one hand, and pul ed open the drawer containing the keys with the other. I held the keys in my palm, trying to remember if I\u2019d seen a lock that the keys might fit. I slowly turned my head toward the wal of cabinets. The center tower of files was locked.</p><p>Surely, he wouldn\u2019t be this obvious, I thought.</p><p>I hobbled to the cabinets and tugged on the drawer. It was stil locked.</p><p>The first key only went in half way. I tried three more keys; the fourth easily slid in, but wouldn\u2019t turn. Two keys later, I found myself cursing my father, Mr. Dawson, even the metal in my hands. I gripped the last key between my thumb and finger and closed my eyes.</p><p>The key slid in, and I rotated my wrist. It began to turn, and then caught. None of the keys were to the locked file cabinet.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d I said, throwing the keys to the floor. I kicked the cabinet, walked away, and then returned to land another kick, this time denting the bottom.</p><p>Limping across the floor, I picked up the keys and tossed them into the desk drawer. I was done.</p><p>I walked down the hal with my hand stil pressed against my throbbing hip and stopped at the top of the stairs. Cynthia\u2019s voice was weary as she spoke on the phone. Idling for a moment before taking the first stair, I heard her speak my name.</p><p>\u201cNina\u2019s fine. She\u2019s upstairs, resting. What do you expect me to do? Forbid her to...? Honestly, you worry too much! She just didn\u2019t want to be alone tonight. I heard some commotion upstairs; I assumed she knocked something over. It mustn\u2019t have been as bad as...,\u201d she sighed, \u201cyes. I\u2019l check on her. Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia turned to look up at me. I sheepishly waved, cursing under my breath for getting caught eavesdropping.</p><p>\u201cAre you al right, Dear?\u201d she cal ed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Ran into a desk; bumped my side. Who was that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWas it real y necessary to yel out such profanities while I\u2019m on the phone? My friends were under the impression that I had raised a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize I was being so loud.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia nodded dismissively. \u201cI\u2019ve got a beautiful ham in the oven. You\u2019l be staying for dinner, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...yes. I was going to stop by the hospital, but it can wait.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia made her way up the stairs. I fol owed into her study where she set some unopened envelopes on her desk.</p><p>\u201cHow is your friend doing?\u201d she asked, I assumed just to be polite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, I haven\u2019t been back since this morning, but no one\u2019s cal ed to tel me otherwise. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s been improvement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful news, Dear,\u201d she said, preoccupied.</p><p>She pul ed her pearl drop earrings from her ears, and placed them on the silver tray that sat on a smal table near the wal . My eyes wandered to a hutch that matched her table and desk. The fronds of a plant obscured the top cabinet, and I zeroed in on a smal silver circle on the top right corner.</p><p>\u201cComing, Nina?\u201d Cynthia asked, pausing at the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be down in a minute. I wanted to check my e-mail, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at al ,\u201d she smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t be late for dinner.\u201d</p><p>I watched her walk out the door and waited as she descended the stairs. Once she was deeper into the lower level, I sprinted down the hal to my father\u2019s office. Yanking open his desk drawer, I grabbed the smal silver ring of keys.</p><p>With a sense of excitement, I hurried back to my mother\u2019s study and pul ed the plant to the floor. It was heavier than it appeared, and I grunted as I worked to set it down without overturning the whole pot onto its side.</p><p>After the first five keys failed, I blew my bangs from my face with a puff of air. Only two keys left. The sixth key slid in, and when I turned my wrist and the key continued to turn ninety degrees, I gasped.</p><p>Pul ing the cabinet door open, I peered behind me for a just a moment, afraid of what my mother would say if she caught me snooping in her things.</p><p>There were several files, so I pul ed al of them out and spread them on the floor. On my knees, I thumbed through contracts, shipping papers, a receipt for the ring my father bought me, insurance claims and filings, and the occasional deposit slip.</p><p>I slid one folder to the side to uncover another with Jack\u2019s no-nonsense scribble on it.</p><p>Port of Providence My hands shook as I opened the flap of the folder. Did I real y want to know? I felt I was opening Pandora\u2019s Box.</p><p>Sitting on top, I found a thick, wrinkled manila envelope. I pul ed the packet from the file and opened it. It contained a stack of black and white photos. Picture after picture featured a dozen or so different men, but those same faces appeared over and over, at times alone, and at other times together. One man that was most often the subject in the pictures stood beside the governor of Rhode Island. Another man was pictured in both casual clothes and some type of uniform; I assumed he was a police officer in formal blues.</p><p>I\u2019d seen enough movies to know that these were surveil ance photos. I turned each of the pictures over, but they were al unmarked. I had never seen these men before that I could remember, and I couldn\u2019t fathom why my father would have them photographed. I looked at the file on the floor, knowing I was about to find out.</p><p>A hand-written sheet of paper caught my eye, and I poured over it. I flipped to the next page, and the next. My heart pounded as the words burned into my irises. It wasn\u2019t true. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cNina? Dinner!\u201d</p><p>I rushed to gather the files and shoved them into Cynthia\u2019s hutch. I locked the cabinet door and heaved the clay pot back to its shelf. After returning the keys to Jack\u2019s desk drawer, I met Cynthia in the dining room.</p><p>I sat in my usual chair, across from my mother. A steaming plate of food waited for me on fine china, and I grimaced as the mouth-watering smel invaded my nose. I realized I hadn\u2019t eaten since five o\u2019clock the evening before. I was famished, but couldn\u2019t eat.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry, dear?\u201d</p><p>I furrowed my brow and stabbed a carrot with my fork. Her strained politeness would soon be chipped away and al the pleasantries would cease.</p><p>\u201cNot real y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , why not?\u201d I waited for the right words to come and she rol ed her eyes with impatience. \u201cReal y, Nina. You know I don\u2019t like it when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Daddy always been a criminal, or was it something he took up just before he died?\u201d I blurted out, unconcerned with the consequences.</p><p>Cynthia\u2019s fork fel to her plate with a shril clang. She didn\u2019t say anything for a long while. We both held our breath, waiting for the other to speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat...did you say?\u201d she final y whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe I did. I\u2019m sure you misspoke,\u201d her eyes fluttered as she ended her sentence.</p><p>\u201cPort of Providence.\u201d I sat slightly forward in my chair, watching her expression change from insult to shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Where did you hear th\u2014,\u201d Cynthia stopped mid-sentence and shook her head. She was flustered, which she rarely experienced.</p><p>\u201cI saw the file, Mother. Was it organized crime, or did he just skim off the top at the docks? You know his payrol was ful of dirty cops, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina Elizabeth Grey! You wil shut your mouth this instant!\u201d I could see the wheels in her head turning, and then she stood up to come to my side of the table, sitting beside me. \u201cYou saw files. What files?\u201d I could tel her fury was subdued, she would address my disrespect later.</p><p>\u201cThe files locked in the hutch in your study, Mother. Stop playing dumb.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes tightened; my rudeness narrowly outweighed her curiosity. \u201cI\u2019ve never played dumb in my life, Nina. Why on earth would you\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the truth.\u201d I didn\u2019t let my eyes move an inch from her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bother myself with your father\u2019s business dealings,\u201d she said, turning away.</p><p>\u201cBut you know what I\u2019m talking about when I say Port of Providence, don\u2019t you?\u201d My accusing eyes bored into her.</p><p>Cynthia nodded slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s not something you want to admit to having knowledge of, Nina. Forget you saw any of that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cForget\u2014,\u201d I was in shock. My father was a...a....criminal? A thief? My face twisted into disgust. \u201cHe stole from the distributors he shipped for, he sold things on the black market, he smuggled il egal contraband, and he used cops to cover up his dirty work...police officers, Mother! Al of which he gathered evidence against to keep them from turning on him!\u201d My eyes glossed over with anger. \u201cEverything we have is from blood money. Jack had people beaten...he\u2019s had people kil ed.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia wiped a tear and looked down at her lap. This took me off-guard; I had only seen my mother cry a handful of times, al of them fol owing Jack\u2019s accident and death.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head slowly. She looked at me with sympathetic eyes, \u201cYou were never supposed to see those things, Nina. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Your father was always so careful to keep you safe from that part of his life.

Why aren\u2019t you upset about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina, Dear,\u201d her tone turned soft, \u201cI told you. Your father did everything in his power to keep you removed from his dealings. I understand you were frightened; but you were safe, I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Why won\u2019t anyone give me a straight answer?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia tilted her head and raised her eyebrows, the way she did when I was little. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree that after tonight, some things are better left unsaid?\u201d</p><p>My immediate reaction was to scream at her and demand the truth, but she was right. I had lost my father again tonight, the reverence I\u2019d once felt for him was replaced with debilitating disappointment. It was worse than losing him to death. Al perception I\u2019d had of him had been ripped away.</p><p>He was no longer God in my eyes, he was just a man; a flawed, corrupt man.</p><p>I considered Cynthia\u2019s suggestion and nodded.</p><p>She lifted my chin. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d I blurted, turning away from her touch. Everything I knew was a lie. I left her alone to fetch my coat.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she cal ed after me.</p><p>\u201cFor a walk,\u201d I said, bundling myself inside my hat and gloves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing outside, Nina! Be reasonable! Please let Robert drive you!\u201d</p><p>I yanked my purse over my shoulder and jerked open the door. \u201cI\u2019l walk to the bus stop and catch a ride to Brown. I\u2019l cal you when I get there.\u201d I avoided her inevitably pleading eyes as I marched outside, slamming the door behind me.</p><p>Winter exploded in my face. The air was too cold to breathe, burning my nose and throat with each gasp of air that I took in. The wind had picked up and the large snowflakes whipped around me. My hair thrashed against my face and I squinted as the icy wind blurred my vision.</p><p>I tried to sort al of the new information, but the freezing air along with my anger blocked any rational thought I could have. I reached the end of the drive and trudged into the street, walking as fast as my legs could carry me. My home had become a dark, wicked thing where corruption and scandal took place. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to look back, even though I had no intentions of returning.</p><p>When the painful burn from the wind began to wane to a numbing sensation, I heard a vehicle slow down beside me. I continued to walk; I wasn\u2019t in the mood to explain myself or argue with Robert. He was less capable of changing my mind than my mother.</p> <p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>I knew that voice. It belonged to the one person I wanted to see. When I came to a stop, so did his SUV.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking the bus, Jared,\u201d I said, looking straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I\u2019ve come to take you home.\u201d</p><p>I stood perfectly stil except for the occasional weaving when the wind attempted to knock me over.</p><p>\u201cNina, it\u2019s freezing outside,\u201d he said, impatient.</p><p>When I didn\u2019t budge, Jared opened his door and walked over to me. He stared at me for a moment and then bent down, sweeping me into his arms. He carried me to the passenger side, pressing his warm lips to my forehead.</p><p>He placed me gently into the seat and paused. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t utter a single word. I felt broken; it was al too much for me to accept in such a short amount of time.</p><p>Once in his seat, he turned the heater to its highest setting and pul ed forward. Occasional y, Jared would reach over and brush my hair back from my face, or hold his warm hand affectionately to my cheek, but the only sounds were the heated air blowing through the vents and the road under the tires.</p><p>The Escalade came to a stop on the street behind Andrews. Jared walked with me to the door in silence, but when I put my hand on the knob, he touched my arm.</p><p>\u201cNina, I know it\u2019s a lot to take in, but he loved you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes focused and I shot a glare at him. \u201cYou knew my father?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes tensed in anguish. \u201cI know everything that he did...he did out of love for you, Nina. You were his world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about him,\u201d I said through my teeth. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me, and unless you give me some answers, you can leave. I am sick of being lied to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you,\u201d Jared said, angry and shocked that I had dismissed him so easily.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so secretive? Why do you always know where I am? How did you save us this morning? How did you do al of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning you were fine with not knowing al the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before I found out my entire life was a lie.\u201d Angry tears overflowed and rushed down my cheeks. \u201cI just need one thing in my life\u2014just one \u2014that I know is real. I need someone to be honest with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared whispered, reaching out for me. I pushed him away and he winced. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. I\u2019ve had to stand by and watch you cry so many times...I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked him, keeping him at arm\u2019s length. \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019ve watched me cry? Please just tel me the truth!\u201d</p><p>Jared hesitated and then sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t. Believe me when I say I wish to God that I could, but I can\u2019t.\u201d His eyes were heavy with a lifetime\u2019s worth of frustration.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d I said, opening the door. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you anymore. Please leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina....\u201d Jared said. I met his eyes one last time before shutting the door behind me. He knocked twice. \u201cNina,\u201d he said in a low, desperate tone.</p><p>I pressed my head against the door and let out a weak, muffled cry. I couldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t worthy enough for the truth. Anger took hold of me again, and I pushed away from the door, making my way to my room.</p><p>Beth sat at her desk, clicking the keyboard on her lap top when I swung the door open. She jumped and turned when the door knob hammered against the wal .</p><p>\u201cWhere were you? Ryan was waiting for you to come.\u201d Her eyes bulged when she saw the expression on my face. \u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to The Gate to get a bite to eat before heading to the hospital, but I ran into Mr. Dawson,\u201d I said, slumping onto my bed.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dawson?\u201d Her voice flew up an octave. \u201cWhy was he at The Gate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe grabbed me, told me he wanted me to get the papers for him\u2014\u201c \u201cHe grabbed you? Does Jared know?\u201d</p><p>My eyes darted to hers with suspicion. \u201cWhat makes you ask that?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, picking at her delicate fingers. \u201cHe always seems to have the best timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t show up this time.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head closer so that I would look at her. \u201cHave you seen him today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just dropped me off,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. He didn\u2019t show up, but he brought you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not talk about this anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sure. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She dropped her arm from my shoulder and left me to sit on her own bed.</p><p>After a few moments, Beth sighed and fidgeted.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Beth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina...,\u201d I waited for her to gain the courage for whatever it was she was struggling with. She took another breath, but it didn\u2019t equip her with the bravery she was hoping for.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love him,\u201d she blurted out, quickly bracing for my reaction.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love him. I don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much is enough to know about someone before you can love them?\u201d</p><p>I thought back to the way I felt when I was around him, the way his touch sent electricity through my body; the way his eyes melted me when he looked beyond my irises to something deeper, as if he could see my emotions dance around inside of me. I felt protected and whole in his presence that rivaled even the absolute security and love I felt being near my father. I shuddered when I considered how miserable my life would be if Jared did as I asked and left me alone.</p><p>\u201cYou love him,\u201d Beth confirmed as she watched my expression. \u201cHe loves you, too, you know. It\u2019s so obvious, almost as if he loved you before you met.\u201d I shook my head in denial and Beth\u2019s voice raised a tone higher. \u201cNina. Seriously? After everything that\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he does, it\u2019s not enough to trust me with the truth.\u201d I winced at my own words. I didn\u2019t realize how hurtful it would be to say them out loud.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stil not talking, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him to leave me alone tonight.\u201d Beth began to speak but I continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. Wel , I meant it, but it\u2019s not what I want. Al he has to do is be honest with me, and he just...refuses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to understand it? Can\u2019t you just be with him and forget about the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe with him how? I don\u2019t even know where he lives. I don\u2019t know his phone number, if he\u2019s right or left-handed, or his birthday...I don\u2019t know anything about him,\u201d I said, disgusted with my predicament.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you two together. It wil al work out,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>I rol ed my eyes at her simple solution. Beth\u2019s logic made my feelings more complicated than necessary, and I was glad when she seemed to give up. I was devastated about Jack, furious with Cynthia and found Jared guilty on principle. Other than that I didn\u2019t want to think about it. Anger was easier to control than feeling betrayed.</p><p>Thursday morning I fol owed Beth to the table reserved for the coffee pots and various sugars and other creamers. Per her usual, Kim appeared behind us and complained about our additives. I gripped my travel mug with both hands, keeping in line with my friends.</p><p>Beth stopped in her tracks, initiating a pile-up. I slammed into Kim, and the coffee I held exploded from the slit in the lid, splattering in a vertical line from col ar to hem of my coat.</p><p>\u201cBeth!\u201d Kim and I both yelped in unison.</p><p>I looked down at my coat and used my mittens to brush off the dripping, mocha-colored liquid. Someone abruptly grabbed my arm and yanked me forward. I didn\u2019t have time to see which of my girlfriends it was, because Jared\u2019s incredible blue-grey eyes caught my attention the second I looked up.</p><p>I took quicker steps than I should have to be within conversation distance, but once I stood within a few feet of him, I couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cRunning late, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jared said, seeming pleased at my reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked, baffled.</p><p>He laughed and looked down. I saw from my peripheral that Beth and Kim were just as awestruck as I was. I couldn\u2019t imagine what had possessed him to show up here, and I was even more clueless at his carefree manner; as if our conversation from the night before had never taken place.</p><p>\u201cWil you have a seat?\u201d</p><p>I sat down immediately, in an almost comical fashion. He usual y didn\u2019t make an appearance unless he had something important he needed to say, or if there was trouble. The scenarios were flashing through my mind. I stared at him in silence, waiting for the answer.</p><p>He crossed his arms on the table and leaned toward me. \u201cI know you said to leave you alone, but I did a lot of thinking last night and I had to see you. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened a bit in shock, and I shut it just as I looked up at Kim and Beth. Their mouths were in a similar state.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l , er...meet you in class, Nigh,\u201d Kim said, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>I grimaced as they abandoned me. My shoulders felt so tense they seemed to be hovering around my ears. I took a deep breath, and forced them down to their proper position.</p><p>Jared appeared nervous and he swal owed. \u201cDid I cross a line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want answers, Jared.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth turned up as he slid a card over to my side of the table.</p><p>I pinched the thin paper between my fingers and examined it. It was a generical y ivory business card with his name and company name in chocolate brown writing. My heart kicked into high gear upon reading the next line, which contained his phone number.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me your number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He waited for a moment with an expectant stare, and then I understood what it was that he wanted.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I said, scrambling to search my backpack for something to write on. I scribbled my name and number on a piece of paper and slid it to him, mimicking his smooth, single movement.</p><p>Jared grinned and poked the paper into his inside jacket pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat if that\u2019s not my number?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s the number to an anger management clinic for your sister?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head, laughing once. \u201cThen I\u2019d give it to her. But I hope it\u2019s yours. I need it to ask you to dinner properly.\u201d</p><p>I could hear my heart pounding inside my chest, and when I thought he might be able to hear it, I felt my cheeks flush.</p><p>\u201cI told you I needed answers, first,\u201d I said, trying to seem calmer than I felt.</p><p>\u201cI told you we were going to talk, didn\u2019t I?\u201d His eyes were bright with amusement, even seeming a lighter shade of blue. \u201cI\u2019m going to cal you this afternoon. Wil that be al right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask me, now?\u201d I said, incinerating any chance of seeming indifferent.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asked, raising his brow.</p><p>I nodded and a broad smile lit up his face. \u201cWould you have dinner with me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make you late.\u201d Even as he said the words, he seemed in no hurry to say goodbye.</p><p>We both stood, and Jared held the door open for me as we walked into the morning air. It felt surreal to be walking next to him on campus. He seemed less like a figment of my imagination surrounded by the scenery of my everyday life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l pick you up around six thirty?\u201d he asked, lightly grazing my finger tips with his. Electricity immediately shot up my arm, and my heart hammered against my ribs.</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d I couldn\u2019t have chosen words more true.</p><p>Kim and Beth were waiting for me just inside the building, and I tried to keep from jumping up and down as I approached.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Beth said, grabbing my arm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out tomorrow night. Six-thirty,\u201d I beamed.</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Beth said, clapping.</p><p>Kim and I continued upstairs to our class. She wasn\u2019t nearly as animated as Beth.</p><p>\u201cRyan isn\u2019t going to be happy,\u201d she said.</p><p>I angled my neck to emphasize my irritation. \u201cI\u2019m not with Ryan, Kim. He doesn\u2019t get to be unhappy about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know...I just think its poor timing on your part for you to go on a date with Jared when Ryan\u2019s stil in the hospital for trying to save your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s wrong for me to go out with Jared because I\u2019m obligated to Ryan now, since he was hurt defending me? Is that what you\u2019re getting at?\u201d I countered, pausing in front of our classroom.</p><p>\u201cNo. I am definitely not saying that. That would be very Casablanca of me.\u201d</p><p>Kim smiled when I rol ed my eyes at her, and we walked to our seats together.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Truth(s)</p><p>Patience is a virtue I do not possess. Amusement park lines, doctor\u2019s appointments, col ege acceptance letters\u2014al enough to drive me insane.</p><p>Waiting for my date with Jared felt very much like torture. Each class failed miserably at holding my interest, and by mid-morning I had given up on taking notes. The final class of the day was insufferable. I bounced my knee up and down, tapped my pencil on the desk, shifted in my chair, and sighed at least a dozen times.</p> <p>Beth touched my arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt my anxiety attack. It\u2019s rude,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Beth pressed her lips together, trying not to laugh. \u201cStop freaking out. It\u2019s a date. You\u2019ve had dates before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with Jared.\u201d</p><p>She tapped her finger on my forearm for a moment and smiled. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we visit Ryan after class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re bril iant,\u201d I said, peeling off the last bit of my eraser.</p><p>By the time Professor Hunter had spoken the word \u2018dismissed\u2019, I had shoved the last of my things in my bag, with the fastest path to the Beamer already plotted out in my mind. Beth struggled to keep up, and growled with frustration when we reached the car.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d she puffed.</p><p>\u201cYou have no excuse. Your legs are longer than mine.\u201d</p><p>She rol ed her eyes as I put the Beamer into gear.</p><p>Ryan looked much better\u2014he had more color in his face and the network of tubes and wires that had covered him just days before had al but disappeared.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d he said, stretching his torso. \u201cThey\u2019re moving me to PCCU today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic!\u201d I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be out of here in no time. Do you know what room number you\u2019l be in?\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019l cal you and let you know, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better. How else are we going to sneak in the il egal contraband?\u201d Beth said.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which...did you happen to bring me another burger?\u201d</p><p>Beth shook her head. \u201cNina was in a hurry to get here.\u201d</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t enjoy her remark as much as I thought he would. \u201cThat\u2019s surprising. I figured you\u2019d be rushing to Andrews to get ready for your date.\u201d He tried to sound casual, but I heard resentment in his words.</p><p>I glanced at Beth and then back at him. My face instantly flushed with anger.</p><p>Ryan rol ed his eyes. \u201cCalm down, Nina. Josh saw you at the Ratty. It pissed him off seeing Jared there. He doesn\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that he\u2019s upset about it at al ,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Josh\u2019s fault. He just thinks I\u2019m better for you than that double-oh-seven wannabe. I happen to agree,\u201d Ryan said, squirming to sit higher in his bed.</p><p>\u201cThat double-oh-seven wannabe is the reason we\u2019re alive,\u201d I said through my teeth.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you guys. This can wait,\u201d Beth sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not real y going to go out with him, are you?\u201d Ryan said, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. And I real y don\u2019t care what you, or Josh, or any of your other buddies think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuddies?\u201d Ryan repeated, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWho says buddies, anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I seethed. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Beth. Visiting hours are over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Nigh. Don\u2019t leave mad,\u201d Ryan chuckled, raising his hand toward me.</p><p>\u201cI told you that you could only cal me that once. The time limit on that has been exceeded.\u201d \u201cNina, I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t leave. It\u2019s none of my business who you date. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s pretty obvious why I have a problem with it.\u201d He looked down at his hands with a frown.</p><p>I stared at him for a moment. It was hard to hold onto my anger when he was lying in a hospital bed. \u201cI hope they clear up whatever it is that has you acting like this before they release you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not that bad. You\u2019re coming back tomorrow, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wil ,\u201d I said, ruffling my fingers in his hair.</p><p>He swatted my hand away. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to hear about your date, al right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can find other things to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better go, Nigh. We have lots to do,\u201d Beth said in a sing-song voice.</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at Ryan before fol owing Beth to the car.</p><p>In search of the perfect outfit, Beth and I blew up my closet. Clothes were everywhere. Something too dark, too tight, too loose, too short, or not short enough covered every surface. I final y settled on a winter white three-quarter length sleeved sweater dress with my favorite fancy brown belt\u2014 it boasted a pearl in the center of the cross buckle\u2014and brown strappy heels. Beth assured me over and over that my curve-hugging dress was the perfect balance of sexy and elegant. I stared into our long mirror and worried my dress was too short; I was al legs.</p><p>I passed the time taking a long shower, being extra careful about shaving my legs, plucking my eyebrows, and painting my toenails.</p><p>After al of the indulging, I\u2019d stil managed to be ready twenty minutes before Jared was due to arrive. My heels clicked against the elevator floor as I stepped in, and I couldn\u2019t help but fuss with my hair and dress while I waited for the doors to open to the first floor. Walking down the hal , I checked my watch; I stil had fifteen minutes before he would arrive. Just as I peeked out, the door popped open. Jared stood in front of me in a solid black dress shirt and charcoal-grey slacks. His hair had the slightest bit of gel in it, easing the subtle messy waves into each other.</p><p>I sucked in a tiny gasp, throwing my hand up to my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I startle you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I wasn\u2019t expecting you, yet,\u201d I said, breathless.</p><p>Jared handed me a smal but beautiful bouquet of pink and white tulips\u2014my favorite\u2014and smiled sheepishly, \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait until six-thirty.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together to keep from uttering the embarrassing truth, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself. \u201cI couldn\u2019t either,\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>A triumphant smile broke across his face, and then he helped me with my coat. He gently pul ed me against his chest and whispered into my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou are stunning.\u201d</p><p>My ears burned. I wil ed the blush in my cheeks away, glad to be stepping out into the brisk air.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked as he pul ed away from the curb.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l see,\u201d he said, an excited grin spreading across his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad you agreed to come. After the other night, I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , after you ambushed me at the Ratty in front of everyone, I hardly had a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoercion was the plan al along,\u201d he said, chuckling. He reached over and lightly traced my fingers.</p><p>\u201cSo this place we\u2019re going to...should I expect more strange cuisine or are you playing it safe this evening?\u201d I casual y turned up my palm to intertwine our fingers. Normal y I wasn\u2019t so forward, but the rules had changed. We both knew that nothing about our time together was ever ordinary.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cI don\u2019t like surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I huffed. It was maddening that he knew me so wel . \u201cAm I going to learn anything about you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>Jared pul ed onto a narrow street and parked beside the curb in front of a darkened building. I wasn\u2019t sure what restaurant it was, but it didn\u2019t look open. He took my hand and led me down an al ey, guiding me around the water-fil ed potholes.</p><p>\u201cYour cut has healed nicely,\u201d I noticed, \u201cI can barely see it.\u201d</p><p>Jared simply nodded, leading me further into the darkness.</p><p>His hand left mine only to reach into his pocket for his keys. He unlocked the door, and then stretched his arm toward the inside to signal me to walk in.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going up the stairs,\u201d he said.</p><p>My heels clanged against the iron steps as I slowly climbed to a smal landing. At the top, Jared edged past me to use his keys once more. He stepped ahead of me this time, holding the door open.</p><p>I walked into a spacious bi-level apartment decorated in grays and blues. It was dimly lit and the blinds were drawn, setting off the glow of the numerous candles lit around the room. Chinese panels and manuscripts from different parts of the world hung on the grey cinderblock wal s, il uminated by track lighting. He didn\u2019t have enough furniture to fil the space\u2014or maybe it was simply clutter free\u2014everything was in its place. The entire room was immaculate. The air was saturated with different spices and flavors, and the smal round table displayed empty wine glasses and white plates.</p><p>\u201cThis is your apartment?\u201d I asked, looking up the wooden stairs leading to the loft.</p><p>Jared stood behind me, sliding my coat from my arms. \u201cIs that okay? I thought it would be the best place to talk,\u201d he asked, a bit anxious.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s amazing...you\u2019re cooking?\u201d I asked, preoccupied with my surroundings.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. Try not to get too excited.\u201d He tucked my hair behind my ears. \u201cHave a seat, it\u2019s almost ready.\u201d</p><p>He took the flowers from my hands and whisked them to the kitchen, fil ing a vase with water. He reappeared, vase and flowers in hand, placing them in the middle of the table.</p><p>Jared brought a serving dish to the table and forked out a slice of meat.</p><p>\u201cPot Roast?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWel , there are other things\u2014,\u201d he gestured back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s just that...pot roast is my favorite. My father had a close friend that always invited us to dinner when I was little, and his wife made this amazing pot roast. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had it, but it smel ed a lot like this.\u201d</p><p>Jared made a strange face as if he didn\u2019t know how to react to my little anecdote, and then returned to the kitchen. He brought out a bowl of steamed vegetables, a plate of dinner rol s, and a baked potato...al of them favorites of mine.</p><p>\u201cYou thought of everything,\u201d I said, bewildered at the food sitting on the table.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an Angel Food cake in the oven,\u201d he said, sitting across from me.</p><p>\u201cI love angel foo\u2014,\u201d I cut myself off when I realized how redundant it would be to say the words. \u201cYou knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jared said with an uncertain half smile. It sounded more like a question than an answer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk, right?\u201d I asked, staring down at my plate.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to talk. But let\u2019s get through dinner, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d I grinned.</p><p>I bit into the pot roast and instantly I was seven years old, sitting in a homey kitchen with a mil ion savory smel s floating throughout the room. Cynthia was politely chuckling at something Jack\u2019s friend Gabe had said, and Gabe\u2019s wife circled the table in a light blue apron, spooning out vegetables onto everyone\u2019s plate.</p><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Jared asked between bites, bringing me back to the present.</p><p>I shook my head, searching for the words that would do the taste I was experiencing justice. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a meal like this in a long, long time,\u201d I chewed, \u201csince I was a girl. Where did you learn to cook like this?\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s my mother\u2019s recipe.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at that. It was the first time he\u2019d ever mentioned anything about his life. \u201cAre you close with your mother?\u201d I asked, settling into my chair.</p><p>\u201cPretty close. I spent a lot of time away from her when I was young.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows with interest, waiting for him to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cSchool was very easy for Claire and me\u2014we finished at a young age\u2014and we went on to train in more special areas.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSpecial as in what you can do? Fight, I mean.\u201d Although I was prepared for an outlandish explanation, I was surprised that it began in his childhood.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jared confirmed. \u201cMy father taught us much of what we know; he took us al over the world to round out our training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of training?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared squirmed in his chair. My insides wrenched as I watched him struggle; I wanted to somehow make it easier for him. I reached across the table and slid my fingers between each of his.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why I\u2019m here, right?\u201d I said, offering a reassuring smile. Jared relaxed a bit and gently squeezed my fingers.</p><p>\u201cWe were trained to defend ourselves, to defend someone else, and received al the training each branch of military receives, including tactical, structure penetration, reconnaissance and patrol ing, hand to hand combat, demolitions, weapons, field medicine...you get the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said in a more incredulous tone than I\u2019d intended.</p><p>Jared took another bite, considering my question. I couldn\u2019t wait for him to decide the best answer.</p><p>\u201cYour father was in the security business?\u201d I prompted.</p> <p>\u201cMore along the lines of security detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBodyguard stuff,\u201d I nodded.</p><p>Jared chuckled. \u201cYes, bodyguard stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Claire went through the same training?\u201d I imagined tiny Claire training with the Navy Seals and shuddered. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because I feared for her safety, or because she was even more dangerous than I had previously thought.</p><p>\u201cWe were separated a lot. When she proved to be accelerated in most things we trained together.\u201d His face twisted with irritation.</p><p>\u201cAccelerated?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe could hit a target from fifteen-hundred yards by the time she was eleven. She\u2019s probably the best sniper the military has ever seen,\u201d he waited for my reaction. After seeing the deliberate smooth features of my face, he continued, \u201cYou can imagine how many elite branches of government and private sectors are fal ing over themselves for her, counting down the days until her eighteenth birthday.\u201d He said the words with a hint of the tone a protective father might have when discussing his daughter\u2019s first date.</p><p>\u201cAre you close?\u201d I asked, remembering the way they had reacted to each other in the pub.</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cI love her. She\u2019s my sister.\u201d The crease between his eyebrows grew deeper, \u201cShe\u2019s also very obstinate and, like most teenage girls, she\u2019s very self-absorbed. But in a lethal-type of way because of her training.\u201d He was suddenly very far away. \u201cClaire\u2019s been through a lot. She didn\u2019t get to have a normal childhood because of the way we were raised, and she\u2019s angry about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you angry about the way you were raised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said the word softly, but with firm conviction. There was no pause between my question and his answer. He scanned my face with such affection that I felt myself fidgeting with unease.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d I bit my lip, stil apprehensive about the intensity in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l get to that later. Dessert?\u201d he asked, squeezing my hand before letting go.</p><p>I noticed the absence of his touch instantly when my hand turned cold. He took my nearly empty plate and returned with the perfect-sized slice of Angel Food cake. No icing, no layers. Just the way I liked it.</p> <p>Taking a bite, I closed my eyes. \u201cYou have more than one talent, Mr. Ryel,\u201d I said after swal owing the moist, spongy goodness. \u201cTel me more about you. I want to hear the little things, too. You know al of my favorites; it\u2019s only fair that I know yours.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once. \u201cOkay.\u201d He wiped his mouth with his napkin and leaned against his chair. \u201cThe little things....I was born in Providence on May ninth. I\u2019m twenty-three,\u201d he explained. \u201cBreakfast is my favorite meal. Summer is my favorite season. I don\u2019t have a favorite color, but I\u2019ve always been partial to that crazy green-honey brown color of your eyes. I have this addiction to sweet potato fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel . There you go...I knew something about you after al ,\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cSee? I\u2019m an open book.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes. \u201cGo on....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think best when on my motorcycle; I don\u2019t real y have time for hobbies. I have a sister, whom you\u2019ve met,\u201d I nodded, \u201cand a little brother, Bex, who\u2019s eleven. They both live with my mother, but Claire spends a lot of time here...sometimes too much,\u201d he grimaced.</p><p>I giggled. \u201cAnd you have your own security business?\u201d</p><p>As soon as I asked, I wished I hadn\u2019t. Jared\u2019s eyes instantly clouded over into familiar twin storms.</p><p>\u201cI brought you here tonight to be honest with you, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, trying to sound braver than I felt. Whatever it was I would listen, believe, and figure out a way to live with it. I had no other option versus the alternative. Now that I\u2019d met him my life would never be the same again. It would be something too peculiar for anyone else to accept, but I had seen enough in the past months to know anything was possible. \u201cI want you to tel me everything.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked away. \u201cYou may feel differently before the night is over.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head to draw his eyes to mine. \u201cAfter everything that\u2019s happened, you don\u2019t think I know there is something abnormal going on? I\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned over and touched my cheek with the palm of his hand. I couldn\u2019t help but lean into it, his skin was always so warm that it radiated into my bones.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. The truth.\u201d He took a deep breath, \u201cMy father has been...close to your father for a long time.\u201d He watched my expression, but that part I was somewhat prepared for. He continued, \u201cMy father served as protection for your father and, as you can imagine, Jack was a ful time job. He made a lot of the wrong people very angry on a regular basis.\u201d</p><p>I winced. I had come to this conclusion after reading the Port of Providence file, but hearing it from Jared rubbed salt in the wound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nina. I don\u2019t like tel ing you this; it goes against the very principle I was raised on.\u201d Jared reached his hand across the table to mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my family does, Nina. We protect your father. And your mother...and you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Your family protects mine? Since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father has known Jack since before you were born...before he married your mother.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyebrows pul in. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we met before?\u201d</p><p>Jared squeezed my hand. \u201cWe have. One of my earliest memories is of Jack encouraging you to take your first steps. We went on family vacations with you; I watched you blow out the candles on your birthday cakes; I saw you drive your first car; we were always in the background.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhen we had lunch I asked you if we\u2019d met. You said we hadn\u2019t.\u201d Frustration made my words sharper than I had intended.</p><p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t met in the way you were inquiring,\u201d Jared pointed out. \u201cThe moment I sat beside you on that bench I\u2019ve been very careful not to lie to you, Nina. I promised myself that if the day ever came that I could final y be in your life\u2014in a real way\u2014I would always be honest with you.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cYour father protected mine?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded.</p><p>\u201cWho is your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe Ryel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe is your father? But...I don\u2019t remember you. I spent time in his home. You weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire and I were away. We had to start our training early to be ready in time. Bex is eleven and he\u2019s already finished school. He\u2019s been in training for the last eighteen months. It\u2019s just the way it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way what works?\u201d</p><p>Jared winced at my irritated tone. He was struggling with each piece of information, now. He spoke as if he expected me to run away with every new fact he revealed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that,\u201d he shifted nervously.</p><p>I pul ed my hand from his and lowered it to my lap. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of that.\u201d</p><p>Jared watched me pul away from him with a pained expression. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to. Your father did everything he could to keep you from the dark parts of his life. He did love you, Nina.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, trying to keep the tears at bay. I couldn\u2019t think of any words. Jared stared at me for a moment and spoke again, \u201cAre you sure you want to hear this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure.\u201d Knowing something real, even if it was hurtful, was far better than living a lie.</p><p>Jared sucked in another breath. \u201cAbout the time I was ready to work alone, you were becoming more independent. It was thirteen months before there was a need for my training. Up until then, I\u2019d pretty much felt like a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>I cringed at his choice of words.</p><p>\u201cFive days before your sixteenth birthday Jack had begun a deal with the cops you saw in the surveil ance photos. My father told Jack it was a bad idea, but the bottom line was always the money, and those men\u2014,\u201d Jared spoke with disdain, \u201c\u2014were the easiest way to bypass the system.</p><p>\u201cOnce Jack realized that dirty cops are a different breed of criminal with even less regard for the law, it was too late. Jack was used to being targeted, but he wasn\u2019t prepared for them to go after you. No one had ever been stupid enough to push Jack that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter me? We\u2019re talking three years ago, and I had no idea? How is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m good at my job, Nina. I had to be.\u201d Jared tensed as he continued, \u201cI\u2019d hoped your father would be honest with you\u2014although at the time I wasn\u2019t sure why\u2014but it only made Jack even more determined to keep you from the truth. He didn\u2019t want you to live in fear, and I couldn\u2019t argue with that logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s hands locked together on top of the table. \u201cThe first time you were targeted, I took a bul et to the shoulder. The training made it automatic for me to stop that bul et, Nina; but in that one instant, my eyes were opened. The moment I saw Tipton\u2019s finger press against the trigger I wasn\u2019t protecting you because I had to. For the first time, I realized that I could lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were almost kil ed?\u201d I gasped. I imagined him bleeding from a bul et wound while I went on with my life, oblivious. My heart faltered.</p><p>Jared crossed his arms on the table and smiled. \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo these feelings you have for me...you had them before I ever knew you existed,\u201d I said, more of a statement than a question.</p><p>Jared grimaced, incensed at my choice of words.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he shook his head. I had obviously offended him somehow. \u201cI was in love with you before you ever knew I existed. It was very difficult to be around you for hours on end and not be able to comfort you, or touch you...even speak to you. I wasn\u2019t al owed to let you see me, but it was my job to watch your every move. That included standing by while people lied to you, betrayed you, caused you pain.</p><p>\u201cJack reminded me constantly that it had to be that way. He could see that every day it grew harder for me to be non-existent...to be invisible to the woman I loved.\u201d His eyes were unfocused, mul ing over the memories that troubled him.</p><p>Jared had now said it twice: He was in love with me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the rage I felt seeing some sleaze that didn\u2019t appreciate you take you to dinner, take you for granted, kiss you...make you cry. It was my duty to protect you and I wasn\u2019t al owed to protect you from that; although, I would have gladly murdered Howard without a second thought the night of your sixteenth birthday.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline rushed through my veins, and my mind burned through the memories of that night. Stacy Howard was my first and only boyfriend. He personified the stereotypical supercilious rich boy, complete with rebel ious nature and bad attitude. The longer I put-off a physical relationship with him, the more acerbic he became. It didn\u2019t take long for me to grow tired of him, but just when I\u2019d decided to end things, Cynthia insisted on it first.</p><p>Playing the part of the stubborn fifteen year-old daughter to perfection, I grudgingly stayed with him just long enough to show my mother that I would make my own choices.</p><p>We had been together for just over a year when he\u2019d chosen my party to break it to me that he was in love with Emma Noble, my then-best friend.</p><p>His plans were unnecessary when I caught them having sex in the pool house before he had a chance to tel me. I was so relieved I barely noticed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re referring to Stacy,\u201d my eyes narrowed.</p><p>Jared nodded with an angry expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou knew about that?\u201d I wailed.</p><p>Jared shook his head and closed his eyes. \u201cFrom the moment it began. It was hel watching him go back and forth, not being able to tel you... or kil him. He was just a kid, and I wanted to end his life...so many times,\u201d he whispered in a low, intimidating tone.</p><p>I buried my face in my hands. Fire exploded across my face and ears. It was worse than anything I could have possibly imagined. Jared hadn\u2019t just been hired to protect me since my father had passed away; he\u2019d observed my awkward tween years, my humiliations, and every one of my embarrassing failures.</p><p>The degradation was unbearable. I sprang from my seat and headed for the door, but before my first step, I heard Jared\u2019s chair grate against the floor. In the next moment he gently grabbed me from behind, wrapping his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI know this is humiliating for you,\u201d he spoke quietly in my ear. \u201cI wanted to tel you, I begged Jack to let me expose that cheating little maggot so many times, but he wouldn\u2019t let us interfere unless it was absolutely necessary. Doing that to you on your birthday,\u201d he said, fuming, \u201cit was the breaking point for me. That night was the first time I\u2019d fought Jack on anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I flipped around and pushed away from him. \u201cI\u2019m not humiliated about Stacy! That was years ago! I\u2019m humiliated because of this!\u201d I said, gesturing to the space between us. \u201cWhen you meet someone new, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be! New! You know al of my bad habits...you\u2019ve seen me do God knows what. You\u2019re only supposed to know the best parts about me in the beginning!\u201d</p><p>He stood there for a moment, shaking his head with an expression of confusion and awe. \u201cI love everything about you.\u201d</p><p>It was at that moment that I realized why his eyes seemed so familiar to me. \u201cYou were there,\u201d I whispered, scanning his face.</p><p>Beyond the cocktail dresses, the twinkling lights draped from every tree and light post, and the smel of the freshly cut grass and imported flowers my mother insisted on, his eyes flickered in my memory. I pressed deeper, feeling the light sheen of perspiration on my skin from the exceptional y warm night, the smel of the chlorine from the pool, and the sounds of the crowd humming in happy, flowing conversation.</p> <p>When I glanced across the lawn at my father, I caught the glowing blue eyes of a stranger standing by the koi pond. His tailored suit and absent tie set him apart from the sea of tuxedos. Our eyes connected for only a second before he reluctantly pul ed them away to face my father, who was having a low, serious conversation with him.</p><p>My memory replayed in slow motion as the chiffon of my short, white dress waved gently against my legs. Once again his stormy blue eyes singled me out of the crowd, and I shied away from his stare.</p><p>I snapped back to the present when Jared cal ed my name.</p><p>\u201cYou were speaking to my father by the pond. That was you,\u201d I said, my eyes wide with realization.</p><p>Jared\u2019s brows pul ed in. \u201cYou remember that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was just before I\u2019d gone to the pool house. Jack was by the pond, talking with that face he made when he was giving orders.\u201d I tried to recal every detail I could. \u201cYou were throwing rocks in the pond; I only saw you for a moment, but that was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded slowly. \u201cI wanted to throw Stacy out, take him somewhere and...I don\u2019t know. Punish him, I guess. Jack refused, but he realized how I felt about you, then. He insisted that my family, including me, be kept a secret from you indefinitely. That was a rough night,\u201d he sighed, rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d I whispered, not knowing what else to say. My heart ached for al the years he\u2019d spent as a ghost.</p><p>Jared took my hand in his and pul ed it to his chest. It was then that I realized I\u2019d been absently twisting my Peridot ring around my finger.</p><p>\u201cI picked up this ring, you know,\u201d he said, softly pressing his lips against my fingers. \u201cCynthia was up to her neck in party details and she\u2019d forgotten to get it,\u201d he smiled. \u201cAnd because you were in my father\u2019s presence, I was sent to pick it up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. They used you as a gopher.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI volunteered. I wanted to,\u201d he explained. \u201cI can\u2019t describe the way it made me feel to see your smile when you opened the box. You were so pleased with it, and I had a part in that,\u201d he said. His smile faded. \u201cLater, it helped a little with the...misery of never being able to console you when I\u2019d see you twist this ring around your finger. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it has always been comforting to see you reach for it when you\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, bewildered. I wasn\u2019t sure how to feel; even with the suspicions I\u2019d already had, I couldn\u2019t have prepared myself for what he was tel ing me.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave,\u201d Jared whispered, stil holding my hand to his chest.</p><p>I looked down at my feet and then reached down to unbuckle the straps of my shoes from around my ankles. \u201cYou\u2019d just fol ow me if I left, right?\u201d I said, kicking off my shoes.</p><p>\u201cEven if it weren\u2019t my job,\u201d he said with an impish grin. He looked down at my bare feet. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re staying, we stil have quite a bit to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded and led me to his smal , grey couch.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should save the rest for another night. It\u2019s a lot to take in,\u201d he sighed.</p> <p>I ignored him. \u201cWhy did you sit beside me on that bench the night of Jack\u2019s funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were crying. Jack was gone. I couldn\u2019t think of any more reasons to stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father? Didn\u2019t Gabe care that you were breaking the rules?\u201d</p><p>Jared looked to the floor. \u201cHe died the morning of your father\u2019s funeral.\u201d He spoke as if exhaustion had just set in.</p><p>I gasped. \u201cGabe is...?\u201d I couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>Jared had comforted me just hours after his own father\u2019s death. I gently pul ed his chin to face me. His eyes were thick with grief, as if he was experiencing it for the first time.</p><p>It dawned on me how it must have felt to Jared, to see me suffering, and the deep need he struggled with to make it go away. I felt the same urgency that very moment. My eyes focused on the thin line between his lips, and I moved a bit closer to him.</p><p>Jared rested his soft hands on each side of my face. He leaned in slowly, inches from my mouth. His jaw tensed; he seemed to be struggling with what he had been told was the right thing to do and what he wanted.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t why I brought you here,\u201d he said, pul ing away from me.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>Jared stared at the floor, working to even out his breathing.</p><p>I touched his arm. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. Maybe we\u2019ve had enough truth for one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d he asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I paused to regain my composure. \u201cNo. I just meant that maybe we could talk about something else...if you want,\u201d I fidgeted. \u201cYour training, what schools you went to, friends...girls,\u201d I said, a corner of my mouth turning up.</p><p>\u201cGirls?\u201d he repeated, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou know about my utter failure when choosing a boyfriend, and I\u2019m sure you saw the awkward dates I\u2019ve been on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose were never a good day at work for me,\u201d he said, furrowing his brow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only fair,\u201d I reasoned. \u201cYou must have had at least one bad date....\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head dismissively. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to date.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what expression was on my face, but it made Jared\u2019s eyes squint with chagrin. He clearly didn\u2019t expect to talk about his love life, or lack thereof.</p><p>\u201cI was focused on keeping you alive. Making mistakes in my family means more than having to say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>Jared shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I never had the opportunity, or that I wasn\u2019t al owed the time...or even incessantly encouraged,\u201d\u2014his face twisted into a disgusted scowl\u2014\u201cI just had my priorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I feel guilty or flattered?\u201d</p><p>Jared looked straight into my eyes. \u201cBy the time it occurred to me to care about things like that, I already knew you were al I\u2019d ever want.\u201d</p><p>I control ed my eyes from bulging from their sockets, but I couldn\u2019t stop my mouth from turning up into a half surprised, half appreciative grin. My eyes focused on his lips again.</p><p>\u201cSo...why did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou said al I had to do was tel you the truth. That was al I needed to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I say that?\u201d I felt my eyebrows pul in as my mind rewound the night\u2019s conversation.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cTo Beth...last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my room? How did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed and sat tal er in his seat, bracing for round two. \u201cJust hear me out before you leave,\u201d he said in a low tone. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to protect you. I can\u2019t do that without knowing where you are at al times. I couldn\u2019t walk around freely in your dorm, so we had to have eyes and ears in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean eyes and ears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father was meticulous.\u201d He was stal ing.</p><p>\u201cSpit it out, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were accepted into Brown, Jack had cameras instal ed in Andrews and different places on campus. We tracked the GPS in your car of course, but that had been in place the day Jack bought it. We tracked the GPS in your cel phone as wel , and your parents\u2019 house has always been wired.\u201d Jared spoke casual y, but he was braced for another outburst.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a camera... in my room?\u201d I spoke slowly, the anger and shock nearly choking my words.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, no, no...,\u201d Jared chuckled nervously. \u201cThere\u2019s a camera in the hal . We only placed a mic in your room.\u201d</p><p>I considered that for a moment, trying to recal if I\u2019d ever done anything embarrassing. Nothing came to mind\u2014I hoped that nothing would.</p><p>Jared squirmed. \u201cJust to be clear, I don\u2019t enjoy invading your privacy in that way, but it is necessary.\u201d I pouted as a smile spread across his face.</p><p>\u201cWel , that\u2019s not true. I enjoyed it last night.\u201d</p><p>I tensed, closing my eyes. \u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s warm hand touched mine. \u201cI heard Beth say that you loved me. And I didn\u2019t hear you deny it.\u201d</p><p>My eyes popped open. \u201cYou heard wrong, then. I did deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you try to convince her otherwise. Are you tel ing me that I\u2019m mistaken?\u201d</p><p>I pul ed my hand from his in defiance. I didn\u2019t like being ambushed.</p><p>He smiled at my stubbornness. \u201cThe second you walked away from me, my choice was clear.\u201d His expression didn\u2019t last long when I didn\u2019t return his smile. \u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no secrets,\u201d I sulked. \u201cDoes my mother know about this?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. I threw up my hands in frustration, letting them smack loudly into my lap. He kneeled in front of me on the floor, forcing me to look at him.</p><p>\u201cIt was necessary, Nina,\u201d he said, lightly touching my bare knees.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how you always miraculously appear?\u201d I was aware that he knew my whereabouts, but I had no idea I was being spied on twenty-four- seven.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of it,\u201d he said with the evasive tone I was bitterly becoming accustomed to.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other part is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d I howled.</p><p>\u201cFirst, since you now know the worst part of it\u2014,\" I rol ed my eyes, \u201c\u2014I owe you an apology,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Mr. Dawson. Claire was on watch both of those nights, and she made the decision to let it get farther than I would have for intel purposes. She wanted to know what Mr. Dawson knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire watches me, too?\u201d I shrieked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry you were scared. I relieved Claire the second I heard the news, which is when I came to take you home.\u201d</p><p>Initial y I was furious, but the anger disappeared when I remembered feeling desperate for Jared to intervene. How could I be angry with him for wanting the same thing that I did?</p><p>\u201cI thought you would come,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d he said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhen Mr. Dawson threatened me, I expected you to show up at any moment. It made the whole thing...tolerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTolerable?\u201d</p><p>And then he was angry. He didn\u2019t speak for several minutes. His jaw flitted under his skin, and he occasional y shook his head. I waited for as long as I could, but I final y prompted him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, searching his stormy eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe first time that you expected me to protect you...I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d He spoke the last three words as if they were poison in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be there every second, Jared. You\u2019re only human.\u201d I returned my hands to his. He brought my hand to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, his face twisting in torment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said, surprised. I didn\u2019t expect his reaction.</p><p>His earlier description of the suffering he had experienced while witnessing my pain materialized. His time with me must have seemed like purgatory. I felt an overpowering urge to comfort him, and I was just inches away.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d he promised. His eyes were fixed on mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding you to that.\u201d A match had been lit inside me; I was burning from the sudden need to touch him, to al eviate the self-loathing in his eyes.</p><p>I leaned forward and rested my fingers against each side of his neck. My thumbs grazed his jaw line, the fear of rejection a faint memory. Pul ing him closer, I pressed my lips against his. He cautiously returned my kiss, but when he began to pul away I refused to let go.</p><p>After a brief, surprised pause, Jared gave into my insistence, wrapping his arms around me and pressing me against him. A quiet hum of satisfaction escaped my lips, and his mouth grew more urgent against mine. He sat up on his knees to tighten his grip, and his hand clutched the back of my neck. My breath became ragged as his lips parted and his outstandingly warm tongue found its way to mine. My knees parted and I pul ed him against me, eliminating the tiny space between us.</p><p>He groaned in frustration and then his grip tightened, holding me a few inches away by my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I puffed.</p><p>He took a few deep breaths before answering, staring at my lips. \u201cWe stil have a lot to discuss,\u201d he breathed, letting go of my shoulders to press my knees together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done talking,\u201d I whispered, leaning in again.</p><p>Jared gently restrained me, amused at my fortitude. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, taking a deep breath. \u201cI brought you here to tel you the whole truth, not just half of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sighed in resignation, sinking back into the couch cushion.</p><p>He smiled at my pouting. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not incredibly tempted.\u201d He sat up on his knees again, and brushed his lips against mine, pul ing away as quickly as he began.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s talk,\u201d I said, more eager than ever to have everything out in the open. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been honest with me.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tel me that you haven\u2019t had time for girls, now. Not when you kiss like that.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression was ecstatic, and then he made a poor attempt to disguise it. \u201cI beg to differ. I\u2019m not an idiot...it\u2019s not a difficult concept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have kissed boys, some of those boys more than once, that never kissed like that.\u201d</p><p>Jared closed in and kissed my neck\u2014from col ar bone to the line of my jaw\u2014stopping to whisper in my ear. \u201cThat\u2019s because you kissed boys, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounded so loudly that I was sure he could hear it. I let out a long sigh. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got to tel me the rest. The suspense is kil ing me.\u201d</p> <p>Jared shifted to the couch, turning to face me. His face returned to the worried frown he had before.</p><p>\u201cJared, thus far it\u2019s my understanding that you\u2019ve been raised by a family of assassins. You\u2019ve spied on me, stalked me, instal ed microphones in my bedroom, and confessed to fal ing in love with me before I could drive. If I haven\u2019t left by now, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to.\u201d</p><p>His face screwed into disgust. \u201cWe\u2019re not assassins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever kil ed anyone?\" Jared raised his eyebrows, shocked at my pointed question.</p><p>\u201cI...er...yeah. But it was to keep you safe,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cYou kil ed people for me?\u201d I asked, my mood immediately shifting.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel a second of guilt for those people, Nina. They wouldn\u2019t have lost a single night\u2019s sleep over taking your life.\u201d</p><p>I swal owed. \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNever. It\u2019s who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? You\u2019re a kil er?\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed the back of his neck nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t think of it that way. We\u2019re protectors. Though there are those that disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d I shook my head, thoroughly confused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting ahead of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting ahead of yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He rubbed his temples with his thumb and forefinger and sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d I laughed without humor. He looked up at me; the hardness of his eyes didn\u2019t relieve my trepidation. \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...implausible. It wil be your first inclination to be skeptical, and I don\u2019t blame you. But it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and then took his hand in mine. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe,\u201d Jared paused for a long time and then cringed, \u201cisn\u2019t from here. He\u2019s known your father since Jack was an infant, but it wasn\u2019t until Jack was a bit older that they met.</p><p>\u201cWhen Jack was twenty-one, he worked for a man named Van Buren. While working there, he befriended Van Buren\u2019s oldest son, Luke, and because Jack spent so much time with Luke, my father in turn spent quite a bit of time in Luke\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for Luke\u2019s younger sister, Lil ian, to catch Gabe\u2019s attention. Lil ian is my mother. Similar to the way I feel about you, he couldn\u2019t stay away from her. Eventual y he made the choice to reveal himself to her, which is against the rules.\u201d</p><p>I started to ask about the rules, but Jared held a finger up so that I would let him continue, \u201cGabe made a huge sacrifice to be with Lil ian. He loved her, and so as far as he was concerned, he had no choice. Even though he had given up everything, his existence stil depended on Jack.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhy did it depend on my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe was assigned to him. For my father, and those like him, he is assigned to someone\u2014his Taleh\u2014from their birth. Because I\u2019m half of what my father was, the draw isn\u2019t right away. We have to figure it out on our own, and that\u2019s part of why my siblings and I are the bastards of Gabe\u2019s world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe\u2019s world? I\u2019m sorry, Jared, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d I shook my head in frustration.</p><p>Jared\u2019s hardened expression smoothed into a warm smile. \u201cI know. You wil . I\u2019m trying to explain this in the best way possible. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet potato fries?\u201d I smiled, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>Jared\u2019s grin widened. \u201cSweet potato fries.\u201d</p><p>He watched me for a moment, and several emotions scrol ed across his face. His hands touched my cheeks and then he pressed his lips against mine. It felt like he was saying goodbye.</p><p>He reluctantly let me go, and avoided my eyes when he spoke. \u201cWe aren\u2019t accepted by Gabe\u2019s family or his enemies. It makes it very difficult to do our job in some ways, and easier in others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean as protectors,\u201d I determined. Jared confirmed my revelation with an approving nod, but my expression caused his smal smile to vanish.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he spoke in a soft, hesitant tone.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying there is a society of protectors out there that al do...what you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-Sort of. But it\u2019s...providential.\u201d He waited anxiously for my mind to catch up to what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cProvidential?\u201d I repeated, letting the word simmer...providential protectors. He chose his words careful y, specifical y attaching divinity to describe the family he referred to. When the comprehension hit, Jared winced. \u201cAre you talking angels, Jared?\u201d I said, indignant.</p><p>\u201cI told you it would be your first inclination.\u201d</p><p>I waited for him to tel me he was joking, but his eyes were far from amused. I stood up and paced between the table and the couch.</p><p>He was serious.</p><p>He expects me to believe he is a...he\u2019s my....guardian angel! I thought. My mind mul ed over wings, halos, and harps, and I laughed out loud. Jared watched me pace as if he were afraid he\u2019d sent me over the edge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an angel,\u201d he said as if I was total y off-base. \u201cMy father is. Was,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re half....\u201d I trailed off, unable to mouth the word. I felt ridiculous for even considering it.</p><p>\u201cHuman,\u201d he amended, intercepting the alternative.</p><p>My thoughts traced to Jared\u2019s lobbing the man the impossible distance across the parking lot. \u201cThat does explain some things. But....\u201d I shook my head. I wanted to believe him and that made remaining objective more difficult.</p><p>Jared walked toward me, but I instinctively took a step back.</p><p>He cringed at my reaction. \u201cI would never lie to you. Do you believe that?\u201d</p><p>Just a few moments before I was determined to believe anything he had to say. But Jared was asking me to believe in fairytales, in the supernatural. His anxious eyes searched my face, begging for me to believe. I was worth his truth and I stood cruel y obstinate. The need to ease his anxiety overwhelmed reason.</p><p>I touched his fading scar with my fingers. \u201cIt makes sense, real y.\u201d</p><p>I had described him as angelic once, when I hadn\u2019t realized it was closer to the truth than I could have ever imagined. His glowing blue-grey eyes, his strength, the flawlessness of his face and the way he moved; it would be the only explanation. It suddenly didn\u2019t matter if it were possible. I believed him.</p><p>\u201cI stil have questions,\u201d I said.</p><p>Hope touched Jared\u2019s eyes, and he led me to the table. I took a bite of my half-eaten slice of cake and giggled.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s funny?\u201d he raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAngel Food.\u201d I pressed my lips together, stifling a laugh.</p><p>Jared chuckled and sucked in a big breath, seeming relieved.</p><p>\u201cAngel Food. Good one.\u201d He attempted an annoyed expression, but the relief on his face thwarted his efforts.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven,\u201d he said immediately. \u201cSo. Now you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d A fresh energy seemed to surround him. \u201cThere is more, but it\u2019s the logistics of what I\u2019ve told you, and part of that...wel , it\u2019s best that you don\u2019t know about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the stories, Nina. Where there\u2019s light, there\u2019s dark. If I go into detail and you become aware, it attracts them. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>My body suddenly felt cold, causing my shoulders to curve in and shudder. I knew exactly what he was talking about: demons. Of course they would exist if angels did.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes sympathized with my reaction, and he pul ed my chair closer to him, leaning over to kiss my forehead. \u201cI suppose I didn\u2019t think through the consequences of promising absolute truth. I don\u2019t want you to be afraid, Nina. I would never let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and put on a brave face for him. \u201cI know,\u201d I shook my head, \u201cthere is so much that I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more questions?\u201d he asked, ready for the next barrage of inquiries.</p><p>I looked at my watch. It was almost midnight. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can get them al in tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have somewhere to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I assumed you wanted to sleep sometime. You do sleep, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cI do. But I don\u2019t require as much...just a few hours to recharge. Claire and I take shifts.\u201d He sighed and touched my arm. \u201cI owe you another apology. I hadn\u2019t slept long\u2014about twenty minutes when Claire cal ed to inform me that you wandered out of town and were stranded on a dark road. She was prepared to let you wait, but I couldn\u2019t just let you sit in the cold. I\u2019m sorry I was so...abrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCranky when tired...check,\u201d I nodded once.</p><p>Relief brightened Jared\u2019s face. \u201cThis is surreal. I\u2019ve dreamed about how I would tel you for years, and now it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I sit, in front of my half-angel Hybrid boyfriend eating cake. I think I win.\u201d</p><p>Three lines appeared on Jared\u2019s forehead when his eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh. It\u2019s boyfriend, now, is it?\u201d</p><p>I swal owed hard, feeling the heat radiate from my face. I picked up my wine glass and took a large gulp.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jared asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just...I didn\u2019t mean...ugh!\u201d I moaned, covering my eyes with one hand.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he chided, \u201cas if I\u2019m not thril ed beyond words at that idea.\u201d Jared pul ed my hand from my face. \u201cWhat could you possibly have to be embarrassed about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...forget I said anything, okay?\u201d I said sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>I involuntarily yawned, using the back of my fingers to cover my open mouth.</p><p>\u201cI should take you home,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home. I stil have questions,\u201d I argued, wiping the inevitable tears that fol owed.</p><p>\u201cWe have a long, long time for Q and A, sweetheart,\u201d he said, tucking my hair behind my ear. I smiled, realizing why he always seemed to pul my hair from my face the moment it crossed my mind.</p><p>I yawned again, but stubbornly shook my head. \u201cThe cut on your face?\u201d</p><p>Jared touched it with two of his fingers. \u201cThere are pro\u2019s and con\u2019s to being what my father\u2019s world cal s Half-breeds.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose at the word. \u201cSounds derogatory to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Most Archs don\u2019t believe we should exist, and the...Others see us as the enemy as wel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cArchs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are several types of angels: Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones...there are nine in al . Archangels serve as protectors for humans. They relay messages, fight demons on occasion, and protect their Taleh against harm, from demon and human alike. But al humans have Archs, and even if their Taleh is threatened by another Arch\u2019s Taleh, Arch\u2019s are forbidden to harm humans. They are strictly protectors, but that protection has limits because of the Laws. Claire, Bex and I are half-human, freeing us from many of those restrictions, just like my father when he chose to live as human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...Gabe...turned human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He relinquished the ability to transfer planes....\u201d My expression must have reflected how foreign the words sounded to me, because he stopped to explain. \u201cTo be invisible. Fal ing from grace has a price. Archs are cursed when they choose to stay, and that curse carries on to their offspring; although, it lessens with each generation. As the blood is diluted with the human gene pool, so is the curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of curse?\u201d I asked. His world was much darker than wings and harps.</p><p>\u201cArchs are obligated to protect their humans even after they fal , and because their priorities have been compromised, so to speak, the curse keeps that obligation in check. Fal en and their offspring, like Archs, don\u2019t get sick and we can\u2019t be kil ed. But unlike Archs, we experience a degree of pain and have a limited life span. Once our Taleh die, we almost immediately fal il and expire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you lost your father when I lost mine,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared nodded infinitesimal y and wiped a tear from my eye.</p><p>I leaned away from his hand. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t comfort me for your father\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t stand to see you cry. Not when I\u2019m close enough to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jared.\u201d I couldn\u2019t imagine having to experience the constant worry of not only my father\u2019s mortality, but someone else\u2019s as wel , for the sake of my father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes widened as my thoughts shifted. \u201cI\u2019m you\u2019re Taleh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d He sat up a bit tal er as his sad expression warmed at the thought.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling we get. When you\u2019re in pain, embarrassed, scared, sick, happy...aroused\u2014,\u201d he looked down for a moment, seeming embarrassed \u2014\u201c...we feel it to a lesser extent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can feel it when I feel those things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. I guess I could liken it to a mosquito buzzing in your ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if I...bump my side on my father\u2019s desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sense it,\u201d he confirmed, amused that I had caught on.</p><p>\u201cWas that you on the phone with my mother?\u201d I raised an eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cYes. I just wanted to make sure you were al right. You hit pretty hard. I\u2019d be surprised if you didn\u2019t bruise,\u201d he said, lightly touching the exact spot where I had col ided with Jack\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cI did bruise. I thought you said my parents\u2019 house has cameras. Couldn\u2019t you see that I was okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s office is the only room in the house that isn\u2019t wired. When you\u2019re in there I have to rely on my senses. I\u2019d prefer it if you wouldn\u2019t spend so much time there in the future.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, preoccupied with an errant thought that had popped into my head. \u201cSo...if I\u2019m cramping....\u201d</p><p>Jared closed his eyes and nodded. He clearly didn\u2019t want to dwel on the subject.</p><p>I giggled in disbelief. \u201cThat hurts you?\u201d</p> <p>Jared chuckled and rol ed his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t get cramps, Nina, no. I\u2019m aware of it.\u201d</p><p>His answer caused my giggles to erupt in laughter. I was definitely feeling the effects of fatigue.</p><p>I tried to remember where we left off before my short bout of hysteria. \u201cWhen did you know I was yours?\u201d I asked. Jared\u2019s eyebrows lifted and I corrected myself. \u201cWhen did you know that I was your Taleh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded in understanding, but a grin lingered on his lips. \u201cArchs are assigned to their humans, but Half-breeds\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHybrids,\u201d I interrupted. I didn\u2019t like him using a derogatory term to refer to himself.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHybrids have to figure it out on their own. Another reason Archs resent us\u2014it leaves our humans vulnerable for a time. They don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of cons,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cThere are pros,\u201d he assured me. \u201cWe have few advantages over the Archs, the most important being that because we\u2019re half-human, we can kil other humans to protect our Talehs if necessary. We can see them, even if they remain hidden to humans. We also retain a fraction of their pronounced strength, focus, intel igence, and accelerated healing. Archs are indestructible and they don\u2019t bleed; bul ets don\u2019t bounce off of them, they simply pass through them.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced at his fading scar. \u201cBut you bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we heal quickly. Very quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the wings thing....\u201d I yawned as exhaustion set in.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me sprouting feathers, Nina,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cArchs don\u2019t fly. They simply appear where they wish to go. I\u2019ve always found the pictures a bit sil y, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like those pictures,\u201d I argued.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disappointed, then?\u201d The corner of his mouth pul ed up as he rested his hand on the back of my chair, leaning towards me.</p><p>\u201cNot real y. I\u2019d rather be sitting across from my angel without wings than looking at a picture of an angel with them.\u201d I could feel his breath on my lips, and I leaned closer to him.</p><p>Jared fel against his chair. \u201cI knew this conversation was going to be difficult, but it\u2019s become difficult for a completely different reason,\u201d he sighed, running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d I asked, surprised at his sudden retreat.</p><p>He glanced up at me with a smirk. \u201cI thought I\u2019d have to stop you from running out into the street in a panic, instead I have to concentrate on finishing everything I want to say before you get me too flustered to speak at al .\u201d</p><p>The blood pooled under my cheeks, and Jared touched my face lightly with his thumb, tracing to my lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice surprise,\u201d he said, letting his thumb slide from my chin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l try to restrain myself,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave that up to me?\u201d</p><p>I raised a dubious eyebrow at him and he chuckled. His demeanor had improved one hundred percent since the beginning of our conversation, and I couldn\u2019t help but grin.</p><p>He outlined my fingers with his and I yawned, relaxing with his warm touch.</p><p>He gave me a disapproving look. \u201cNina....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stil have questions,\u201d I said. \u201cYou said you don\u2019t get sick. Ever?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head with an amused smile, he was enjoying my interview.</p><p>\u201cBut the rest, about dying after your Taleh, do you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cBut that\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina, don\u2019t forget...I ful y intend on growing old with you.\u201d He enveloped me in his arms then, pul ing me into his lap. \u201cI literal y can\u2019t live without you.</p><p>But I wouldn\u2019t want to, even if I could.\u201d</p><p>I struggled for words to reply with, but they never came. Jared\u2019s expression tensed as though he might have said too much, and the need to relieve his quandary had me searching for new questions.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very convenient, isn\u2019t it? That you and Gabe\u2019s Taleh just happened to be father and daughter?\u201d I asked, hoping to take the uncomfortable expression off his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great for carpooling.\u201d</p><p>I tried not to smile. \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned his forehead against my cheek, taking in the scent of my hair. \u201cIt\u2019s quite common. Archs are family as wel as an army, existing in groups. Those groups are general y assigned humans that are related or connected in some way. It creates stronger bonds with humans.\u201d</p><p>His candid desire to grow old with me made my heart race, and I was suddenly focused on his mouth. After al , he\u2019d only qualified that we wait until he told me everything.</p><p>And we were so close... \u201cHow many like you exist?\u201d I asked to distract myself. I didn\u2019t want to give him another reason to point out my embarrassing lack of self-control.</p><p>\u201cNot as many as you might think. Like I said, it\u2019s taboo to get too involved with humans. It\u2019s even worse to fal in love with one\u2014to betray your seraphic family for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how can they protect us if they despise us?\u201d I asked, incensed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, Nina. They have an almost maternal love for humans. They see you as innocent, na\u00efve children. Fal ing in love with a human is frowned upon by Archs as humans would an elderly man fal ing in love with a five year old. It\u2019s a social taboo, it\u2019s inappropriate. It\u2019s not because they are disgusted by humans, though there are those that feel that way. But those types of emotions lead to fal ing farther than earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDem\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. Don\u2019t even think it. Especial y in my presence, they tend to hover.\u201d</p><p>A shiver traveled down my spine, but when Jared pul ed me tighter to him, I instantly felt more at ease. As I relaxed my cheek against his neck, I yawned again.</p><p>\u201cAl right, it\u2019s morning. Time to take you home.\u201d He stood up and in the same movement, lifted me effortlessly in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you kick me out,\u201d I said, feeling slightly intoxicated.</p><p>\u201cThen you may never leave,\u201d he said, kissing my lips.</p><p>He sat beside me on the couch and I leaned against his chest, sliding my arm across his middle and nestling my head under his chin. He didn\u2019t speak; the only sound in the room was the buzzing from his ceiling fan and our quiet, rhythmic breaths.</p><p>Before I could focus the fuzziness in my brain to form another question, exhaustion engulfed me, and my eyes became too heavy to keep open. I relaxed further into Jared\u2019s side, feeling my consciousness slip away. It wasn\u2019t an uncomfortable feeling\u2014I felt I was just where I belonged. My last coherent thought was the contentment I felt as Jared\u2019s warm arms tightened around me.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Caught</p><p>The mangled, dark blue sheets underneath me were unfamiliar, but their wonderful scent was one I recognized right away. I lifted my head, peering around to study my surroundings. I was in a king-sized bed that sat against a grey, cinderblock wal . The alarm clock on the night table read nine o\u2019clock in large, red numbers.</p><p>My eyes drifted to a metal frame beside the clock, and I blinked to bring it into focus. It was a black and white picture of me. It had been taken from an indefinite distance, zoomed in on my face. It was from a high angle, and it reminded me of the surveil ance photos I\u2019d seen in the Port of Providence file.</p><p>Rol ing over, I hugged the pil ow next to me. It smel ed like Jared, and I took in a deep breath. His scent was incredible\u2014like line-dried laundry, soap and something else...the way it smel s when it\u2019s about to rain?\u2014I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it.</p><p>The only rooms upstairs were his bedroom and a closed door to what was likely the master bath. The far wal beyond the end of the bed wasn\u2019t a wal at al , only a metal railing.</p><p>I heard Jared\u2019s voice speaking to someone else in French downstairs. His company\u2019s voice was distinctly female. They argued in hushed tones, and in my limited knowledge of French I thought I heard Jared reprimand the woman for waking me.</p><p>This piqued my interest, so I tiptoed to the railing to steal a glance at the woman below. When my fingers met the metal bar, I saw that Jared and Claire were both looking up at me. I waved sheepishly and bit my lip, feeling foolish for trying to sneak up on celestial beings.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sweetheart.\u201d Jared said, almost crooning.</p><p>Claire\u2019s expression was the polar opposite of Jared\u2019s. She glared up at me with ice blue eyes, as if she wanted to scale the wal with murder in mind. I recoiled, suddenly feeling out of place.</p><p>While avoiding her eyes, I noticed crisply folded bedding at the end of the couch. Jared had slept downstairs.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like to shower, fresh clothes are on the dresser. You\u2019l find everything you need,\u201d Jared cal ed up to me.</p><p>On the dresser sat a neatly folded stack of clothes, and beside them a pair of boots. My eyes darted to the opposite side of the dresser where my toiletries sat. They were al from my dorm room.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had Claire bring them,\u201d Jared explained, making his way up the stairs. When he reached the top, he pul ed me to him and kissed my neck.</p><p>I glanced down to Claire, who hadn\u2019t ceased her death stare. It was clearly more than intimidation. If Jared hadn\u2019t been near, I would have been afraid for my life.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her. She won\u2019t bother you,\u201d he assured me as he pul ed me away from the railing. \u201cDid you sleep wel ?\u201d</p><p>His face was positively lit up; I couldn\u2019t recal seeing him quite so cheerful.</p><p>\u201cI must have. I don\u2019t remember anything after we sat on the couch.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hands over his light blue t-shirt, letting my fingers glide over the perfect highs and lows of his chest and abdomen. He was incredible. I\u2019d seen plenty of physiques like his on posters, commercials for exercise equipment and movies, but never in person; certainly never within my grasp.</p><p>Jared tightened his arms around me. \u201cI was careful not to wake you. You\u2019re so peaceful when you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept on the couch?\u201d I said, letting my disappointment show through.</p><p>\u201cI reconsidered...several times,\u201d he said, his lips brushing my neck when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhen did she bring my things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier. She\u2019s been in and out a lot,\u201d he frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s not happy about our conversation last night. I assume it has something to do with that.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling at my inevitably worried expression, he kissed my forehead. \u201cBreakfast wil be ready soon. I\u2019l wait for you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>After my shower, I reluctantly crept down the stairs. Claire and Jared watched me approach the table with equal but conflicting focus.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Jared whispered before he kissed my cheek and pul ed out a chair.</p><p>Claire continued to glower as I sat across from her.</p><p>\u201cClaire....\u201d Jared warned. Her irritation turned to him, then. I felt a brief moment of relief.</p><p>\u201cThank you for bringing my clothes, Claire,\u201d I whispered. As soon as the words left my mouth I thought better of it. Her icy blue eyes shot back at me and I sunk back into my chair.</p><p>Jared stared at her until she shifted uncomfortably. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she grumbled, looking down at her plate.</p><p>\u201cHam, mushroom, green pepper and cheese omelet...toast,\u201d Jared pointed out each with his butter knife as he spoke, and then shoved a forkful into his mouth.</p><p>I stabbed the eggs and took a bite. He was an incredible cook.</p><p>Everything he had made for me was exactly the way I liked it.</p><p>\u201cMmmm...that\u2019s good. I didn\u2019t realize how hungry I was,\u201d I hummed.</p><p>The fork clanged against my plate as I chewed the last bit of egg, and Jared rested his chin on his hand, amused at my shameless appetite.</p><p>Claire sighed in irritation. \u201cYou should be aware that Cynthia knows Nina spent the night here last night.\u201d</p><p>With indifference Claire watched Jared\u2019s face morph into anger.</p><p>\u201cAnd how does she know that, Claire?\u201d he seethed.</p><p>\u201cI told her,\u201d Claire admitted.</p><p>Jared slammed his fist on the table. I jumped, but Claire didn\u2019t react. I watched them stare the other down, wondering if I should distance myself from the line of fire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared noticed my growing unease and placed his hand on mine. \u201cWhat exactly did you tel her, Claire? And more importantly, why?\u201d he spoke through his teeth, working to keep his tone calm.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a choice, Jared. After what happened at the hospital, and last night, Cynthia needed to know what was going on. That\u2019s what Dad would have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s not here.\u201d Jared\u2019s voice broke as he fought to keep his calm.</p><p>Claire crossed her arms. \u201cObviously, Jared, or you wouldn\u2019t be insisting on going through with this. You\u2019ve gone against everything Dad taught us, hours after he died. I tried to tel you, but you won\u2019t listen....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can go, now, Claire,\u201d Jared snarled.</p><p>Claire\u2019s stoic expression faltered at her brother\u2019s stern tone. \u201cFine. Cynthia is waiting at Andrews. Maybe she can stop this before it gets too far.\u201d</p><p>Claire shoved herself away from the table, grabbing her keys and motorcycle helmet. I cringed when she slammed the door behind her as she left.</p><p>The force of the door crashing into the door jamb caused the shelves on the wal s to tremble. I peered over at Jared, whose jaws worked under his skin.</p><p>\u201cSo she knows about us, so what?\u201d I said, squeezing his hand.</p> <p>Jared didn\u2019t answer right away, and I could tel that he was trying to calm down before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cThis...complicates things,\u201d he said in a low tone. \u201cWe should get you back. The longer she has to wait the more difficult it wil be.\u201d</p><p>I stood and shook my head. \u201cHave I missed something here? This is my mother we\u2019re talking about, right? Why are you so nervous?\u201d</p><p>Jared took our plates to the sink and then went directly to the coat stand.</p><p>He held out my coat and tried to smile, but it resulted in a twisted, pained expression. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I twisted into my coat. I was glad when he took my hand and held it until we reached his SUV, and even more pleased that he didn\u2019t release it for the entire drive to Brown, but he didn\u2019t speak a word until we reached Andrews.</p> <p>He put the Escalade in park and looked straight ahead, releasing my hand to grip his steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming in?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m the last person she wants to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO...Okay,\u201d I said, unsure of what to make of his behavior. Jared had admitted to standing up to my father once, but he wouldn\u2019t face my mother.</p><p>I reached for the door, but Jared grabbed my arm and pul ed me to him with worry in his eyes. His hands cupped my face and he pressed his lips against mine with a sense of urgency. When he final y released me from the kiss, he leaned his forehead against mine, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou act like you\u2019re never going to see me again,\u201d I said, suddenly nervous.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ask you to go against your mother\u2019s wishes, Nina.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once in surprise. \u201cYou think she\u2019s going to tel me to stay away from you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s going to do.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou should know my mother has a poor track record for changing my mind. Even she knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seldom fails to get her way. Just...don\u2019t listen to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer tricks work on everyone but me. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up, but it seemed contrived.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l cal you later, okay?\u201d I ran my fingers through the sides of his hair, and he pressed his forehead against mine once again.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The Escalade stood motionless until I was inside the building, and then it slowly pul away.</p><p>Knowing he would be listening, I hurried to my room. I was anxious to calm the storms in Jared\u2019s eyes, even if that meant going toe to toe with Cynthia Grey.</p><p>I opened the door and froze. Cynthia stood in the middle of the room, her arms crossed, prepared for confrontation. Beth twisted around in her desk chair, meeting my eyes with a sympathetic expression.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to grab some coffee. Would either of you like me to bring you something ba\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thank you,\u201d Cynthia interrupted. She must have been far beyond anger; she was never cross enough to be so rude.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l take some, Beth, thanks,\u201d I said, making a show of appreciation. Beth nodded and grabbed her coat, rushing out the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d Cynthia demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou know perfectly wel where I was,\u201d I said, mimicking the set of her chin.</p><p>This took her off-guard. Cynthia typical y relied on the element of surprise.</p><p>She recovered quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t get involved with Jared, Nina. You don\u2019t know anything about him, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know enough, Mother.\u201d I sat on Beth\u2019s bed and looked to the floor. I would have to choose my words careful y.</p><p>Cynthia reared her head and stepped in front of me. \u201cNina Elizabeth, it\u2019s too dangerous. I know you think you know him, but you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once. \u201cIf he\u2019s dangerous then why is he being paid to protect me?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia\u2019s mouth flew open. \u201cThat arrangement was between him and your father. You\u2019re not listening. He\u2019s not dangerous to you. It\u2019s dangerous for you to be...to become...involved with him. He has just as many enemies as your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into? I don\u2019t think you have the slightest idea of where this could lead or the choices you\u2019l have to make. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s thought this through, either, or he wouldn\u2019t have done this. Maybe not, maybe he\u2019s too selfish to care\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish?\u201d I shrieked. \u201cHow can you say that about him? After what we\u2019ve put him and his family through, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is about? Guilt?\u201d Cynthia paced the room, arms stil crossed.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that,\u201d I said, embarrassed that Jared could hear her words.</p><p>She closed her eyes and sighed. \u201cNina...please. I\u2019m begging you. You know that I want you to be happy...but this\u2014this is not going to end wel ,\u201d her voice was quiet.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cDoes anything end wel ?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia heaved her usual resigned sigh, but this time it was different. It was the same she used in the seldom event that she lost an argument to Jack.</p><p>\u201cI wish this one time, Baby, that you would listen to what I\u2019m trying to tel you. The last few months have been the culmination of every fear I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>I had been unaffected by my mother\u2019s infamous guilt trips since I was thirteen, but now that she\u2019d used Jack\u2019s death, I couldn\u2019t break free of the blame. She had never wanted me to find out the truth, and I imagined that it was the one thing she wanted to remain unchanged after we lost my father.</p><p>When I thought of her dishonesty and how she\u2019d kept secrets about Jack and Gabe and the Ryels from me for years, the guilt turned to anger.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tel me how to feel,\u201d I glowered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late, Nina. You can save yourself,\u201d she said, lifting my chin. Her uncharacteristical y soft affection caught me off guard, but I was resolved.</p><p>I pul ed away from her. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be saved from Jared.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia sucked in a sharp breath and pinched her nose with her thumb and finger. \u201cNina....\u201d</p><p>I could see that she was finished. She had pul ed every trick from her bag and laid her cards on the table. I felt triumphant as I imagined Jared smiling at my words.</p><p>Beth returned, then, sitting beside me on her bed. \u201cHazelnut and Splenda,\u201d she smiled, handing me a Styrofoam cup.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Beth.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia looked at me, exasperated. \u201cI\u2019m going home now. Please think about what I said. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wil .\u201d I tried to conceal my relief at her departure.</p><p>Beth closed the door and then turned to me. \u201cDid she just give you the sex talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d I twisted my face in disgust. The thought of discussing my sex life with my mother made my stomach turn, and Beth clearly had the wrong idea about several things.</p><p>\u201cYou stayed with him last night?\u201d The corners of her mouth turned up in an enthusiastic grin.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I fel asleep. It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Wel , did you have a good time?\u201d she asked, deflated.</p><p>\u201cWe went to his loft, he cooked\u2014\u201c \u201cHe cooked?\u201d Beth interrupted.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe brought me flowers and there were candles everywhere. We talked for hours, into the morning.\u201d</p><p>Beth pul ed her knees up to her chest. \u201cWow. I told you he was in love with you. I have a sixth sense about these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d I granted.</p><p>\u201cThanks for noticing,\u201d she said. Her eyes narrowed with her grin. \u201cWhen are you going to see him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater today, I hope. Our morning was sort of cut short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCynthia,\u201d she said. I nodded my head and she stood up, gathering her things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the hospital with Chad and Tucker in an hour. Do you have time before you meet back up with Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, deciding in the moment.</p><p>Beth dialed her cel phone, cal ing Chad to let him know that I would be tagging along. Quickly after he answered, her voice lowered. She tried to be vague, but I could tel Chad, Tucker, or both, had a problem with me going. Beth won in the end, and she turned to me and winked.</p><p>I was relieved to arrive at the hospital; Tucker and Chad didn\u2019t seem angry with me, but there was an obvious air of tension in Chad\u2019s jeep. I wasn\u2019t sure what al the apprehension meant until we arrived at Ryan\u2019s new room in PCCU.</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t look happy to see me. In fact, he behaved as if my very presence was an insult.</p><p>He wasted no time before he pounced. \u201cSo how was your date?\u201d he sneered.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d My answer was automatic and venomous. I hadn\u2019t intended to sound defensive, but his spiteful attitude took me by surprise.</p><p>\u201cThat was before Beth cal ed everyone looking for you at three in the morning. It went that wel , huh?\u201d he bristled.</p><p>I looked over at Chad and Tucker; this is what they were worried about.</p><p>Beth looked at Chad with an angry glare, and he shot her an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, Babe!\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d she snarled.</p><p>Ryan rol ed his eyes. \u201cIt was Josh. What does it matter?\u201d</p><p>Beth stomped to my side of the room in protest, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat business is it of Josh\u2019s?\u201d I said. \u201cIf everyone\u2019s so worried about me upsetting you, why do they keep passing on my business?\u201d I was being entirely too defensive, but I was stil raw from my earlier encounter with Cynthia.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they want me to talk some sense into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr is it because you\u2019re making everyone think they have to choose sides?\u201d I narrowed my eyes and mimicked Beth\u2019s crossed arms. We must have looked ridiculous side by side; the Prom Queen Mafia.</p><p>\u201cThere are no sides.\u201d Ryan\u2019s nose wrinkled at my words.</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d I raised an eyebrow. My eyes darted to Chad and Tucker standing on one side of the room, and then at Beth beside me. \u201cIt sure seems like it to me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan ground his teeth and looked out the window, clearly too angry to continue.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cIf you\u2019d just give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>Ryan sucked in a sharp breath, readying himself to real y let me have it, but he cringed and grabbed his bandaged wound, letting out a muffled grunt instead.</p><p>\u201cRyan...\u201d I groaned, reaching for him. The pain in his face sent guilt burning through me. I took a step closer to his bed.</p><p>\u201cJust go, Nina. Just...go,\u201d he said with his eyes clinched shut.</p><p>I wanted to apologize, but nothing could make it right. I would never be sorry for being with Jared, and that was my only crime in Ryan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>I trudged to the waiting room without another word. My perfect morning had transformed into an abysmal day.</p><p>Beth, Chad and Tucker returned after half an hour, and we walked to the jeep in silence. I tried to find solace in their conversation on the way back to campus, discussing Ryan\u2019s improvement, his possible early release, and the funny stories they were trying to cheer him up with, but nothing helped. I was considered the scarlet letter when I had done nothing wrong.</p><p>As we pul ed into the campus parking lot, my cel phone buzzed. The display lit up and Ryan\u2019s name and number scrol ed across the screen. I clambered from Chad\u2019s jeep and pressed the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nina,\u201d he blurted out apologetical y. \u201cYou were right; it\u2019s no one\u2019s business. I just didn\u2019t expect...I don\u2019t know what I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. I just fel asleep,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, right, Nina?\u201d he said. My insides wrenched at the exhausted sadness in his voice.</p><p>I covered my eyes with my hand. \u201cOf course we are. I hate it that you\u2019re mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no right to be. I just need to know that I didn\u2019t ruin everything.\u201d</p><p>Ruin everything? He was lying in a hospital bed healing from a wound that I could have prevented. The guilt was unbearable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I choked out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a jealous idiot, Nina. Just...promise me you\u2019l come back. I won\u2019t be a jerk again, I swear.\u201d His voice bordered on begging, and I was desperate to take away his regret.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of me that easily.\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled after watching me stuff my cel phone into my purse. \u201cI\u2019m glad you two got it worked out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>Once in my room, I dialed Jared\u2019s number. The tone repeated over and over in my ear and I was caught off-guard when the voicemail prompt beeped in my ear.</p><p>\u201cH-hey, Jared,\u201d I stuttered. I had ful y expected him to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s Nina. I\u2019m back from the hospital and just thought I\u2019d give you a cal . Talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>After two hours, I became suspicious when I hadn\u2019t heard from him. He had been so anxious about the outcome of my mother\u2019s visit that I couldn\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d wait so long to return my cal . It didn\u2019t help when I realized he had probably heard my message in real-time the second I\u2019d left it.</p> <p>Just as I had lost the fight to keep from cal ing him a second time, there was a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cHappy Saturday, ladies,\u201d Kim said, bursting in.</p><p>\u201cHey Kim,\u201d I said, disappointed.</p><p>\u201cWel . I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was expecting Jared,\u201d Beth explained.</p> <p>\u201cI heard the date went wel .\u201d Kim raised her eyebrows repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cI fel asleep. He slept on the couch.\u201d</p><p>Kim wrinkled her nose. \u201cBummer.\u201d She immediately turned her attention to Beth. \u201cWhat are we doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...Chad is taking me out. Sorry,\u201d Beth said, not sounding the least bit sorry.</p><p>Kim smiled. \u201cOh wel , maybe you can have a more interesting time than Naughty Nina over there.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened, knowing that Jared or Claire could hear everything. I felt the blush span from col ar bone to crown.</p> <p>\u201cWhoa! Just kidding, Nigh!\u201d Kim said, mistaking my embarrassment for anger.</p><p>Kim forced me to rehash the entire evening. It was difficult for me to explain the length of time that I\u2019d spent there and leave out everything that Jared had told me. I kept checking my phone, even though I knew no one had cal ed.</p><p>Beth discussed the juicy details of our earlier visit to the hospital, which seemed to intrigue Kim.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect? He\u2019s crazy about her,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI know you real y like Jared, Nigh, but Ryan\u2019s a good guy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, looking at my phone again.</p><p>\u201cWho are you expecting to cal ? You\u2019ve been checking your phone like a crack addict waiting on her dealer,\u201d Kim chided.</p><p>\u201cKim!\u201d I wailed, my face burning again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is with you, today? I thought you slept last night,\u201d Kim asked, confused.</p> <p>\u201cI did. I just wish you would keep your mouth shut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNigh, we\u2019re in your room. Who\u2019s going to hear?\u201d Kim looked at Beth like I\u2019d gone insane.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d I said. \u201cYou just...nothing. I have to go.\u201d I grabbed my coat, shoved my phone in my purse and headed out the door. I wished that Jared had forgone the microphone part of the truth. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable having a normal conversation in my room.</p><p>By Monday, I stil hadn\u2019t heard from Jared. It was heartbreaking that he was somewhere close, yet he refused to speak to me. Even after everything Jared had said, my thoughts continued to return to one horrible prospect: that for some reason after he\u2019d dropped me off, he realized how unworthy I was of the adoration he\u2019d felt for so long.</p><p>The week dragged on and I found the only place I felt somewhat normal was at the hospital. I escaped campus day after day, feeling I could final y breathe the moment I sat at Ryan\u2019s bedside. We were nearly caught up on al of his homework by the time he final y broached the subject.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tel me what\u2019s been going on with you or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked with a contrived smile.</p><p>\u201cNina. This is me you\u2019re talking to.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyes gloss over and I buried my head into Ryan\u2019s blanket.</p><p>\u201cNina? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, awkwardly patting my head. When I couldn\u2019t speak, Ryan pul ed my hair away from my face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and peeked up at him. \u201cNo. No, I\u2019m not okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Ryan\u2019s face looked as desperate as I felt.</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing happened. You don\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d I sat up and wiped the moisture from my face.</p><p>\u201cIs it about Jared?\u201d he guessed. I nodded and his face twisted into rage. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shook my head, wiping away more tears. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t do anything to me. He doesn\u2019t...,\u201d I sighed, \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tel me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t...want me,\u201d I said, my face crumbling around my words.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s expression made it seem as if the sentence I\u2019d put together didn\u2019t compute; as if he couldn\u2019t imagine that being possible. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s just been some misunderstanding. What makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>I was disgusted at myself for making Ryan feel he needed to reassure me about Jared. I was a terrible person.</p><p>\u201cNina. Tel me.\u201d He spoke in the tone I provoked in people when they\u2019d had their fil of dragging information out of me.</p><p>\u201cI just thought we...I thought he....\u201d I couldn\u2019t say half of what I wanted. Certainly not enough to keep me from sounding like a spoiled child.</p><p>Ryan laughed once and I looked up at him. \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d I said, wiping my eyes with my sleeve.</p><p>\u201cIf he took you out, spent an entire night with you and can\u2019t see how incredible you are\u2014he doesn\u2019t deserve for you to be waiting for his cal . You\u2019re so much better than that. Anyone that makes you feel any less is a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but it\u2019s real y more complicated than that.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face grew serious. \u201cNo. No, it\u2019s not. If he doesn\u2019t realize what he has right in front of him, than to hel with him. And I\u2019m not just saying that because I was hoping for something like this.\u201d</p><p>I shot a glare at him and he winked at me. I smiled and sighed, letting my frustration escape with my breath. He leaned over to issue a comforting kiss to the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so good to me?\u201d I asked as he handed me a handful of tissues from his bedside table.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re worth it.\u201d He looked at me as if I should know that already, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s been trademarked by L\u2019Oreal,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I meant \u2018Maybe she\u2019s born with it\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s Maybel ine?\u201d I quipped.</p><p>He pointed at me. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take a licking and keep on ticking,\u201d I smiled, resting my head against my hand.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I giggled again and wiped the residual wetness from my eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t top the coppertop.\u201d</p><p>Ryan sat for a moment, looking stumped, and then an impish grin appeared on his face. \u201cI have good news. I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to GEICO.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you in good hands?\u201d</p><p>Ryan intertwined his fingers in mine. \u201cEasy, breezy, beautiful, Covergirl.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, not wanting to stop our game. It was such a wonderful distraction.</p><p>\u201cJust Do It,\u201d he nudged my arm.</p><p>\u201cLeggo my Eggo,\u201d I countered, playful y pul ing my arm back.</p><p>He flexed him arm. \u201cBeef. It\u2019s what\u2019s for dinner.\u201d</p><p>I pointed to his arm and shook my head. \u201cTastes great, less fil ing.\u201d I sat up and waited for his riposte.</p><p>\u201cWASSSSSUP?\u201d he leaned over into my face and I burst out into a roaring laughter. He bel owed out his own and we covered our mouths to keep the nurses from rushing in to quiet us down.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I needed that,\u201d I breathed, holding my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly did,\u201d Ryan agreed.</p><p>The next morning, I woke up to the ring of my cel phone. I scrambled to my night stand, ripped the charger cord from its port and jerked it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHel o?\u201d I cringed, waiting for the person at the other end of the line to mention the near maniacal tone in my voice.</p><p>\u201cHey Nigh, it\u2019s Ryan. You left your Anatomy book here yesterday. I just wanted to let you know before you got to class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh! Thanks. I don\u2019t think I\u2019l need it today, we\u2019re preparing for a lab.\u201d I rubbed my eyes, wondering when I had final y fal en asleep. It didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d slept at al .</p><p>\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s okay.\u201d I looked at the clock. \u201cThe alarm goes off in ten minutes, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nurse said that they may release me today or tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExcel ent! Let me know when and I\u2019l ral y the troops to spring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWil do,\u201d he chirped, sounding extremely enthusiastic for the early hour.</p><p>Classes dragged, and I had to force myself to finish out the day. By the time I got to my room, exhaustion had set in, and I decided to cook something quick and then take a nap.</p><p>Finishing the mounds of homework scattered on my bed was impossible. I couldn\u2019t concentrate knowing that every time I turned a page, every time my spoon scraped the bowl, every time I sighed, Jared was listening.</p><p>When that thought crossed my mind, anger pulsed through me. He had told me secrets\u2014which he expected me to keep\u2014he told me that he loved me, made promises, and then he just...left.</p><p>\u201cWho does that?\u201d I asked aloud. I shook my head, thinking of the show he\u2019d put on when dropping me off at Andrews. He seemed so terrified of losing me, of my mother talking me into staying away from him. In the end, it was Jared that was evading me.</p><p>I dwel ed on that for a moment and wondered what had changed from the time he dropped me off until after I\u2019d returned from the hospital. I had only focused on what I could have done wrong; I hadn\u2019t stopped to think about other possible reasons for Jared to avoid me like the plague. Like my mother.</p><p>My hand flew to my mouth as the revelation sunk in. She had spoken to him. She had told him to stay away from me, and he had listened to her.</p><p>Grabbing my coat and keys, I shot out the door as if my room were on fire. I ran to my car and violated every traffic law between Brown University and my parents\u2019 home. Once I pul ed into the drive my courage had somewhat waivered, but I had to know why Jared had changed his mind. I had to know it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t live up to his expectations.</p><p>I burst into the door, cal ing for my mother. After the third time that I yel ed her name, she came hurrying down the staircase.</p><p>\u201cNina? What are you carrying on about?\u201d She held onto the banister with one hand and clipped on an earring with another.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say to whom?\u201d A disgusted look immediately clouded her face.</p><p>\u201cMother, stop it!\u201d I yel ed.</p><p>Cynthia raised an eyebrow and spoke slowly. \u201cYou wil watch your tone while in my house, young lady.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and took another step toward her. \u201cWhat did you say to Jared?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia deliberated for a moment. \u201cI told him what he needed to hear, Nina. Of course you wouldn\u2019t listen, so I had no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you deliberately try to hurt me?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia was stunned by my assumption. \u201cNina, I\u2019m simply trying to save you from yourself. If you won\u2019t have the sense to...wel , I\u2019m glad that he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m begging you...don\u2019t do this. I have been....\u201d I couldn\u2019t finish. I sat on the bottom step and covered my face with my hands.</p><p>Cynthia descended the remaining steps and sat next to me. \u201cI know you think you understand, Darling, but you don\u2019t. Whatever you think you know... you couldn\u2019t truly grasp what it was that you were choosing. I\u2019m glad that Jared loves you enough to let you go.\u201d</p><p>I glared at her. \u201cDo you even hear yourself? He loves me, Mom. He loves me and you....\u201d I shook my head and walked to the door. \u201cDo you even care how I feel?\u201d I asked, standing with my back to her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I returned to my car, choking back a frustrated cry. There was only one way I could talk to him, now.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Purgatory</p><p>I searched under the desks, running my fingers along each of the twisted wires underneath. Jared would listen to me whether he liked it or not, and in my determination, I left nothing to chance. I meticulously inspected the edges of the mirror, the back of the microwave, the mini-fridge, under both beds and under the dorm\u2019s standard-issue cord phone.</p><p>An hour had passed, and I found nothing. Jared was a professional. Of course I wouldn\u2019t find the mic he\u2019d planted. I tried to recal any spy movies I\u2019d watched when revelation hit. My eyes slowly fol owed the wal up to the ceiling, and focused on a rectangular vent in the center.</p><p>I rol ed Beth\u2019s desk chair directly underneath. There were two screws, and I had no tools. I rushed to the residential advisor\u2019s room and tried to catch my breath while rapping on the door. She opened it with a bored look on her face.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dara. Listen, I\u2019m having some trouble with the vent in my room....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l cal maintenance in the morning,\u201d she deadpanned, closing the door.</p><p>I pushed it open. \u201cI was wondering if you had a screwdriver. One of those cross-ones that I could use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Phil ips?\u201d she asked, bored with the conversation.</p><p>My eyes lit up. \u201cYes! Do you have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat size do you need?\u201d she asked, turning her back to me.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d I peered up at her vent, and she did the same.</p><p>\u201cYou need a smal one, here.\u201d She handed me a tiny screwdriver, and I thanked her before rushing back to my room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The screwdriver was smal er than I needed, so I had to press on one side to get the screw to rotate at al . Once the first screw became loose enough to use my thumb and finger to make more progress, it didn\u2019t take long for it to drop into my hand. I began working on the other screw, and after two laborious turns my right hand slipped. Trying to catch myself, my palm grated against the edge of the vent, and the ragged edge of metal sliced through my skin.</p><p>I pul ed my hand back with a gasp, watching the blood ooze from the cut and drip down my forearm toward my elbow in a thick, red line.</p><p>\u201cOw! Sssshhhhoooot!\u201d I cried, bending at the waist.</p><p>I climbed down to grab a wad of tissue and held it tightly in my hand, unwil ing to give up.</p> <p>Tissues in hand, I tried to fit the screwdriver into the tiny slot at the best angle possible for traction. When I pressed against the side of the screw, I leaned into the movement and the wheels of the chair shifted. Before I could right myself, the chair jerked from under me and I tumbled down, smacking my elbow on the floor.</p><p>It took a moment for the pain to register, and once the sharp stabbing sensation shot up my arm, I closed my eyes. \u201cOw,\u201d I whimpered. Once I could think about something other than the pain, I hobbled back onto the chair.</p><p>Tugging the vent loose, I inched up on my tip toes to peer inside. My heart skipped a beat when I saw a tiny black object nestled in the decades of dust. I reached inside the vent and pinched the smal piece of plastic, tugging on it once before it gave way. I pul ed it toward me and brought it into view; Jared\u2019s miniature microphone.</p><p>Overwhelmed by the undeniable truth I held in my hand, I pul ed the mic down with me as I slumped to the chair. Jared could hear me and was aware of what I had done. Coupled with the pain in my arm, the fact that he was just on the other side of this device made my eyes wel over with tears.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I breathed, trying to keep my voice from shaking. \u201cI know you can hear me.\u201d I sighed, closing my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she said to you. I don\u2019t care, I just...,\u201d I trailed off as my voice broke, \u201cI miss you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhat are you doing? Al that talk about growing old together and being honest? And now you\u2019re going to listen to her and walk away?</p> <p>\u201cWil you please just....\u201d I struggled to form the words. \u201cWil you please just talk to me? Please?\u201d</p><p>I watched my cel phone, praying, wil ing it to light up and ring. An eternity passed, but it lay on my nightstand, stil and dark.</p><p>I wiped the moisture from my eyes, looking up at the wire spiraling down from the ceiling. Anger surged through my veins and I stood up, yanking on the wire over and over until it final y ripped from its source. I noticed the frayed edge of the end of the wire and wiped my face once more, satisfied.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair that he could hear me when I was alone.</p><p>A buzzing noise came from the night table and I stiffened. It buzzed again and I threw the wire down, nearly tripping over it to reach the phone before I missed the cal .</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I breathed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s uh...it\u2019s Ryan. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t be sorry,\u201d I sniffed.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You sound like you\u2019ve been crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there a reason you cal ed?\u201d I wasn\u2019t in the mood to discuss my latest moment of insanity.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he hesitated, \u201cI\u2019m being released in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh yeah, okay. I\u2019l come in the morning, then. Did you let everyone else know or should I cal them?\u201d I asked, hoping he would catch the meaning.</p><p>\u201cI just started making the cal s.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d cal ed me first. I wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about that.</p> <p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm?\u201d I said, distracted by the wire curled and arched beside my bed.</p><p>\u201cTel me why you\u2019re upset. Is it Jared?\u201d My silence was al the answer he needed. \u201cI could kil him for doing this to you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault, Ryan. I\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>Ryan sighed, accepting my vague reply. \u201cI\u2019l see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Friday was easier than I thought it would be, with the six of us choreographing Ryan\u2019s on-the-fly homecoming party. We caravanned to the hospital; bal oons and shoe polish decorated our cars. The windows of Josh\u2019s truck vibrated to the beat of \u201cParadise City\u201d as Tucker wheeled Ryan out of the double doors of the hospital. We al whistled and clapped as Ryan lumbered into Josh\u2019s passenger side.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Nina,\u201d Ryan smiled, gesturing for me to accompany him. When I scooted in next to him, Ryan weakly lifted his arm to the top of the seat behind me. We giggled and joked al the way to Brown, and the seven of us made our way to Ryan\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a parade threw up in here,\u201d Ryan said, beaming. He hobbled over to his desk chair and fel into it, visibly spent.</p><p>We sat and talked, and then Beth, Chad and Tucker left for class. Thirty minutes later, Kim and Josh had classes of their own to go to.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to your hand?\u201d Ryan asked, staring at my messily bandaged palm.</p><p>\u201cI sliced it on the air vent in my room,\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOuch. Are you al caught up on your tetanus shots?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019l come by later, okay? We have a lot of work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have class?\u201d he asked, disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had class for the last two hours, Ryan,\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cThanks for today. Maybe we could do this every month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m not volunteering to get stabbed next time. Or ever.\u201d I hugged him and an awkward pause fol owed when I pul ed away. \u201cYou take it easy. I\u2019l come over later and we can study.\u201d</p><p>Ryan watched me with a soft expression as I walked to the door. \u201cSee you later, Nigh.\u201d</p><p>I pul ed his door closed and let out a gust of air. I couldn\u2019t be sure if it was guilt or the look in Ryan\u2019s eyes after I\u2019d hugged him, but everything felt different when we were alone. I forgot about angels and demons and feeling unwanted. In Ryan\u2019s presence, life was normal.</p><p>Soon after class began, my thoughts zeroed in on Jared. I clenched my eyes shut when I thought about the night before. I had probably relieved him of any regret he might have felt after my antics. The professor\u2019s voice blurred into the background, and I took shal ow breaths to keep the tears from forming; it was embarrassing enough that everyone peered over their shoulders at me every day as if I\u2019d gone crazy, the last thing I needed was to break down in class.</p><p>In the solitude of my room, I let the tears flow. I was glad that Jared couldn\u2019t hear me. I had become a blubbering, pathetic mess. My eyes drifted to the vent to see that the cover was securely fastened to the ceiling. My eyebrows pressed inward. I was too exhausted the night before to replace it.</p><p>Scrambling to the floor, I lifted my comforter to peer under the bed where I had hidden the frayed carcass of the wire. I gritted my teeth seeing that the only thing under my bed was a lone sock surrounded by a herd of dust bunnies.</p><p>Jared or Claire had come into my room while I was gone and replaced the mic. I looked to the ceiling, bal ing my hands into fists at my sides. \u201cStay out of my room!\u201d</p><p>The screwdriver was missing from the top drawer of my dresser as wel . I had left it there for safe keeping until I could replace the vent cover. I burst into the hal way, letting the door crack against the wal . Anger fueled my march to the RA\u2019s room and I pounded on her door.</p><p>She opened it with the same impassive look on her face as before. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cDara! Oh good, you\u2019re here. Um, I seemed to have lost your screwdriver. Do you think I could borrow another one? And, I need a bigger one this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost one of my screwdrivers and you want to borrow another one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, more of a question than an answer.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d she sighed, leaving for a moment. She returned with a larger screwdriver in hand.</p><p>Running back to my room, I pushed Beth\u2019s chair under the vent. The new screwdriver was a better fit, and I had the screws out in record time. I reached up again and stood on my tip toes, finding the familiar smal plastic object without effort. An exact replica of the first mic came down in the first tug.</p><p>I climbed down and pul ed on the wire until it quivered with tension. With one swift yank, the wire dislodged from the vent and dropped to the floor. A strange sense of accomplishment came over me; I had perfected the art of ripping out surveil ance wires.</p><p>With a smug smile, I looped the thin, mangled wire into a tight circle. \u201cI\u2019m not a zoo animal,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>The door pulsed as someone banged on it from the other side. I twisted the knob, hoping for a scolding from Jared, but instead I found Claire standing in front of me with a murderous expression.</p><p>A lump lodged in my throat as she shouldered past me. In one lithe movement, she climbed onto Beth\u2019s chair and reached up into the duct. It took her longer to get the new wire instal ed than it had taken me to rip the old one out, but she replaced the vent quicker than I had removed it.</p><p>She walked to the door and stopped to look at the wire in my hands. Her hand blurred as she snatched it from me.</p><p>\u201cIf you do it again,\u201d she eyed the vent and then whispered in my ear, \u201cI\u2019l rip out your tongue.\u201d</p><p>My tongue curled up inside my mouth as I tried to swal ow. Claire leaned back to offer a disturbing sweet smile, and then left. I shut my door behind her and locked it, wrapping my arms around my middle. She terrified me.</p><p>The thought of Jared hearing my every movement made tears trickle from my eyes and down my cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d I whispered. The sudden need to distance myself from that microphone became urgent, and I grabbed my coat and keys. If I was going to have any type of normalcy again, I would have to convince Cynthia.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I cal ed, walking into the dining room.</p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen, Dear,\u201d Cynthia cal ed.</p><p>I watched her expression change to concern when she saw my puffy, wet eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your hand, Nina?\u201d she said, noticing the make-shift wrap around my palm.</p><p>\u201cI want you to talk to Jared, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Her concern vanished and she returned to preparing her lunch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nina. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me have my privacy.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia seemed a bit uncomfortable with the topic, but she was never one to be intimidated. \u201cThat is between Jared and your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>She ignored me. \u201cJared and I talked for a very long time. If it helps, he argued with me at first. He was quite determined. But when I reminded him how hard it is for his mother, and how hard it wil be for you, he couldn\u2019t deny doing what is best for you. This is the easy part. You can\u2019t begin to imagine how hard your life wil be if you continue this ridiculous\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to try. You owe it to me to try,\u201d I begged.</p><p>She clicked her tongue. \u201cHe won\u2019t listen to me now, Nina. There are some things that you just can\u2019t take back. Once you\u2019ve made your case, you can\u2019t argue the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother....\u201d I pursed my lips, but it was no use. The tears fel from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI warned him that if he continued a relationship with you, I would be forced to fire him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrying on a relationship with him could get in the way of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s the only one that can keep me safe! You\u2019re wil ing to risk my life to prove a point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! Your father insisted that Jared stay away from you, Nina. You\u2019re just going to have to forget him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, I love him!\u201d</p><p>Cynthia\u2019s eyes widened at my words. After a short pause, she shook her head dismissively. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>I could barely form a whisper. \u201cLook at me.\u201d I let my shoulders hang in defeat. \u201cDoes this look like just a crush to you? I\u2019m in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop. This is not what your father wanted for you. Did Jared tel you that? That he was forbidden to get involved with you? I won\u2019t help you go against your father\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat had nothing to do with me or with Jared, Mother! Daddy didn\u2019t want me to know the truth about him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d she breathed, \u201cyou don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>I could see my efforts were in vain; Cynthia wouldn\u2019t help me. I escaped her apathetic eyes and fled to my Beemer. The rain poured relentlessly, and I was soaked by the time I entered the car. I sped down the street, the tires creating a wake behind them.</p><p>The farther I drove, the less I wanted to return to my dorm. Walking into Andrews would be admitting defeat. Worse, something deep inside of me knew that the second I stepped inside my room, I would begin a life without Jared.</p><p>When the street lights began to flicker, the rain tapped against my windshield in tiny crystals. Some of the roads had been blocked off by the flooding, and I was soon corral ed onto a dead end road. Through the gush of windblown rain, a bridge came into view just ahead of my car, arching high into the night sky.</p><p>I turned off my car and sat, mul ing over the last week. My feeble attempt to gain any control over the situation had ended dismal y. I hadn\u2019t truly considered giving up until that very moment.</p><p>I pul ed my hat and gloves off and threw them on the seat beside me, deciding that the only option I truly had was to leave. But Jared would fol ow, he would have to, and I would take him away from his sister, his brother, and Lil ian. I gripped the steering wheel as the realization sunk in; I was trapped.</p><p>One of my gloves fel to the floorboard, drawing my attention to my purse. Barely peeking out, the sharp end of Jack\u2019s letter opener glinted under the light of a lone street lamp. Without another thought, I grabbed it from my purse and shoved my way out of the car. The rain immediately blasted against me, but I planted my feet on the ground, determined to get Jared\u2019s attention this time. I grabbed the handle of the letter opener as tightly as my freezing hands could manage and held it above me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019l come,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>With a loud cry, I shoved the golden spear into my back tire. It pierced the thick rubber, but not deep enough to do any damage. I used my foot to shove it in the rest of the way, and to my relief it made a loud hissing sound.</p><p>Icy rain soaked every inch of me, and my body began to tremble as the biting wind blew against my skin. After a few minutes, I shed my coat and threw it into the seat. My body shook uncontrol ably as rain pelted against me.</p><p>I waited.</p> <p>When my sweater was soaked through, I yanked it over my head and threw it on top of my coat. Down to a long-sleeved cotton shirt, the rain felt like ice splinters driving into my bones. My teeth were chattering with such force that I opened my mouth to keep them from breaking. A puff of air escaped my mouth as a wind gust sent stinging rain tearing into my skin.</p><p>Stil , I waited.</p><p>Just when I thought I would col apse, a pair of headlights broke through the curtain of rain and came to an abrupt stop behind my car.</p><p>\u201cNina! What the hel are you doing?\u201d Jared yel ed over the rain. He took off his coat and stepped toward me, but I backed away. \u201cDo you know what hypothermia is? You\u2019re going to freeze to death!\u201d he said, shoving his coat toward me.</p><p>\u201cI l-l-love you,\u201d I said as my entire body shuddered.</p> <p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Jared said, pressing his eyebrows together. \u201cLet me take you home.\u201d He held out his coat again, but I took another step back.</p><p>\u201cY-you l-listened t-t-to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t listen to her! If she fired me it would make it harder for me to protect you. Keeping you safe is my first priority. Now, please get in the car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-How would it make it h-h-harder if you\u2019re with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about this when you\u2019re out of the rain!\u201d</p><p>I took another step back.</p> <p>\u201cCynthia controls our funding!\u201d Jared said in a desperate tone. \u201cShe funds our surveil ance, our weapons...everything. I could stil protect you, but not as wel . I couldn\u2019t risk it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re j-just going to leave me, we\u2019re g-going b-back to the way things were so you c-can buy more microphones and b-bul ets?\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. You\u2019re too important not to use the best means available, Nina. I thought if I figured out a way for us...I was trying to figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re j-just s-saying that to g-g-get me to go back there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Jared said. He lifted his coat and I took another step back. His jaws tensed. \u201cI made a mistake! I didn\u2019t want to hurt you! I just needed some time to fix the mess I\u2019ve made!\u201d</p><p>I tried to turn the corners of my mouth up into somewhat of a smile. \u201cI th-thought you didn\u2019t make m-mistakes.\u201d</p><p>With a desperate expression, Jared took a step toward me, groaning when I took another step back. \u201cDon\u2019t make me do this, Nina. Don\u2019t make me force you. Please get in the car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going b-back there,\u201d I sputtered.</p> <p>The rain poured down Jared\u2019s face and streamed from his chin. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to take you...,\u201d he sighed, \u201cI want you home with me!\u201d</p><p>I watched him for a moment, trying to read his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to you,\u201d he said, reaching for me. \u201cI want to take you home.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath and nodded. Jared wasted no time wrapping me in his coat, but it was already soaked through. He lifted me into his arms and in the next second I was in his car.</p><p>Jumping behind the wheel, Jared cranked up the heater and then rubbed my arms with both hands. \u201cJesus, Nina, your lips are blue.\u201d</p><p>He raced down streets that seemed more like rivers. I had just closed my eyes when he pul ed to the curb in front of the loft.</p><p>\u201cStay awake, Nina. Don\u2019t go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jared took the steps three at a time, unlocked his door and skipped more steps to the loft. He held me in one arm while he turned on the shower, and the steam immediately fil ed the room.</p><p>He lifted my stiff body into the shower and held me against him. I cried out as the water burned my icy skin. After a while, the quivering turned less violent. Once I was able to stand alone, Jared adjusted the temperature to a hotter setting.</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>Jared grimaced, his eyes glowing steel blue. \u201cLet\u2019s just get your temp up.\u201d</p><p>He pul ed the gauze from my hand and inspected my wound, wincing before glaring down at me. I watched as he gently scrubbed the festering cut with a washcloth.</p><p>\u201cYou should have gotten stitches for this,\u201d he grumbled. His jaw tensed as he rinsed the soap away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, worried that it was resentment in his eyes instead of concern.</p><p>\u201cEverything, Nina. I leave you alone for a week and you\u2019ve got a deep, infected cut in your hand, you nearly broke your arm when you fel off the chair, and you almost froze to death...or drowned, I\u2019m not sure what would have happened first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You have every right to be mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad? I\u2019ve made myself believe that when the time came, I would be better at making you happy than anyone else...and look at you. I\u2019ve made your life worse. You\u2019re worried I\u2019m angry with you? You should hate me for what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>I ran my aching fingers through his wavy, wet hair. He closed his eyes and sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>His expression crumbled at my words. \u201cI\u2019ve been going crazy. When you found the mic, Claire had to restrain me. It\u2019s one thing to know you\u2019re hurting; it\u2019s another to know I\u2019m causing it.\u201d</p><p>I offered a weak grin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to find a new place to hide the microphone. It didn\u2019t take me long to figure it out. I total y outsmarted you.</p><p>Twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutsmarted me? You don\u2019t even have the sense to get in out of the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I have enough sense to know that we shouldn\u2019t be apart.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes tightened in anguish.</p><p>I leaned up and pul ed his face close, pressing my lips to his cheek. The water poured over us as he pul ed me to him, my light kiss making his blue eyes burn with intensity. He kissed me as if I was the air he\u2019d gone without for five days. Neither of us held back, the agony we had experienced apart fueled every movement. Our lips parted, and he pressed me against the tile wal of the shower. I clutched the back of his shirt in each of my fists and pul ed him against me, but I couldn\u2019t get close enough. Jared\u2019s hands gripped each side of my face as he tasted the inside of my mouth.</p><p>I reached down and pul ed his shirt over his head, exposing the perfection of his bare chest. His wet shirt fel to the shower floor with a slap. I slid my hands down his back and he moaned in response. His mouth grew impatient, then, and he reached down to grab my knee. He lifted my leg and pul ed me against him, and I pressed my fingers into the flesh of his back. I braced myself as the intensity in the smal space soared to a new level; but his lips slowed down, became gentle, and then he pul ed away from me after a few soft kisses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long night, Nina. You need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can,\u201d I said, pressing my forehead against his chest.</p><p>Jared kissed my wet hair. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>When he was satisfied that I was warm enough, he pul ed me from the shower and wrapped me in a towel. I nestled against him as he carried me to his bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stil shaking,\u201d he frowned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling much better, real y,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>The front door slammed below and Jared kissed my cheek. \u201cClaire fixed your tire and drove your car here. She\u2019s going to help you get into some dry clothes.\u201d</p><p>My entire body felt like it had been sandblasted, steamrol ed and smashed in a garbage truck. I was too exhausted to argue.</p><p>Jared left us, and Claire peeled off my wet clothes, sliding a long sleeve t-shirt that read NAVY over my head.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd I thought I was crazy.\u201d</p><p>I sighed to form some sort of laugh and my eyes slowly closed and opened again.</p><p>Claire pul ed a hairdryer out of a hot pink duffle bag and began to dry and brush my hair. I braced myself for her to do her best to rip my hair out, but she was very gentle; almost maternal.</p><p>The high-pitched whine of the dryer silenced, and Claire crouched in front of me. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>As Jared passed Claire on the stairs, he offered an appreciative smile. He was shirtless, his only article of clothing a light blue pair of pajama pants. In the shower was the first time I\u2019d seen his bare physique, and even through my exhaustion I was impressed. Every muscle in his body sleek and toned, he kneeled in front of me holding a smal white box.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>The skin around the jagged cut was opaque and wrinkled from the long shower. Jared spread antibiotic along the fissure spanning the width of my palm, from the outside of my wrist to the bottom of my index finger. It didn\u2019t hurt, but because of residual trembling I had a hard time holding stil .</p><p>I raised my hand to inspect it and Jared rol ed his eyes. \u201cIs it okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely done,\u201d I nodded in approval.</p><p>I leaned against the pil ow while Jared walked to the other side of the bed. When he crawled in beside me, it occurred to me that my heart should have been pounding out of my chest, but I only felt exhaustion.</p><p>Jared pul ed me to him and folded his arms around me. I sighed as I relaxed against his chest; he was warmer than the shower. I was stil cold enough that his skin was slightly painful against mine, but I leaned in closer, welcoming the burn.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t do anything like that again,\u201d Jared whispered, kissing my forehead.</p><p>I buried my face into the concave of his neck and shivered. In reaction, Jared wrapped his arms tighter around me.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Healing</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, but my eyes wouldn\u2019t open.</p><p>Jared brushed the hair away from my face and kissed the exposed patch of skin on my cheek.</p><p>I blinked to focus, and Jared\u2019s blurry form came into view.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s six thirty, sweetheart. You have an eight o\u2019clock class.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, immediately grabbing Jared\u2019s arm. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDizzy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAs if you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, leaving my side to grab a stack of folded clothes and place them on the end of the bed. \u201cClaire brought some more of your things.\u201d</p><p>With my eyes half-closed, I stood up and stretched, and then inched up the hem of my shirt to change.</p><p>\u201cEr...Nina?\u201d Jared said, grabbing my hands. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you were the most beautiful in the morning. Seeing you standing here in my t-shirt is nearly driving me mad. Would you please stop trying to send me over the edge?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced at his infuriating insistence on putting off the inevitable. I\u2019d always been the one to procrastinate when dealing with the intimacy issue.</p><p>Now that I\u2019d felt strong enough about someone to want to press the boundaries, he insisted on dragging his feet.</p><p>Sensing my aggravation, he kissed my nose and jogged down the stairs, al owing me the privacy to change.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l drive you to school, if that\u2019s okay,\u201d Jared said after breakfast.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The roads were slick with ice, and the trees and grass were frozen in time under the inch-thick frost. Jared effortlessly navigated the Escalade to Brown\u2019s campus, keeping my hand in his until we pul ed into the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l meet you here, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...yeah?\u201d I said, caught off guard.</p><p>\u201cI thought it would be best if you stayed with me for a few days,\u201d he shrugged, \u201cuntil your hand heals. You\u2019l need a fresh dressing every night.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together, trying not to let myself get too excited. I didn\u2019t want to tip him off.</p><p>\u201cOr not...I can cal you later,\u201d he backpedaled.</p><p>I slid my arms around his middle. \u201cI would love for you to pick me up.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes relaxed. \u201cI wil be right here, one-thirty.\u201d</p><p>Initial y, the excitement of staying with Jared propel ed me through the first half-hour of class, but as the hour wore on I had a hard time concentrating. Doubt seeped into my every thought, and I found myself watching the clock, anxiously counting down the minutes.</p><p>He had left me on a day much like this one, including the perfect morning of smiles and kisses goodbye. Victory suddenly seemed too easy, and I felt sick with worry that he had appeased me long enough to disappear again.</p><p>Beth and Kim met me outside, eager to hear the story behind my bandaged hand. The prospect of enduring lunch and another class added to the stress of constructing a detailed lie of the night before had me nearly in tears. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I would go to meet him at the designated time and he wouldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>Beth noticed my mood immediately. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Nina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Why?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my tone light. It was hard to seem casual when my chest felt ful of concrete.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>I let out a sigh of relief. \u201cJared!\u201d I said, grabbing onto his coat and hugging him. I was too relieved to care how ridiculous I looked.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me without hesitation. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he whispered into my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you, Nigh?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>I buried my face in Jared\u2019s chest, and I was glad when he hugged me tighter.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he whispered in my ear again. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>I peeked over to Beth and Kim, who watched me with confused frowns. I tried to smooth my face before looking at them. \u201cI\u2019l meet you guys at The Ratty, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Beth asked, staring suspiciously at Jared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be right there,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>My friends reluctantly left me behind, and I buried my face in Jared\u2019s chest once again, tightening my arms around him.</p><p>\u201cNina, please tel me,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cYou\u2019ve been freaking out al morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He pul ed up my chin and scanned my face for a clue. He sighed in frustration when I didn\u2019t speak. \u201cNina, I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d I looked down to my boots; I couldn\u2019t look him in the eye while sounding so pathetic.</p><p>Jared took my face in his hands and kissed me tenderly. \u201cI wil never leave you again. Not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like what?\u201d I asked, concerned there might be more behind his words.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t make that mistake again. I\u2019m yours for as long as you\u2019l have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cI love you more than I could ever promise.\u201d</p><p>I rested my cheek against his chest and closed my eyes, indescribably happy. The euphoria faded when I realized I would have to make it through lunch and another class before I would see him again.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to get used to that, you know,\u201d I said, frowning.</p> <p>\u201cGet used to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sensing how I\u2019m feeling. It\u2019s....\u201d I trailed off, wrinkling my nose.</p><p>Jared chuckled. \u201cWeird?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him sheepishly and shrugged. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to lunch with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go to class with me, but you can come to lunch. It would help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp with what?\u201d he asked, stil stumped.</p><p>\u201cWith the....\u201d I hesitated. Being honest meant casting blame in his direction, which I had no desire to do.</p> <p>\u201cAnxiety,\u201d Jared finished for me. As I predicted, he was visibly upset that I felt that way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s your fault, I just meant....\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I felt the corners of my mouth turn up, and I let his warm hand surround mine as we walked into The Ratty. Every face at the table seating my friends seemed to look over at us in unison as we walked to the buffet.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just curious.\u201d I said as we walked through the line. Jared simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cEverything al right, Nigh?\u201d Beth asked once we were seated.</p><p>\u201cEverything is great,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t look so great when we left you,\u201d Kim said. Her eyes narrowed in Jared\u2019s direction for a moment, and then returned back to me.</p><p>Jared seemed amused by my friends\u2019 incredulous expressions.</p><p>I picked up the spoon from my tray and muttered under my breath; I\u2019d meant to grab a fork. Before I could get up, Jared sat a fork on my tray. I looked up to thank him, but before I could form the words, Ryan puffed a disgusted laugh.</p><p>\u201cIs he going to feed you, too?\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I sneered. If I hadn\u2019t been so angry I might have feared for Ryan\u2019s safety. Jared could have easily reached over the table and snapped his neck. He watched Ryan, but seemed outwardly unaffected.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing this weekend, Ryan?\u201d Josh asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ryan answered. His eyes were focused on Jared, ful of hate.</p><p>Kim spoke, \u201cI say we go to our regular spot. We\u2019re making that place a ton of money. The geriatrics love the entertainment we\u2019re providing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just like older men,\u201d Josh teased.</p><p>\u201cOnly the ones that carry around a bottle of Viagra,\u201d she said off-handedly. Everyone at the table paused for moment, waiting for her to crack a smile. When she didn\u2019t, they continued discussing plans.</p><p>Ryan looked away from Jared after Kim\u2019s comment, and she winked at me after the moment had passed. The girl was a genius.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d Tucker said.</p><p>Beth turned to face me. \u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, quickly glancing at Jared from the corner of my eye. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Kim groaned.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring Jared? It\u2019l be fun,\u201d Beth chirped.</p><p>Ryan slowly turned to her with angry disbelief. Beth sank back in her chair.</p><p>Noticing Ryan\u2019s reaction, Jared hugged me gently to him and smiled. \u201cSounds good to me. Do you want to go?\u201d he asked, turning to me.</p><p>\u201cUh...sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d Kim said with a mouth ful of food.</p><p>\u201cSpring Break is in two weeks,\u201d Carrie chimed in. \u201cLisa and I are going to Tahoe. Does anyone else want to go skiing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds amazing! Do you want to go?\u201d Beth said, looking at Chad.</p><p>Chad shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t been skiing in a couple of years. How many spots do you have open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom has a place there. We can al fit if you guys want to come,\u201d Lisa said.</p><p>\u201cHow much fun is this going to be?\u201d Beth clapped. \u201cDo you want to go skiing, Nigh?\u201d she asked, turning to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I usual y go on vacation with my parents. I\u2019m sure Cynthia has something planned, already,\u201d I looked to Jared who nodded infinitesimal y, confirming my assumption.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get out of it?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot this year. I don\u2019t want to make her go alone.\u201d Kim and Beth nodded in understanding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta get back,\u201d Ryan said, rising. He peered up at me a few times while gathering his things, and then walked away without saying goodbye.</p><p>Josh fol owed closely behind.</p><p>\u201cWhat his problem?\u201d Lisa asked.</p><p>Kim shrugged, but I caught her glance in my direction.</p><p>Jared walked me to my next class. I was glad that he decided to do that on his own; it saved me the humiliation of asking. Suddenly the task of sitting through the next hour was less daunting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l see you after class?\u201d he asked, kissing my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to come al the way here,\u201d I said, leaning my cheek into his lips and closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he scanned my face, exasperated. His was the tone he used when I had misunderstood something he thought was obvious. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize. I was here, anyway. How would I protect you from the loft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you just hang around campus every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you leave. That is my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...when I saw you al of those times before, off campus? When I first started running into you?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, looking caught. \u201cShamelessly stalking you.\u201d</p><p>I felt my face brighten. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>Class seemed to fly by. Before I knew it, I was on my way to Jared\u2019s loft again, riding happily in the passenger seat.</p><p>He held the door open with one hand, and held my bag in the other. I put my things in the downstairs bathroom, finding a deep whirlpool tub.</p><p>I wil definitely be trying that out, later, I thought to myself.</p><p>I walked to the couch and sank into the cushions. I was home.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Jared whispered in my ear.</p><p>I blinked a few times, trying to focus as I looked around the room. The sun no longer filtered through the windows and a blanket was draped over me. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I asked, stretching.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after six. Did you want to go out for dinner or stay in?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely stay in. I\u2019l cook this time,\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stil tired, how about we order in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can cook?\u201d I looked at him with accusing eyes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever tasted your cooking. Jack has mentioned it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved my cooking,\u201d I said defensively.</p><p>\u201cJack adored you. You could have served him sludge from a toxic waste plant and he would have asked for seconds,\u201d Jared teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to prove it to you.\u201d I walked over to the refrigerator and opened the door.</p><p>Jared was instantly behind me. \u201cNina, you\u2019ve had a long week, a rough night last night, and you went to school today. You don\u2019t have to prove anything tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, surveying the contents of his fridge.</p><p>Just then, Claire burst through the door, kicking it closed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to buy me another door\u2014again\u2014if you keep that up,\u201d Jared growled, turning to face her.</p><p>Claire held two large, plastic bags. \u201cDinner.\u201d</p><p>A smug smile immediately appeared on Jared\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI guess that settles it,\u201d I said, defeated.</p><p>Claire brought the sacks to the table. \u201cI was over by Thai Star. I got you the Green Curry, Nina. Jared...your usual. There are egg rol s and Satay, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Claire,\u201d Jared said, digging through the sacks and sticking an egg rol in his mouth. After a moment he looked up at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>It was surreal enough to have my new boyfriend know al of my favorites, al of my idiosyncrasies, and sense my feelings. With his sister\u2014who I\u2019d seen al of three times\u2014 bringing my favorite dish from a restaurant I frequented, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit dazed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re going to have to do a better job of easing you into this,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Claire realized what he meant, rol ed her eyes and spoke in a disgusted tone, \u201cIt\u2019s dinner, Nina. I\u2019ve been around you my entire life, so natural y I would know your food preferences. You were less disturbed about us being Half-breeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It just took me off guard,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed,\u201d Jared said, glaring at Claire then looking back at me with concern. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some getting used to. We know it\u2019s going to be awkward for you for awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself. It\u2019s annoying how you coddle her al the time,\u201d Claire fumed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take your daddy issues out on her,\u201d Jared snarled.</p><p>Claire narrowed her eyes and put her fists on the table, leaning closer to him. Jared automatical y angled his body protectively in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWow! I am starving!\u201d I said, a bit too loudly.</p><p>Jared and Claire both looked at me with their typical polar-opposite reactions. Jared was amused at my attempt to avoid bloodshed, and Claire appeared to be contemplating a way to choke me to death before Jared could stop her. I sat down and opened the flip-top box Jared had placed in front of me.</p><p>I watched him rummage through the other sack, pul ing out boxes of appetizers, and I tried to mimic his casual demeanor. Claire stood there for a moment, glaring at both of us, and then sat down to her meal.</p><p>After a few minutes of silence, Jared and Claire began discussing their day. I caught on after a while that they were being vague. I didn\u2019t press the issue, from the path of the conversation I assumed it was about Claire. At least they weren\u2019t speaking a foreign language.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like I\u2019l be leaving in a couple of weeks,\u201d Claire grumbled.</p><p>\u201cSpring Break?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cIch hasse diesen See,\u201d she said, leaning back in her chair.</p><p>That was when my patience faded. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to learn German,\u201d I grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jared said, \u201cwe\u2019re not trying to exclude you. We were just discussing Claire\u2019s training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered that,\u201d I said, picking at my food.</p><p>Jared smiled at me with adoration and then leaned over to kiss my cheek.</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes. \u201cSie bilden einen Dummkopf von selbst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making a fool of myself. She\u2019s right, we\u2019re being rude.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Jared\u2019s complimentary translation. He leaned over again to quickly kiss my forehead before going upstairs.</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes again and then took her plate to the sink. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my appetite.\u201d</p><p>I had to look twice when Jared returned downstairs. He was shirtless, wearing only a pair of red soccer shorts and wel -worn running shoes. He stood behind me as I rinsed dishes at the sink, and then wrapped his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. I\u2019l get to it, later,\u201d he said, pressing his cheek against mine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d I said, trying to sound tough.</p><p>Jared left me to retreat to the corner where he kept his home gym. I loaded the few dirty dishes in his sink into the dishwasher while Claire walked into the downstairs bathroom and closed the door behind her. Suddenly the door opened again and my suitcase was hurled with incredible precision from the bathroom, landing directly beside me.</p><p>\u201cThis is my bathroom,\u201d Claire warned.</p><p>I swal owed nervously, staring at the suitcase that sat an inch from my foot. I offered a meek smile. \u201cNice tub.\u201d</p><p>Jared puffed from the corner. \u201cThey\u2019re both my bathrooms, and you\u2019re welcome to either.\u201d</p><p>Claire glared at him and slammed the door, making my shoulders shoot up to my ears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her push you around. She\u2019s al bark and no bite,\u201d he puffed, pushing an absurd amount of weight.</p><p>I eyed the bathroom door. \u201cShe bites, Jared. She\u2019d chew me up and spit me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t hurt you. She just loves to see you squirm,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t like the Archs, that you could hurt humans if necessary?\u201d I looked back at him, trying to concentrate on the subject at hand instead of his perfect form.</p><p>\u201cShe could, but she won\u2019t. Claire knows better than anyone what you mean to me. Besides the fact that she would have to come to blows with me to even come close to you\u2014and she would never cross that line\u2014she wouldn\u2019t make me choose between you and my family. She\u2019s just rattling your cage,\u201d he said, repositioning himself on the bench. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you choose between me and your family,\u201d I murmured, knowing he would hear.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he said in that familiar frustrated tone, \u201cyou\u2019re not listening to me. She knows how I feel about you, so you can stop worrying about Claire.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cShe might know how you feel about me, but one of these days she might over look it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the love of my life, Nina. There\u2019s no overlooking that.\u201d Jared spoke the words casual y, but my legs disappeared. I had to steady myself against the counter to keep from hitting the floor.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, continuing his workout.</p><p>\u201cMe? Er...yeah. I\u2019m just fine. Perfectly fine. Why?\u201d I sighed at my utter failure to fool him. Jared simply smiled with a knowing look, never slowing his repetitions.</p><p>Claire emerged from the bathroom in a hooded sweatshirt and sweat pants, her hair pul ed back into a wiry bun. She looked like a seventeen year old girl, for once. She fel into the couch, feet hanging over the arm, flipping through channels of the flat screen.</p><p>Once the dishes were finished I lingered in the kitchen, wiping down the counters over and over again. I decided to take my suitcase upstairs to organize my things as best I could, hanging my clothes in Jared\u2019s closet and finding a place for my shampoo and toothbrush. It was fun playing house for the week, but it only took so long.</p><p>I stood in the middle of the room, feeling lost. Jared was stil deep in his workout, and with Claire on the couch I saw no point in enticing him upstairs. I decided to try Jared\u2019s incredible tub to pass the time.</p> <p>The steam danced above the surface of the water as I let my robe fal to the floor. I stepped in with both feet, stifling a moan. Once I was submerged to my neck, my body instantly relaxed. I loathed the communal showers of Andrews; I would miss more than just the tub when I returned.</p><p>\u201cNina? Did you grab a towel?\u201d Jared said, his voice muffled through the door.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d I said in a sing-song tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l grab you one.\u201d</p><p>Within moments, Jared\u2019s arm poked through as he cracked open the door, extending a thick navy blue towel. I frowned.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t reach it,\u201d I teased.</p> <p>I heard Jared sigh before he opened the door just wide enough to get through, turning his head to the opposite direction. He was stil only in shorts and running shoes, dripping with sweat.</p><p>He took a few more steps in my direction, holding out the towel. The water sloshed as I raised my steaming arm to grab it, setting the towel beside me on the ledge.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed and left the way he came, making sure not to open the door any wider than absolutely necessary.</p><p>I slid under the surface of the water to suppress the laughter. He was working as hard to preserve my chastity as I was to rid myself of it.</p><p>I remained in the tub until my feet and hands were sufficiently pruned. Wrapped in my robe, I climbed the wooden stairs, noticing Claire was no longer on the couch. When I reached the top, I heard the shower running.</p><p>I rifled through my things and chose a pink silk pajama set, and just when I buttoned the top of my shirt, Jared walked out of the bathroom in a pair of black cotton pajama pants.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Claire?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cShe had to go out...training,\u201d Jared explained, pul ing the first aid box out from under his bed.</p><p>I sat down and held my hand palm up for him to work with. \u201cI thought you were finished with your training. What else could she possibly learn? And from whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ful of questions tonight,\u201d he said, working quickly to disinfect and redress my wound.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re evading them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to acuminate our skil s when we....\u201d he trailed off, his eyes darkening the way they had during our first date.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, watching him place the last strip of tape on my hand.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you to do something for me?\u201d he asked, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnything. Except leave.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes popped open. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave. I\u2019m asking you to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for what?\u201dI grimaced. Jared had a knack for confusing me.</p><p>\u201cLeave this one alone. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to explain everything to you soon. But I\u2019m just not ready to\u2014,\u201d he squirmed uncomfortably, \u201c\u2014can you wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s face instantly relaxed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask just one thing?\u201d I whispered, peeking up at the clouds reforming in Jared\u2019s eyes. \u201cI just...was wondering...wil you ever have to leave me? For training, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled once again, obviously relieved at my question. \u201cNo. I\u2019m finished with my training. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor me,\u201d I teased.</p><p>I pul ed myself back to lean against the headboard and Jared lay on his stomach beside me. He hugged my legs to him and rested his head on my lap, and I happily ran my fingers through his damp hair.</p><p>\u201cAre you running a fever?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared looked up at me, puzzled. \u201cI don\u2019t get sick, Nina, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you...you\u2019re burning up,\u201d I said, feeling his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI run a little hotter than everyone else. It\u2019s a constant thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much hotter?\u201d I asked, skeptical.</p><p>\u201cAround one-oh-four usual y. I just got out of the shower, so I\u2019m probably a little higher than that at the moment.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him blankly; I had nothing else to say.</p><p>Jared chuckled at my speechlessness and let his head rest against my leg again. \u201cIt\u2019s real y not a big deal. Claire runs about the same. It has to do with how our bodies handle the extra...abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbilities....\u201d I repeated. Most of the time I had a handle on Jared being half-angel, but only when I tried not to think about it. The details made my head spin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how it must be for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough getting to know someone when you start dating, and then you have to deal with your boyfriend spouting off unbelievable particulars al of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s boyfriend, now, is it?\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed and sat up, readying himself to pounce.</p><p>My mouth hung open, feigning shock. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my legs and pul ed, sliding me underneath him. He playful y pinched my sides, tickling me as my laughter chimed through the loft.</p><p>\u201cOkay! Okay. Boyfriend it is,\u201d I giggled again.</p><p>Jared sighed in contentment at my words. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve ever wanted is right here in my arms.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t imagine why he looked at me that way. Six bil ion people in the world, and a man so perfect he was also half divine had chosen me. That fact alone was more than I deserved, but for him to say something so beautiful with that look in his eyes, I couldn\u2019t help myself.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jared.\u201d It didn\u2019t seem like enough, but once the words tumbled from my mouth, his smile turned into pure elation, as if I\u2019d given him the one thing he\u2019d wanted his entire life. Before I could think to say anything else, his lips were on mine.</p><p>He kissed me differently this time; it was gentle, almost cautious. I wrapped both of my arms around his neck as he continued to work his warm lips softly against mine. He put so much emotion in these smal , slow, tender kisses that I found myself fighting tears. He kissed me like a happy ending.</p><p>And then he stopped.</p><p>In one smooth movement, he moved me to my proper place in the bed. He crawled over me careful y, lying directly behind me, tracing my body with his. I took a deep breath and let out a satisfied humming sound that compel ed Jared to pul me closer.</p><p>Just before I drifted off to sleep, I said the first prayer I\u2019d uttered since I was girl. I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d done to deserve such a wonderful gift, and I wasn\u2019t sure if it was insolent, but I thanked God for fal en angels.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Fate</p><p>Over the next few days, we settled into a comfortable routine. Jared took me to school, returned to sit with me at lunch, and then waited outside my last class. At night, I studied while he worked out, and I became quite accustomed to fal ing asleep in his arms. Each time he dressed my wound a sense of dread came over me; the healing cut meant that our nights together were numbered.</p><p>The girls at our regular lunch table became quite taken with Jared, while the boys tried their best to ignore him. The lines were clearly drawn. Lisa even invited Jared to a tentative girls\u2019 night out, to which Jared only replied with a raised eyebrow, causing those who were paying attention to laugh.</p><p>I noticed Ryan being careful to speak only to me, making a point to ignore anything Jared contributed to the conversation. By Thursday, the tension at the table had elevated.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to study group tonight or not?\u201d Ryan asked, clearly in a bad mood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the plans are tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked at me and began to speak, but Ryan cut him off. \u201cWhat? You need permission?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s cal ed being courteous. You should try it.\u201d</p><p>Jared lightly touched my knee to keep me calm. It wasn\u2019t working; Ryan couldn\u2019t be more proficient at getting under my skin.</p><p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m not happy about how weird you\u2019ve been, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m being a jerk,\u201d he said, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cYou said it, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve moved in with this guy,\u201d he motioned to Jared, \u201cyou don\u2019t talk to your friends anymore, you\u2019re skipping out on study group...I\u2019m doing what friends do, Nina. I\u2019m making sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cal ed me last night,\u201d Beth said defensively. Ryan ignored her.</p><p>I could feel the heat radiating from my face. \u201cYou\u2019re not being a friend. You\u2019re being aggressively nosy.\u201d</p><p>Ryan rol ed his eyes. \u201cAre you coming to study group or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d I growled.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s demeanor immediately changed. \u201cSo, you wanna grab something to eat after?\u201d</p><p>I felt Jared\u2019s hand tense around my knee.</p><p>\u201cNot funny, Ryan,\u201d Kim scolded.</p><p>Ryan continued to look at me expectantly. Everyone at the table watched for my\u2014and Jared\u2019s\u2014reaction.</p><p>\u201cJared is picking me up afterward. We have dinner plans,\u201d I said, glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t know what your plans were,\u201d Ryan goaded.</p><p>I leaned forward in my chair, taking in a sufficient breath to unleash my temper across the table.</p><p>Jared final y spoke, \u201cWe have dinner plans every night, Ryan. You\u2019re welcome to join us.\u201d I shot Jared a surprised look and noticed that his face was free of any sarcasm.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, taken off guard by Jared\u2019s sincere invitation. \u201cI think I\u2019l pass.\u201d</p><p>I smiled smugly at him, turning my attention to Jared. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said, leaning over to kiss my forehead.</p><p>Lisa and Carrie swooned.</p><p>At the door of my classroom, Jared set my bag on the floor beside me, pul ing up the handle.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, giving him a quick peck.</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019l be hanging around here until study group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou assume correctly,\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cCal me when you\u2019re finishing up, I\u2019l pick you up at the Rock.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that you have to sit outside and wait on me. Why don\u2019t you just come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve done for the last three years. You need to spend time with your friends or they\u2019re going to start worrying about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan is the only one that\u2019s worried, and he\u2019s just being difficult,\u201d I said, running my hand over the sleeve of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s jealous.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled and kissed the top of my hair. \u201cI\u2019l see you later, then.\u201d</p><p>As soon as class was over, I headed directly for Andrews. The sun was shining, and I was just beginning to enjoy my walk when Ryan appeared beside me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, less than enthusiastic about his company.</p><p>\u201cOh. c\u2019mon. You\u2019re not that mad,\u201d he teased, throwing his arm over my shoulder and squeezing.</p><p>I squirmed from his embrace. \u201cYou tried to humiliate me in front of everyone, Ryan. What was the point in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you what the point was. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>I breathed out a sarcastic laugh. I was never safer than when I was with Jared.</p><p>\u201cNina...,\u201d he said, slowing down. Before I could get too far ahead of him, he jerked me back by my coat sleeve to where he stood. \u201cNina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I growled, trying not to trip over my bag. I jerked my arm from his grip and smoothed out my sleeve.</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit you\u2019ve been MIA this week. What\u2019s going on with you? You barely know this guy.\u201d</p><p>I fidgeted as I tried to think of a believable answer. I knew it appeared that way to him\u2014and everyone else\u2014but I couldn\u2019t defend myself with the truth.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t move in with him. My hand is infected, so he\u2019s changing the dressing every night. As soon as it heals I\u2019l be back at Andrews.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but frown at the thought.</p><p>\u201cHe could do that at Andrews,\u201d Ryan argued.</p><p>Of course he was right, but Jared and I both knew it had been a flimsy excuse al along. I didn\u2019t like the thought of him spending the night in his Escalade outside Andrews, and Jared was more than ready to make the present living arrangement permanent. Neither of which I could explain to Ryan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d I asked, continuing to the dorm.</p><p>Ryan shoved his hands in his pockets, fol owing close behind. \u201cI just think you\u2019re getting in way too deep, way too fast. You need to take a step back. Slow down. You just met this guy and you\u2019re acting like an old married couple. You have other friends.\u201d</p><p>Feeling slighted, my mouth flew open. \u201cI am not! I know I have other friends. I\u2019ve talked to Beth and Kim every night since I\u2019ve been at Jared\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to me,\u201d he said, looking hurt.</p> <p>I rol ed my eyes, glad that we had final y reached Andrews. \u201cYou want me to start cal ing you at night? Wil that make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would. Wil your husband mind?\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes, pul ing my keys from my pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind if I come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not, since you\u2019re already fol owing me in.\u201d</p> <p>I shoved the door open and rol ed my bag into the closet. Ryan sat on Beth\u2019s bed and watched me, seemingly amused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, waiting for a sarcastic remark.</p><p>He shrugged, dropping his backpack to the floor. \u201cNothing. You\u2019re just so funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I asked, peeling off my coat.</p><p>\u201cYou spend so much time pretending to be mad at me when you know why I say the things I do. I don\u2019t get it. You like spending time with me; you like spending time with him; the only difference is that you decided to play house with him this week.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, anticipating a fight. \u201cAre you insinuating what I think you\u2019re insinuating?\u201d I asked, pul ing off my boots.</p> <p>\u201cIt depends. Are you going to throw your boots at me?\u201d he asked, pul ing one side of his mouth up into a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m leading you on?\u201d I yel ed, gripping one boot in my hand.</p><p>\u201cWel ...,\u201d he trailed off long enough to see my temper flare. \u201cJust kidding!\u201d He held his hands up, expecting a boot to fly across the room. When he felt he was safe, he continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I just think you should leave your options open, is al . You\u2019re getting al wrapped up in this guy you barely know. You might miss something that\u2019s right under your nose.\u201d</p><p>I knew what he meant, but I refused to gratify it with a reply. I plugged in my laptop, watching the screen as it came to life. \u201cWhat time are you heading over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you do,\u201d Ryan shrugged, sprawling out on Beth\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cI probably won\u2019t leave until seven thirty,\u201d I said, criss-crossing my legs on the desk chair.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at him in disbelief. \u201cWhat do you plan on doing here for four hours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHanging out with you. It\u2019s my turn,\u201d he sniffed.</p><p>\u201cUgh. You talk like you\u2019re sharing me,\u201d I groaned, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said, utterly naive of any offense.</p><p>\u201cQuit it.\u201d</p><p>Ryan bel owed out a laugh and interlocked his fingers behind his head. I watched him for a moment as he stared at the ceiling. Surely being in Ryan\u2019s position was nothing to be so chipper about, and I was getting impatient for him to get over this ridiculous crush so we could go back to being friends.</p><p>The next four hours passed relatively quickly. Ryan and I caught up on the last week, although I was careful to leave out much of what went on in Jared\u2019s loft. We talked like we used to, and it was refreshing. I had missed him.</p><p>He was right, I did enjoy spending time with him, not less than I did with Jared, but it was exceedingly different. I always felt at ease with Ryan, but the urgency wasn\u2019t there. I didn\u2019t feel like the oxygen was missing from the room when he wasn\u2019t in it. Ryan was always in the back of my mind, and it hurt me when he was hurting, but he was wrong. There were more differences than just playing house.</p><p>We were the last ones to arrive at the Rock. Ryan wanted to grab something to eat on the way, so our detour cost us the prime seats.</p><p>Beth smiled at me when we walked in. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey yourself. Where were you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAt Chad\u2019s,\u201d she smiled. I looked to Chad, who appeared very frustrated with his laptop.</p><p>Ryan and I brought a stack of notes to occupy our time, so we went right to work. After an hour, I decided to take a break and cal Jared.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jared answered in a tender tone, picking up on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cI just thought I\u2019d cal and see how you\u2019re doing. Did you want me to bring you some coffee or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart. Just pretend I\u2019m not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t like the idea of you having to sit outside in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what I do, remember? I\u2019m ready to see you, though,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I cringed at how utterly ignoble my words sounded. I was glad that he could sense differently.</p><p>I walked back to the group and Ryan grimaced.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d I warned.</p><p>Ryan shook his head and returned to his book. He fidgeted in his seat for awhile, and then final y heaved a big sigh. \u201cAre you staying there again tonight?\u201d he blurted out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some more of your business,\u201d I said, distracted by a particularly tricky equation.</p><p>\u201cI thought he said you had dinner plans. Since you missed dinner, I thought maybe you\u2019d just stay here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStil none of your business,\u201d I murmured, scanning the words on the pages. Any divulging of my sleeping arrangements would only end in another argument that I wasn\u2019t in the mood for.</p><p>Beginning the third subject, I looked up at the clock.</p><p>\u201cIs that clock right?\u201d I asked the group. Everyone looked in unison at the large round clock on the wal , and then peered at their watches or cel phones. In different tones, they al murmured confirmations.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ryan asked, stretching as he watched me shove my things into my bag.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>I pul ed out my phone and pressed the speed dial for Jared\u2019s cel . He didn\u2019t answer, so I rushed out the door. I stood there a moment, looking around, and then hurried down the stairs, banging the rol ers of my bag against every step. The Escalade wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>I tried not to panic, convincing myself that he was just in a wel secluded spot. After ten minutes, I walked down the sidewalk a little over a block each way. My search was futile. Jared wouldn\u2019t let me walk around in the dark; he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>My bag barely touched the ground as I sprinted across campus, glad that Claire had parked my car in the middle lot to be spiteful. I thought of al the possibilities for his sudden disappearance, but my mind kept returning to the hel I\u2019d gone through just a week before. Jared didn\u2019t have a history of warning me that he was going to end our relationship.</p><p>By the time I reached my car my lungs were frozen and aching. I fumbled with my keys and ripped the door open, heaving my bag to the passenger side. The tires squealed as I pul ed out into the street, cursing every stoplight that cost me precious time.</p><p>I pul ed up to Jared\u2019s loft and took a deep breath. His Escalade wasn\u2019t parked in front, but I tried the door, anyway. I kept my eyes on the doorknob as I waited, wil ing it to twist open. Dogs barked down the dark street and I suddenly felt uneasy. Until that moment, I hadn\u2019t realized how safe I felt with Jared; the al ey had never seemed frightening before.</p><p>I walked back to the Beemer, defeated. He would have cal ed if it was anything other than the worst scenario. He had either broken his promise not to leave me, or he was in danger. After twenty minutes and stil no cal from Jared, my lungs began to feel less satisfied with every breath and my eyes wel ed over with tears.</p><p>A knock resounded on my window and I jumped. Claire\u2019s flawless face was on the other side.</p><p>She rol ed her eyes. \u201cOh, stop. Something came up. I\u2019m here to let you in.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her for a moment, dumbfounded. Her explanation didn\u2019t make sense, but the knowledge that he had sent her to let me in the loft extinguished half of my fears.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d I asked, fol owing her down the al ey.</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah. You worry too much,\u201d she said, her annoyed expression obvious even in the dark.</p><p>She led me up the iron stairs of the entry way, and then opened the door to let me inside. I ran up the stairs to the loft and col apsed into the bed. An overwhelming feeling of relief tore through me, and I did my best to weep quietly to avoid further ridicule from Claire.</p><p>I dried my eyes as I heard her light footsteps climb the stairs and stop beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she deadpanned, chomping on a wad of gum too big for her petite mouth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a shower?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I ignored her.</p><p>Claire sighed and sat down on Jared\u2019s side of the bed.</p><p>I froze for a moment, bracing for an obnoxious comment from her. She sat quietly.</p><p>I shot a confused glance her way. \u201cW...What are you doing?\u201d I asked, sniffing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to sit with you,\u201d she said, sounding bored.</p><p>\u201cSit with me? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just am. Go take a shower, wil you? You\u2019re a mess.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed again and ambled to the shower, too baffled to argue. Claire never missed an opportunity to make me feel like an idiot, but surely she could understand my tears. I hurried through my nightly routine, anxious that every noise outside the bathroom was Jared returning home.</p><p>When I finished, Claire was downstairs. I slipped on one of Jared\u2019s t-shirts. It was a poor substitute, but it would have to do until he came home.</p><p>With impeccable timing, she returned as I slipped under the covers.</p><p>She looked away from me, suddenly uncomfortable. \u201cThat\u2019s Jared\u2019s favorite shirt.\u201d</p><p>I looked down and noticed the dead giveaway: It was ratty and worn. The dark grey heather cotton was thin, and I smiled as I made out the faded words across the front; it was from a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert four years ago. I looked up at Claire who showed signs of a slight grin.</p><p>\u201cMy dad took him to that concert,\u201d she mused, sitting on the bed beside me.</p><p>\u201cYou look like him,\u201d I said. Gabe had light blonde hair as wel , and Claire had inherited his ice blue eyes.</p><p>Those eyes instantly glazed over with anger. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about him. You...,\u201d she stopped herself, \u201cjust go to sleep, Nina.\u201d</p><p>Fal ing asleep with Claire sitting over me like a prison guard wasn\u2019t likely, so I turned my back to her, focusing on Jared. I wondered what it was that he was doing, and wondered why he hadn\u2019t cal ed. I opened my mouth to ask Claire, but given her mood I thought better of it.</p><p>The clock switched from P.M. to A.M. as the numbers changed to midnight. Jared stil hadn\u2019t cal ed, and I was almost worried enough to ask Claire to cal him. At that moment, Claire stood up and walked over to the railing. The outside door slammed, footsteps echoed up the iron steps, and then the front door opened and closed quietly. Claire\u2019s eyes fol owed the footsteps up the stairs until Jared came into view.</p><p>The sight of him shocked me. His face was smudged with dirt and blood, along with his shirt, jacket and jeans. His knuckles were swol en and bloody. I noticed that on a few of them the hide had ripped away and hung by just a few centimeters of skin.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I said, ripping the covers off to run to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he said, holding me away. \u201cI\u2019m dirty. Let me jump in the shower.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Claire retreated downstairs.</p><p>I paced the room, chewing on my nails until he reappeared. He was dressed and clean shaven, the only remnants of his earlier disheveled appearance was his already healing knuckles.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked in firm tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there. Something came up,\u201d he said, eyeing my bandage free hand.</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d I said, crossing my arms. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Dawson stopped by The Rock to pay you a visit. I had to act quickly.\u201d He walked by me to pul the first aid kit from under the bed.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dawson?\u201d I asked, shocked.</p><p>\u201cHe was armed, and he also had...,\u201d Jared\u2019s jaw tensed, \u201che had paraphernalia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of paraphernalia?\u201d I said, sitting on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThe kind you use to tie someone up and torture them. He was planning on getting that package tonight.\u201d</p><p>I swal owed loudly. If Jared hadn\u2019t been there to protect me, I didn\u2019t want to think where I would be.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up when he spoke, \u201cHe won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou....\u201d</p><p>I watched as he worked silently, dabbing antibiotic ointment across my hand. The cut was now the beginning of a bright pink scar, the infection had dissipated days ago.</p><p>After a long pause Jared answered me. \u201cI didn\u2019t kil him. Not that I didn\u2019t have to exercise restraint. He gave up information, but not nearly enough. I let my emotions get in the way,\u201d he sighed and shook his head, \u201che was never conscious long enough to tel me everything I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tortured him,\u201d I said, watching Jared fasten the last piece of tape on the flawlessly wrapped gauze. I braced for his answer; the Jared I knew couldn\u2019t be capable of the horror that I imagined.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to snap his spine and throw him in the Narragansett to drown, Nina. He\u2019s lucky he ended up with his life.\u201d</p><p>His job was to protect me by any means necessary; I just hadn\u2019t stopped to think what that would be. \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l discuss it tomorrow. You need to rest,\u201d he whispered. He placed me gingerly on the bed, kissing the palm of my bandaged hand.</p><p>When he tried to pul away, I squeezed his fingers with mine. \u201cI was worried. I drove here prepared to beg you back.\u201d</p><p>He laughed once. \u201cIn what alternate universe would you ever have to beg me back?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had to rip out two microphones and nearly freeze to death in the pouring rain to get you back before. Driving to your apartment and knocking on your door isn\u2019t the most extreme measure I\u2019ve taken.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression was pained. \u201cI noticed your car out front. I\u2019m sorry I had to leave without an explanation. I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was better than the alternative,\u201d I said, my grin fading as I considered the possibilities.</p><p>Jared touched the side of my face, and then left me to walk toward the stairs. I sat up to protest, but Jared paused. \u201cI\u2019l be right back,\u201d he assured me.</p> <p>Relaxing against the bed, I listened to his footsteps jog down the steps, silence when he reached the couch, and in the next moment climb the stairs again.</p><p>He sat beside me and held a smal red box in the palm of his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited. It\u2019s nothing major.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and took the box from his hands, pul ing on the smal silver loop on the top. I looked at him, raising my eyebrows in surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to make up for tonight. So? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Hanging from the lid was a shiny silver key.</p> <p>\u201cTo the loft,\u201d he explained. \u201cNext time something comes up, you won\u2019t have to wait outside in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you have time to do this?\u201d I asked, stil processing the shiny object spinning around from a thin red ribbon.</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cI had it made a few days ago. I\u2019ve been meaning to give it to you, but you haven\u2019t needed it until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a key?\u201d My eyebrows lifted in disbelief.</p><p>Jared nodded and then his brows pul ed together. \u201cI promised you I would never leave you. I meant it. If something like this happens again, come here. Wait for me.\u201d He touched his hand gently to my cheek. \u201cI\u2019l earn your trust back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d I said, mimicking his expression.</p> <p>Jared leaned over and pressed his lips to mine. \u201cAnd I trust you. Nice work in your room today.\u201d</p><p>I cringed. \u201cYou heard that, did you?\u201d</p><p>Jared chuckled. \u201cAl of it. I think it\u2019s going to take me by surprise every time I hear you say my name in perfunctory conversation. It\u2019s a good thing Ryan....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Ryan what?\u201d I asked, leaning over to bring his eyes to mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I have patience,\u201d Jared said, looking everywhere but my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of patience, but that\u2019s not what you were going to say.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes bounced from me to the floor to other things in the room, uncomfortable with where the conversation was headed. \u201cIt has to do with what I told you we would discuss later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s training has to do with Ryan?\u201d</p> <p>Jared sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to wait now, are you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly, not sure what to expect. The two names seemed to be on different sides of the universe.</p><p>Jared leaned his head down, looking at me from under his eyebrows. \u201cThe night at the pub, when you first met Claire, Ryan put his hands on me.\u201d I nodded and Jared continued, \u201cWhen she grabbed his hand, she felt something. She felt his pain.\u201d Jared patiently waited for me to comprehend.</p><p>\u201cRyan is Claire\u2019s Taleh?\u201d I whispered, knowing she could hear me, anyway. I couldn\u2019t believe it, and at the same time I felt excited, like I\u2019d just heard a juicy bit of gossip. \u201cBut, when we were mugged...,\u201d Claire was talented, even among her kind. She wouldn\u2019t have let Ryan be hurt in that way.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the situation went farther than I normal y al ow. Claire had them targeted. It would have just taken a second to take them out, but when Ryan jumped in, Claire couldn\u2019t get a clear shot. She couldn\u2019t risk it. That\u2019s when I decided to intercede.\u201d Jared\u2019s eyes began to cloud over. The worst was coming.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want to tel me?\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned over and kissed me. It was urgent and deep, the way he kissed me before I left him to speak with my mother; as if he were kissing me goodbye forever.</p><p>He reluctantly pul ed away to look at me. \u201cIt was for purely selfish reasons. I wanted to wait so you and I could...so you could get to know me better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when I was explaining the Taleh, you mentioned how convenient it was that Gabe protected Jack, and I protected you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, you said that angel groups tend to stay in families or those that are connected somehow.\u201d Now that he\u2019d brought it to my attention, it made more sense. \u201cClaire is Ryan\u2019s protector because he\u2019s a friend?\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed and shifted nervously beside me. \u201cClaire being Ryan\u2019s protector means he is supposed to be in your life. Permanently.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and shook my head. \u201cSo what are you saying? That Ryan\u2019s going to be family somehow?\u201d Jared waited and my eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m supposed to marry him? Oh, c\u2019mon! That\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the only explanation,\u201d Jared said, his expression grave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious. There\u2019s no way for you to know that. It could be any number of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that if you didn\u2019t get to know me first, then you\u2019d want to be with him. He is supposed to be your husband one of these days. I would understand why, armed with that knowledge, you might feel differently. And he\u2019s a good friend to you. And he\u2019s...persistent,\u201d Jared said, his face twisting into an annoyed expression.</p><p>I held his face in my hands and looked directly into his eyes. \u201cQuit it. I\u2019m in love with you, Jared. There is no me without you.\u201d</p><p>He watched me for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I kept it from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a single thing to worry about. I promise,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared switched off the lamp and crawled over to his side, pul ing me to him.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I said, settling into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to go back to the way it was when my hand heals. I could probably start staying at Andrews this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave,\u201d Jared whispered in the dim light.</p><p>I buried my head into his chest. I had never wanted anything more, but Ryan\u2019s words about moving too fast came to the forefront of my mind.</p><p>\u201cI would love that...someday,\u201d I said, hoping to preserve his feelings.</p><p>\u201cSomeday,\u201d he repeated, sighing. \u201cI understand. It\u2019s too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe just a little,\u201d I smiled, kissing his chest.</p><p>The next morning, I woke up in Jared\u2019s arms. He was awake, patiently holding me against him. My smile faded when I realized it would be our last morning together for awhile.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jared asked, sensing my disappointment.</p><p>I sucked in a deep, disheartening breath. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday,\u201d I breathed. \u201cI\u2019m going back to Andrews tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a key. You can use it whenever you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said, looking up at him with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s comforting.\u201d</p><p>Jared brushed my bangs from my face. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss seeing you like this in the morning...especial y in my shirt. It would have had a whole new significance had I known that one day you would be lying in my arms with it on. An interesting choice, I might add. That\u2019s my favorite one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cTake it with you. I want you to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s your favorite shirt!\u201d I argued, pul ing away to look at him.</p><p>\u201cMy mornings won\u2019t be quite as disappointing from now on if I know you\u2019re waking up in that shirt,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cGood point. I\u2019m taking it. But it\u2019s only on loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that one of these days it wil be a permanent fixture in my closet again. You can\u2019t live in Andrews forever.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip and pressed my cheek against his bare chest. It seemed a little sil y, lying here with him, knowing we both would rather I just stay. But I would never hear the end of it from my friends, and my mother would be an entirely different set of problems.</p><p>\u201cI could stay here on the weekends,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou wil ?\u201d he asked, his eyes brightening.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t want to impose.\u201d</p><p>Jared kissed me until I could feel a tingling in my toes. Just as I needed to take a breath, he pul ed away. \u201cI would have everything you own here by the time you finished your classes today if you\u2019d let me. You staying here on weekends is absolutely okay.\u201d</p><p>A smile spanned the width of my face and I wrapped my arms around his neck. When he said things like that, it was hard for me to remember why I couldn\u2019t just give in to what he wanted\u2014to what I wanted. I immediately felt better knowing that I had a few more days with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late. I\u2019l make coffee,\u201d he said, jogging downstairs.</p><p>I hurried through my shower and Jared handed me a pink travel mug as I put my coat on. I raised an eyebrow at the color and then looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Claire\u2019s,\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cUm, I thought I would take my car today. Do you mind picking me up, later?\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t hide his disappointment. \u201cSure. Just give me a cal when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>I leaned up on my toes to kiss him. \u201cOkay. I\u2019l see you later.\u201d</p><p>The professor began lecture just as I slid into my seat. Kim leaned over to whisper in my ear.</p><p>\u201cBeth and I are going for coffee after class. You coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019l drive,\u201d I offered.</p><p>I felt like I hadn\u2019t spent enough time with Kim and Beth lately. An afternoon at the caf\u00e9 would give us time to catch up. At least I would get caught up on their lives; my news included almost getting kidnapped and tortured, and my boyfriend nearly beating the man to death who had tried.</p><p>The three of us huddled at the table of the coffee shop, waiting to thaw. The temperature had dropped significantly after lunch, and the wind was brutal. I was glad that I would be lying on a beach somewhere in just over a week.</p><p>I sipped my coffee as Beth chattered about Chad. Things between them were progressing, and she mentioned she wasn\u2019t homesick for the first time since she\u2019d come to Brown. She was even considering getting an apartment in the summer instead of returning to Oklahoma.</p><p>I tried to concentrate on the conversation, but I found myself focusing on the new information Jared had forced out of Dawson. I wanted to know what it was that Jared was keeping from me; it couldn\u2019t be good news.</p><p>\u201cNigh. Nigh! Where are you? You look like you\u2019re a mil ion miles away,\u201d Kim said. She and Beth were both staring at me with matching expressions.</p><p>\u201cUgh, I\u2019m sorry. I just have a lot going on,\u201d I said, blinking.</p><p>Beth\u2019s cel phone hummed. By her tone I knew that it was Chad. Apparently he was out and about, and she invited him to join us.</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s okay,\u201d Beth said to us after disconnecting the line.</p><p>Kim shrugged. \u201cFine with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan is with him,\u201d Beth added, eyeing me.</p><p>I made sure my face was smooth. I hadn\u2019t seen Ryan since Jared had told me that Ryan and I were meant to be together. I wasn\u2019t sure how to act around him with that knowledge.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the door chimed as Chad and Ryan strol ed through it. They were both in gym clothes, sweaty and tired.</p><p>Ryan had his white hat pul ed down over his eyes and didn\u2019t speak when he sat across from me at the table. He leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you two been up to?\u201d Beth asked, standing up to sit on Chad\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cWe just finished a basketbal game. We lost,\u201d Chad said in an embittered tone.</p><p>\u201cThey cheated. Repeatedly,\u201d Ryan chuckled, only his smile visible.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t handle prison rules?\u201d Kim elbowed him, making him sway for a moment.</p><p>Ryan pul ed his hat up and over to the side, his eyes final y in view. \u201cI can handle prison rules, it\u2019s the cheating when there is supposed to be rules that bothers me. I lost twenty bucks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Beth said, laughing. \u201cDid you lose money, Baby?\u201d Chad pursed his lips and nodded, stil brooding. \u201cAw!\u201d she said, rubbing his back.</p><p>We sat at the table, discussing the game. Our laughter saturated the room, causing the other patrons to stare. After a while, Ryan leaned over and pul ed my chair closer to him, the legs grating against the floor. He stretched his arm around the back of my chair and smiled, flashing the deep dimple in his cheek.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s destiny to be my future husband popped into my head, and a strange ache overwhelmed me. Ryan\u2019s future was forever changed the second Jared sat on that bench. I would never take that moment back, but I cared about Ryan. I wanted him to be happy, and that was impossible if I stayed in the picture. One of these days I would have to remove myself completely from his life, and because of that, either Claire or Jared would be separated from their family.</p><p>Ryan gripped my shoulder and pul ed me to his side. \u201cHey. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d I said, distracted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been like that the whole time she\u2019s been here,\u201d Kim complained.</p><p>Ryan hugged me to him again and I turned, throwing my arms around him. He tensed, obviously not expecting my sudden display of affection. After his initial shock wore off, he rested his chin on my shoulder and enveloped me in his arms.</p><p>He puffed a short laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Nigh?\u201d he whispered into my neck.</p><p>I shook my head. I couldn\u2019t tel him, and even if I did, I didn\u2019t want him to know.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re, uh...we\u2019re going to take off,\u201d Chad said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it al right if I catch a ride with you?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>I pul ed away from Ryan and looked up at my friends. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday. Did you want to go out later?\u201d</p><p>Kim shot a look at Ryan and then back at me. \u201cI already have plans. Tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019l catch a ride with Nina,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Beth and I both looked at Chad, who shrugged. \u201cCool. See ya.\u201d He lifted his hand to wave and they filed out of the coffee shop.</p><p>I looked at Ryan, embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s official. I\u2019m a freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a freak. Chad was planning on taking Beth back with him, anyway. They have dinner plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cleared the table in less than two minutes. I\u2019m a freak.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to grab some dinner?\u201d</p><p>I tried to think of a delicate way to turn him down, but he spoke before anything came to mind.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l just grab something quick...go through a drive thru. Me and Josh are going to grab a few beers later, anyway,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah, okay,\u201d I said, standing up.</p><p>We sat in the parking lot closest to Andrews devouring our fast food. The slogan game had kept us entertained since we left the coffee shop. Ryan countered my feeble attempts to stump him so quickly that I couldn\u2019t help but double over with laughter.</p><p>\u201cHave you been practicing?\u201d I giggled, exhausted from laughing so hard.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie. I\u2019ve had a lot of time on my hands, waiting to heal,\u201d he chuckled, throwing up a piece of chicken and catching it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably going to get some laundry together, take it over to Jared\u2019s,\u201d I said without thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying over there again? I thought you said you weren\u2019t moving in,\u201d he said, this time without his usual attitude.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I snapped, waiting for him to come back with something spiteful.</p><p>Ryan sighed and took my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue about it anymore, Nigh. I\u2019ve said everything I needed to say on the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want us to fight, either. I want us to be able to hang out and be friends like we used to. I miss you,\u201d I said, suddenly hopeful that we could get beyond al of the infatuation nonsense.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too. I\u2019l quit being a jerk,\u201d he said, brushing my bangs out of my eyes. \u201cWhen you hugged me tonight, I realized how ridiculous I\u2019ve been. I don\u2019t want to lose you, Nina. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re with him, or me, or anyone else. What matters is that we\u2019re friends, and that you can count on me being here when you need me.\u201d</p> <p>I pul ed in a shal ow breath through my nose, trying to keep my eyes from glossing over with tears. He didn\u2019t know that we would have to lose each other if he wanted to be happy. I just smiled and nodded my head, and Ryan hugged me once more.</p><p>\u201cTruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruce,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>He walked to his dormitory and I headed to Andrews, feeling morose. I pul ed out my cel phone and cal ed Jared, who picked up on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he answered, sounding a bit sad himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to grab a few things from my room and then I\u2019l be ready.\u201d</p><p>As I rounded the corner, Jared came into view, his cel phone to his ear. He pul ed up one corner of his mouth into a contrived half-smile. I put my cel phone away and wrapped my arms around him, burying my face in his chest. He could sense my feelings for Ryan, and I was ashamed for feeling the way I did. It wasn\u2019t fair to either of them.</p><p>An awkward silence festered in the Escalade until we pul ed up to the curb in front of his apartment.</p><p>\u201cNina...,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I interrupted him. I wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to say, but I didn\u2019t want to waste time discussing my feelings for Ryan. Jared felt he was getting in the way of fate, but I knew what I wanted. There would be no compromise.</p><p>We walked hand in hand to the loft, and I could feel the worry radiating from him. I hung my coat on the rack and immediately went to the kitchen, praying there were dishes to be done or to put away; anything to keep me busy.</p><p>Jared went to his extravagant stereo system and tinkered with the multitude of buttons. While I put away dishes in various cabinets, a familiar song permeated the room. I felt Jared\u2019s arms surround me, the heat of his skin sinking into my back. His cheek touched mine as he pul ed me into his chest, and I closed my eyes when he whispered into my ear.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize this song?\u201d</p><p>I simply nodded, listening to the music. It was the song we danced to at the pub. I remembered that moment as if it were just hours before, and yet it felt like a lifetime ago.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cal ed \u2018Little Heaven\u2019.\u201d His lips peppered my neck with soft, tiny kisses, working his way up to my ear.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Jared turned me slowly to face him and I watched the clouds rol in, darkening his eyes. His jaw tensed as he scanned my face.</p><p>\u201cI could step aside, Nina. I could step aside and let you be with who you\u2019re supposed to be with. If I was any less selfish...I would. But even after al of my stupid mistakes, I stil think I can make you happy.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s what you want, I\u2019l step aside,\u201d he shook his head, \u201cbut if it\u2019s not...I\u2019l fight fate. I\u2019l fight Heaven, and Hel , and everything in between to keep you.\u201d</p><p>I stood there, stunned. Anything I said would pale in comparison. The storms in his eyes raged stronger than I\u2019d ever seen them.</p><p>\u201cJared...,\u201d I struggled with what I wanted to say. Jared swal owed, sensing the turmoil within me. I shook my head and he let go of my waist, bracing himself for my next words. But there would be none.</p><p>I inched up on the bal s of my feet and paused. My eyes moved from his eyes to his mouth. Jared stood motionless, waiting for judgment.</p><p>I pressed my lips to his, and he cautiously kissed me back. My hands held each side of his face, and I worked my lips against his, sliding my fingers through the back of his hair. Jared\u2019s hands returned to my waist as the kiss intensified. My lips parted and he pul ed me to him without hesitation.</p><p>His doubt melted away, he knew my decision.</p><p>Against his body I let out an involuntary moan, causing a chain reaction. Almost simultaneously, I lifted Jared\u2019s shirt as he finished the task by yanking it over his head, my knee inched up and Jared firmly grabbed it, pul ing it higher up his side, and then he eagerly lifted me on top of the counter.</p><p>I wrapped my legs around him, digging my fingers into the bare flesh of his back to draw him closer. His hands gripped my thighs, impatiently pul ing me to the edge of the counter. Jared\u2019s lips were urgent, but in a new way. His wasn\u2019t the kiss that he used to tel me he loved me, or to tel me goodbye. He was giving in.</p><p>Jared lifted my sweater over my head and I let out a satisfied sigh when he pressed his bare chest against mine. I pressed my lips harder against his; we stil weren\u2019t close enough. My breath grew ragged and uneven as he impatiently pul ed me from the counter and walked across the room\u2014 my legs stil wrapped around him\u2014to climb the stairs. As he held me, he never took his lips from mine.</p><p>With one hand on my back, and the other on the mattress, he gently lowered me to his bed. His lips caressed every inch of my neck, and my body shivered in anticipation. I slid my hand down the perfect ripples of his chest and stomach, and pul ed his belt free of the loops, fumbling with the buckle. A low moan emanated from his lips when I final y unfastened it and his mouth readily returned to mine.</p><p>He pul ed away with a quick jerk, his eyes unfocused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, pushing myself up on my elbows.</p><p>His jaw tensed and he closed his eyes in frustration. \u201cClaire.\u201d</p><p>In the next moment, Claire unlocked the door and opened it without knocking. Jared stood at the top of the stairs and glared down at his sister.</p><p>\u201cBusy?\u201d Claire asked.</p><p>I covered my mouth to stifle a laugh, thinking of the view from Claire\u2019s perspective. It wouldn\u2019t take much for her to imagine what we\u2019d been up to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take that key back if you don\u2019t start cal ing ahead of time,\u201d Jared growled.</p><p>\u201cYou say that as if I can\u2019t pick your lock in three seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Claire,\u201d Jared said so quietly that I barely heard him.</p><p>Wel , I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, not sounding sorry at al . \u201cBex left for training an hour ago and mom is al weepy. Ryan is in bed asleep and lucky me, my Taleh doesn\u2019t have half the police force and various criminals after him.\u201d</p><p>Jared turned to face me and his expression morphed from anger to an apologetic expression.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here for the night,\u201d he explained, going to his closet and pul ing a t-shirt off the hanger. He seemed to have thought better of it, putting the shirt back and walking across the room to search through my suitcase for a pair of pajamas.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019l be able to control myself if you put one of my t-shirts on,\u201d he said quietly, handing me the pajamas. I smiled at him, amused.</p><p>Claire groaned in disgust downstairs. \u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>Clothes shot up and over the railing, landing at Jared\u2019s feet. It was the shirts we had left behind on the kitchen floor. The refrigerator door opened, and the sounds of Claire rummaging for food made Jared rol his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a quick shower,\u201d he said, rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cA cold one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, turning toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI could keep you company.\u201d</p><p>Jared froze in mid-step, pausing for just a moment before closing the bathroom door behind him.</p><p>I changed while he was in the shower, feeling a bit guilty for teasing him. I understood his frustration al too wel . I leaned back on the bed, chewing on my thumb nail and smiling at what had almost happened.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The Hunt</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be good,\u201d I promised.</p><p>Jared came out of the bathroom in only a pair of shorts. He stood several feet from me, hesitating to come to bed. \u201cMaybe you should take a cold shower, too. I don\u2019t think it I can concentrate with you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAroused?\u201d I said, quickly pressing my lips together to stifle a laugh.</p><p>His mouth fel open in shock and I cackled, too pleased with the reaction to help myself.</p><p>Jared smiled and nodded, complaisant to my playful badgering. He crawled into bed and propped his head up with his hand.</p><p>I sat against the headboard and sighed. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t serious, right? About the half-the-police-force thing?\u201d</p><p>His face fel . \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you,\u201d he said, sliding his fingers between mine.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they after me?\u201d</p><p>Jared cursed in Spanish under his breath resulting in Claire giggling from somewhere downstairs.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not after you, sweetheart. They\u2019re after something of Jack\u2019s. They just think you know where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re after the Port of Providence file?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDawson said they want to dispose of the evidence Jack compiled that proves they\u2019re dirty, but they\u2019re looking for something else\u2014something that\u2019s contained within the file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we go to my parents\u2019 house, figure it out and get rid of it. Toss it off of a bridge or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t help us, Nina,\u201d Jared said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I grimaced.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, it was worth going after Jack Grey. No one does that unless it\u2019s...it\u2019s something big, Nina. Something we don\u2019t want to be caught without.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I was frustrated with the circles we seemed to be talking in.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t tel you this.\u201d He pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and index finger.</p><p>\u201cDo it, anyway,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>A heavy expression settled on his face. \u201cJack didn\u2019t die from the car accident. He died of complications from a gunshot wound to the chest.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for my brain to wrap around what he\u2019d said, but once I processed the words, I was instantly angry. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jared put his hand on mine. \u201cGabe did everything in his power to try to save him, but Jack was in over his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Gabe was indestructible. Wasn\u2019t he one-hundred percent angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey threatened the only thing more important to him than Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore important than his own life?\u201d I asked, skeptical.</p><p>Jared nodded; the severity in his face was a bit frightening. \u201cMy mother. They were in my home the day Jack was shot. Claire and I had taken Bex to the airport, so Gabe had no choice but to leave him. My father knew what would happen if he left Jack alone, but his life meant nothing without my mother. Jack was shot en route to his office downtown. He did crash into a guard rail, but it was the bul et that led to his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying the men that want this package murdered my father?\u201d Jared confirmed with a nod and I felt heat burn from every pore in my face. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it is. We\u2019re getting rid of it. They wil never get their hands on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina, I know you\u2019re upset, but we need to think about this. They want something in that file so badly they went up against Jack and my father, and they knew what Gabe was capable of. I\u2019d rather have it in our possession so we have something to barter with if need be.\u201d</p><p>Tears fil ed my eyes and Jared wrapped his arms around me. I mourned once again for my father. I kept losing him over and over again, with one horrible truth after another.</p><p>I cried myself asleep, and when I awoke, Jared comforted me once again when the news from the night before replayed in my memory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need to do something. I can\u2019t just sit here,\u201d I said, rushing over to my suitcase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to figure this out, Nina. Just give me a day or two to decide our next move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait another second,\u201d I said, my mind racing to form a plan. When the idea struck, I paused. \u201cI\u2019m going back to my parents\u2019. The answers are there.\u201d I yanked a t-shirt over my head and the first pair of jeans I touched.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go now,\u201d he argued.</p> <p>\u201cYes we do,\u201d I said, pul ing on my shoes while hopping to the stairs.</p><p>Jared scrambled from the bed. The hangers in his closet clanged against each other, and within seconds he was behind me, ful y dressed. \u201cNot exactly how I wanted to spend the weekend,\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. Let\u2019s go. Vaminos!\u201d I said, rushing him out the door.</p><p>In my parents\u2019 home, Jared fol owed me up the stairs to Jack\u2019s office. He watched me locate the keys to Cynthia\u2019s safe, fol owed me to her study, and then pul ed the plant to the floor without effort. I used the key to gain access to the papers and files inside, placing them in somewhat organized piles.</p><p>For two hours we searched the documents, separating what we thought would be useful. One photo caught my eye. I held it out in front of me, staring at it, hoping I would recognize what it was that drew me in.</p> <p>\u201cHe looks familiar to you?\u201d Jared prompted.</p><p>\u201cSomething about his eyes...I can\u2019t put my finger on it.\u201d</p><p>Jared pul ed a black wal et from his jacket pocket and tossed it into my lap; it was the one he had taken the night Ryan was stabbed. I took a closer look at the metal object embedded into the black leather. It was a badge.</p><p>I gasped, pointing at the picture. \u201cThis is the man that wanted my ring. This is Grahm.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey were al cops?\u201d I said, shaking my head in disbelief. \u201cBut why would they...?\u201d My eyes wandered to my hand.</p> <p>Jared stared at it as wel . \u201cThe ring must be the key to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d I whispered. I looked at the papers for a moment and then rifled through them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a receipt in here for the purchase of my ring. I didn\u2019t think about it before, but there has to be a connection,\u201d I said, impatient with the endless stacks. \u201cWhy else would it be here with important business documents?\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened with excitement when I found the thin carbon copy. Jared leaned over my shoulder to take a look for himself.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an engraving charge,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIs your ring engraved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t...Jack never said anything, I\u2019ve never noticed,\u201d I said, looking at my ring.</p><p>Slowly pul ing it off my finger, I held it up, rotated it, and narrowed my eyes, looking for any words. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing,\u201d</p> <p>Jared held out his hand, and I handed it to him. My finger felt naked in its absence. Jared lifted it up, looked at it from every angle, and then returned it to my finger.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing,\u201d he confirmed. He eyed the receipt once more. \u201cI say we go to the designer. Maybe they have a copy of this receipt.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, prompting Jared to gather the information and return it to the safe.</p><p>Jared and I drove to the address on the receipt, and I nervously twisted the ring around my finger as we pul ed to a stop beside the curb. At first glance it appeared to be a typical jewelry store, not the underground, surreptitious establishment I had expected.</p><p>The bel on the door announced our arrival and a short, pudgy, elderly man with round glasses greeted us. Jared took my hand as we walked toward the glass display cases the man stood behind.</p><p>\u201cGood morning. I am Vincent! You like diamonds? Sapphires? Rubies? Emeralds? Semi-precious stones? I have them al ,\u201d he gushed with a thick accent.</p><p>Jared squeezed my hand and introduced himself. \u201cThis is Nina...I\u2019m Jared.\u201d</p><p>Vincent didn\u2019t skip a beat. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help you with anything you need.\u201d He paused to look at our hands intertwined and smiled. \u201cCould I interest you in our exquisite line of engagement diamonds? I designed most of these,\u201d he said, pointing out a long row of extravagant rings. \u201cI can design one customary, if you wish.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked at me with a soft expression, and then reluctantly turned his attention back to Vincent. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Vincent smiled at me, and I felt the blood rise to the surface of my cheeks. \u201cAh, wel , then. Another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the owner?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>Vincent chuckled, patting his protruding bel y. \u201cI am. Thirty-six years, now.\u201d</p><p>Jared raised my hand, resting it on the surface of the glass encasement. \u201cDo you recognize this ring?\u201d</p><p>Vincent leaned down to get a better look. \u201cYes...yes...,\u201d he hummed, elongating the words. \u201cIt has been awhile, has it not?\u201d he asked, looking to me.</p><p>\u201cMy father purchased this from you three years ago,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>Vincent lifted my hand and angled it several different ways, proudly watching it sparkle in the bright lights above.</p><p>\u201cYour father was a man of vision,\u201d he said, smiling in approval.</p><p>Jared slid the receipt in front of Vincent. \u201cThis paper includes an engraving fee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. I remember,\u201d he said, pinching his bottom lip with his thumb and forefinger. \u201cI don\u2019t ask questions, you know. I just make the customer happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...there is no engraving on the ring,\u201d I said.</p><p>He bel owed out a cheerful laugh. \u201cThere is, kisa. But it\u2019s hidden, you see.\u201d Vincent opened his hand, prompting me to give him my ring.</p><p>I sighed and looked to Jared, who offered a comforting smile. He took my hand and slowly pul ed the ring off of my finger. Once Jared placed it in his hand, Vincent turned the ring upside down.</p><p>\u201cHe had it marked into the pavilion of the stone. The underbel y,\u201d he explained, \u201cvery tiny...I had to send it away to a gentleman I know with a laser. I don\u2019t have one of those here, of course,\u201d he chuckled, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThe engraving order has been covered. Do you have the original receipt?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I would have total in my books, only. If I remember correctly, it was letters and numbers. Gibberish that only made sense to your father, I assume.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to be too easy. I felt I was in the middle of a cloak and dagger movie, happening upon the perfect clues at the perfect time, watching it come together in front of my eyes.</p><p>Jared tucked my hair behind my ear with an apologetic expression. \u201cVincent?\u201d His eyes were hesitant to leave mine. \u201cCan you remove the stone from the setting?\u201d</p><p>I jerked my ring from Vincent\u2019s open hand. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Jared pul ed me out of ear shot. \u201cNina, if you want to see what Jack had put on this ring\u2014and what Grahm wanted\u2014we have to remove it from the setting to read it. He can reset it as if it were never touched.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together in frustration. We would have to see what was etched into the stone to make progress, and there was only one way to do it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other way?\u201d I asked, knowing the answer.</p><p>Jared shook his head and opened his hand. I placed my ring in his palm and chewed on my lip.</p><p>\u201cCan you do it?\u201d he asked, setting the ring on the glass.</p><p>Vincent\u2019s eyes moved from Jared to me, unsure of how to proceed. \u201cI could remove the stone, but there is no guarantee we wil be able to read what is there, you see what I say?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. \u201cRemove the stone.\u201d</p><p>Vincent seemed suddenly disinclined. \u201cIt wil be a few days before I can get to it. Write down your number and I wil cal you when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize you\u2019re busy, forgive me,\u201d Jared said, pul ing out his wal et. He set a smal stack of hundred dol ar bil s on the glass, and Vincent\u2019s eyes widened, jerking his head back up to Jared. \u201cThat is in addition to your fee, of course,\u201d Jared added.</p><p>\u201cYou wait here...I\u2019l be just a moment.\u201d Vincent gestured for us to sit on a short couch by the door, and then hurried to the back.</p><p>We waited together on the couch. A strange calm came over me, and I sighed when Jared began lightly caressing the top of my hand.</p><p>My eyebrows pul ed in and my smile faded. \u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he said, playing with the strands of hair that had escaped my ponytail.</p><p>\u201cVincent cal ed me kisa. It doesn\u2019t mean \u2018stupid\u2019 or anything, does it?\u201d</p><p>Jared burst into laughter. \u201cNo, sweetheart. I would never let anyone insult you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>Jared kissed my forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s Russian. It means kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>The minutes ticked by and I became increasingly anxious. I began pacing, and Jared watched me walk the length of the floor. A door shut behind me, and I flipped around. Vincent cupped the remnants of my ring in his plump hand.</p><p>Jared stood up and joined me at the display case. \u201cDid you find anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Vincent flattened a piece of paper in front of us with letters and numbers scribbled across it. He handed Jared a loupe and held out his hand for Jared to take the stone from his palm. Jared looked through the loupe at the stone, but pul ed it away from his eyes, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything,\u201d he said, holding the peridot in front of him. Jared periodical y looked down to the paper and back at the gem, placing it back into Vincent\u2019s palm.</p><p>\u201cYou could see that without the loupe, eh?\u201d Vincent chuckled. \u201cThese old eyes aren\u2019t what they used to be.\u201d</p><p>Jared took the paper and handed it to me. \u201cWhat he has written is what is inscribed in the stone.\u201d He looked to Vincent, then. \u201cI\u2019l need that reset immediately, please.\u201d</p><p>Vincent nodded and returned to the back, taking the pieces of the ring with him.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I asked, looking down at the paper.</p><p>825 2TR2TL223TR05 \u201cDoes it mean anything to you?\u201d Jared asked, grimacing in thought.</p><p>\u201cEight twenty-five is my birthday...August twenty-fifth, but other than that...no.\u201d</p><p>Within ten minutes, Vincent had returned. I sighed as I slid it back to its rightful place on my finger, looking exactly the same as it did before.</p><p>We returned to Jared\u2019s loft for lunch. I sat on the counter staring at the piece of paper, hoping the answer would spontaneously pop into my mind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to catch fire if you keep staring at it like that,\u201d Jared teased, pushing the stir fry around in the wok.</p><p>\u201cHe put it on something he knew would be safe, the last place anyone would look, that he always knew where it would be....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hid it in plain sight,\u201d Jared nodded. \u201cThe question is how did Grahm figure it out?\u201d</p><p>I scanned the floor in deep thought. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe an old associate of my father\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cJack engraved a code to something that everyone wants and put it on his only daughter\u2019s finger. He wouldn\u2019t risk tel ing anyone about it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed in frustration. \u201cThe eight twenty-five is separate from the other numbers. Think that means something?\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cIt could. It could just be meant to signify your birthday. It could be an area code, or a flight number...some type of location?\u201d</p><p>I thought about the safe in my mother\u2019s office, the files it contained, the photos...I couldn\u2019t make a connection with anything we\u2019d looked over to the number. Shoving myself off the counter, I slammed the paper on the table and walked to the couch, fal ing over the arm onto my back with a frustrated cry.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d Jared said, his voice beside me, \u201cwe\u2019l figure this out. Try not to make yourself sick over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the safe; I\u2019ve already poured over my father\u2019s office and searched al of his cabinets, there\u2019s nothing!\u201d I covered my face with my hands.</p><p>Jared kneeled beside me and pul ed my hands away from my eyes. \u201cWe\u2019l go back tomorrow, look in Jack\u2019s office and take another look at the files in the safe. Why don\u2019t we rent a movie, hang out on the couch...spend some time together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d I said, sitting up. \u201cDid I put Jack\u2019s keys in his drawer? I don\u2019t think I did. What did I do with them?\u201d I asked, patting my pants pockets.</p><p>Jared grinned. \u201cThey\u2019re in my jacket pocket. We can take them back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I sat for a moment, my eyes unfocused, deep in thought.</p><p>Jared touched my shoulder. \u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>I scrambled to the coat rack and shoved my hands in his jacket pockets. \u201cThey\u2019re not here!\u201d</p><p>Jared eyed me warily. \u201cThey\u2019re in the inside pocket. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight twenty-five!\u201d I yanked the ring of keys from his jacket and thumbed through them. When I found what I was looking for, I held it away from the rest, showing it to Jared. \u201cSee? Eight twenty-five!\u201d</p><p>Jared looked at the key and then back at me, his eyes animated. \u201cWhat does it open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, looking at the key, \u201cbut it can\u2019t be a coincidence, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Jared said, his face twisting into a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jared took the keys from me. \u201cI want you to let me take care of this. I\u2019ve humored you. You\u2019re upset about the way Jack died, I get it. But things could go downhil pretty quickly if we find what they\u2019re looking for. I don\u2019t want you anywhere near me when they figure out what we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve humored me?\u201d I asked, insulted. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get in your way, I almost have this figured out, I....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you listen to a thing I\u2019ve said?\u201d he snapped. After a brief moment, Jared closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cI know you need this to be over. You just don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re dealing with, here. I can\u2019t let my emotions get in the way of my job, Nina. I\u2019ve already let this go too far.</p><p>God knows the last thing I want is for you to be angry with me, but you\u2019ve got to let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Nina. It\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d he said firmly.</p> <p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me tel ing you what to do. This is about your safety.\u201d He hugged me to him and I reached for the keys, pul ing them from his grip. I knew that if he hadn\u2019t al owed me to do it, I would never have gotten the keys from his hand. I hoped that meant a part of him wanted my help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take another look at Jack\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>I turned to open the door, but I was frozen. Jared held me by my waist. Before I could protest, he exhaled a long, resigned sigh.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute. I\u2019l go with you,\u201d he said, obviously annoyed.</p> <p>I waited at the door until Jared finished packing our lunch, and then he grabbed my hand on the way out.</p><p>Half-way to my parents\u2019 home he stil hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, placing my hand on his. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be mad, but this is something I need to do.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get hurt. I\u2019m beginning to regret tel ing you anything.\u201d</p><p>Those words stung me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get hurt, either. We won\u2019t have to keep looking over our shoulders if we end this. We can just live our lives normal y. Together.\u201d</p><p>Jared squeezed my hand as he pul ed into the drive.</p> <p>On a rug in Cynthia\u2019s office I thumbed through papers, looking for anything with numbers. I highlighted anything with an eight, two, or five anywhere near each other.</p><p>Two and a half hours later, I had several piles of papers, and nothing that included the numbers we were looking for. I sat up straight to stretch my aching back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a break,\u201d Jared said. He pul ed the highlighter from my fingers and handed me the plastic container with my lunch sealed inside.</p><p>I stretched my legs over Jared\u2019s lap and chewed happily on his amazing stir fry, marveling at what an exceptional cook he was. Jared pul ed off my boot and began rubbing my foot, and I leaned my head back.</p><p>\u201cThis is taking forever,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>\u201cWe could cal it a day. I could take you out to dinner,\u201d he offered.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking this very seriously.\u201d</p><p>Jared let out one shocked puff of air. \u201cOn the contrary, I think I\u2019m taking this more seriously than you are. You don\u2019t seem to understand how dangerous this is for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat could happen to me? My boyfriend also happens to be my guardian angel,\u201d I said, leaning over to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hel is going on here?\u201d</p><p>I looked over to the door where Cynthia stood, her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cHel o, Mother,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming back until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is this search and seizure or burglary?\u201d she said, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too,\u201d I said, rol ing my eyes in response. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find something with an eight twenty-five on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight twenty-five?\u201d Cynthia asked, looking at Jared, who stopped chewing for a moment under her glare.</p><p>He swal owed the lump of food in his mouth before giving report. \u201cI intercepted Dawson. They\u2019re finished with the pleasantries, Mrs. Grey. They want the evidence Jack col ected on them and they think Nina knows where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder why that is, Jared? It couldn\u2019t be because they\u2019ve seen you two together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Jared replied, impervious.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Charles Dawson have to do with the number?\u201d Cynthia asked, closing in on the mess on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jared said dismissively, looking over the papers again. I was a little surprised by his impassive attitude at Cynthia\u2019s presence when just over a week ago he balked at just the mention of being in the same room with her.</p><p>Cynthia seemed to accept his ambiguity, probably because she was used to being left in the dark by my father. \u201cI trust you\u2019l take care of Mr.</p><p>Dawson, Jared. That simply won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been taken care of, Mrs. Grey.\u201d</p><p>Cynthia nodded in approval. I was shocked that she spoke so candidly of violence.</p><p>\u201cKeep me updated,\u201d she said, walking out the door.</p><p>\u201cThat was weird,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>Jared looked up from the paper. \u201cWhat, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe threatened to fire you a few days ago if you didn\u2019t stay away from me. You quit speaking to me because of it. And just now you nearly ignored her.\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cMy mother discussed it with her. She\u2019s had a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I asked, suspicious.</p><p>\u201cLil ian\u2019s very persuasive,\u201d Jared smiled.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d I turned to see my mother round the corner again.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving for Nicaragua a week from Sunday. I need you to meet me here early so we can be at the airport by nine. Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l have everything ready,\u201d Jared said, distracted by the paper in his hand.</p><p>My heart began to pound, causing Jared to look up. I realized that I was going to spend the entire week of Spring Break on a beach with him, and the thought made my cheeks flush red.</p><p>Jared smiled, guessing what made my heart flutter. \u201cThis might be your first vacation with me, but it\u2019s not my first vacation with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time you\u2019l sit with me on the plane,\u201d I said a bit too eager, grinning from ear to ear. Jared chuckled at my enthusiasm.</p><p>Cynthia\u2019s reaction differed. \u201cHe\u2019s there to work, Nina. Please keep that in mind. Jared, make sure she is here on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019m,\u201d he said, his soft eyes never leaving mine.</p><p>With that, Cynthia disappeared once again.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but think about lying in a hammock with Jared. It already seemed like heaven.</p><p>\u201cI am suddenly looking forward to vacation,\u201d I grinned.</p><p>Jared leaned over to touch my cheek. \u201cLying with you on a Caribbean beach at sunset? I\u2019l have to remind myself that it\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat wil you have ready?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared\u2019s attention turned to the paper he was holding once more, and his eyes narrowed. He didn\u2019t make eye contact when he spoke. \u201cUh...al of my surveil ance supplies. We typical y bring about fifteen hundred pounds of tech with us, but with Claire going to Tahoe, I\u2019l be carrying light. I\u2019l set up a perimeter around the premises....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I leaned over to see what he was so absorbed in and recognized it was a bank statement. I\u2019d seen it several times before during my search, but set it aside in the scrap pile.</p><p>Jared pointed to a section of the statement and I gasped. It was a monthly charge for a safety deposit box. Box eight twenty-five.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d I cried, grabbing his arm.</p><p>Jared looked at his watch. \u201cThe bank is closed.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, deflated. \u201cWe\u2019l go first thing Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l go. You have class.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m going, Jared. We\u2019re doing this together.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as we gathered the piles of papers and photos and replaced them. Jared lifted the plant as if it were an empty cardboard box and returned it to its proper place.</p><p>My cel phone buzzed in my coat pocket. The display lit up with Kim\u2019s name scrol ing across the screen, and I closed my eyes. \u201cI bet she\u2019s cal ing about the pub tonight. I forgot al about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Kim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not backing out, Nigh. Don\u2019t even try,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to, I....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kim. I forgot,\u201d I said, rubbing my forehead with my fingers, feeling a stress headache coming on. \u201cBut I\u2019l be there.\u201d</p><p>Jared walked with me to the Escalade and held the door open as I climbed inside. By his expression I knew he was aware of the dul pain in my head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stand us up again, are you?\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, I\u2019l meet you there around nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. See you then.\u201d Kim said, disconnecting the line.</p><p>I put my cel phone back in my pocket and took Jared\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I groaned. \u201cI think I unwittingly double booked myself.\u201d</p><p>My head began to throb. It was difficult skipping back and forth between the two lives I was leading. I was the typical col ege student when I was with Kim, Ryan and Beth, and when I was with Jared, my life turned into this fantastical dream world with angels and demons and secret safety deposit boxes.</p><p>We parked in front of the loft, and Jared sighed. Claire\u2019s Lotus was sparkling beside the curb.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019d have much time alone, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Claire was lounging on the couch in stilettos boots and a leather jacket, flipping through channels on the flat screen. \u201cRyan\u2019s taking a nap. That guy sleeps like a hibernating bear,\u201d she said, rol ing her eyes. \u201cEvery branch of the military wants me on a special ops team, and God sticks me with the most boring Taleh in the history of mankind.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her observation, and Jared led me upstairs by the hand.</p><p>\u201cRyan is going to the pub tonight?\u201d Jared cal ed back to his sister.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Claire said. \u201cI\u2019l see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping Claire company tonight?\u201d I asked, col apsing onto his bed.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019l hang back tonight, let you spend time with your friends,\u201d he said, lying on the mattress beside me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to come?\u201d</p><p>Jared brushed his thumb across my sul en lip. \u201cI always want to be where you are.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cBecause you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true,\u201d he said, trying his best to seem annoyed.</p><p>I leaned over to kiss his cheek. \u201cHow do you expect me to have fun when you\u2019re right outside and I\u2019m hoping that any minute you\u2019l just break down and come in?\u201d</p><p>Jared grinned. \u201cHow can I say no to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l come, then?\u201d I asked, raising my eyebrows expectantly.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Jared shrugged. He tried to seem casual, but beyond the cool blue of his eyes was an edge of hopefulness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019l always want,\u201d I whispered, touching his cheek with my fingertips.</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression beamed with adoration. \u201cI knew that if I ever got my chance to be with you, al the waiting would be worth it. It\u2019s as if we\u2019ve cheated the curse, somehow. I\u2019ve never understood how something could be considered a curse that requires me to spend every moment with you, and that grants me the mercy of leaving a world that doesn\u2019t have you in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me to say after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the truth, sweetheart. You don\u2019t have to try to outdo me,\u201d Jared said, amused.</p><p>\u201cI love you...and I wil love you forever. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression turned intense, as if he was moved beyond words by my simple honesty. He pressed his lips to mine in the same slow, meaningful way he had only once before. It was the sweetest moment of my life.</p><p>It occurred to me that the stars had al but lined up for us: Gabe assigned to my father, fal ing in love with Lil ian, and then Jared coming along four years before I did, just in time to be assigned to me\u2014the daughter of a criminal\u2014a girl that would need constant supervision.</p><p>I traced the planes of Jared\u2019s torso and pondered how perfectly everything had been laid out for us to be together, and then my mind drifted to Claire and Ryan. If I was going to believe in fate, I had to take into account who Jared said I was meant to be with. I closed my eyes, pushing the thought from my mind. Ryan would find someone else that he would be happy with, and Jared could keep me.</p><p>Jared\u2019s voice pul ed me out of my daydream. \u201cYou were determined today. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything\u2019s possible with an angel and a little ingenuity,\u201d I said, settling in beside him.</p><p>Jared let me sleep for an hour, and then we left early to grab a bite to eat before meeting my friends. I descended the stairs in a black satin corset and jeans, with a pair of ruffle-toed pewter pumps. To my extreme pleasure, Jared stood frozen by the door, dropping his keys and then catching them before they hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I smiled, letting him help me with my coat.</p><p>By the end of dinner, I\u2019d already had three glasses of wine. We arrived at the pub at nine sharp, and the various vehicles of my friends were already in the parking lot. I noticed Claire\u2019s Lotus parked beside the curb down the street.</p><p>When Jared and I walked in, my friends cheered and whistled at our arrival.</p><p>Kim yel ed over the music. \u201cI brought a CD!! We\u2019re going to be dancing queens for the night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d I yel ed over the upbeat song blaring over the speakers.</p><p>Tucker brought over shots\u2014al of them different colors\u2014and the group howled. Everyone held up their shot glasses and Chad pushed one ful of something green in my direction.</p><p>We al yel ed in unison, \u201cTO THE BIG BROWN BEAR!\u201d</p><p>With that, we al tipped our heads back, kil ed our shots, and glasses slammed to the table at different intervals. Tucker yel ed for Tozzi to bring another round, and everyone cheered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thirty minutes later, most of us were on the dance floor jumping around like maniacs. My head felt a bit heavy, already feeling the effects of the wine and whiskey. Ryan and Jared watched us from the table and I waved to both of them as I bounced up and down.</p><p>I returned to the table and sat on Jared\u2019s lap. He pul ed me toward him to talk in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI love you, but there is no puking in the Escalade.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and planted a kiss on his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m fine! I\u2019m Irish, remember?\u201d</p> <p>Jared nodded and leaned into my ear again. \u201cEven the Irish throw up, Nina.\u201d</p><p>It seemed like the night had just begun when Tozzi announced last cal . I lost count of the drinks I\u2019d had, and my eyes struggled to focus.</p><p>Jared supported most of my weight as he escorted me to his SUV. He lifted me effortlessly into the passenger seat, and I leaned my elbow against the console, resting my head against my fist.</p><p>By the time we arrived at the loft, my head felt too heavy to hold up. Jared pul ed open my door and I slipped in and out of awareness as he carried me up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower,\u201d I said, stumbling to the bathroom.</p> <p>Jared fol owed me. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea? I don\u2019t want you passing out in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you join me, then you can make sure I don\u2019t?\u201d I said, steadying myself against the door jamb.</p><p>Jared raised an eyebrow, and I frowned at him before grabbing a towel and shutting the door behind me.</p><p>I fought with my clothes in slow motion. My eyes wouldn\u2019t stay open, and I was incessantly giggling for no good reason, which made me giggle more. I turned on the shower and stepped under the water, letting it rush over me, plastering my hair onto my face. Every movement I made felt like it was at a snail\u2019s pace, but I managed to exit the shower before my palms pruned.</p><p>I ran a comb through my hair and clumsily brushed my teeth. I giggled again at my blundering of the most mundane of tasks and I heard Jared chuckle outside the door in response.</p><p>\u201cEverything al right in there?\u201d he asked, knocking on the door.</p> <p>I giggled again and spit loudly in the sink. \u201cEverything\u2019s fantastic!\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed again, and I opened the door and stumbled to the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hop in the shower. Don\u2019t try to go downstairs or look over the railing or anything like that, okay? Just stay put until I get out.\u201d I understood his words, but they seemed to blur together.</p><p>I fel onto the bed face down and moaned into the comforter at how perfectly wonderful it felt. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d I said, my eyes sealing shut.</p><p>Jared reappeared in less than five minutes. \u201cDid you plan on sleeping in your towel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, feeling melted to the bed.</p><p>Jared walked over to his closet and pul ed a t-shirt off its hanger. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, sitting me up, \u201craise your arms.\u201d</p><p>I complied, and he slid the oversized t-shirt over my head. I buzzed my lips as the neck line went over my mouth making Jared erupt in laughter.</p> <p>\u201cYou are something else,\u201d he said, covering my legs with the blanket. He stepped away for a moment and then returned, throwing a piece of light blue fabric onto my lap. It took me a moment to realize that it was a pair of my panties.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l let you...take care of that.\u201d He started down the stairs, and I spoke up.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>He turned around, immediately catching the panties I clumsily shot at him. I burst into a delighted cackle, knowing if he had been merely human I would have caught him square in the face.</p><p>Jared smiled with inexhaustible patience. \u201cThese are for you, not me,\u201d he said, tossing them back. They landed perfectly in my lap.</p><p>I giggled again as he descended the stairs, feeling exhausted and wide awake at the same time. I could hear every step and movement Jared made downstairs, yet the fog in my head kept the sounds blurred together.</p><p>I was already settled on my side of the bed when Jared returned, and he wasted no time nestling himself next to me. Though the rest of my senses were lacking, my skin was aware of the heat created when his skin touched mine. Every part of me felt content and peaceful in his arms, as if I was meant to be there. I kissed his chest, but my lips didn\u2019t want to stop there. I continued until I reached his neck, and Jared took a deep breath, wasting no time to hold my shoulders far enough away to look into my prurient eyes.</p><p>\u201cNina....\u201d Jared warned, but I put my mouth on his to stop any further protesting.</p><p>I skipped over our usual cautious beginnings and let go of al my inhibitions. I leaned over him, lifting my knee at the same time to straddle his hips.</p><p>Jared\u2019s lips were not as urgent as mine, but I persisted.</p><p>I felt Jared\u2019s torso rise against my lips as they left his chest to slowly kiss my way up the midline of his throat. When my lips reached his lips again, his mouth was less cautious. He turned, rol ing over me, positioning me on my back. I smiled at my imminent victory.</p><p>Jared pul ed away from me, his breath disparate from just moments before. \u201cNina, we can\u2019t do this tonight.\u201d</p><p>I let out a gush of air I\u2019d been holding in anticipation of my triumph. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Jared kissed my nose and smiled. \u201cWel \u2014although I\u2019m incredibly tempted by the slurring and stumbling\u2014I\u2019d like for you to remember our first time.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed my legs, letting them fal to the bed. \u201cWhy do you have to be so freaking noble?\u201d I complained, pounding the mattress with my arms for emphasis.</p><p>Jared chuckled and curled up beside me. \u201cYes, I\u2019m so noble that I struggle with it every second I\u2019m alone with you. Don\u2019t give me too much credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry....\u201d I sighed, knowing I would feel guilty in a clearer state of mind.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t enjoy it,\u201d he chuckled. \u201c...Nina?\u201d he said, whispering my name.</p><p>I could hear him, but I couldn\u2019t respond. I realized just how fast I was sinking when my mind wanted to answer him but my mouth refused to form the words. He kissed my exposed shoulder and relaxed his head on the pil ow behind me. As I floated into unconsciousness, I felt his arm tighten around me once more, blanketing me with the warmth of his skin. I thought I heard him whisper something else, but I was too deep inside the darkness to make out the words</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Eli</p><p>My chest hurt. My eyes hurt. My head felt like a railroad spike had been driven through it. I wanted to scream, but that would only make it more excruciating. The only part of the moment that offered a grain of comfort was that I was stil in Jared\u2019s bed. I felt colder than I usual y felt when waking up in his apartment, and I knew at once he wasn\u2019t with me.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I rasped, unable to speak louder than a whisper.</p><p>I felt the bed indent beside me and I winced at the nausea the movement induced. The fissure I managed between my eyelids let in an infinitesimal amount of light and I cowered from it, bringing my hands over my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l get the light,\u201d Jared spoke in a hushed voice.</p><p>The assaulting brightness that seeped through my eyelids faded and I tried again.</p><p>\u201cMuch better, thank you,\u201d I whispered, pul ing myself up on my elbows.</p><p>\u201cI brought you breakfast.\u201d Jared nodded to the bedside table. Two aspirin, a large glass of water and a triangle of toast sat on a plate beside my picture.</p><p>I forced a smile and immediately reached for the aspirin. Jared handed me the water and I tossed the pil s to the back of my tongue, gulping down the cool liquid. It felt uncomfortable against my parched throat, as if my body wanted to reject any further fluids that might cause more anguish.</p><p>\u201cI feel awful,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usual y get a hangover. I must have been absurdly drunk,\u201d I said, rubbing my face with the tips of my fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou were,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>I sank into the mattress. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to babysit me. As if you don\u2019t have to do it, anyway. I\u2019m so embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>Jared attempted a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize for having a good time with your friends. It\u2019s just...uncomfortable.\u201d His eyes unfocused and his eyebrows pul ed in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>Jared rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cThis hazy, painful, tired, irritable heaviness you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I breathed, stil not understanding. I hadn\u2019t considered that Jared would be sensing the same symptoms. I sank deeper into the mattress, feeling very selfish. \u201cDo you have a headache?\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed with a puff of air. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never had one before. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lesser version of what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cI thought it was faint, like a mosquito buzzing in your ear?\u201d</p><p>Jared looked away from me, clearly troubled. \u201cIt\u2019s getting stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. My father never mentioned our senses increasing more than what I\u2019ve always experienced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jared. I didn\u2019t know or I wouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he interrupted, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about me. I just need to figure out what this is. It bothers me that I don\u2019t feel one hundred percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared asked, as if I\u2019d pul ed him out of a deep thought.</p><p>\u201cThe no-drinking policy. You feel off balance this morning and you like feeling in control al of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say it like it\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d he said defensively.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect al the time, Jared. It\u2019s okay to let your guard down.\u201d</p><p>I leaned in to hug him but he pul ed away just enough to make me hesitate. As soon as he realized what he\u2019d done, he seemed to regret it, which made him even angrier.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Claire,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cClaire and I are in agreement on this one, then. You are half-human. It\u2019s okay to make mistakes,\u201d I said, my words more rigid than I\u2019d meant them to be.</p><p>\u201cNot for someone like me. Certainly not for someone that has the daughter of Jack Grey for a Taleh. It\u2019s like you have no sense of danger, Nina.</p><p>After everything you\u2019ve been through lately, I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>He mentioned my father to get a reaction, so I kept my temper in check. I raised an eyebrow at his mini-tirade. \u201cDid I strike a nerve?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s unending patience from the night before had run out. \u201cIf I let my guard down you die. Do you understand that?\u201d</p><p>I took a drink of water and nodded. \u201cWe die.\u201d</p><p>Jared took the glass from me and slammed it on the table. \u201cDo you think I care about that? I would die for you a thousand times if I could. You\u2019re the only thing that matters.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms, incensed with his tender words mixed with their biting tone. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Why are you so upset?\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned his elbows on his knees, looking to the floor. \u201cI had company this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anyone come in,\u201d I said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t use doors. It was Samuel. He was a friend of my father\u2019s. He\u2019s concerned about the situation I\u2019ve put you in.\u201d</p><p>I held up a hand. \u201cBack up. What do you mean he doesn\u2019t use doors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an Arch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Archangel was here this morning?\u201d I asked, mystified. \u201cDo they look like Gabe? Do they look human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cSo if they look human, how do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArchs have the same light hair, flawless skin, and the bright blue eyes, although Samuel and his family are the exception. They are nobility among the Archs, and are a contrast to the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContrast?\u201d I had hoped I would learn to decipher Jared\u2019s cryptic explanations, but I stil failed consistently.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Cimmerian, a line of dark angels. They are the strongest of Archs, they\u2019re sovereigns and they\u2019re warriors. They are assigned to those that are marked by Hel \u2014the humans who are born to be stalked and tormented. They go toe to toe with demons quite frequently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, thinking about what kind of creature had been just a few feet from me while I slept. Anything built to wrestle demons had to be a frightening sight to behold.</p><p>Jared continued, \u201cIn addition to that, I can smel them a mile away. It\u2019s very difficult for them to sneak up on us. Or each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike fresh laundry, soap and a thunderstorm?\u201d I asked, the corners of my mouth turning up.</p><p>Jared frowned for a minute in thought and then his mouth mimicked mine. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it. To me it\u2019s those things times ten. I would describe them as smel ing like the cleanest air I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d After a short pause, he looked at me with curiosity. \u201cWhat made you say that?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, grabbing his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s how you smel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do? Hmmm. Good to know,\u201d he said, nodding his head in thought.</p><p>\u201cSo...Samuel...?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, his eyes darkening again. \u201cHe\u2019s noticed an increase in activity in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of activity?\u201d</p><p>Jared swal owed and shifted closer to me on the bed, holding my hand tighter. \u201cThe Others don\u2019t understand my draw to you...even with me being half-human. It\u2019s interesting to them. So their visits here have increased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t...they haven\u2019t bothered me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t engage us unless they have to.\u201d</p><p>I swal owed. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying when you\u2019re near, they won\u2019t hurt me?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes clouded over. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to cross that line, trust me. They know better than to get too close to you when I\u2019m near.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you had Claire sit with me the night you were with Mr. Dawson.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be afraid. It\u2019s only an issue in my apartment; they\u2019re drawn to the dwel ings of Hybrids. Remember I told you that they\u2019re attracted to those that are aware of them?\u201d I nodded. \u201cClaire, Bex and I, and those like us, are very aware of them. Our lineage enables us to see them even when you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve noticed more of their kind coming and going. They\u2019re curious about you.\u201d</p><p>I held his hand tight. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>Jared offered a comforting smile. \u201cYou let me do the worrying.\u201d</p> <p>I took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cWhat did Samuel tel you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve noticed...,\u201d Jared rubbed the back of his neck, \u201cthey\u2019ve noticed that we\u2019re spending more time together. Both sides. The Archs are unhappy about it. It\u2019s unusual\u2014and heavily frowned upon\u2014to become involved with one\u2019s Taleh. It\u2019s considered more of a taboo than fal ing in love with a human. Even though I\u2019m half-human, they find it irresponsible. Samuel is concerned that the Archs won\u2019t be inclined to help if things get messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we need their help? I thought you said they wouldn\u2019t come near me when you\u2019re around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about a dozen or so Others, Nina. Samuel wouldn\u2019t be concerned if it wasn\u2019t serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow serious is it?\u201d</p> <p>Jared sighed. Al of his energy seemed to have been sucked from him. \u201cHel is familiar with our fathers. Being their children in addition to our unique circumstance...we\u2019ve become people of interest, so to speak. The Others made a game of trying to catch my father off-guard. With me having a stronger reason to protect you...,\u201d he choked off. He swal owed and then began again, \u201cSamuel came to warn me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarn you,\u201d I repeated. My head was swimming with confusion and the whiskey stil saturating my system.</p><p>\u201cOur relationship could unintentional y provoke Hel .\u201d Jared rubbed his temples. He was having trouble focusing as wel . \u201cSamuel informed me that the curiosity they already have, coupled with Jack\u2019s death...we could have bigger problems than just the increasing visits.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhat does Jack have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men that kil ed your father knew how to bypass Gabe because of who they work for. Those cops, and a few other enemies of your father\u2019s, are employed by a man named Shax. Except...he\u2019s not a...he\u2019s not exactly a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Other?\u201d</p> <p>Jared attempted a smile, but the tension on his face twisted it into something that resembled pain.</p><p>\u201cShax is a Duke of Hel . He is also a renowned thief and takes great pride in his spoils. Somehow Jack made an enemy of Shax, and I\u2019m going to guess that he took something that Shax felt belonged to him. Not something you want to do to an aristocrat of Hel .\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to speak in a calm voice.</p><p>\u201cSamuel advised that we...see less of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! You\u2019re not...you\u2019re not going to listen to him, are you?\u201d</p><p>Jared took my face in his hands. \u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t leave you again, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou did. You promised,\u201d I said, more to myself than to him.</p><p>Jared returned his elbows to his knees and lowered his face in his hands. \u201cI have made a mess of everything, Nina,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re in more danger than you\u2019ve ever been. I see now why Jack forbade me to see you.\u201d</p> <p>I positioned myself behind him, wrapping my arms around his middle and pressing my cheek against his back. \u201cSo we have to jump through some hoops to be together. Who doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Jared twisted, looking at me with an incredulous expression.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cFor us to be together...it\u2019s a miracle isn\u2019t it? A Hybrid and his human, in love when everyone from Heaven to Hel says we shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>The starvation of a multitude turned into miraculous fish, the enslaving of a nation brought on the parting of the sea, blind men to see, lepers healed, a mother\u2019s grief brought back the dead...it takes a nightmare to earn a miracle.\u201d</p><p>He laughed once. \u201cIn this scenario I\u2019m the nightmare\u2014you\u2019re the miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I asked, pausing for a moment while I reconsidered broaching the subject again.</p><p>He sensed my trepidation and touched my cheek. \u201cWhat, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan on doing with the information Samuel gave you?\u201d I braced for his eyes to cloud over but to my surprise he smiled. His eyes even brightened a bit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight through the nightmare to earn the miracle, right?\u201d</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my cheek. \u201cI\u2019l let you get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see a friend,\u201d Jared said, jogging downstairs.</p><p>I thought about that for a moment. \u201cA human friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegative,\u201d I heard him say from the kitchen.</p><p>After my shower, I descended the stairs stil feeling a bit woozy. I felt even worse for Jared, who didn\u2019t even enjoy the debauchery before feeling the consequences of it.</p><p>Jared kept the accelerator to the floor, making the buildings of Providence blur by. I fidgeted with the temperature until final y resorting to the air conditioner. The stream of air blew against my face, and I closed my eyes.</p><p>Jared touched my knee.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s helping with the nausea,\u201d I said, knowing he would be just as relieved to have a smal fraction of my symptoms al eviated.</p><p>The Escalade slowed to a stop beside the fence of an abandoned warehouse. We were just outside of town, no more than ten miles from Jared\u2019s loft. I immediately felt a bit skittish, but the fear disappeared with Jared\u2019s warm touch. He took my hand and didn\u2019t let go as we hiked along an aging, gravel walkway and stopped at a gate harnessed with rusting chains. He pul ed a key from his pocket and twisted it in the large vintage lock.</p><p>Jared pressed open the heavy gates and led me around to a side entrance, where he pressed a button on a smal grey box. No one answered, but we were buzzed in.</p><p>Jared led me by the hand across the vast concrete. Pane after pane of glass lined the wal s, shooting beams of sunshine to the floor through the decades of dust. He stopped in the center and smiled at me before cal ing out into the huge, empty space.</p><p>\u201cEli?\u201d</p><p>We waited for almost half an hour. I wanted to ask Jared if he was sure his friend was there, but as long as he was being patient, I would play along.</p><p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon. She knows,\u201d Jared said suddenly, rol ing his eyes.</p><p>I watched him, the corners of my mouth turning up. It was amusing to see him talking to himself.</p><p>\u201cEli, we need to talk. You know she\u2019s important.\u201d He looked at me and then impatiently peered up to the extensive ceiling. \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>he shouted into the air.</p><p>I stifled a giggle.</p><p>Jared turned to me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, forcing the corners of my mouth straight.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now she thinks I\u2019m nuts,\u201d Jared cal ed out to the massive room.</p><p>A tiny giggle escaped my throat, and Jared angled his neck to face me, attempting an insulted expression. He failed miserably when a wide grin stretched across his face.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it. It was funny,\u201d a voice came from behind us.</p><p>I flipped around, instinctively hiding behind Jared.</p><p>A platinum-haired man stood in front of us with an amused smile. He was tal er than Jared, though not by more than a few inches. I was surprised at the way he was dressed. I was expecting the crisp, white, buttoned-down dress shirt, but I hadn\u2019t anticipated it un-tucked and the sleeves rol ed up to his elbows, or the holes in his jeans, or the light brown leather sandals. I was certainly not expecting the faux hawk.</p><p>He surpassed attractive, and his physique was as incredible as Jared\u2019s, noticeable even under his clothes. Even though he was fair, warmth emanated from his skin, almost a muted, dewy glow. His ice blue eyes appraised me, and then looked to Jared, who pul ed me to his side.</p><p>\u201cEli,\u201d Jared said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cYeah. There wil be none of that nodding crap, Jared,\u201d Eli said, pul ing us both in for a hug. \u201cHow have you been? I assume the moping has ceased since you\u2019ve found a way to final y introduce yourself?\u201d</p><p>Jared nervously laughed, looking at me from the corner of his eye. \u201cI\u2019ve been fine, and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavenly,\u201d Eli said, with a wide, dramatic gesturing of his arms.</p><p>Jared rol ed his eyes. \u201cQuit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel o, Nina. I\u2019ve heard...,\u201d his eyes widened for a moment, \u201clots about you. It\u2019s nice to final y meet you...formal y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, too.\u201d</p><p>I extended my hand and Eli took it, appearing pleased with my bravery. His hand felt normal, a little on the cool side. Not at al like Jared\u2019s feverish temperature.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to run a fever to keep up with what we can do,\u201d Eli smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, nodding.</p><p>I looked to Jared, who watched me with an expression as amused as Eli\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou were expecting a toga and a harp?\u201d Eli asked, winking at me.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone, Eli,\u201d Jared warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just having a little fun, Jay. You know I don\u2019t get to do this often,\u201d the angel said, letting go of my hand.</p><p>Jared turned to me. \u201cEli isn\u2019t an Arch. He is the Angel of the Divine Plan. He watches over spiritual evolution, and when cal ed upon by humans, he assists Him in helping humans to find the correct path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim? As in...your boss is...?\u201d</p><p>Eli seemed bored with Jared\u2019s explanation. \u201cI am a traffic cop for the Archs and a glorified guidance counselor, Nina. Don\u2019t let the title intimidate you.\u201d</p><p>I tried to stifle a laugh, but the best I could do was to cover my mouth when I giggled. I had expected somewhat of a formal meeting, and Eli had gone from an ominous being to a pleasant surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve started experiencing some changes in my senses, Eli. Do you know what that\u2019s about?\u201d Jared asked, impatient with the pleasantries.</p><p>\u201cI do. Have you become physical with your Taleh?\u201d Eli asked matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cIn what respect? If you\u2019re meaning sex, then no,\u201d Jared said, impervious to such a forward way of asking a delicate question.</p><p>I began to feel a bit dizzy by the sudden turn of conversation. I wasn\u2019t sure how many times I could be taken off guard in my condition. Jared pul ed me to his side, supporting some of my weight.</p><p>Eli eyed us speculatively. \u201cIn any respect, Jared. When you revealed yourself to her, the connection became stronger. As you spend time with her, it becomes stronger. Every time you touch her, it grows stronger. As your feelings for her deepen, so does the link between you. If you\u2019re with her in an intimate way, the connection becomes a solid, permanent bond. There wil be a noticeable difference in how you\u2019l sense her presence, her pain and her emotions when a physical commitment is made. You should keep that in mind. It could hinder your duties as her protector.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, immediately taking Eli at his word.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he\u2019l be more susceptible to sickness and pain?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a possibility. Of course, those things would always be in connection with you, Nina, but only in theory. We don\u2019t have much experience with this type of thing. The two of you are only our seventh case since the dawn of humans\u2019 time on earth. And you would be the first half- breed/human case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHybrid,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>Both Jared and Eli looked at me with a strange expression.</p><p>Eli smiled, clearly amused. \u201cHybrid, then. You\u2019re right, that wasn\u2019t very nice of me, was it?\u201d he said, winking at Jared, who looked away, trying not to smile.</p><p>Jared cleared his throat, getting back to business. \u201cI\u2019m told we could have some legions to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Eli looked up for a moment and then back to Jared. \u201cSo far it\u2019s just the humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something I can do to get them to back off of her?\u201d Jared said with a noticeable change in his tone. There was a distinct edge of desperation to it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the damage has already been done, Jared. You were warned,\u201d Eli said without judgment.</p><p>Jared glanced at me and then let go of my hand, walking away with his hands on his hips. He kept his back to us, looking down at his feet and then up to the ceiling.</p><p>Eli nodded at me with a patient smile. I forced the corners of my mouth to turn up.</p><p>Only Jared\u2019s profile was visible. His jaws worked just beneath the skin. After several moments he began speaking in a language I didn\u2019t understand. It was more beautiful than French or Hebrew; it was the most beautiful language I\u2019d ever heard. The words came out of Jared\u2019s mouth like a symphony.</p><p>Eli answered him in the same language, and then I understood. They were speaking the language of Heaven. After Eli\u2019s lengthy response, Jared turned around with tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCan I do this alone?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cNone of us can do anything alone, Jared. That is why we exist in families.\u201d Eli\u2019s expression was calm, the opposite of Jared\u2019s. I felt an overwhelming urge to go to Jared and hold him in my arms until the tortured look left his eyes.</p><p>Jared seemed to understand what I did not. He pul ed me to him, kissing the top of my hair. I wrapped my arms around him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. Whatever it is, we\u2019l figure it out,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>He smiled, but his face crumpled around it. \u201cI\u2019ve put you in serious danger, Nina. You\u2019re father was right, I should have stayed away. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>Eli sighed with satisfaction. \u201cShe\u2019s a keeper, Jared. She has faith. Maybe it wil rub off on you.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>In the same moment, we were alone. We made our way back to the SUV, and then Jared opened my door, lifting me to the seat.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to move back to Andrews right now,\u201d he said with an apologetic expression.</p><p>I touched his cheek, worried about his reaction. \u201cJared, I can\u2019t keep staying with you. What wil people think?\u201d</p><p>He laughed once, but he was perturbed at my question. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what anyone thinks. I\u2019m more concerned with keeping you alive.\u201d</p><p>I smiled patiently and kissed his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m staying with you on the weekends, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough, Nina. I need you with me at al times.\u201d</p> <p>I raised my eyebrows in protest. \u201cWel , you can\u2019t. I have class...and friends. I have a life outside of this craziness. Jack didn\u2019t move in with you, and he had more enemies than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my mother was Gabe\u2019s Taleh, he would have moved her in. If Gabe had created a fun new game for a legion of demons to play, he would have moved her in,\u201d Jared said, rubbing his forehead with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a headache?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Anger exploded across Jared\u2019s face and he walked away from me, paused a few feet away, and then walked back, stil furious.</p><p>\u201cNina! For God\u2019s sake, your life is in danger! And it\u2019s my fault! Quit worrying about me!\u201d</p><p>I sat there, stunned. Jared walked away, picked up a basebal -sized rock and hurled it at the warehouse. I lost the rock with my human eyes before it crashed through a window.</p> <p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared flipped around and seemed to contemplate yel ing some more before wrapping his arms around my waist and burying his head in my lap.</p><p>\u201cWil you please take this seriously? Before I\u2019m consumed with guilt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to be afraid?\u201d I asked. Jared looked up at me with a pained look on his face. \u201cDo you want me to be angry with you? Do you want me to scream at you and hate you for coming into my life?\u201d I shook my head and cupped his cheeks with my hands. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I know one way or another, everything wil work out. It wil .\u201d</p><p>My optimism didn\u2019t help Jared\u2019s agony. His face fel , and he let his head fal to my lap again, pul ing me to him, grasping at my back. I hugged him and touched my cheek to his hair. I didn\u2019t know what else to do for him, but I refused to let my emotions betray me.</p><p>When the sun began to set, Jared\u2019s head hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>\u201cJared, it\u2019s getting dark. We should go,\u201d I said, running my fingers through his hair.</p><p>After a few minutes, he stood up and slowly walked to the other side of the SUV, in no hurry to get back to town.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to Brown,\u201d Jared said, pul ing away from Eli\u2019s warehouse. \u201cWe\u2019l get the rest of your things, I\u2019l get you a dresser, make you some closet space....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared...no.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darted to mine. \u201cNina, I\u2019m sorry but this isn\u2019t up for negotiation. I have to fix this, and then you can go back to Andrews.\u201d</p><p>I kept my voice calm. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hide, Jared.\u201d</p><p>Despite my quiet tone, Jared became increasingly angry. \u201cI realize you haven\u2019t a clue with what we\u2019re dealing with here, but I\u2019m tel ing you now: You\u2019re packing, and you\u2019re coming home with me. I don\u2019t know for how long.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly.</p><p>His jaws tensed. \u201cNina, don\u2019t be stubborn. Please trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not going to hide,\u201d I said again.</p><p>He jerked the Escalade onto the shoulder of the road and shoved the gear in park. \u201cI\u2019m not asking, Nina. I am tel ing you. It\u2019s that serious.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him and he sighed, hitting his steering wheel with the heel of his hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me! It\u2019s bad enough knowing I\u2019ve put you in this situation without you refusing to let me keep you safe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack didn\u2019t want you to tel me the truth because he didn\u2019t want this. He didn\u2019t want me to live in fear or in hiding. If you lock me up you\u2019re giving them what they want.\u201d</p><p>His knuckles were white as they gripped the steering wheel. \u201cWhat makes you think you know what they want?\u201d His voice was low and deliberate.</p><p>\u201cBecause Jack wanted the opposite,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared stared at me, considering my words. \u201cJack wanted you safe. These things don\u2019t show mercy, Nina. They don\u2019t care that you\u2019re an innocent teenage girl.\u201d</p><p>I swal owed. \u201cEli said we were only dealing with humans for now. Let\u2019s concentrate on that.\u201d</p><p>Jared thought for a moment and relaxed a bit. \u201cOkay. We\u2019l do this your way. While we\u2019re stil dealing with humans, you can stay at Andrews. The second Shax cal s out even a fraction of one of his legions, you\u2019re coming with me. And I don\u2019t want to hear a single word about it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cFair enough.\u201d I pul ed my arms around me, bracing myself. My curiosity outweighed my need to remain oblivious. \u201cWhat are Legions?\u201d</p><p>Jared grimaced, obviously wishing I hadn\u2019t asked. \u201cShax has thirty legions under his command. Don\u2019t ask me how many demons that is. You don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again, swal owing the bile rising in my throat.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Jared asked, feeling my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel wel ,\u201d I said, reaching for the door handle.</p><p>I ran to the grass, hearing both car doors shut simultaneously. As soon as my feet touched the soil, Jared was beside me, pul ing my hair away from my face. It didn\u2019t take long for the dry heaving to commence; I hadn\u2019t eaten anything since breakfast.</p><p>After my stomach relaxed and the gagging ceased, Jared lifted me into his arms and returned me to my seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to the loft,\u201d he warned, putting the gear in drive.</p><p>I was too exhausted and sick to argue.</p><p>Jared carried me up the two flights of stairs and gently placed me on my side of the bed. I let my body melt into the mattress while I listened to the water run in the bathroom. Moments later a cool, folded wash cloth was laid it across my forehead.</p><p>\u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t taking your condition into consideration when I drug you out to see Eli, and I should have gotten you something to eat. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit apologizing. You didn\u2019t force me to drink too much last night. How are you feeling? Like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick, just uncomfortable. I\u2019l make you a deal. I\u2019l quit apologizing if you quit worrying about me,\u201d he said, brushing my hair back from my face.</p><p>I smiled but didn\u2019t make any promises. Jared kissed my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m going downstairs to get you some crackers and soda to settle your stomach.</p><p>Try to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m real y fine. You don\u2019t have to fuss,\u201d I said, pushing myself up against the pil ows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to make you comfortable.\u201d He had a strange expression on his face, almost sul en.</p><p>\u201cYour bed is a thousand times more comfy than my bed at Andrews, and even my bed at home. And neither of them smel s like you.\u201d</p><p>Jared fidgeted before speaking. \u201cSo...why is it that you\u2019re so against staying here? Is it me?\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows immediately pul ed in, hurt that he would ever come to that conclusion. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not against staying here. I love staying here. I just need to go back to Andrews.\u201d</p><p>Jared raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd why is that? I thought staying alive would be a good enough reason for you to want to stay here with me. You didn\u2019t mind when I needed to dress your hand every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about being forced into hiding, it\u2019s about my friends, and it\u2019s about keeping some degree of normalcy in my life. I know you want me here where you know that I\u2019m safe,\u201d I explained, resting my hand on his leg.</p><p>\u201cNot just to keep you safe. I just want you here,\u201d he said, tenderly tracing my jaw line with his fingertip.</p><p>I smiled at his words, my jaw radiating with the heat from his touch. \u201cWe have plenty of time for that, right?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes immediately clouded over and I final y understood the urgency. He wanted to spend every second of the time we had left together. I looked away from him; I had to have faith that we would make it through this. My eyes felt heavy and I turned onto my side, pressing my cheek into my pil ow.</p><p>\u201cI have faith in you, Jared. More than you have in yourself. I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d I said, closing my eyes.</p><p>The door slammed and I jerked, looking around the room. It was morning.</p><p>\u201cCan you close the door like a normal person?\u201d Jared snapped.</p><p>\u201cThis is a terrible idea, Jared. Maybe the worst one you\u2019ve had, yet,\u201d Claire complained. Smal footsteps stomped up the stairs. \u201cYou have to talk him out of this, Nina. He won\u2019t listen to me. Not in the mood he\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it, Claire,\u201d Jared said from downstairs.</p><p>Claire made a face and then jumped from the railing, landing on her feet. \u201cI can\u2019t stay out of it, because you keep making it my business!\u201d she hissed.</p><p>I quickly dressed and met them downstairs. Jared was dressed in a buttoned-down shirt and slacks, holding a motorcycle helmet. He shoved it toward me without a word.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I asked, staring at the helmet.</p><p>\u201cI think better on my bike,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Claire and then to Jared. I pressed my lips together and then took the helmet from him. Claire sighed and stormed out.</p><p>I fol owed Jared outside and eyed the slick, black beauty parked on the curb. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a Vulcan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird. I thought it was a motorcycle.\u201d I smiled, but Jared didn\u2019t find humor in my words. I put up my hand and separated my fingers into a \u2018V\u2019. \u201cLive long and...no?\u201d I shook my head, seeing that Jared was in no mood for jokes.</p><p>I shoved the helmet on and fastened the chin strap. My father had a motorcycle and, although I\u2019d never been brave enough to drive one, I was wel - versed in being a passenger. Jared revved the engine and I climbed on behind him, glad that it was another nice day.</p><p>He raced down the street, taking various turns. It wasn\u2019t until we pul ed onto the sidewalk in front of Sovereign Bank that I understood the reason behind Jared\u2019s mood. He lifted me off the seat as if I weighed nothing, placing me on my feet.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re not speaking to me?\u201d I asked, shoving his helmet at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you that I\u2019m angry with. It\u2019s Jack,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s making it impossible for me to keep you distanced from this. They need both of our signatures. The box is in a special area. We need the key, our signatures and our fingerprints to get in,\u201d he said, glaring at the door of the bank.</p><p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t have my fingerprints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never given them mine, either, but they have it on file,\u201d Jared said, distant and cold.</p><p>\u201cYou tried to come here without me? Is that why Claire was at the loft?\u201d I crossed my arms. \u201cAnd let me guess, it just burns you that you needed my help after al .\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes jerked to mine. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d I stood with my arms stil tightly intertwined across my ribs. Jared shook his head at me and held out his arm. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>We walked into the bank and a man in a stuffy and notably hideous light grey suit approached us.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stephens, this is Nina Grey,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>The man held out his lanky hand and I took it. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you Miss Grey. Right this way.\u201d He ushered us across the lobby to an elevator.</p><p>Once inside, he used a smal key to gain access to a lower floor that wasn\u2019t on the button display.</p><p>The elevator opened into a cavernous room with an enormous bronze vault. Mr. Stephens briskly walked ahead of us, taking his place behind a tal desk with a computer. As we approached, he was tapping the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cMiss Grey, I\u2019l need to see two forms of identification, please,\u201d Mr. Stephens said, looking up from the monitor.</p><p>I shot an irritated look at Jared, realizing I\u2019d left my purse at the loft. Jared reached into his jacket pocket and pul ed out my wal et. I snatched it from his hand and then put my driver\u2019s license and student ID on the smal space in front of the computer monitor. Mr. Stephens\u2019 eyes darted twice between my face and each of the cards and then nodded. I put the cards back into my wal et as he repeated the process with Jared.</p><p>\u201cMiss Grey, there is a red pad in front of you. I\u2019l need you to press and hold your thumb there until you see a flash, and then I\u2019l need you to do the same, Mr. Ryel,\u201d he said, watching us both fol ow his directions. \u201cNow sign here and approve the date with the green button when you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>I hastily signed and clicked the button with the pen, handing it to Jared, who signed his name under mine.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have the key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Jared said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cRight this way,\u201d Mr. Stephens said, the vault automatical y opening.</p><p>The room was fil ed with various sized boxes, al plated in the same bronze color as the door. Our steps echoed against the marble floor.</p><p>Mr. Stephens turned to us, pointing to a shiny golden square on the wal with a smal black button in the center. \u201cPress this button to let me know you\u2019re finished. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Miss Grey...Mr. Ryel,\u201d he nodded, leaving us alone. The vault door sealed shut behind him, and Jared\u2019s eyes drifted to mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, he was creepy,\u201d I whispered, half-expecting Jared to offer comfort.</p><p>Without a word, he walked ahead, pul ing the key from his pocket. I scanned the boxes on the wal and noticed that the numbers were out of order.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to take forever!\u201d I complained. Jared stil didn\u2019t respond, so I rol ed my eyes and looked for box eight twenty-five.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Jared cal ed to me. \u201cNina?\u201d</p> <p>I rushed toward his voice and found him in the back corner, looking at a bronze square the size of a shoebox. \u201cWel , we should have looked back here, first. This is just like Jack, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jared stil didn\u2019t speak; he simply shoved the key in the lock and opened it, exposing a tan safe with a large black combination lock and handle on the front. He placed the safe on the floor at my feet as if it were a shoe box. I was sure it must have been at least fifty pounds, if not more, but Jared didn\u2019t brace himself against the weight. The muscles of his arms didn\u2019t even strain.</p><p>\u201cThe code is a combination,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jared nodded, pul ing out the wrinkled piece of paper from his inside jacket pocket. He read the code aloud and then looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cDoes that make sense to you?\u201d he asked, holding out the paper for me to take.</p> <p>825 2R2TL223TR05 \u201cThe eight twenty-five is the box number, and the rest is the key to the combination. But, combinations are just three numbers, one or two digits, right?\u201d I didn\u2019t look up, and Jared didn\u2019t speak, so I wasn\u2019t sure if he was in agreement with me or not. \u201cSo we need to figure out which of these numbers are the numbers of the combination. And the others are...what? Red herrings?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo. Jack didn\u2019t play games, these are al important.\u201d</p><p>I concentrated on the dial of the combination lock, looking at the numbers and thinking about turning the dial to each number in the different ways they appeared in the code. I burst into laughter and looked at Jared with excitement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Jared masked an emotion, which in turn curbed my enthusiasm. It seemed we were back to square one of our relationship.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got what?\u201d he asked, his voice flat.</p><p>\u201cThe letters, the R T L letters, they mean right turn and left turn. Turn it twice to the right, stopping on two. Turn left twice, stopping on twenty-two.</p> <p>Three turns right, stopping on five.\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>My first inclination was to wad up the paper, throw it at him, and tel him to try it. My temper cooled as reason crept into my mind. I wanted to see what was in the safe, and he would catch the paper, anyway, even if I did manage to aim wel enough to hit him.</p><p>I kneeled down and twisted the combination. I fol owed the directions, but when I stopped on the last number, it didn\u2019t catch the way combination locks should.</p><p>My anger at Jared coupled with my frustration with the lock made my eyes water. When I tried to inconspicuously wipe my cheek with my shoulder, he sighed.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>I sniffed. \u201cNo. Leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it again,\u201d he said, indifferent.</p> <p>I cleared the dial and paid close attention to each turn and stop, but when I reached the five, I passed by it once more. I had only passed it twice instead of three times. The lock caught and I gasped.</p><p>\u201cIt worked,\u201d I whispered, staring in shock at the safe.</p><p>Jared pul ed me off the floor and kneeled down to open the safe. He slumped over and pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cDamn it, Jack. What have you done?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Guilty</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, leaning over his shoulder.</p><p>He turned to face me holding a brown, leather-bound book. It surpassed antique in appearance; wel -worn on the edges, with a strange branded seal on the front cover.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Naissance de Demoniac. The Bible of Hel ,\u201d he said in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhy is the Bible of Hel in Jack\u2019s safe?\u201d I said, stunned.</p><p>\u201cEach of the patricians of the hierarchy of Hel has one. This one belongs to Shax,\u201d he said, eyeing the black brand in the center. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know how Jack got his hands on it, but the fact that both of our names are on the account here tel s me that he knew I would go against his wishes, and once I did, we would need this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed it for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo barter for the only thing Jack would be wil ing to hand this over for: Your life.\u201d His expression was tortured, as if the guilt was crushing him.</p><p>\u201cJared....\u201d I said, reaching out to him.</p><p>He pul ed away and emotion disappeared from his face.</p><p>His rejection fueled my irritation. \u201cAre we going to leave it here or take it with us?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s staying here. I don\u2019t want this anywhere near you. Let\u2019s hope Shax is the one demon in Hel that won\u2019t hold a grudge.\u201d</p><p>I reached my hand out to the book. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>Jared jerked it away and kneeled down to thrust it back into the safe. He slammed the door shut, locked it and pushed the safe into the safety deposit box with a loud bang. He threw the paper bearing the code in with it and locked the door, shoving the key into his pocket.</p><p>Grabbing my arm, he rushed down the aisle toward the door. A short, low buzzer sounded when Jared pressed the button, and he fidgeted until Mr.</p><p>Stephens answered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Jared growled.</p><p>As soon as the vault opened, I was pul ed forward again. His long strides had me trotting alongside him to keep up. The elevator doors slid open, revealing Mr. Stephens\u2019 lanky frame. Jared stood rigid as the elevator climbed, and when the doors opened again he burst out, keeping a firm grip on my arm.</p><p>At his motorcycle, Jared wasted no time handing me his helmet. I fumbled with the chin strap, and with one movement he snapped his firmly across my neck and swung his leg over the seat, simultaneously pul ing me on the seat behind him with one arm.</p><p>He wrapped my arms tightly against his chest. \u201cHang on,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>We raced down the road, weaving through traffic, blowing through red lights and stops signs until we reached his building.</p><p>My feet barely touched the steps, and once we were inside the loft, he released me. Without a word he climbed the stairs and disappeared beyond the railing. I stood at the bottom of the steps and listened as his footsteps stopped in the center of his bedroom. I waited, listening for a clue as to what he was up to, and then he walked into the bathroom. Seconds later I heard the shower turn on, so I waited.</p><p>Ten minutes passed. I sat on the couch, staring at the dark television screen. Nothing about Jared\u2019s behavior made sense, and I assumed he would explain it in his own time, as he always did.</p><p>After half an hour, I began to doubt my own reasoning. I climbed the stairs and made my way to the bathroom door, pressing my ear against the wood. The shower was stil running so I tried to be patient, but after the fourth time of glancing at the clock I couldn\u2019t let him avoid me anymore.</p><p>I lifted my fist to knock on the door but held back, turning the knob instead. The steam bel owed out around me and dissipated, revealing Jared slumped on the floor. His knees up, his back against the tile wal , his head down; he looked hopeless.</p><p>I sat on my knees in front of him. \u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, his eyes a midnight blue. \u201cThe night I sat on that bench, Nina, I signed your death warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d The sight of him frightened me. \u201cPlease tel me what\u2019s going on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had more company last night,\u201d Jared said, with the same tortured look from before.</p><p>\u201cWho was it this time?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d he choked out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not talking about your father, are you? You mean The Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...The Gabriel.\u201d Jared said, rol ing his eyes at his own words. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most vocal advocates for eliminating fal en Archs before they have a chance to procreate. My existence insults him,\u201d he said, an indignant look flitting across his face. \u201cGabriel\u2019s a messenger...he also serves as the angel of death.\u201d</p><p>I swal owed. \u201cWhat did he say to you?\u201d</p><p>Jared leaned his head back against the wal . \u201cHe said that he\u2019l see me soon.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened as I gasped. \u201cWhat did you say to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he always says that,\u201d he said with a contrived smile.</p><p>I thought for a moment. \u201cEli doesn\u2019t mind Hybrids. Maybe he can talk to Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>Jared breathed out through his nose, trying to be patient with my suggestion. \u201cNina, no one but the Almighty tel s Gabriel anything.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders sunk. \u201cSo now we\u2019re fighting demons and angels? How did we sink into this mess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have sat on that bench.\u201d</p><p>I touched his face. \u201cYou sitting on that bench is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Jared recoiled from my touch. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. You have no idea what I\u2019ve caused. Shax won\u2019t stop until he has the book, and even then there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019l retaliate. Hel wants us dead and Heaven won\u2019t help us, Nina. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. If Jack hadn\u2019t taken the book, none of this would have happened.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed once. \u201cIncluding us.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cDidn\u2019t we agree we had to get through the nightmare to get our miracle?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled infinitesimal y. \u201cYeah.\u201d He parted his knees and pul ed me to him, hugging me to his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do about what we saw today?\u201d I whispered into his neck.</p><p>\u201cRight now we\u2019re just dealing with humans. We have to make sure it stays that way.\u201dJared shifted and stood up, bringing me along with him. He brought me to the middle of his room and took in a deep cleansing breath, pressing his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been so....\u201d he shook his head, clearly in ful self-loathing mode.</p><p>I inched up on the bal s of my feet and touched my lips to his. He cautiously kissed me back, and then sighed again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re under a lot of pressure right now,\u201d I said, running my fingers through the sides of his hair.</p><p>\u201cThe last person I should be taking that out on is you. The way I treated you this morning is unforgiveable,\u201d he frowned.</p><p>\u201cIt was unforgiveable,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know what they want; we\u2019re just not sure how far they\u2019l go to get it. Claire and I can handle the humans. The hardest part wil be waiting for their next move.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and wrapped my arms around him. \u201cCan we start this day over?\u201d</p><p>Jared kissed the top of my head. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we start with getting you to class? You have a test today, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI have a paper to turn in at ten thirty.\u201d</p><p>Jared released me, disappearing to the bathroom. He emerged in a light grey t-shirt and black soccer shorts, with his ratty running shoes. He looked dramatical y different than the more professional attire he wore to the bank.</p><p>I stood by the door and waited while he pul ed a hooded sweatshirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cGet your stuff together and I\u2019l take you to school. I need to finish setting up for next week, so I\u2019l meet you later, okay? Claire wil be close,\u201d he said, almost in passing.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d My fists gripped the fabric of his shirt, holding him tightly to me just as he began to walk away. He looked down at me and tucked my hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he smiled, the softness final y returning to his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCan we just pretend it\u2019s a normal vacation and forget about everything here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said, hugging me to him.</p><p>At Brown, Jared seemed to be back to his old self, which helped the unease surrounding me. Bibles from Hel , demons with criminals-for-hire, antagonistic angels\u2014trying to make sense of it al only created more questions.</p><p>I snapped out of my daze when I saw Jared\u2019s expression. \u201cSee you at one thirty?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Ryan passed us as he walked into the classroom, nodding to Jared. I noticed Jared watch him for a long moment, and then he looked into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he said, a bit nervous. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about earlier. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already said that,\u201d I said, pul ing up one corner of my mouth.</p><p>Guilt displayed across Jared\u2019s face. \u201cI know. I just don\u2019t think that I was clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were clear. Consider it forgotten.\u201d</p><p>His face seemed to relax, then, and he kissed me once more. \u201cI\u2019l have your things back in your room. I\u2019l meet you there when you get back.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and watched him walk down the hal . Before he turned the corner, he looked back at me and smiled. I waved and extended the handle of my bag, continuing to my seat.</p><p>\u201cI came by your room about nine last night. You weren\u2019t there,\u201d Ryan said in a hushed voice, tapping his pen on my desk.</p><p>\u201cI was sick last night. I stayed with Jared.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face turned concerned. \u201cYou could have stayed here. I could have kept an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, knowing he was sincere. I appreciated his attempt to repair our friendship. The bitterness from before was absent from his face, and sitting beside him felt right again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, now. It was just a bad hangover. I didn\u2019t feel wel al day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t feel the greatest, either,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you offer to take care of me? That would be a sad sight, both of us lying around, puking our guts out,\u201d I laughed, shaking my head.</p><p>Ryan chuckled, taking my paper when the professor instructed the class to pass them to the end of the row. During lecture, a smal square of paper landed on my desk. I smiled and pul ed open the folds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was in Ryan\u2019s chicken scratch.</p><p>Wil you go to lunch w/me? (circle one) I\u2019l lose my appetite if I have to sit across from you.</p><p>I already have lunch plans w/my husband.</p><p>Of course, I need to practice my slogans.</p> <p>I wanted to rol my eyes at his childish note, but when I saw the expectant grin on his face, I couldn\u2019t say no. I circled \u2018C\u2019, folded it, and tossed it back.</p><p>Ryan always came up with the sil iest things, and I adored that about him. Unbeknownst to him, he was a safe harbor from my other life, the one that had become ful of shadows and uncertainty.</p><p>I watched him unfold the paper and read my answer. He didn\u2019t look up at me; he folded back the smal torn page and stuffed it in his pocket, a wide grin across his face.</p><p>After class, Ryan and I walked to The Gate. He was his usual amusing self, and I laughed every step of the way. A few times I noticed he would hug me to him, nudge me, and a few times he led me by the smal of my back through the doors he held open. I had the distinct feeling we were on a date, even though that wasn\u2019t the case. The only thing that bothered me was that Ryan\u2019s touch didn\u2019t bother me. It wasn\u2019t the electricity I felt with Jared, but it felt expected, almost comfortable.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize when Ryan asked me to lunch that the entire study group was coming, but I smiled at the friends that filtered in and surrounded us.</p> <p>Over the next hour, we sat hunched over our paper plates of pizza that we balanced on our laps, the boys trying their best to keep their towering stacks of slices from fal ing to the floor. Ryan and Kim were inexplicably engaged in a contest to see who could take the bigger bite. Our ordinary moment was a welcomed break and I smiled at the laughter saturating the air around me, absorbing the sweet chaos I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d missed.</p><p>Ryan walked out with me and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here, tonight, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I grinned.</p><p>He prolonged our walk with a leisurely pace. \u201cAre you going to study group tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI need to. I was going to ask for your help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need more help than I can give you, but I\u2019l do my best.\u201d</p><p>Ryan kept his hands in his pockets, angling his face towards the sunshine. He looked truly happy, and I felt a warm tinge in my chest. I was hopeful that we could remain in each other\u2019s lives, after al .</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice today. I could grab a blanket and we could hang out on the greens,\u201d he said, purposeful y bumping into me.</p><p>Jared waiting for me came to the forefront of my mind, but I didn\u2019t want to spoil Ryan\u2019s buoyant mood. We walked a few more steps as I decided how I should explain to him why I wouldn\u2019t. I had experienced normal, the normal I had been desperate for, and yet I found myself giddy at the thought of seeing Jared again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t. I\u2019l see you tonight.\u201d Ryan said, squinting as he looked to the sky again. I was thankful that his radiant grin hadn\u2019t faded.</p><p>I smiled in response and he pul ed me into his side, kissing my forehead.</p><p>\u201cLater, Nigh,\u201d he said before turning toward his dorm.</p><p>I pul ed in a big, cleansing breath of air. I felt renewed and rejuvenated. Even with the frightening things that lurked in the shadows, something had made it al disappear. I quickened my pace, eager to see Jared again. He was the only thing that could make my afternoon better.</p> <p>The door was cracked when I arrived, and I pushed it open to find Jared looking out of the opened slits of the window blind. A smile immediately streaked across my face.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d he asked, not turning around.</p><p>I walked up behind him, wrapped my arms tightly around his middle and squeezed. He folded his arms over mine.</p><p>\u201cAs if you have to ask. You should have joined us,\u201d I said, closing my eyes and taking in his wonderful scent. When he didn\u2019t respond, I released my grip on him and walked around to see the perfection of his features. His eyes were bright and cloudless like the sky outside, but they seemed sad.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>I smoothed the barely noticeable wrinkle between his eyebrows. \u201cIt would have been better had you shown up.\u201d</p><p>He looked away for a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me with you every second, Nina. You seem happier sometimes when I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think because you sensed that I was happy this afternoon it was because you weren\u2019t there? Don\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d I scolded.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s good for you to spend time with your friends. I loved watching you laugh with them. You haven\u2019t laughed like that in a long time,\u201d he said as a smal smile materialized on his face. It looked unnatural against the worried set of his eyes.</p><p>I hopped on one foot to pul off one boot and then repeated the process with the other. My feet felt as if I\u2019d been trudging through a swamp from the uncharacteristical y warm weather outside.</p><p>\u201cJared, what is it? Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shifted. \u201cCan we not talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know,\u201d I said, keeping myself in his line of sight.</p><p>Jared sighed and cringed at the words he was about to speak. \u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re happy you and Ryan are friends again. Believe me when I say that as long as it makes you happy, I want that for you. But I\u2019m in love with you, Nina. I can\u2019t help but be a little worried knowing what I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel that way about him, Jared. You have to sense that,\u201d I said, touching his arm.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes tight. \u201cI don\u2019t think it wil ever become easier to watch him make you laugh, though.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed his face and tried another reassuring smile, but it fel short.</p><p>I raised one eyebrow. \u201cJared Ryel, are you jealous?\u201d</p><p>Jared raked his hair with his fingers and let them slide to his neck, rubbing it nervously. \u201cYou asked, Nina. I told you the truth.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head no. \u201cI\u2019m...,\u201d he pressed his lips together and shook his head yes with a few quick jerks, \u201ca little jealous, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jared positioned himself in front of me and cupped my shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you. Especial y after the morning we had compared to your afternoon with him. It wouldn\u2019t take much more of that for you to question why you chose me.\u201d</p><p>My feelings had betrayed me. Jared\u2019s connection to me had become stronger, and he could feel my relief to be around Ryan. He sensed the contentment I\u2019d experienced at lunch. My stomach reeled with guilt for indulging in such emotions. Nothing could compensate for the love and safety I felt with Jared.</p><p>My eyes fel to the floor when I realized how it must have hurt him. I was bathing in my temporary liberation from the madness that had exploded around me, and he must have thought I was glad to be free of him.</p><p>He could sense my feelings, but he didn\u2019t know the motivation behind them.</p><p>I continued to look down, picking at my nails as an excuse. \u201cIt was nice to have a little normal today, Jared. I do enjoy spending time with Ryan...with al of my friends,\u201d I looked to his face to gauge his reaction. \u201cBut do you honestly think I would trade being with you for one sil y afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t speak for a long while. I watched as several emotions scrol ed over his face; he seemed to appreciate what I was trying to say, but I could see the turmoil in his eyes.</p><p>Jared shook his head and tensed his arms around me. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, Nina...you\u2019re the only thing that gives me peace. It seems like I\u2019m the opposite for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t always seem like you\u2019re al that happy and peaceful with me,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>Jared\u2019s face crumpled. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that. I said this morning that I should have never sat on that bench...I didn\u2019t mean it. That was the beginning of the best moments of my life.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my cheek against his chest and relaxed into the heat that blazed through his t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cEverything around us is crazy,\u201d I said. \u201cBeing with you is the only thing that makes sense. You were so worried about the way I felt when I was with Ryan that you obviously missed the way I felt when I realized I was going to see you soon.\u201d</p><p>That caught his attention. \u201cWhen was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that was about me? It wasn\u2019t because you were with him?\u201dJared\u2019s eyebrows pushed up and then pressed together, looking somewhat disconcerted and touched at the same time. Realization hit him and the tension melted from his eyes. A few seconds later, a wide grin flashed across his face.</p><p>\u201cThat makes me happy,\u201d I said, matching his smile.</p><p>I leaned up on the bal s of my feet and kissed him. He tightened his grip around me and my feet slowly came off the floor. My lips were slow and deliberate. I wrapped my arms around his neck, happy that it was my turn to demonstrate my feelings with a kiss.</p><p>After a moment, he returned me to the floor. I pressed my forehead against his chest and sighed at the sil y misunderstanding. Jared was obviously more worried about my fate with Ryan than I thought.</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cIf I\u2019m happy when you\u2019re not around, it\u2019s because I\u2019m thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you couldn\u2019t say things the way I can?\u201d he beamed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the truth,\u201d I said in earnest. I was beyond pleased that he compared his always elegant articulation with my stunted, debilitated speech.</p><p>Jared kissed me again, this time scooping me into his arms and lowering me onto my bed. His lips traveled over to my ear, and then slowly made their way down my neck.</p><p>I slipped my hands under his shirt and ran my fingers up his back, marveling at the incredible muscles of his torso and his baby-soft skin. Jared pul ed his shirt over his head with one hand and tossed it onto the floor. As he did so, his muscles stretched and flexed under his skin, and the butterflies in my stomach erupted into a frenzy.</p><p>\u201cIs it hot in here?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cGetting pretty toasty,\u201d he smiled, leaning down to kiss me again.</p><p>I pul ed away from his mouth, sucking in a deep breath of air. His kisses were not the cautious kind. The electricity from his lips pulsated al the way to my toes. His mouth moved the way it did in his kitchen the night Claire made an unexpected a visit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely hot in here,\u201d I breathed. With that, I reached down and pul ed my sweater over my head. Jared pressed his torso against me and I moaned as the feverish temperature of his skin burned against mine. I took another deep breath between Jared\u2019s amazing kisses and pressed my fingers into his chest, pushing him away. Jared leaned back, surprised.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked, his breath quick and shal ow.</p><p>My breathing matched his. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me the truth. We love each other, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s been established that we\u2019re spending the rest of our lives together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he breathed, clearly impatient.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t stop,\u201d I begged, staring at his lips.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes radiated a sky blue as he pressed his mouth against mine. His fingers traced my col ar bone, catching the strap of my bra and slowly sliding it off my shoulder. Every inch of me felt tingly, and the nerves under my skin screamed in anticipation. I pul ed him against me as his lips touched the cusp of my bare shoulder. His mouth parted against my skin and his tongue tasted my flesh, giving rise to goose bumps when the air cooled the heat left behind. I wrapped my legs around him and my thighs automatical y tensed with an overwhelming sensation.</p><p>Jared pul ed in a ragged deep breath and firmly worked his mouth against mine. It had less caution than before, eager, a prelude to what we both knew was coming.</p><p>He leaned his cheek against mine to whisper in my ear. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around him, my body aching with a desire I had never felt before in my life. I was more than ready. \u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d I whispered, the need for him becoming almost painful.</p><p>I felt his hand slowly and deliberately glide down my side, over my bare ribs, past my hips to settle on the button of my jeans. Effortlessly he pul ed it open and the butterflies that had been in my stomach escaped to more southern regions. He steadied himself with one hand on the mattress as he slid his fingers down my hip, in between my skin and the denim. I let a sigh escape my lips, waiting for him to remove any clothing impudent enough to come between us.</p><p>\u201cWel , we can just get it at the....\u201d Beth said, pul ing her key out of the door as she walked through with Chad. \u201cOH!\u201d she squealed as Jared pul ed his shirt over me.</p><p>I cowered behind Jared\u2019s body, covering my face with one hand. \u201cHey, Beth,\u201d I said, stil trying to catch my breath and peeking at her through my fingers.</p><p>\u201cHey! What\u2019s up? I mean...how are you guys? I\u2019m...we\u2019re....\u201d Beth looked at Chad, mortified.</p><p>\u201cWe were just leaving,\u201d Chad said, pul ing Beth\u2019s arm with one hand and shutting the door with the other.</p><p>Jared playful y col apsed on top of me, and groaned with frustration.</p><p>I kept my hand over my eyes, too embarrassed and frustrated to speak.</p><p>Jared eased onto his side and pul ed my hand from my face. \u201cYou\u2019re blushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Jared kissed my hand. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think there is a reason for al the interruptions.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, holding my sweater.</p><p>I pul ed the thin lime green fabric from his hand and sat up.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing the constant interruptions mean is that one of us needs to change the locks,\u201d I grumbled, jerking my sweater over my head and buttoning my jeans. I smiled as an errant thought crossed my mind. \u201cWe have an entire week in Nicaragua.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWith Cynthia,\u201d Jared pointed out. \u201cI\u2019m there to work, you forget.\u201d</p><p>I felt the crease between my eyebrows deepen. \u201cYou promised it was going to be a real vacation.\u201d</p><p>Jared took my hand and held it between his, sitting higher on his elbow. \u201cIt wil be. For you and Cynthia.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes and reached for my phone, sitting up to through the numbers. I sent Beth a text message, giving her the al clear and to let her know I would be at study group later.</p> <p>Jared slipped his shirt over his head and then pul ed me onto his lap. My phone buzzed and I smiled at Beth\u2019s apology-ridden reply. I tried to send her back my unconditional forgiveness, but my attention was drawn to the nibbling at my neck.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said it was a good thing we were interrupted,\u201d I smiled, tilting my head against his tickling breath.</p><p>Jared\u2019s head jerked up to face me. \u201cI never said that. I said I was beginning to think there was a reason for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by that you mean...?\u201d I prompted.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about what Eli said. Surpassing a certain point of intimacy could hinder my ability to protect you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe also said they weren\u2019t sure because we\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure we should chance it,\u201d he frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? That we can never...?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his forehead to my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m saying that it might not be a good idea to test Eli\u2019s theory while we\u2019re in the middle of a war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cNina....\u201d</p> <p>I stood up and walked to the other side of the room, crossing my arms. \u201cNo, I get it. Abstinence it is, then. I don\u2019t want you upset that I\u2019m not taking things seriously, again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he said, patient, \u201cI\u2019m not happy about it, either. But I have to put your safety first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a Planned Parenthood commercial,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Jared burst into laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s not the safe I was referring to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, narrowing my eyes at his infuriating amusement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a woman so beautiful when angry...especial y when you\u2019re angry about this. It\u2019s very endearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad this is so entertaining for you,\u201d I said with thick sarcasm.</p><p>Jared shook his head, trying not to smile. He held out his arms. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p> <p>I stood there a moment, arms crossed, eying him suspiciously. The plan that he would change his mind from my protesting had backfired. He was maddeningly resolved.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to give in, but his arms looked so inviting I couldn\u2019t help myself. Before I knew what I was doing, I curled up in his lap.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me crazy, you know. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being so stubborn,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>Jared\u2019s shoulders shrugged around me. \u201cI\u2019m being cautious. Beth and Chad walked in on us.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him with a dubious expression. \u201cSince when do you care what other people think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear them. They caught me off guard,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>I felt one corner of my mouth turn up. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never happened before. I should have been able to hear them exit the elevator. I should have heard her pul out her keys. I heard nothing until they walked through the door. If that had been one of Shax\u2019s men, you would have been dead.\u201d</p><p>My grin faded quickly, and I struggled to push away any worry. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means Eli was right. When I\u2019m with you like that, I can\u2019t focus. I\u2019m not only fighting my feelings, Nina. When we\u2019re alone and things get intense, I struggle with your...desires as wel . Can you imagine what you were feeling doubled? It\u2019s impossible to think about anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubled? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible.\u201d As soon as the words stumbled from my mouth, I felt my face flush with crimson. \u201cI just meant that I wouldn\u2019t complain about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining,\u201d he said, kissing my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m saying we\u2019re going to have to wait until I can afford to be distracted. If anything happened to you ...I\u2019ve already put you in danger from my selfishness, Nina. I have to keep my priorities straight.\u201d</p><p>I grudgingly nodded. By keeping me safe, he was safe. I couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>Jared stood up, taking me with him. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here. Get some fresh air,\u201d he said.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cWe\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>Jared chuckled and held the door open for me. He had the quilt his father had bought me when I received my acceptance letter from Brown. It had the school colors in different scraps of fabric that somehow formed the Brown University crest.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that for?\u201d I asked, stopping in the doorway.</p><p>Jared shrugged, the blanket folded tightly under his arm. \u201cI thought we could hang out in the sunshine for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>I fingered the blanket with sentiment. \u201cI haven\u2019t used that blanket, yet. I\u2019ve been sort of saving it as a keepsake.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s mouth turned up into a half smile. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Gabe bought it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what he told you?\u201d he asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my mother make it for you when you were accepted into Brown. It makes sense, I suppose. He couldn\u2019t tel you it was from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis blanket was a gift from you?\u201d I said, my eyes wide with disbelief. \u201cLil ian made this?\u201d I touched the blanket as if it were gold.</p><p>\u201cYes. So you don\u2019t have to keep it preserved. We can use it for the first time together,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>I knew the touched look on my face was pathetic, but I couldn\u2019t help it. His first present to me had been sitting in my closet and I had no idea. \u201cAw!\u201d</p><p>Jared flinched. \u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018aw\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t change my ridiculous expression. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say \u2018aw\u2019 when your boyfriends give you junk,\u201d he said, his face twisting into disgust.</p><p>The wheels of my mind thrust into high gear, and I scanned over everything Stacy had ever given me, trying to remember if I was ever insincerely appreciative. I came up with nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only had two boyfriends, and neither of them gave me junk.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s face scrunched into a doubtful grimace. \u201cYou said \u2018aw\u2019 when Chuck Nagel gave you that crappy mixed tape.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fel open. \u201cIt was sweet! Do you know what lengths he must have gone to? Where would you get a cassette tape these days? And he wasn\u2019t my boyfriend,\u201d I argued, shuddering at the thought. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe you remember that!\u201d</p><p>Jared rol ed his eyes. \u201cI had to watch that simpleton pine for you for months. You may not have noticed him, but I did.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together in an amused smile. \u201cI love the blanket. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he beamed, kissing me.</p><p>What I thought would be a peck turned into a longer kiss, and with his free arm Jared pul ed me to him, pressing his fingers into my back. I found myself hoping he would pul me back into the room.</p><p>He leaned back with a jerk, keeping his eyes closed. \u201cWe\u2019d better go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaying on a blanket with me in public isn\u2019t so tempting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, nodding once.</p><p>We walked to the Main Green hand in hand, weaving through the sea of students. On the few warm days during the school year, the campus lawn went from being desolate to bustling with movement in every direction.</p><p>The clusters moved in a distinct way. A game of touch footbal was in ful swing, guitars were being lazily strummed under the shade trees, and the more studious co-eds were hunched over a book. Blankets peppered the grass in vivid colors, creating a patchwork of chatter and laughter. It was a celebration without anything to celebrate, which made it more innocent, more enjoyable.</p><p>We settled on a spot by a tree near the center. With a flick of his wrists, the blanket under his arm unrol ed and slowly fel to the ground, perfectly flat.</p><p>I shook my head in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared asked, smiling cautiously. He sat on the edge of the blanket with his back against the trunk of a budding Tulip tree.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, standing in place while he clinched his jaw at my impertinence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to quit doing that. I\u2019d gotten used to knowing how you were feeling without the narrative, but now that I can ask you, when you don\u2019t tel me it nearly drives me insane.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at that. \u201cThen we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>Jared rol ed his eyes as I sat on the blanket. After a moment he smiled and pul ed me to his chest. I leaned back against him to rest my elbows on his thighs, letting the sunshine drape over me. I remembered what Jared had said about feeling happy with him, so I let the bliss I was feeling swel into unbridled ecstasy. I opened al of my senses, the warmth of the sunshine above me, the heat of Jared\u2019s skin below me, his amazing scent floating around us, the laughter in the background, and the convivial atmosphere.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Jared to react. \u201cThis is amazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I took the chance to make up for the rejection he\u2019d felt earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day and I\u2019m lying in the sunshine with the man I love. This is better than amazing. This is heaven,\u201d I smiled, closing my eyes to the sun.</p><p>Jared took a deep, satisfied breath and intertwined his fingers with mine.</p><p>We remained that way for a long time, listening to the laughter and babbling voices, their words blurring\u2014to me, at least\u2014around us. Jared jostled me a bit when his arm darted out and jerked. He had caught a footbal inches from my face.</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Nice catch! You wanna play?\u201d A winded male voice said from the foot of our blanket.</p><p>I lifted my hand to block out the sun in order to see the person standing above me. I didn\u2019t recognize him. He was tal and slender, had shoulder- length brown hair, and was wearing only a pair of long khaki cargo shorts and running shoes. His hand was outstretched for the footbal Jared had caught.</p><p>\u201cHe looks pretty busy to me, Zack.\u201d</p><p>I recognized the voice right away; it was Ryan. His chest heaved as he struggled for breath, and his bare chest revealed the scar from where he\u2019d been stabbed. I felt a twinge in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I blame him,\u201d Zack said, smiling down at me.</p><p>\u201cDid you throw that at me?\u201d I asked Ryan, knowing I wouldn\u2019t be surprised either way. It was his idea to come to the Main Green with a blanket, and I turned him down only to come here with Jared.</p><p>\u201cNo! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d think that!\u201d Ryan scoffed.</p><p>\u201cThat was me, sorry about that,\u201d Zack said to Jared, breathless, resting his hands on his hips. \u201cCan we have our bal back?\u201d</p><p>Jared showed no signs of surrendering the bal . \u201cI think you owe her the apology, not me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan rol ed his eyes and looked at me, and then to Jared. \u201cIt was an accident, Jared. Give him the bal .\u201d</p><p>Jared waited.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Zack said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have been more careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said, uncomfortable that Jared had forced him to apologize.</p><p>Zack eyed the footbal in Jared\u2019s hand. \u201cDid you want to play? We\u2019re short one player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to play. He doesn\u2019t want Nina to see him trip over his feet,\u201d Ryan snorted.</p><p>Jared stood up, towering over me and both of the other boys. He looked past Zack to the other team. Tucker and Josh stood among them, waiting on the opposite side of their mini-field. Jared reared back his arm and launched the footbal across the greens like a missile. It soared through the various tree branches, straight into Josh\u2019s chest. Josh caught the bal , but it stil made an audible thud that caused him to double over. He immediately stood up, although looking somewhat like a hunchback, trying to mask the fact that the wind had been knocked out of him.</p><p>Zack and Ryan had matching shocked expressions. I smiled at their surprise.</p><p>\u201cI am busy. My feet have nothing to do with it,\u201d Jared said, reaching for my hand to pul me up to stand beside him. He leaned over to kiss my forehead.</p><p>Ryan reacted with disgust.</p><p>My heart fluttered in my chest at the testosterone in the air, and Jared looked down at me. \u201cUnless you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>A wide smile spread across my face. \u201cAbsolutely not. Go get \u2018em tiger.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed each side of my face and planted a quick kiss on my lips. His eyes narrowed as he looked across the grass to the other team. \u201cI assume we\u2019re skins.\u201d</p><p>Zack nodded and Jared pul ed off his shirt, handing it to me. I was supposed to be good, but it was hard seeing him so animated, not to mention half-naked.</p><p>Jared pressed his cheek against mine. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tone that down or I\u2019m going to get pummeled,\u201d he whispered in my ear.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cLike it would hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He jogged out with Ryan and Zack, and the other team met them in the center of the grass.</p><p>I watched them over the next hour. The skins team quickly realized that with Jared they had the clear advantage. Zack assigned Jared the quarterback position, and I laughed and cheered as his team ran in one touchdown after another. Before long, they had drawn quite the crowd. A smal group of girls were soon drowning out my feeble cheering each time Jared made a play.</p><p>Jared\u2019s face was exultant, and I wondered when the last time was that he was free to let loose. He\u2019d always had to keep an eye on me from afar, and now that I was just yards away he had more time for himself. I realized that it was like that at night as wel , and guilt swept over me for making him spend the night in his car instead of beside me in his warm bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared fired the bal in a perfect spiral, and Ryan caught it flawlessly for the winning touchdown. The crowd cheered, and Josh\u2019s team ambled around their side of the makeshift field, notably less enthusiastic.</p><p>Jared jogged over to me, glistening with sweat and grinning from ear to ear. He lifted me and then twirled me around, kissing me with boyish enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou were amazing!\u201d I squealed.</p><p>Jared lowered me to my feet. \u201cAgh...I\u2019m sorry honey, I\u2019m al sweaty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d I said, flinging my arms around his middle.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d he asked. When I nodded, he cleared the crowd from our blanket.</p><p>As Jared shook off grass and folded, Ryan approached us. \u201cGood game, Jared,\u201d he said, sounding only half-sincere.</p><p>I heard Jared mumble a thank you as he tried not to watch us converse.</p><p>\u201cYou were great!\u201d I said, waiting as others agreed with me. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say you\u2019re ful y recovered.\u201d I held up my hand for a high-five and Ryan smacked it. His fingers intertwined in mine.</p> <p>I instinctual y pul ed my hand back, tucking my hair behind my ear to avoid drawing any more attention to the situation.</p><p>Ryan smiled. \u201cThanks. I\u2019l see you in a couple of hours, okay? You want me to swing by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l meet you there. I have a few things to do, first.\u201d I said.</p><p>Ryan stared at me as if he was debating something, and then he leaned over to kiss my cheek, his lips soft against my skin. I gave him an awkward, polite smile and then he walked away. The excited chatter around us died down dramatical y, and I felt everyone\u2019s eyes on me.</p><p>Jared glared at Ryan as he walked away. I met him in the middle of the dispersing crowd and took the blanket from his hands.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I asked, trying to sound unconcerned.</p> <p>Jared\u2019s eyes hadn\u2019t left Ryan\u2019s back; he looked as if he wanted to punch a hole through it. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said through his teeth.</p><p>Jared took my hand and led me through the stragglers that stil meandered around us. He stopped at the door of Andrews as he opened it for me.</p><p>\u201cClaire is close. I\u2019m going to run home...get a shower. I\u2019l catch up with you later.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re going home?\u201d</p><p>Jared smoothed his features and chuckled. \u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go find Ryan or anything, are you?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tensed. \u201cNo. But if Claire wasn\u2019t his...he gets under my skin.\u201d</p><p>I leaned in to kiss him. \u201cI\u2019l talk to him.\u201d</p> <p>Jared nodded and gave me an anxious look. \u201cYou\u2019re staying at Andrews tonight?\u201d</p><p>I fidgeted, trying to decide if my unwanted independence was real y more important than Jared spending the night in his vehicle to watch me.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes were suddenly bright and hopeful. \u201cSecond thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean...I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, unable to focus with the encouraged look on his face.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t deny that I would rather stay with him, and he was more than wil ing for me to change my mind. When I slept at Andrews, Jared was stuck outside in his SUV listening for trouble. I cringed at the thought. On the other hand, it was what he was used to, and by his own words he didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>Beth expected me home. When I stayed with Jared, she stayed with Chad, which is where everyone knew that was where she would rather be.</p><p>When my mind drifted to Ryan, I winced. I had already told him that staying with Jared was temporary. The thought of his reaction to my new living arrangements made my stomach twist with a sick feeling. I wasn\u2019t sure why I worried about Ryan\u2019s opinion so much. Something about hurting him just didn\u2019t feel right.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re al over the place,\u201d Jared said, visibly confused.</p><p>\u201cCal me later?\u201d I asked. It wasn\u2019t exactly a subtle evasive tactic, but it would serve its purpose.</p><p>Jared was resigned. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to more games. I\u2019m sure Josh wil want a rematch.\u201d I smiled and leaned toward him, staring at his lips.</p><p>Jared wrapped his arms around me, smiling at the thought. \u201cIt was fun. I\u2019m not sure about more games, though. I didn\u2019t mean to cause a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you play like a professional footbal player, Jared, you\u2019re going to draw a crowd.\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself. Every time I heard you cheering, I stepped it up a little more.\u201d</p><p>I raised a dubious eyebrow. \u201cYou could hear me over your groupies?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled, pecking me on the lips. \u201cBesides the fact that I could feel how proud you were,\u201d\u2014he kissed me again\u2014\u201cI could hear your voice from the stands in a stadium...at the Super Bowl.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me again, but this time his lips parted and he caressed my tongue with his. I tasted the combination of sweet and salty on his mouth, and when he pul ed back, I licked my lips before pressing them together.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that,\u201d he pleaded, staring at my lips.</p><p>\u201cHow do you expect us to live together if you can\u2019t handle me licking my lips?\u201d I teased, watching him scan my face with the same hunger in his eyes from before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l find a way. I\u2019l sleep on the floor if I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you sleep on the floor, I\u2019m sleeping on the floor with you. I want to wake up where you are.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cI wish that were true.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fel open. \u201cIt is true! You think me staying here during the week means I don\u2019t want to stay with you at al ?\u201d</p><p>Jared grimaced, shaking his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that. I shouldn\u2019t have said that, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d I said, bracing myself for what he might say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard getting used to the way things used to be, that\u2019s al .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou meant more than that.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked straight into my eyes. \u201cLet me move your things, then. I\u2019l have you moved in by the time you finish up at the Rock.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my feet. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Jared. I need some more time to think.\u201d</p><p>The answer should have been simple. I wanted to be there, he wanted me there, and we loved each other. But normal was here. I wasn\u2019t ready to give that up, yet.</p><p>Jared smiled half-heartedly. \u201cThat\u2019s what I meant.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, irritated that he had proved his point in that way. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his forehead against mine. \u201cI\u2019d better go. I\u2019l see you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooner than I\u2019l see you,\u201d I grimaced.</p><p>\u201cYou could change that if you weren\u2019t so worried about what everyone else thinks,\u201d he said, trying to keep the disappointment from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI told you that isn\u2019t the case. Wel , not entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I understand,\u201d he said. He kissed my forehead again before he left me to walk to my room alone.</p><p>I felt wretched. We\u2019d had a horrible morning, a heated afternoon, and then I\u2019d ruined it with my stupid, selfish, stubborn theories on normal. There were other reasons, but I couldn\u2019t pin point what they were. I just wasn\u2019t ready.</p><p>I walked into my empty room and sighed. I had a few hours yet before study group. Both Jared\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s sweat were on me, a scent mixed between Ryan\u2019s salty boy smel and Jared\u2019s salty angel smel . It only confused me more, so I made a bee line for the showers.</p><p>Under the steaming water, I couldn\u2019t help but think of Jared\u2019s shower. The water pressure was better, the smel was certainly better, and I didn\u2019t have to wear flip flops to walk around in it. I sighed again, knowing nothing would make me happier than to cal Jared and give him the green light to move my things. I couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sound of his voice when I broke the news to him, and how I would feel walking into the loft, knowing I was home.</p><p>As I walked down the hal way in my robe, I tried to come up with more pros than cons for staying at Andrews. I focused on what my father would want; at first I reasoned that he would want me to stay, but then my thoughts drifted to the fact that Jack would want me to be where I was the safest.</p><p>And I was definitely safer in Jared\u2019s arms. Loft...I meant the loft.</p><p>I closed the door behind me and pul ed off my robe. There was a knock on the door and I automatical y tightened my towel around me, anticipating Jared\u2019s smiling face at the other side of the door.</p><p>When I pul ed on the knob, Ryan stood before me, clean and dressed. He gave me an once-over as I stood in front of him shocked and stil dripping.</p><p>\u201cWel , hel o,\u201d Ryan said, his eyebrows shooting up in surprise.</p><p>I slammed the door in his face.</p><p>I pul ed on a pair of jeans and slipped on a random pink t-shirt before hearing a knock on the door once again.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d he said in a muffled voice.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute!\u201d I cal ed, feeling the blood rush to my cheeks. I opened the door once again, \u201cSorry,\u201d I breathed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to talk to you anyway,\u201d I said, stepping to the side.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. Hubby\u2019s jealous?\u201d he smiled, strol ing past me with his hands in his pockets.</p><p>I closed the door behind him and picked up a brush, raking it through my hair. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about him, it\u2019s about me. You can\u2019t kiss me like that, especial y with Jared right there. Did you honestly think that was okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just wanted to do it.\u201d</p><p>I threw my brush onto my desk and glared at him. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just do it. It makes things more difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor us,\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt makes it more difficult for us to be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I wasn\u2019t going to fight with you about Jared anymore, I never said I wasn\u2019t going to fight for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ryan rol ed his eyes and then smiled. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I heard the words, but I was stil processing what he\u2019d said before. I shook my head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ryan took a few steps closer to me and cinched his hands around my hips. \u201cYou heard me. I\u2019m not stupid; I can see what\u2019s going on with you and Jared. But I also see the way you look at me. And don\u2019t give me that crap about how you care about me because we\u2019re friends, either. It\u2019s something else and you know it.\u201d</p><p>I felt my cheeks flush. \u201cI know you\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve waited. I\u2019ve watched. Today I\u2019m sure. For whatever reasons you\u2019re refusing to acknowledge it, but you know it\u2019s there, same as I do. The only reason we\u2019re not together right now is because you met Jared first. That\u2019s not a good enough reason for me to walk away.\u201d</p><p>My stomach felt sick. I hadn\u2019t prepared for this conversation, and the fact that my boyfriend was listening didn\u2019t help. Jared was waiting for me to deny it. As much as I wanted to scream at Ryan to get out, I also knew that I couldn\u2019t eject him for the truth. That...and I wanted to him to stay. I couldn\u2019t tel him he was wrong when we both knew he was right.</p><p>Ryan took a step closer and grabbed the crests of my hips gently with each hand, grasping them a bit tighter as he inched closer. He closed his eyes, and I pressed my lips together, praying he wouldn\u2019t try to kiss me. I wouldn\u2019t kiss him back, but I couldn\u2019t tel him no. Either way I would hurt him.</p><p>He leaned in for a moment, waiting patiently.</p><p>I breathed out from my nose, letting my chest cave in. Something kept me where I stood, so it was the most I could move. Tears glossed over my eyes and I felt them burn, unable to close them or look away.</p><p>Ryan released my hips and took a few steps back, sitting on Beth\u2019s bed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Nigh. I\u2019m not going to make you choose. I\u2019l let you decide.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at him. I found a spot on the door and stared at it, a tear final y escaping down my cheek. In that moment it seemed fate had made the choice for me.</p><p>\u201cWould you say something already?\u201d he begged.</p><p>I thought my eyes might bore a hole into the door when I heard three consecutive knocks. I wiped my face quickly, terrified of who might be on the other side.</p><p>Ryan stood up and put his hand on the knob.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Five Days</p><p>\u201cAnd what have you two been doing in here?\u201d Kim teased, walking through the door. She looked at me and made a face. \u201cHave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>She glared at Ryan, then. \u201cAre you being a jerk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay...I think,\u201d he said, staring at me with a blank expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. I turned to the sink and splashed water over my reddened face. I twisted around to face them, drying my cheeks with a towel.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, turning to Ryan.</p><p>Ryan nodded and shrugged. \u201cI had to tel her sometime.\u201d</p><p>Kim looked at me. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, glowering at her. There would be hours of explaining, but it wouldn\u2019t be to Kim.</p><p>Kim\u2019s eyes widened with innocent surprise. \u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having this conversation right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina...,\u201d Ryan began.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Nina me. You show up here, unannounced, and then...say al this stuff that I\u2019m not prepared for. Damn it, Ryan! You\u2019re making this impossible!\u201d I was so grateful for the anger that I didn\u2019t stop to think if my words were making sense.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything you don\u2019t already know,\u201d he said, standing up.</p><p>I stomped over to the door and yanked it open. \u201cI want both of you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Kim tried not to laugh at my temper tantrum, and Ryan shoved his hands in his pockets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019l see you at study group,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I slammed the door behind them and stood in place, trying to slow my pulse. Adrenaline pumped through me like I\u2019d been in a physical altercation. I breathed in and out slowly and covered my face. That was it. Any chance we might have had to be friends was over.</p><p>My phone buzzed and I jumped. I hesitated before picking it up, and then peered at the lighted display.</p><p>It was Jared.</p> <p>With each ring, I wil ed myself to answer it but couldn\u2019t. The only explanation was the truth, and the truth would devastate him. The phone buzzed again, and I pressed the button, knowing if I didn\u2019t answer he would end up outside my door. I wiped my face and tucked my hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cHel o?\u201d I waited for a moment and my heart pounded through the silence.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he final y asked, the pain evident in his voice.</p><p>I pressed my lips together and clinched my eyes shut, trying not to cry. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, and then Jared\u2019s strained voice came across the receiver. \u201cYou\u2019re ready for what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to move my stuff...I\u2019m not going to study group, so I can help you. We can have my things moved by ten and we can go to bed and forget this ever happened. I won\u2019t talk to him, I won\u2019t go near him. I swear I won\u2019t.\u201d I tried to sound optimistic, but my voice broke over and over.</p><p>I heard a frustrated sigh. \u201cNina, you can\u2019t do that. He\u2019s your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. I wil ,\u201d I promised.</p><p>I waited for him to tel me that he didn\u2019t want a weak, faithless coward like me living with him, but he kept silent.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me now, do you?\u201d I asked, struggling to keep calm.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI want you. I\u2019l always want you. I want you here because you want to be, not because you want to prove something...to me or to yourself.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want you to come here because you don\u2019t trust yourself there.\u201d</p><p>I dropped the phone, covering my face with my hands. Why would he want me after what I had done? It was pathetic at best, and at worst it was dangerously close to being unfaithful.</p><p>I sat on my bed and rested my head on the pil ow, trying to cry quietly. I didn\u2019t want Jared to hear and feel worse than he already did. Ten minutes later I heard a knock at the door. When I didn\u2019t answer, it slowly opened. Jared stood at the door, looking as devastated as I felt.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said.</p><p>I sat up and wiped my face, trying to look him in the eyes. He walked over to me and pul ed me to my feet, wrapping his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come home with me,\u201d he said against my hair.</p><p>I nodded. It was the only thing I was capable of.</p><p>We kept pace with one another in silence down the hal . Jared didn\u2019t reach for my hand; he simply walked beside me, opening the various doors for me as we walked to the Escalade. When he pul ed away from the curb I struggled to keep the tears at bay.</p> <p>Jared reached over and gently placed his hand on mine. \u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I shut my eyes, praying he wouldn\u2019t offer further comfort.</p><p>He drove to the loft and parked. Neither of us moved after he switched off the ignition.</p><p>\u201cI can have Claire grab some of your things if you decide to stay,\u201d he said, looking ahead.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay?\u201d I looked down at our hands, afraid of his answer.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes darted over to me. \u201cDo you even have to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t want me. I\u2019m a horrible person. You must be so angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry. You feel bad enough for the both of us,\u201d he paused for a moment, and then continued. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. It\u2019s not even his fault...I did this. You\u2019re supposed to be with him,\u201d he said, his voice breaking at the end.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I have a say in who I want? Don\u2019t I have a choice? I don\u2019t feel that I do. Even you act as if I don\u2019t. No matter what I do, I lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Nina. I could just be in the way.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, refusing to even consider that.</p><p>Jared gently pul ed my chin to face him. \u201cHe said he wouldn\u2019t make you choose. But if you don\u2019t have a choice, I\u2019m the one that loses. So I\u2019m going to make you choose, Nina. Choose me. Please....choose me.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><p>I held his face and kissed him tenderly, pul ing back to look into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve already made my choice, Jared. I\u2019l make it a thousand times if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Jared buried his face into my chest and I held him to me, knowing he was as close to despair as I was. He had promised to fight fate for me, but I could see he was terrified that the fight wasn\u2019t his at al \u2014it was mine.</p><p>The next morning I felt marginal y better. The fact that Jared\u2019s arms were around me made the world seem right again.</p><p>\u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I turned over and pressed my cheek into his chest. \u201cLike a rock. I don\u2019t remember fal ing asleep. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cAl right, I guess. For me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get more than an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not real y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep at al , did you?\u201d I grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI had a lot to think about,\u201d he justified.</p><p>When he noted my expression, he leaned down to kiss the top of my head and hugged me to him. \u201cThere are a lot of things for me to think about right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you get in the shower, and I\u2019l get us breakfast. Waffles sound good?</p><p>\u201cWaffles sound great. Don\u2019t change the subject.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to start out the morning rehashing the chaos. Let\u2019s just have a normal morning, okay? You have a test in a couple of hours and I\u2019m just about ready for Little Corn. Once we get those out of the way, we can talk the whole thing to death to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d</p><p>I ignored his dig. \u201cLittle Corn. Mmmmm. Hammocks, sun, beach, ocean...that sounds even better than waffles.\u201d</p><p>I left the bed, pul ing off his shirt on the way to the bathroom. I tossed the crumpled fabric into the hamper as I passed. Jared\u2019s footsteps stopped abruptly and I smiled as I heard him continue down the stairs with a loud, flustered sigh.</p><p>The next days passed quickly. Before I knew it, the tests were over, the papers were turned in, and school had been dismissed for Spring Break. I spent Friday night with Jared, but even in his warm arms I was too excited to sleep. Saturday was spent packing, and I teased Jared with the dozens of bikinis I\u2019d purchased for the trip.</p><p>Sunday final y arrived. I could barely contain my enthusiasm when I stepped out onto the tarmac. Cynthia had chartered a jet for our trip, as my father had always done. I had never understood before, but seeing the crates being wheeled in and loaded, I knew that flying commercial y wouldn\u2019t be possible. I tried to remember earlier vacations, scanning my mind for similar memories of Jared or Gabe directing traffic and giving orders as I boarded the plane. There was none. My only memories were of the smiling faces of our flight attendants as I was led into the fuselage by the large hand of my father.</p><p>I fol owed Cynthia up the stairs and tried not to stare at Jared as he handed our luggage to a man wearing a blue jumpsuit. I wasn\u2019t sure how many people worked in the background when we left the country, but it seemed to be a ful blown tactical operation. Even knowing the truth, the activity around the plane seemed like needless fuss.</p><p>Jared was al business. He seemed at ease giving orders and organizing the details of our flight, arrival and return. The men loading the plane worked fervently on each of his specific instructions, seeming to be afraid to make a mistake. When Jared spoke to one or a few, they listened with nervous obedience. He exuded control and leadership, and my heart raced in my chest.</p><p>Jared turned around once to look at me, and I waved. His mouth turned up into a warm smile before turning away from me with the no-nonsense expression he used with the crew.</p><p>I counted one large crate and three smal er crates. The luggage had been loaded, including an entire set belonging to Cynthia. My mother had never been one to pack light.</p><p>I tried to suppress my excitement when Jared finished and began to board the plane. He trotted up the stairs in a crisp white button down shirt and jeans and walked down the aisle, breezing right past me.</p><p>My expression compressed into a disappointed frown. Jared was going to insist on just being my protector during this trip. My first inclination was to cross my arms and pout, but I restrained myself so I wouldn\u2019t have to listen to Cynthia lecture me on Jared\u2019s priorities.</p><p>Jared plopped down in the empty seat beside me and fastened his seat belt. He let out an exhausted sigh and leaned over to kiss me on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more work when I\u2019m by myself. I should have brought Bex,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>I stared at him for a moment, concentrating on keeping my heart rate at a normal pace and my smile polite. I didn\u2019t want him privy to the fact that I was giddy about him being as much my boyfriend on this trip as protector.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cIs that what it was? I wondered why you were so keyed up. I thought you had developed a sudden phobia of flying.\u201d</p><p>I felt the blood rush to my face when the realization came as to why he had turned around and grinned at me from the tarmac. He could sense what I felt as I watched him.</p><p>I feigned insult. \u201cI\u2019ve never been afraid to fly.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s expression turned dubious. \u201cImpressed with what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cJust watching you give orders and how they reacted to you. I haven\u2019t seen that side of you. It was very...appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what impresses you? Interesting,\u201d Jared said, considering that for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s more than that. You impress me al the time,\u201d I said, scanning his face.</p><p>Jared leaned his head against the seat, staring into my eyes. He was clearly amused by the conversation. \u201cReal y? And here I thought I needed to work harder,\u201d he smiled, leaning toward me.</p><p>I leaned in for a kiss, but he took each piece of my seat belt and fastened it snuggly across my waist.</p><p>I smiled and sighed, gazing out the window at the various crew members on the run way. I could feel Jared\u2019s warm breath on my neck; he was looking out the window over my shoulder. The exhilaration I always felt before a trip mixed with the elation of being virtual y alone with Jared for five days made it almost impossible to sit stil .</p><p>\u201cAre you al right? Your heart is going to take off before the plane,\u201d Jared whispered into my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy,\u201d I said, stil looking out the window.</p><p>The pilot came over the intercom and spoke directly to my mother, tel ing her our position in line for take-off, the expected flight time and the current weather in Nicaragua.</p><p>The plane pul ed forward and we taxied to the runway. Jared grabbed my hand and interlaced his fingers with mine. He leaned his head against the seat and watched me with his light blue-grey irises, a content grin spanning across his face. I smiled and closed my eyes as the plane suddenly gained momentum. The fuselage shuddered and then transformed into a weightless, graceful vessel the second we left the ground.</p><p>Jared informed me that from the big island, there would be a water taxi that transports guests to Little Corn, but the smal boat wouldn\u2019t be possible with the crates of expensive surveil ance equipment. He\u2019d contracted a larger water craft to take us over and arranged for a car to take us to Casa Iguana, where we would be staying.</p><p>\u201cJust a head\u2019s up, you won\u2019t see me for several hours when we first get there. I\u2019l be setting up a perimeter and situating the equipment. Cynthia\u2019s reserved three cabins. She has the grand casita...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...and you and I have deluxe casitas. They\u2019re not bad for little cabins nestled in the side of a cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cliff? Where\u2019s the beach?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled his patient smile. \u201cClose. Just a two minute walk. The cliff cabins are more private. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guardian angel is with me. What could I possibly be worried about?\u201d I grinned, kissing the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He smiled at my words and continued. \u201cIt wil take some time for me to get set up, so that should give you time to get unpacked and settled into your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree cabins seem wasteful to me. Why don\u2019t I get settled at your place while you set up?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head, amused by my idea. \u201cMy place wil be ful of monitors and computer equipment. Not exactly a romantic setting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d I lilted, my voice sickeningly sweet. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be romantic?\u201d</p><p>He wrinkled his nose. \u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018aw\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I giggled and leaned my head on his shoulder, settling in for the rest of the flight.</p><p>We arrived on Corn Island in the early afternoon, and I began peeling layers. Two men, one shorter than I and the other as tal as Jared and twice as wide, met us just yards from the plane. Several other locals stood behind them, ready to work and a bit intimidated. I looked at Jared and couldn\u2019t fathom why they would regard him in such a way. I had seen him look far more menacing than he did now.</p><p>I quickly discerned that the two men standing in the front of the others were our drivers, and beyond them and the smal workforce were their two waiting vehicles. A car that might have doubled as a taxi cab sat with open doors and a rusty, white moving truck waited for the crates.</p><p>I waited for Jared to demonstrate his fluent Spanish, but to my surprise he and the driver conversed in the only language I understood.</p><p>Once again Jared took charge, issuing orders and getting the crates and our things secured in the vehicles. I stood next to him this time, and I was more than pleased when he took my hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready, Mr. Ryel,\u201d the short man said with a thick Spanish accent and a discolored smile.</p><p>\u201cThe boat is waiting, correct?\u201d Jared asked in a commanding, dispassionate tone he\u2019d never used with me.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. The boat crew wil take you to the Little Island and has been given instruction. You wil be quite satisfied, Mr. Ryel. You and the wife wil have a happy time.\u201d</p><p>I felt the blood rush to my cheeks as the smal man nodded to both of us with a grin so wide it made his eyes close. Jared squeezed my hand, pul ed it up to his mouth and pressed his lips to my fingers, keeping my hand against his chest. His eyes turned a bit softer as he thanked the man and handed him several American bil s.</p> <p>When we went on holiday during my formative years, I loved to pretend. I felt I could be whoever I wanted when we left Providence, and of course Jack encouraged my fantasies. Mostly I was a princess; a few times I posed as a famous ice skater, and once I was even an up and coming young actress. With my father keeping drivers and assistants, it was easy to appear as someone important. Letting the locals think I was Mrs. Jared Ryel was by far the best role I\u2019d ever played on vacation. I righted my posture; I was flattered by what was being assumed and wanted to portray my part to perfection.</p><p>Forty-five minutes after we left the wharf, our boat pul ed next to another dock, and the fresh hands of the boat crew went into action. Instead of pacing back and forth, they walked down the sand-covered pier to a trail, continuing around a corner past the thick, lazily bent trunks of native palm trees.</p><p>We fol owed the same path the crew had taken to another set of aging vehicles. Jared informed me these were two of just a handful of automobiles on the island. That fact came to light when I noticed some of the inhabitants straddling their bicycles and staring at our caravan with minor curiosity.</p><p>The morning had disappeared and evening quickly approached by the time I had settled into my room. At first glance, I was wary of what I would find inside, but once I climbed up the steps of my whimsical y painted bungalow, the inside was spacious and clean. Palm trees surrounded my temporary residence, and I noticed Cynthia\u2019s casita peaking out of the trees to one side of me, and Jared\u2019s on the other.</p><p>I splashed my face with water and changed into the turquoise maxi dress I had bought a week before just for the trip. I tied the halter around my neck and chose a pair of sandals from my newly organized closet.</p> <p>I plodded over the dirt trail to Cynthia\u2019s cabin and found her already on her spacious veranda reading one of the many books she\u2019d packed. She wore a large brimmed hat and square shaped sunglasses, her legs stretched across an adjacent chair, properly crossed. Even in her remote casita, she remained a lady.</p><p>\u201cHel o, Dear,\u201d she said, laying her book pages-down in her lap.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. How\u2019s your cabin?\u201d I asked, taking a seat beside her.</p><p>She leaned toward me and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. And yours? What do you think about the island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy room is great. I\u2019m not sure about the island, yet, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be... interesting. No cars, no jet skis, no phones, no Wi-Fi, col ected rain for water...not exactly what I imagined when you said you wanted to vacation in the Caribbean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you and Jared wil find something entertaining to do. There\u2019s snorkeling, fishing, and so on. Take care not to burn,\u201d she said, returning to her book.</p> <p>I took that as my cue to let her be. I strol ed back to my cabin and decided to continue my walk, fol owing a trail that led me to the beach in minutes. I gasped at the sight of it. The fishing boats on the horizon, the clear water and the Technicolor clouds were beginning to glow blues and yel ows from the descending sun; it al would have been the perfect shot for a postcard.</p><p>\u201cIncredible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jared said from behind me, folding his arms around my waist.</p><p>I leaned my head against his chest and stared out onto the ocean. \u201cI think it\u2019s the company more than anything,\u201d I said, relaxing into his arms.</p><p>He pressed his lips against the bare skin of my shoulder and I smiled at the warmth left behind. \u201cYou are absolutely beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and slipped my arms under his and tightened them around his middle. He was stil in his crisp white shirt and jeans, but his sleeves were rol ed up and he had changed into a pair of casual sandals.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you correct the driver when he cal ed me your wife?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI guess I just liked the sound of it so much I couldn\u2019t tel him he was wrong. Did it offend you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot at al . I\u2019ve always liked to pretend on vacation.\u201d</p> <p>Jared raised one eyebrow, amused. \u201cAre you royalty this time or an award winning actress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d I laughed. \u201cApparently this trip I\u2019m Mrs. Jared Ryel.\u201d The words rol ed off my tongue like I had spoken a beautiful foreign language. It felt strange to say the words together, yet it was familiar somehow.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cWel ...pretend if you like. There\u2019s only so much longer you can do that.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me. Only five days left and we haven\u2019t even started, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for the remainder of our trip, sweetheart. You can\u2019t pretend to be Mrs. Jared Ryel when you are Mrs. Jared Ryel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, processing his last sentence.</p><p>He looked down at me with the softness in his eyes that he reserved only for our sweetest moments. I took in a deep breath and let a broad grin spread across my face. As talented as I had become over the years at false impersonation during vacations, I couldn\u2019t pretend not to be overwhelmingly besotted by his sentiment.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we walk down to the vil age?\u201d Jared suggested. Sliding his hands down my arms, he took a few steps backward and pul ed me along with him.</p><p>\u201cI say yes,\u201d I chirped, stil high from the euphoria I had felt just moments before.</p><p>At a leisurely pace, Jared and I walked hand in hand down a dirt road\u2014it wasn\u2019t even a road, real y, more like a double path that had been worn by bicycles, scooters, and the occasional vehicle.</p><p>We approached a fork in the path that bore a sign directing us to the nearby vil age.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the smal huts and aluminum buildings of the vil age came into view. There were clusters of locals at each one conversing and watching us walk past. Some were smiling at us and some were eyeing us indifferently before returning to their various conversations.</p><p>I didn\u2019t see a single tourist shop, although there were craftsmen sel ing various items.</p><p>We entered a hut that appeared to be a combined blacksmith and jewelry stand. Jared watched me look over the rings, necklaces and ear rings, some with shel s, some with gems, although roughly cut and not one of them held with prongs or soldered. One ring in particular caught my eye. The band was silver, and at first glance there seemed to be tiny shel s fastened to it in decoration, but when I looked more closely, I could see the two dozen or so miniscule gems appeared to be rough, uncut diamonds fastened to the ring with a tiny wire.</p><p>\u201cYou like that one?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very unique,\u201d I said, stil staring at the indentations of the band.</p><p>The man held it closer for me to see. \u201cThis is real silver,\u201d he boasted proudly. \u201cWe hammer it...see here?\u201d He pointed to the indentions in the band.</p><p>\u201cPolished by hand and hardened in the tumbler. The diamonds are hand-fastened with the wire. Ten gauge wire, see...?\u201d He made a show of rotating the ring to show how secure the diamonds were. \u201cMade right here,\u201d he beamed. \u201cVery beautiful. You try on?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled patiently to the vendor and held out his hand. The man placed the ring into Jared\u2019s palm and he lifted my hand, sliding it on my left ring finger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little big, but it fits,\u201d he approved, looking up at me from under his brow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful....\u201d I trailed off, eyeing it for a brief moment before taking it off. \u201cThank you. Have a nice day,\u201d I said, nodding.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what expression was on my face, but Jared chuckled and shook his head. His arm hooked over my shoulder and he pul ed me affectionately to him, kissing my cheek. He was remarkably different in this place than in Providence. The clouds in his eyes had been noticeably absent since we\u2019d boarded the plane in Rhode Island, even while he dealt with organizing the crews and getting us and our things to each point in the journey. It was a nice change from the turmoil and angst he usual y dealt with concerning our relationship. If it were even possible, I had fal en in love with him al over again.</p><p>We meandered to the end of the road, which consisted of four more brightly colored sheet-metal huts, two on each side. Some of the locals had congregated on one side playing their various instruments. The music was a lively blend of Latin and Caribbean, and it seemed to float in the air perfectly with the heat and humidity. Jared led me to where they were gathered and we watched them clap and play. They smiled at us as we approached, and then the man strumming the guitar gestured with a nod behind us. We turned to see an older couple from the other side of the street march to the beat until they were in the middle, and then they danced together.</p><p>Another couple joined them and then the guitar player cleared his throat to draw our attention. He nodded again to the street and spoke again, this time to Jared.</p><p>\u201cYou dance? Take your wife to dance!\u201d he urged with a smile, gesturing again with a nod out to the other couples.</p><p>Jared smiled and looked down at me. \u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d</p><p>A sudden feeling of nervousness came over me, but the eager expression on Jared\u2019s face made it impossible to say no. He pul ed me to the center of the dirt street and twirled me around to the beat of the music. We danced for several songs, laughing as the people around us clapped and cheered. Jared effortlessly spun me around the improvised dance floor. My dress fanned out with every turn and my sandals kicked dirt against my legs. Soon I was breathless, but Jared didn\u2019t seem to be remotely tired.</p><p>As the sun set the music slowed, and Jared pul ed me close. My mind flashed back to the first time we danced at the pub, and I remembered what it felt like to be that close to him when he was al but a stranger to me. Just a couple of months later, we were in a foreign country, on a tiny island in the Caribbean Sea, dancing together in the middle of a dirt laden street among strangers, posing as husband and wife. Although both instances would be moments I would forever regard as precious, Corn Island was magical.</p><p>Once the song was over and the beat picked up again, Jared pul ed away from me with an apologetic smile. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be dark soon and you\u2019ve had a long day. We should head back.\u201d</p><p>I heaved a resigned sigh, pul ing my mouth to the side in disappointment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l come back,\u201d he assured me, lacing his fingers in mine as we waved goodbye to our new friends.</p><p>\u201cYes! You come back! We\u2019l play more music for you!\u201d the guitarist said.</p><p>Jared walked over to him, shook his hand and pressed a twenty in his palm.</p><p>\u201cThank you. We had a wonderful time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem! You come back anytime!\u201d The man smiled, even more animated than before.</p><p>We waved again before returning the way we came. Once we passed the fork in the road, Jared scooped me up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNew shoes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re rubbing against your toes. You don\u2019t want to get blisters your first day here. We have a lot to see, yet.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou sense my feelings and you can pin point exactly where I\u2019m uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you that already. But it is getting stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I stil haven\u2019t gotten used to the feelings-thing. It\u2019s....\u201d I wrinkled my nose trying to think of an adequate word.</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d he finished for me. \u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his cheek enthusiastical y. \u201cIt\u2019s already been an incredible vacation, and we\u2019ve only been here a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this to be the best vacation you\u2019ve had...so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMission accomplished,\u201d I whispered, running my nose along his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to trip over something if you don\u2019t stay away from my ear,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d I said, lightly biting his earlobe. I\u2019d only meant to tease him, but a quiet moan escaped with his sigh.</p><p>\u201cNina, please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes someone have an ear fetish?\u201d I taunted, grazing the edge of his ear with the tip of my tongue.</p><p>He abruptly set me on my feet. I pressed my lips together and tried not to burst out in laughter.</p><p>\u201cWel . That\u2019s something you didn\u2019t tel me on our first date,\u201d I giggled.</p><p>Jared tried his best to be annoyed with my teasing, but his face twitched until a grin broke out across his face. \u201cThat\u2019s probably because I didn\u2019t know, then.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced, knowing he would add this to the list of rules. \u201cOne more thing I\u2019m not al owed to do.\u201d</p><p>He scooped me up into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m already fighting with myself every second I\u2019m alone with you, Nina. You...in this dress...as beautiful as you are. Not to mention feeling how happy you are with me, in this place.\u201d</p><p>He sat me on my feet again and I realized we were already at my casita. I looked over to see Cynthia note our return. Satisfied, she blew me a kiss and retreated inside for the night.</p><p>It was only then that I realized my mistake. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me sleep alone, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jared tenderly touched my face. \u201cIf I had my way, you\u2019d sleep in my arms every night for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d I said, unable to hide my relief at his answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a quick shower.

Jared watched me until I turned to wave at him from the inside of my screen door and then he disappeared behind the foliage.</p><p>The next morning, I woke up with a thin sheath of perspiration covering my body. Jared was lying next to me but, much to my chagrin, his arms were nowhere near me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he immediately asked, handing me a large glass of ice water.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you over there?\u201d I pouted, taking a large gulp.</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cNo air conditioning. I had to track down a fan,\u201d he said, nodding to the corner. A fan sat beside the futon, oscil ating slowly.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep it cool in the loft to compensate for you having to sleep with an electric blanket. Even on the particularly cold nights, I kept the heater off until morning so you wouldn\u2019t overheat. With the heat and humidity here....\u201d he trailed off, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYou were worried I\u2019d get too hot,\u201d I finished for him, trying to say it in the most diplomatic way possible.</p> <p>\u201cYou did get too hot, so I had to improvise...and you\u2019re stil sweating,\u201d he said, clearly dismayed at the situation.</p><p>I looked around to see that al the windows were open. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep last night.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed, frustrated. \u201cYou could have suffered heatstroke from sleeping beside your boyfriend and you\u2019re worried if I got my hour in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need more than an hour,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said, gulping more water down before setting the glass on the bedside table. \u201cI\u2019m going to take another shower, I\u2019m sticky.\u201d</p> <p>Jared nodded with a guilty expression and then retreated to his hut.</p><p>I showered and then dug through my pile of bathing suits. I held up a smal piece of fabric, finding what I hoped would render him speechless.</p><p>Interestingly enough, it was a one piece. It was blush pink, with a dramatic cut out so revealing it might as wel have been a bikini. Smal gold circles lined the missing piece and a single strap came over one shoulder, leaving the other bare. I stood brazenly at the screen door; hand on hip, waiting for Jared\u2019s reaction.</p><p>Jared kept his back turned. \u201cDo I want to know what you\u2019re up to?\u201d he asked, sensing my impish disposition.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you turn around and find out for yourself?\u201d</p><p>Jared slowly turned. The second I came into his line of sight his eyebrows shot upward and his mouth parted infinitesimal y. He struggled with words for a moment, and I beamed with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cFeel like trying out the beach today?\u201d I asked, smiling innocently.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said, his eyes scanning over every part of me.</p> <p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l get my trunks,\u201d he said, wheeling around to his cabin.</p><p>I giggled as I watched him swiftly vanish behind the palms and return within moments. He walked over to me in light blue board shorts and it was definitely my turn to be impressed.</p><p>We spent the morning playing in the water, diving through the waves and splashing each other. After an hour, Cynthia strol ed out of the trees and parked in a lounge chair, laying her book beside her on the sand. She had brought her camera with her and snapped shots of the ocean, of the fishing boats, of me, and of Jared and me. Jared even coaxed the camera from her and snapped a picture of me and her.</p><p>Jared handed the camera back to my mother and pul ed me off the sand, leading me out to the water.</p><p>\u201cYou can replace the one on your nightstand with the picture of us together,\u201d I said, thinking of the black and white photo beside his bed.</p><p>Jared smiled, splashing water my way. \u201cI\u2019l get another frame. I\u2019m keeping the one I have of you.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose in disapproval. \u201cWhy? It\u2019s a surveil ance shot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes grew soft as he scanned my face. \u201cI was taking some of the pictures that are now in Cynthia\u2019s safe. I snapped that one of you in the same afternoon...I wasn\u2019t sure why at the time.\u201d He grabbed my hand and pul ed me through the water to him. \u201cI took that the day I fel in love with you.\u201d</p><p>I felt a surprised grin spread across my face as my eyebrows rose. \u201cYou failed to mention that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never asked me to replace it before,\u201d he pointed out, pul ing me out deeper into the water.</p><p>After another hour, Jared talked me into returning to the sand to borrow the bottle of sunscreen Cynthia had purposely left behind when returning to her cabin.</p><p>I sprawled across the lounge chair and reached for the sunscreen bottle. It instantly disappeared from my hands and Jared squirted a large white dol op into his palm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to miss anything,\u201d he said, trying not to smile.</p><p>I leaned back, gesturing for Jared to proceed.</p><p>He began at the tops of my feet and massaged the lotion up one leg, and then the next. I\u2019d had several massages before, but Jared\u2019s hands were significantly different as they pressed into and over my skin with the perfect amount of pressure. I bit my lip when he covered the skin bared by the cutout of my suit with his hands, his fingers occasional y slipping ever so slightly under my suit. He final y made his way to the rest of my body and kissed my lips when he was finished with my face.</p><p>\u201cFront\u2019s finished,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>His head created a block to the sun that was directly above us, making his face black out and lining him in a bril iant halo of light.</p><p>I turned onto my stomach and Jared repeated the process again, this time beginning at my neck and working his way down. Once he finished with my ankles, I sat up and criss-crossed my legs. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to burn,\u201d I warned in a sing-song tone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t burn, Nina. Even if I did, it wouldn\u2019t hurt...the redness would go away in seconds.\u201d</p><p>I thought about that for a moment and then grimaced, looking out on the water. \u201cCan you drown?\u201d</p><p>He rol ed his eyes, amused at my question. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you did...wouldn\u2019t that kind of negate the whole you-only-die-when-I-do theory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an excel ent swimmer, Nina. And I seem to float easier than humans, so I\u2019m going to say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth would you know that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned proudly. \u201cThe Coast Guard guys hated me. I could out-tread any one of them by twice the time and come out of the water as fresh as when I\u2019d gone in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you train with the Coast Guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was fourteen,\u201d he answered matter-of-factly.</p><p>I shook my head, thinking about him blowing away every trainee at every training facility he\u2019d ever been at, making the recruits crazy with frustration at being outdone by a recent junior high graduate.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t object to a fourteen year old joining the ranks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe had more than enough connections to round out our training. Not to mention there are a few hal...Hybrids in the military and in the government. They\u2019re aware of our need to train, and that makes it easier.\u201d</p><p>I nodded as I contemplated Gabe\u2019s connections, wondering if the soldiers Jared trained beside suspected anything.</p><p>Jared rol ed his eyes again, this time in real frustration. \u201cWhy do you ask me things if it bothers you to hear the answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s just...surreal,\u201d I said, watching the sun glistening off the lotion on my skin. \u201cDon\u2019t you think about your life and who you are and just shake your head at how incredible it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s surreal to me is that you\u2019re sitting here speaking to me, that I can reach over and touch you,\u201d he said, touching my face, \u201cand that you love me. Sometimes I stil can\u2019t believe it\u2019s real,\u201d he said, pul ing me off the chair and carrying me to an empty hammock.</p><p>Once we were situated inside, swinging lazily back and forth in the shade, I kissed the skin just behind his earlobe. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who has friends mentioned in the Bible. I\u2019m not the one who heals amazingly fast, that can do anything and do it better than everyone else in the world...I\u2019m not the one that\u2019s practical y perfection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my perfection. I\u2019m al of those things for you,\u201d he said, shaking his head at what he considered a serious misapprehension. \u201cI exist for you, Nina. This mortal being so precious to the Creator of the Universe that it al owed for my existence. Tel me that\u2019s not incredible.\u201d</p><p>Words failed me. The only thought I could form was to kiss him, which I did, over and over. When the kisses became more intense, he gently restrained me and I smiled to hide my frustration.</p><p>We spent our days at the beach lounging and swimming, our evenings dancing and laughing in the vil age, and our nights in my cabin. While Jared and I swam in the clear water on Wednesday afternoon, the clouds rol ed in. The waves were soon the largest we\u2019d seen since our arrival and when we had to dive into the water regularly to keep from getting pummeled, Jared carried me back to the shore.</p><p>As soon as he stepped onto the sand, the rain began to fal . I looked up to the sky and smiled. The light, warm rain was a welcome change from the sharp, icy downpours of Providence. Jared and I raced to my casita\u2014which he al owed me to win\u2014and we parted ways to wash off the salt water in our respective huts.</p><p>Jared hadn\u2019t returned when I slipped on a pair of white canvas pants and a pink tank top, so I walked to his cabin in my bare feet. I could hear his music as I approached; I thought that he might stil be in the shower, so I knocked on the wooden border of his screen door.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Nina,\u201d Jared chuckled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to knock.\u201d</p><p>Jared relaxed with his back against the wal , lying on top of his perfectly-made bed. He was scribbling in a thick, brown book. The screen door whined as I stepped inside, and several smal lights caught my attention. Monitors and electrical equipment lined one side of the room.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou brought a stereo?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI take it everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have brought an mp3 player?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have music blaring in my ears while I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>I crawled in bed beside him and he pul ed me closer. \u201cI thought you could hear me over a stadium ful of people?\u201d</p><p>Jared wrinkled his nose. \u201cOkay, you caught me. I don\u2019t like the way those things feel in my ears.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip and leaned into his ear. \u201cBut I thought you liked things touching your ears,\u201d I whispered, brushing my lips along the ridge of his ear. He pressed his lips firmly against mine and in the same second, I was flat on my back. His reaction seemed automatic, and I was suddenly hopeful that his weakness was my best chance at changing his mind about waiting.</p><p>Just as I settled against him, he pul ed away.</p><p>\u201cYour lips are different than a pair of hard plastic speakers. Now behave yourself,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said unconvincingly, nestling in the crook of his arm. Listening to the rain tap out a soft song on the roof, I closed my eyes and smiled. It was the first time I had ever been glad for it to rain on vacation.</p><p>The pages of the book Jared held were ful of hand-written words. He had begun at the very top of the page, writing in tiny script, using every empty space available.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy journal. I thought I\u2019d get caught up. I\u2019m about a month behind. I didn\u2019t want to leave anything out,\u201d he said, kissing my hair.</p><p>\u201cYou keep a journal?\u201d I asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat else is there to do for the six or so hours I\u2019m awake at night?\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever write about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina, most of this book is about you,\u201d he said, as if it should have been obvious.</p><p>I sat up. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Jared grinned, amused at my reaction. \u201cYes. You don\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I believe you...I just....\u201d I looked down at the thick book, and noticed that there was only half an inch left to write in. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of pages.\u201d</p><p>His features softened as he scanned my face. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took notes on things I did?\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed. \u201cNo. Wel ...sometimes. Mostly I wrote about the way the things you did made me feel, or plans I\u2019d make, how I could get around Jack\u2019s wishes, how I would live without you, how I would make you happy. It got me through some rough nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything bad?\u201d</p><p>Jared grinned. \u201cWould you like to read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cried. Embarrassed that he thought that was what I wanted, I felt the familiar fire burn under my cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s your journal. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t keep secrets from you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hands and picked at my fingernails. \u201cIt\u2019s private. I wouldn\u2019t want you to read my journal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a journal. I probably would have read it if you did,\u201d he said offhandedly.</p><p>I looked up at him, shocked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding!\u201d he chuckled. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve written that I\u2019m ashamed of. I think it would be a good thing.\u201d</p><p>He closed the book and placed it in my lap. I was curious to know what the journal contained, but it felt wrong to read it, regardless of the permission I\u2019d been given.</p><p>\u201cNina. It\u2019s okay. Read it,\u201d he said, taking a finger and flipping open the cover to the first page.</p><p>I spent the stormy afternoon with my head propped up against Jared, reading his private thoughts. Once I\u2019d pored over the first few pages, the guilt slipped away and I found myself absorbed in every word. It was an odd sensation reading my memories from pages written at a time when I didn\u2019t know he existed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I chewed on my thumbnail as I read through my life from the outside. Jared played with my hair; otherwise he sat motionless and silent. Half way through one of his more lengthy entries, I realized it was written the night he\u2019d taken a bul et for me.</p><p>...Claire extracted the bul et. I\u2019ve been angry, but this time I was furious. I saw that bastard aim at her and I wanted to tear his head from his neck. I couldn\u2019t end his life fast enough. That\u2019s one less of Donovan\u2019s men that wil go after her, but it doesn\u2019t make me feel better. I can\u2019t figure it out. I yel ed at Claire to finish so I could go back to Nina. I couldn\u2019t even explain to Claire what I was so mad about, because I don\u2019t know myself. The need to get back to her was ridiculous, because I knew that Dad was with her. She\u2019d gone home by then, but I had to be near her and I was angry that I felt that way.</p><p>It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been addicted to her, but I didn\u2019t know it until tonight. As if I didn\u2019t already have to be near her to protect her, now I just need to be near her. It\u2019s infuriating.</p><p>So now I\u2019m here, watching her talk to Cynthia. I stil don\u2019t know what my problem is. For the first time, I was afraid that I would fail. And not just fail\u2014 that I would fail HER. Claire accuses me of being a perfectionist, maybe that\u2019s what it is. Or maybe I just didn\u2019t want to let her down. But why the hel should I care? She wouldn\u2019t know either way. I don\u2019t want her to die, but that should be obvious, right? She dies, I die.</p> <p>Maybe I just care. And that wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing... for me to care about her. She\u2019s a sweet girl. She\u2019s kind to others. She\u2019s intel igent. She\u2019s comical y stubborn. She does that cute tuck-her-hair-behind-her-ear thing when she\u2019s nervous. She\u2019s beautiful... unbelievably beautiful. Anyone with any sense would care about her...spending al this time around her, I guess it was inevitable. But this is more than just caring. If I wasn\u2019t bleeding al over myself I would have grabbed her and...I don\u2019t know. What am I thinking? She can\u2019t know about me. Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m angry about. Maybe I want her to know I\u2019m protecting her. I think a part of me wants her to know. She\u2019s walking around her house and has no idea that I saved her life today. And that should bother me WHY? She shouldn\u2019t know. She shouldn\u2019t know that I protect her or that I care about her or that I think she\u2019s beautiful. Wouldn\u2019t that be ridiculous if I had feelings for her? But maybe that\u2019s what it is. Maybe it\u2019s more than that. I think it\u2019s more than that.</p><p>I think I\u2019m in love with her.</p><p>I looked up from the pages of Jared\u2019s journal to see that he was watching for my reaction. I pul ed myself up quickly and scrambled to kiss him. His mouth turned up into a smile as I pressed my lips against his, so I pul ed back to look into his eyes. His expression was triumphant.</p><p>I took in a deep breath to speak, but Jared\u2019s face twisted into a frown. \u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018aw\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head quickly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t! I was most certainly not going to say \u2018aw\u2019. That was amazing, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should read the night of your sixteenth birthday. Or the day you graduated from high school. Or the night you went out with Philip Jacobs.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to relive my sixteenth birthday. And I know I don\u2019t want to relive the three hours with Philip Jacobs. Yech.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cI could read it to you. And I\u2019l leave out the parts you don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back against him, settling in to hear my life through Jared\u2019s eyes.</p><p>I was amazed at how much he loved me for so long, and how he fought the sometimes insufferable longing to speak to me. There were parts that were difficult to listen to, and parts that\u2014if I had wanted to interrupt him, which I didn\u2019t\u2014I wanted him to go back and read again.</p><p>He skipped to the entry he wrote the day of my high school graduation. He wrote how proud of me he was, and how beautiful I looked in my cap in gown. He spoke of how happy I felt and wondered where my col ege years would take us. Jared wrote a lot about being worried that once we gained distance between us and Gabe and Jack, that he would introduce himself.</p> <p>His eyes clouded over as he read to me his fears that I would fal in love with someone at col ege, and the unknown reaction he would have watching me be with someone in that way. I learned how devastated he was at the prospect that I would never know how much he loved me, and how he dreaded the day I got married and had children with someone else. Jared\u2019s voice broke as he read the words.</p><p>When he turned to the entry on the day that my father died, tears wel ed up in my eyes as he described watching Gabe fade away. Jared\u2019s hand tangled in mine as he spoke of the moment he stood a few feet away from me, watching me sob on the bench. When the bus left the curb, the fight in him to stay away from me was gone. The tone of the pages changed significantly after that.</p><p>Jared smiled as he cited the joy he felt every time he ran into me, the expressions and feelings I would have, and how it felt the first time I\u2019d said his name.</p><p>\u201cRead what you wrote today,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI wil later. The rain stopped,\u201d he said, shutting the book.</p><p>I looked up as I listened for the rain, but the only sounds were the intermittent dripping from the roof and the fronds of the palm trees, and the birds singing brightly just outside the cabin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d I asked, sitting up and stretching.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you show Cynthia around the vil age?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at his selfless suggestion, kissing him before I made my way to my mother\u2019s cabin. She was drying her chair with a towel, a book in her other hand.</p><p>\u201cHel o, Dear,\u201d she said. Her sunglasses moved up with her smile.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d like to go to the vil age with me. It\u2019s real y eclectic. I think you\u2019d like it,\u201d I said, resting my arms on the wooden railing.</p><p>Cynthia sat in her chair and opened her book. I knew the answer before she\u2019d given it.</p><p>She smiled politely as she always did before she diplomatical y turned down an offer. \u201cI think I\u2019l just relax here, Nina. Why don\u2019t you and Jared go exploring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been almost everywhere,\u201d I shrugged. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to go?\u201d</p><p>Cynthia didn\u2019t look up from her book. \u201cI\u2019m sure. Go have fun.\u201d</p><p>I clambered up the railing and leaned far over it to land a kiss on her cheek. She simply grinned and continued reading.</p><p>Jared waited for me outside his cabin. \u201cNo dice, huh?\u201d he said, opening his arms to hold me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never been this way. I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d I said, pressing my cheek against his chest.</p><p>\u201cShe just misses Jack,\u201d he reassured me. \u201cWhat do you say we rent one of those cycles from the vil age and take a ride up the coast...try to find a vil age we haven\u2019t seen, yet?\u201d</p><p>I smiled enthusiastical y and nodded.</p><p>Jared took turn after turn, indiscriminate of dirt or paved roads. A few huts came into view, and moments later we were in more of a town than a vil age. It looked like it might have been one of the more populated places on the island. Jared parked the bike and we walked along a cobble stone road. The buildings were less primitive than in the vil age we frequented.</p><p>The sunlight began to wane when Jared squeezed my hand. \u201cWe should head back. It\u2019s going to be dark soon.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, sad that another perfect day was over. Just as we turned around, a bel began to ring. I turned my attention in the direction of the beautiful tol ing and noticed a group of people standing together on a street corner a block away, staring in the same direction.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said, tugging on Jared\u2019s hand. \u201cI want to see what al the commotion is about.\u201d</p><p>Half way down the road, a bright white chapel came into view. I gasped as I watched a newly married couple walk slowly down the steep rock steps to the smal crowd that cheered, chanted and sang. Soon, they al began singing the same, happy song.</p><p>The group fol owed the couple down the street, clapping and singing in unison. The bel tol ed a few more times and, as if on purpose, rang one last time before the last of the joyful procession disappeared.</p><p>I looked back to the chapel, hypnotized by its beauty. It stood tal er than the other buildings with its meager two stories.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to look inside?\u201d Jared asked, gently tugging on my hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I just want to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jared murmured, obviously curious at my emotions.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t explain it, but I felt a bit weepy. It was as if the building had spoken to me, asking me to stay a bit longer. Jared wrapped his arms around my middle, touching his lips to my hair. I felt the sweat bead on the skin of my back that pressed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jared asked after several moments.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so beautiful,\u201d I said, my voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cNo...there\u2019s something....\u201d he said, clearly confused by my mixed emotions.</p><p>I leaned my head back against his chest. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get married in this chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d Jared asked. I turned to scold him for mocking me, but he had a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p><p>My grimace instantly turned into an appreciative grin. \u201cI\u2019d like to come back here...when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s irises glowed with the same azure blue as the sea. \u201cI would travel to the ends of the earth to marry you.\u201d</p><p>He grazed the line of my jaw with his thumb and pressed his lips against mine. I melted against him. Jared\u2019s grip tightened as he sensed my elation, and my imagination transformed my clothes into a white dress and Jared\u2019s khaki shorts and t-shirt into a suit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get back,\u201d he said, looking up at the dark clouds rol ing in from the horizon.</p><p>I nodded, and he led me away from our chapel. I watched it as we walked down the block until it disappeared behind the palm trees.</p><p>Friday morning came too soon, and Jared became the authoritative personality he transformed into when organizing the progression of our things from one point to another. Once in the air, Jared put his hand on mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet al morning. You want to talk about it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready. It went by too fast,\u201d I murmured, looking out the window of the plane.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l take another vacation soon. The moment you finish your last final, I\u2019l have Robert take us to the airport and we\u2019l get on a plane...just you and me. Somewhere with air conditioning,\u201d Jared promised, kissing my hand.</p><p>I sighed and nodded. Even though the prospect was infinitely appealing, I couldn\u2019t rise above the morose I felt.</p><p>Jared lifted my chin to look into my eyes, appraising my mood for a moment. He seemed to deliberate something, final y pressing his lips together.</p><p>\u201cI was going to wait, but I think I should give this to you now,\u201d he said, standing up to dig inside his duffle bag.</p><p>He sat down beside me and placed a smal woven box in my lap. \u201cOpen it,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>I pul ed at the lid. Sitting on tiny shreds of palm fronds sat the ring I\u2019d tried on in the vil age. A smile broke across my face.</p><p>\u201cYou liked that one, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved that one,\u201d I said.</p><p>The sadness from our departure intertwined with how touched I was that he somehow went back to the vil age and bought the ring without my knowledge. Tears formed rapidly in my eyes.</p><p>Jared lifted the ring and held it between his fingers. My eyes darted from his hand to his eyes; he seemed nervous about something.</p><p>\u201cI have a request,\u201d Jared said, smiling sheepishly.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cA condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no...just a request. Once I put this on your finger, I\u2019d like for you not to take it off until I replace it.\u201d</p><p>My pessimism al but forgotten, I didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to promise, it\u2019s just a request,\u201d he said, heartened by my reaction.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>Jared beamed as he slipped the silver band on my left ring finger. It fit perfectly.</p><p>\u201cYou had it sized?\u201d I asked.</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cI wanted it to be perfect.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at me each time he caught me lifting up my fingers to stare at my left hand. I was stil sad to say goodbye to our island, but knowing I had brought a piece of it with me made the trip home a bit easier.</p><p>Once we landed, I stepped onto the wet tarmac and pul ed my coat tightly around me. The bitter cold wind swirled around me, and I was glad when Jared offered his warm arms as insulation.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead with Cynthia? You don\u2019t have to stand in the cold with me,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>I began to argue, but I saw the clouds in his eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s brow fel inward, and I could see he didn\u2019t want to tel me. Beyond Jared\u2019s shoulder, a tal dark figure caught my eye.</p><p>\u201cSamuel?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cIt must be pressing, or he wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l meet you in the car.\u201d I choked back the tears. We had barely touched the ground and already the harsh reality of our lives in Providence insisted we pay it attention like a spoiled child.</p><p>\u201cIf you love him, you\u2019l have to accept that this is the way it wil be,\u201d Cynthia said apathetical y.</p><p>I watched Jared from inside the car. His expression was grave; it was not good news. He nodded once and walked towards the door Robert dutiful y held open. Samuel was no longer there. He didn\u2019t disappear, he didn\u2019t fizzle out or his form blink from the space it occupied; he was there one moment, and then he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Jared slid into the seat beside me. \u201cYou can go, now, Robert.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Robert said, nodding in the mirror and then looking ahead.</p><p>I watched Jared work to keep the tension from his face. I didn\u2019t need supernatural perception to know what he was feeling. He had the same look on his face when he pul ed the book from the safe. He was afraid.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The Last Supper</p> <p>Jared instructed Robert to drive us to the loft, and then take my things to Brown. I noticed that he didn\u2019t speak much on the way, but there was no point in trying to talk to him. Not with Cynthia sitting on the other side of me.</p><p>When the car slid in next to the curb, I kissed my mother goodbye. Jared led me up the stairs with one hand, his duffle bag and luggage in the other.</p><p>He put a few things away, and then trotted down the stairs.</p><p>From the railing I watched him mil about. I wasn\u2019t sure when reality would final y set in. His perfection was something only seen on the silver screen or a magazine cover, and yet he casual y walked around just below me. He was thumbing through his mail until he paused to look up at me.</p><p>\u201cEverything al right?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI should be asking you that, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not necessarily, why?\u201d His face was too relaxed, his features intentional y at ease.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tel me what Samuel said?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled, seeming to ignore my question. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your things, I had Robert take them to be laundered. We\u2019l pick them up later and swing by Andrews to get anything else you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared...Samuel\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLil ian wants to meet you,\u201d he interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cShe wants to meet me? But...I\u2019ve met her,\u201d I said, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cNina, you haven\u2019t been around her since you were a girl. And she wants to be properly introduced to my girlfriend, not to mention Bex has been dying to meet you. You\u2019re sort of a celebrity at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d I said dubiously.</p><p>Jared laughed. \u201cImagine your father guarding the king, and your big brother, whom you idolize, guards the princess. You\u2019ve never met either of them....wouldn\u2019t you be excited to hear that a princess is coming to dinner? He\u2019s eleven. He\u2019s excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Crime,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night. She\u2019s making pot roast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh! You\u2019re not fighting fair!\u201d</p><p>His face contorted from playful to concern. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to meet my family?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I want to meet your family. It\u2019s just that...being around your mother\u2014who I desperately want to like me\u2014and in the same room is Claire...who wishes me dead. It\u2019s going to be awkward.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled warmly. \u201cIt wil be fine. Claire wil be on her best behavior, I assure you. My mother is less forgiving about Claire\u2019s attitude than I am.</p><p>And you don\u2019t have to worry about Lil ian. She\u2019s always loved you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wondering what I had ever done to deserve her kind regard.</p><p>We set out on perfectly normal errands. He held me against his side while we waited for our developing film, and while walking the aisles of an antique store to find the perfect frame for our new picture. On the surface it appeared that our normal days on the island hadn\u2019t ended, but Jared had purposely made it seem that way. He was hiding something.</p><p>He seemed to have to work harder to hide his unease when he wrapped his arms around me for the night.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tel me, are you?\u201d</p><p>I felt him tense. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I thought truth was the cornerstone of our relationship? That was so important to you before Spring Break,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stil important,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it? Why are you keeping what Samuel said from me?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cBefore we left you needed normal. While we were gone, we had normal. I want you to have that here, where we live. If that\u2019s what you want then you should have it. We could live like Jack and Cynthia. She didn\u2019t ask questions, he didn\u2019t divulge information, and they made it work.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips against my hair. \u201cLeave the details to me.\u201d</p><p>I considered that for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to make things easier on you.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his shoulder. \u201cAnd when do things get easier on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe in my arms. I\u2019m not outside Andrews in my SUV listening to you talk about some guy you\u2019re dating, wishing it was me. The fact that you know what I am and that we spend so much time together, my job is easier than it\u2019s ever been. This wil end soon, sweetheart. I just need you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet potato fries?\u201d I whispered into the darkness.</p><p>Jared pul ed me closer to him and kissed my neck. \u201cSweet potato fries.\u201d</p><p>Saturday morning I awoke to Jared standing beside the bed. He held out my buzzing cel phone and I took it, noting the unhappy look on his face.</p><p>\u201cHel o?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood mornin\u2019, sunshine. How was your trip?\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cIt was perfect. How was yours?\u201d I said, rubbing my eyes. I couldn\u2019t help but smile, Ryan\u2019s voice was strangely comforting.</p><p>\u201cIt was fun. You should have been there. You didn\u2019t forget about the Bio test next week, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cal ing about the test?\u201d I asked, immediately suspicious of his ulterior motives.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s just my lame excuse. I\u2019m cal ing because I haven\u2019t heard your voice in a week and I miss you.\u201d</p><p>I could tel by the tension in Jared\u2019s jaw that he could hear Ryan perfectly clear. I sighed, \u201cThank you. I didn\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>Ryan chuckled. \u201cGood. I\u2019l see you Sunday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Sunday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming back to Brown Sunday night. Or did you change your mind and move in?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cNo. I\u2019m coming back, but not until late...I\u2019m having dinner with Jared\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ryan dramatical y exhaled, making a loud noise into the phone. \u201cOkay, then. I\u2019l see you Sunday night. Later, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and made a face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being...weird. He\u2019s being real y nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Jared frowned, sitting beside me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s up to something,\u201d I grimaced.</p><p>Jared watched me for a moment and smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t say I blame him. I\u2019ve been in his shoes, and I can testify that it\u2019s torture being in love with you and seeing you with someone else. I don\u2019t take a single second with you for granted.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cOkay, now you\u2019re up to something.\u201d</p><p>Jared laughed and shook his head. \u201cRyan is working overtime to win you over. I\u2019m just doing everything I can to keep you. You can\u2019t begrudge me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to worry about. I\u2019ve always been yours.\u201d</p><p>Jared took my hand and kissed my new ring, content. \u201cThat\u2019s al I\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>As the evening approached, I grew increasingly nervous. Jared reassured me that Lil ian was very fond of me, but it didn\u2019t help to calm my fears.</p><p>As soon as we walked in, the wonderful smel from my childhood saturated my senses. Jared\u2019s mother greeted us in the foyer and I grinned how much Jared looked like her. She hadn\u2019t changed, only this time in a sage green apron. Her long blonde hair caressed her shoulders, and her wide, blue-grey eyes wrinkled with her broad smile. She approached me with open arms.</p><p>\u201cNina! Nina...it\u2019s so good to see you, honey. We\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time.\u201d She hugged me tightly, and then pul ed Jared in to kiss his cheek. The plant Jared held caught her eye. \u201cThis is for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina insisted we bring you something. I tried to tel her the poor thing would be dead in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Jared...you\u2019re so sil y,\u201d she giggled, lightly smacking his shoulder.</p><p>I could see why an angel would fal in love with her. She was a beacon of light, and love seemed to pour from her every word.</p><p>\u201cCome in! Come and sit, dinner is almost ready,\u201d she said, carrying the smal plant with her.</p><p>Bex\u2019s eyes brightened as he stood to greet me.</p><p>Jared gestured to the boy. \u201cNina, this is my little brother, Bex. Bex, this is Nina Grey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Bex said, surprising me with a hug. His blonde hair was nearly white, and his big, blue-grey eyes matched his freshly ironed shirt. Even at eleven, his muscles were already wel on their way to his older brother\u2019s size, and he was almost as tal as I. Jared watched me with adoration as I hugged his brother. Bex pul ed out my chair and I smiled appreciatively before taking a seat.</p><p>I caught Claire rol ing her eyes and Jared cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cClaire? Could you help me in the kitchen for a moment?\u201d I heard Lil ian say in a slightly firmer tone than she\u2019d had moments before. Claire stiffened and then quickly joined her mother in the kitchen.</p><p>I sat between Bex and Jared as Lil ian and a significantly more affable Claire brought the dishes of food to the table.</p><p>I felt seven years old again as Lil ian circled the table, scooping out side dishes to each plate. After Lil ian served me, she leaned down and kissed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI have missed you, sweet Nina,\u201d she crooned.</p><p>When she retreated to the kitchen, Jared pul ed me to him and kissed me affectionately. \u201cI told you. She loves you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, feeling a little overwhelmed at the outpouring of love. Aside from Jared, the only person that I felt loved me so deeply was my father. It felt as if I\u2019d had a secret family my entire life that I wasn\u2019t aware of. They had al \u2014but one\u2014 loved me from afar and watched me grow. Gabe\u2019s occasional proud paternal glances made more sense, now.</p><p>I looked over at Claire and wondered why they didn\u2019t regard me in the same way that she did. My family had kept Gabe away much of the time, and now I occupied the majority of Jared\u2019s and, until recently, Claire\u2019s time. I couldn\u2019t fathom the pure goodness in Lil ian for loving me despite what my family had done to hers, but she sat across from me, watching me like I was a long lost daughter that had final y returned home.</p><p>I looked down to my food, the deluge of emotion threatening to bring tears to my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Jared whispered, gently touching my knee.</p><p>I nervously chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, looking up at him as if he\u2019d given me the greatest gift in the world.</p><p>He was confused at first, but my overwhelming happiness prompted a wide grin across his face. We ate and laughed as Lil ian and Bex told funny stories about Jared. Even Claire al owed herself to laugh a few times. Jared and I shared our time in Little Corn, and Lil ian rushed over to look at my ring, kissing her son on the head in approval.</p><p>Lil ian looked at her watch and smiled at her youngest son. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s bedtime, Bex,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>Bex fought a look of disappointment and nodded, stopping to hug me before he retreated upstairs.</p><p>\u201cWow. What a great kid,\u201d I mused, watching him leave.</p><p>\u201cHe is. Al of my children are exceptional,\u201d she said, watching Bex as he climbed towards the second floor.</p><p>\u201cYes they are,\u201d I enthusiastical y agreed. We al shared a laugh at that, and Claire cleared the table of our pie plates.</p><p>Jared leaned over to kiss my forehead and Lil ian beamed with joy. \u201cYou make my son the happiest I have ever seen him. You don\u2019t know how wonderful it is to see final y see him smile that way.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Jared, who scanned my face with deep adoration. He touched my cheek and I tore my eyes away from his affectionate stare, embarrassed by the intimate way we were behaving in front of his mother.</p><p>I struggled to deflect the three pairs of eyes staring at me. \u201cSo...how does that work? Bex having a bed time, I mean. Isn\u2019t he awake by midnight?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Lil ian\u2019s musical laugh fil ed the air. \u201cHe real y has told you everything, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d she said, winking at her son. \u201cThe younger they are, the more they sleep. They slept almost as much as other infants when they were newborns. By their first birthdays they no longer need naps, but they stil slept nearly through the night. My goodness, you and I would have our work cut out for us if we had babies that only slept two hours a day!\u201d She laughed again and I felt the blood rush to my cheeks.</p><p>Jared shifted in his seat. \u201cWe haven\u2019t real y...discussed that, yet, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she smiled sweetly. \u201cI\u2019m notorious for wishful thinking.\u201d</p><p>I felt Jared\u2019s warm hand gently encompass mine. \u201cLet\u2019s just take one thing at a time. We don\u2019t want to scare Nina off.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Jared. \u201cIt would take a lot more than that to scare me off. As if that could ever happen.\u201d</p><p>Claire stiffened in her seat, and almost simultaneously Jared did the same. Lil ian watched her son. She was waiting for something, but didn\u2019t seem afraid. Jared turned his head, listening intently. He reminded me of a wild animal sensing danger, on alert, ears scanning the air for movement.</p><p>Suddenly Claire stood up and kicked her chair against the wal . I jumped at the noise, and then it was dark.</p><p>\u201cBex,\u201d Claire whispered.</p><p>Jared grabbed my arm and whisked me up the stairs, with Lil ian just behind us. We rushed down a long hal , and then entered the last door to our right. He backed me into a corner and gently put his finger to my mouth. It was then that I realized something was very wrong.</p><p>I could barely make out Jared\u2019s form in the darkness as I saw him lean over Bex\u2019s bed and whisper in his brother\u2019s ear before disappearing silently from the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was quiet for a long time, and I jerked when I felt Lil ian\u2019s hand on my arm. My eyes darted back and forth between the door and Bex, who was lying as stil as a statue in his bed.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud crash echoed from downstairs and I closed my eyes. My heart threatened to punch through my chest with every beat. Another crash came from a different area of the lower level and then two gun shots rang out. I heard scuffling, and then a male voice cried out, abruptly cutting off.</p><p>Bex remained in his bed. The room became clearer as my vision adjusted to the darkness. Unable to discern who was in the house, how many, and who was winning, I told myself that Jared was alive as long as I was.</p><p>In the next moment, a stranger dressed in black burst through the door. The bed lit up with the beam of a flashlight, and in the next moment the man charged, yanking Bex from his bed. I lunged forward when the man pressed cold metal against the boy\u2019s temple.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed. Lil ian grabbed my shoulders and jerked me against her chest.</p><p>Claire appeared in the door way, targeting the intruder with her handgun. She jerked her head up once, breathing heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s been awhile, Crenshaw.\u201d</p><p>Even in the darkness I could see a smug smile on Claire\u2019s face, as if she had the upper hand. Crenshaw pressed the barrel of his gun against Bex\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Bex said, sounding as terrified as I felt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s going to be al right,\u201d Claire assured him.</p> <p>\u201cJust let me take her, and I\u2019l go quietly. I\u2019l leave the boy down the street,\u201d the man growled, true fear underlying his demand.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not going to happen, Crenshaw. Just take your life and go,\u201d Claire said, looking down the sights of her firearm.</p><p>Crenshaw tightened his grip on his gun. \u201cI can\u2019t go back without her\u2014you know that. Hand Jack\u2019s kid over and I\u2019l leave the boy,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Bex\u2019s head tilted from the pressure of the barrel pressing harder against his skin.</p><p>Claire\u2019s expression was frightening, even in the darkness. \u201cDo you know what I\u2019l do to you if you leave a mark on him? Ease up on that barrel, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l go!\u201d I said, desperate to end the standoff.</p> <p>Crenshaw\u2019s attention jerked toward me, then. \u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l go with you. Just leave them alone,\u201d I blurted out, a tear burning down my cheek.</p><p>Claire sighed in exasperation, keeping her eyes on Crenshaw. \u201cI\u2019m not going to trade one brother for another, Nina. Stay where you are.\u201d</p><p>Crenshaw cocked his weapon and Claire took one hand off her gun and held it palm-out, toward Crenshaw. \u201cOkay. Okay, Harry. I\u2019m laying down my weapon. Easy does it,\u201d she said, moving slowly to lay her gun flat on the floor.</p><p>Lil ian held her breath and her nails lightly dug into my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYour heart is racing, Crenshaw.\u201d Claire said, standing up slowly with both hands in front of her.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they warned you about us, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah...so?\u201d he sniffed.</p><p>\u201cSo, when they warned you about Jared and I, and they sent twelve of you to take on two of us, and you al came in here, guns blazing, knowing most of you wouldn\u2019t make it out...,\u201d she raised one eyebrow before getting to her point, \u201c...did they warn you about Bex?\u201d</p><p>Crenshaw\u2019s head darted around to each side of him, unclear what Claire meant, but he looked terrified.</p><p>A smal hand slowly rose into the air. \u201cNice to meet you, Crenshaw. I\u2019m Bex.\u201d</p><p>In the same second Bex\u2019s body blurred in movement, and Crenshaw\u2019s dark form bent unnatural y as he cried out. I heard bones snap as the intruder\u2019s gun fel to the floor. In the next moment, Bex stood over his assailant. In one swift jerk, Bex pul ed Crenshaw\u2019s neck and a loud crack pierced the room.</p><p>Lil ian exhaled as Bex stood over Crenshaw\u2019s broken body. Claire walked over to her slightly tal er, younger brother and hugged him.</p><p>\u201cI underestimated you,\u201d Claire said, smiling at the overgrown boy in her arms.</p><p>\u201cAnd you said I wouldn\u2019t be able to act scared enough,\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cI admit it. I was total y wrong. There for a second I thought you were going to cry like a little girl. He didn\u2019t see you coming for a second,\u201d she said, pressing her fist against his jaw.</p><p>Bex playful y punched her in the arm and she ruffled his hair.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Nina?\u201d Bex asked, turning to me with a concerned expression.</p><p>I could only lift the corners of my mouth for a second, grateful when Claire motioned for him to fol ow her downstairs. I recoiled as I watched Bex step over Harry Crenshaw\u2019s body like he was a piece of furniture.</p><p>Jared came through the door moments later, and after surveying the scene, walked straight to me.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, sweetheart?\u201d he asked, pul ing me tightly into his arms.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to take care of a few things downstairs. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d he asked again, holding my cheeks in his hands and scanning my face.</p><p>I nodded again, and then my knees buckled. Jared lifted me into his arms and carried me downstairs through the darkness.</p><p>\u201cShould I get the lights?\u201d Lil ian asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jared answered.</p><p>I heard Claire trot down the stairs and rummage through a cabinet in the bathroom. With a smal flashlight in her mouth, she turned to look at her back in the mirror as she flattened a pink Hel o Kitty band-aid against a deep cut on her shoulder.</p><p>Jared took me outside into the night air. \u201cTake a few slow, deep breaths. You\u2019l feel better soon.\u201d</p><p>I felt a blanket surround me as Lil ian kissed my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Baby. We\u2019l try again another night.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t reply. She acted as if she\u2019d burned the pot roast, not that a group of men had broken into her home and assaulted her family to kidnap one of her guests.</p><p>\u201cI need to take Nina home. Claire and Bex can clean up. Cal me if there is a problem,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Lil ian nodded and kissed her son.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d I choked, the guilt crushing me.</p><p>Jared\u2019s mother cupped my cheek in her palm and stared at me with deep sympathy. \u201cThis is not your fault, Nina. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. It is what it is.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged with a smal smile and I tried to return her expression, but I was afraid if I let the numbness escape me for even a moment, I would break down in front of everyone.</p><p>Once in the SUV, I asked Jared to take me to Andrews.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, genuinely surprised.</p><p>\u201cI just want to go home,\u201d I said, looking out the window.</p><p>Jared traced my fingers with his. \u201cI\u2019d feel better if you stayed with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I...I just want to sleep in my bed,\u201d I said, stumbling over my words. I had made the decision before I got in the car.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d He sighed in resignation, and then turned down a road that led to Brown.</p><p>Jared slowly pul ed beside the curb and switched off the ignition. Without a word, I pul ed on the handle to let myself out.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Jared cal ed as he caught up with me. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea, you\u2019re not in any condition to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth is there,\u201d I said as I continued walking.</p><p>He stopped me just as I reached for the door. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be around me tonight, do you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to say it. I begged myself not to, but I had to say the words. The tears threatened to fal but I forced them back. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Jared.\u201d</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other, shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou can\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go back to the way things used to be,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice from breaking.</p><p>I could see the clouds forming in his eyes. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asked warily.</p><p>\u201cI....\u201d My lips pressed together, afraid to speak words that would be physical y painful to say, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be together. I don\u2019t see how it can work.\u201d</p><p>Jared was instantly angry. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. You think what happened at Lil ian\u2019s tonight is your fault.\u201d He gripped my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey came to your mother\u2019s house, Jared. For me. If I wasn\u2019t there they wouldn\u2019t have come. Quit saying it\u2019s not my fault. It is.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHow do you think this is going to help, exactly? This isn\u2019t the first time someone has been in our home. It\u2019s not the first time Lil ian has been in danger. She was married to Jack Grey\u2019s guardian angel, Nina. It sort of comes with the territory.\u201d He relaxed a bit and pul ed me to him. \u201cWe can take care of ourselves, okay?\u201d</p><p>I pul ed away from him, surprised at his casual demeanor. \u201cYou brought me to meet your family and you expect me not to care what happens to them?\u201d</p><p>Jared grabbed my hands and sighed in frustration. I could see that he was desperate for me to see reason. \u201cNothing happened to them. I realize you were scared, but it was completely under control. You don\u2019t think Bex has seen worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his home? In his room? Your eleven year old brother broke a man\u2019s neck in his bedroom, Jared. That\u2019s not normal....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not normal!\u201d He took a deep breath to keep his voice calm. \u201cBex just got home from training with the Marines, Nina. You\u2019re not saving him by doing this. It\u2019s who we are. What do you think you\u2019l accomplish by pushing me away?\u201d He shook his head and looked at me as if I\u2019d lost my mind.</p><p>But I was resolved.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to keep them focused on me and out of your mother\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes darkened and a grave expression shadowed his face. \u201cSo we won\u2019t go back there. If that\u2019s what you want, we\u2019l stay away from her house.\u201d Jared reached for me, but I moved away.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThey already know who you are. They know where your mother lives. They know about Bex, now. The damage is done, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being unreasonable. This doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he said in a strangled tone.</p><p>I looked to the sidewalk. \u201cDon\u2019t make this harder\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThan it already is? Original,\u201d he snapped. \u201cHow are we supposed to go about this, Nina? I\u2019m no longer al owed to speak to you or touch you? You expect me to go through that again?\u201d</p><p>His pointed question sent a new bolt of guilt shooting through me, and I struggled to keep his pain from overriding the guilt that I felt at Lil ian\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I expect, I just know this is too hard...it\u2019s too...I\u2019m going to get your family kil ed! Don\u2019t you care about that?\u201d</p><p>He rol ed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get them kil ed. Three out of four of us are Half-breeds, Nina. Twelve wel -trained humans couldn\u2019t make it out of our house alive, tonight. You don\u2019t have to do this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHybrids,\u201d I insisted. \u201cDon\u2019t fight me on this. You know I\u2019m right. They know they can get at one of us with the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019l solve the problem, not run from it. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re saying this,\u201d he seethed. \u201cYou of al people, who stood in the freezing rain for fifteen minutes because you didn\u2019t want to wait a few more days for me to appease your mother! Who sliced open your hand and nearly broke your arm because you had to talk to me! Two days ago we decided where our wedding wil be, Nina! You\u2019re just going to walk away from everything we\u2019ve been fighting for?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue, so I simply nodded my head.</p><p>Jared grabbed my shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I needed normal.\u201d I hesitated; my next words would cut him. \u201cI can\u2019t have a normal life with you.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes turned a midnight blue. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Nina. You want out because you\u2019re afraid something wil happen to my family if we stay together. I\u2019m tel ing you, nothing\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m asking you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>I reached my hand up to touch his cheek; his jaws tensed under his skin. \u201cSomething wil happen. I don\u2019t know what else to do, Jared. We both have to have some sort of a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have a life without you. I don\u2019t want a life without you.\u201d He swal owed hard. His face was locked in an agonizing expression.</p><p>I pressed my lips together, determined to make him believe the lie. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how I want to live. The fear, the guilt, the looking over my shoulder. We can\u2019t even be intimate.\u201d</p><p>Jared took my hand and pressed his lips against my knuckles, closing his eyes tight. \u201cPlease...please don\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t go back to that.\u201d</p><p>I almost gave in. I wanted to, but I stayed focused on the guilt I felt as I told Lil ian goodbye. \u201cYou have to go.\u201d I placed the loft key in his palm.</p><p>\u201cNina...,\u201d he choked, looking down at his hand as if I had placed a hot coal there.</p><p>I reached down to pul his ring from my finger and he grabbed both of my hands. His face crumpled as if he had taken al he could stand. \u201cDon\u2019t break your promise.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed my hands down to my sides. He was right, I had promised.</p><p>Jared pul ed me into him by my shoulders and kissed me deeply\u2014and I let him. I returned his kiss with the same sadness and fear. He held me so tightly I found it hard to breathe, but I didn\u2019t care. I let him hold me and kiss me however he wanted. It would be our last night together.</p><p>He abruptly pul ed back, just a few inches, but kept me tightly in his arms. \u201cI\u2019l do what I have to do, Nina. If you want to go away, we\u2019l go. If you need intimacy, I\u2019l make love to you. I\u2019l give you whatever you want. I\u2019l give up everything I have. I\u2019l give up my family. We can get in the car right now and just drive\u2014 I won\u2019t even look back. Just don\u2019t ask me to do this. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t...,\u201d he choked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pul ed away from his grip and opened the door. Jared pul ed me back into his arms and kissed me again. Once I felt the tears streak down my cheeks I pushed him away, but he kept me against him. I final y had to shove him again and again until he final y let go so that I could get through the door.</p><p>The steps to my room were endless. I stayed focused on my mission, refusing to fal apart. Jared had said it himself that he was wil ing to give up everything for me, including his family...and I couldn\u2019t let him do that. I couldn\u2019t let the Ryels get hurt because of me, whether it was physical y or from losing Jared. I couldn\u2019t look Jared in the eye if he lost another person in his family because of the mistakes of my father.</p><p>I wiped my face and tucked my hair behind my ears before I opened the door. Beth sat at her computer.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s home!\u201d Beth said excitedly, spinning around in her desk chair. Her tone quickly changed when she saw my face. \u201cOh my God, Nina! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJared and I are over,\u201d I murmured, changing into my pajamas. I wanted to sleep. It was the only thing that would al eviate the wrenching pain in my ribs.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you meet his mother tonight? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAl hel broke loose,\u201d I replied, scrubbing my face in the sink.</p><p>\u201cUgh! Why can\u2019t Hel stay where it\u2019s at? Why does it always have to break loose?\u201d she whined.</p><p>I tried to smile at her, but my mouth wouldn\u2019t cooperate. I couldn\u2019t tel her the truth and I didn\u2019t want to lie. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t working.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019ve been talking about forever with this guy.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at the vent in the ceiling and then back to Beth. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I know how to save him.\u201d</p><p>Beth grew quiet. \u201cSave him from what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The Arrangement</p> <p>\u201cJust keep walking,\u201d Beth said, coaxing me into class.</p><p>Jared stood against the wal beside the door. He didn\u2019t speak or approach me; he only watched as Beth led me in. My chest ached at the exhausted look in his eyes. He hadn\u2019t slept.</p><p>Day after day, Jared continued to wait at the doorway of any place necessary for me to enter. By the end of the week I would feel a sick feeling in my stomach anytime I was coming or going. Sometimes he watched me walk past, sometimes he kept his eyes to the ground, but he was always there.</p><p>The second week was more difficult than the first. Jared stil waited for me in random places on campus, and my friends began to ask questions.</p><p>Ryan guessed there was trouble and proceeded to gril me about the details. I was glad that he noticed it was too painful to discuss, and let me suffer in silence.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes darkened from midnight blue to black each time he saw Ryan walking happily beside me. It was unfair to let his worst fear play out in front of him, and I regretted not explaining to him the night I ended things that he would never have to suffer through that. I couldn\u2019t be with someone else knowing that I could never truly love them the way I should, least of al Ryan. He deserved someone\u2019s whole heart, and I had left mine with Jared.</p><p>Ryan knocked on my door every day, several times a day to visit or walk me to class, and I welcomed the company. It was easier to function when I was around him; he became my main distraction from al things Jared. Any obligation I felt for him had disappeared. As more time passed, I realized it wasn\u2019t just him; I didn\u2019t feel anything around anyone. I concentrated so hard on keeping Jared from sensing my grief that I felt numb most of the time.</p><p>By the second week of April, I had learned to keep my emotions in check. Kim, Beth and I passed Jared on our way into the Ratty and as usual, but I couldn\u2019t get quite past him without my eyes involuntarily glancing in his direction. When I did so, his eyes caught mine and for the first time in a month, he reached out and firmly pul ed my arm, bringing me just inches from his face.</p> <p>Beth and Kim stood a few feet away. They didn\u2019t protest, but they didn\u2019t leave me alone. I assumed they thought they might get an insight on the strange situation with Jared if they stuck around to eavesdrop.</p><p>I stood in front of him, obstinately silent.</p><p>Jared scanned my face in confusion. He didn\u2019t speak so I took a step toward the door. He pul ed me back.</p><p>His sweet scent floated around me and my chest tightened. Feeling something other than hol ow sent a wave of panic over me and I lashed out at him. \u201cWhat do you want, Jared?\u201d</p><p>He winced at my acerbic tone. \u201cI\u2019ve been patient. I\u2019ve given you space. But it\u2019s time we talked.\u201d</p><p>I pul ed my coat from his grip. \u201cYou haven\u2019t given me space! You\u2019re everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d break down and talk to me. This has to stop, Nina,\u201d he said, working to stay calm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. This has to stop. You can do your job without being in my life. You\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p><p>Jared pul ed up my hand, viewing his ring stil firmly in place. \u201cIf you don\u2019t care about me, then why are you so adamant in keeping your promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stil a promise...no matter who it\u2019s to,\u201d I said, pul ing my hand away. My wrist ached at the remaining warmth from his grip.</p><p>\u201cThat ring wil be slightly inconvenient when you get married one of these days, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take it off if you\u2019d like,\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>Jared\u2019s shoulders relaxed and the exhaustion set in. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you\u2019re not hurting over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...,\u201d I should have lied to him and told him I was fine, but I couldn\u2019t. The grief in his eyes was unbearable, so I retreated to the Ratty.</p><p>Jared\u2019s hand shot out and grabbed the sleeve of my coat again, but this time I turned and jerked my arm down and away, and then yanked the door open. Beth and Kim quickly fol owed.</p><p>I sat between Ryan and Tucker, quietly picking at my food.</p><p>\u201cNina, you don\u2019t eat much anymore,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve lost some weight. I\u2019m starting to worry about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>He rol ed his eyes and threw his french fry to his plate. \u201cI know you\u2019re fine. You\u2019ve been fine for a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Al eyes in the room seemed to dart in my direction, looking for the source of the commotion. I stood and walked out, leaving my tray on the table.</p><p>I stormed past Jared and walked straight to my dorm, deciding to skip my afternoon class. Concentrating so hard on being void of any emotion took up so much of my energy that I tended to take naps more often than not. I rol ed into a bal under my blanket and cleared my mind. Before long, I drifted off.</p><p>I woke to a knock at the door. It was dark; I had been asleep for hours. My muscles felt heavy and congealed, so I waited for Beth to answer.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d she asked the visitor in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cIs Nina here?\u201d Ryan asked, peering around her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Beth whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m up. Come in, Ryan,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ryan stepped across the room, and I bounced when he plopped onto my bed. \u201cYou need to pul yourself together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ryan,\u201d I said, wiping the inevitably smeared mascara from my eyes.</p><p>He pressed his thumb gently under my eye to fix a place that I missed. \u201cWe\u2019re going out. I want you to come with us.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo thank you. I don\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to, Nina. You never want to do anything. But you need to,\u201d he said, flattening the parts of my hair that were out of place.</p><p>\u201cThings suck right now. You\u2019re miserable, we al see it, but maybe if he thinks you\u2019re happy he\u2019l back off.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just meant that he\u2019s probably hanging around because he\u2019s worried about you. You look so unhappy. If he thought you were okay without him... maybe he\u2019d let you live your life.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his shoulders and pul ed him tightly to me, and then scrambled across the room to pul on my jacket.</p><p>\u201cWalk with me,\u201d I said, holding the door open.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow and stood up reluctantly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfect, let\u2019s go,\u201d I said, hurrying him out the door.</p><p>I pul ed him along by his hand, dragging him to the parking lot. When we got to my car, Ryan paused. \u201cWe\u2019re going somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get in.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou\u2019re weirding me out, Nigh.\" \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWil you tel me where we\u2019re going, first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome place we can talk. Just...trust me,\u201d I said, aware that I seemed completely insane.</p><p>\u201cNina, I trust you. I just think you\u2019re not yourself these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you trusted me, you would be in the car by now.\u201d I slid into the driver\u2019s seat and waited. After a few moments, Ryan opened the door and sat beside me. I smiled at him and touched his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan offered a half smile and squeezed my hand, holding it tightly the entire trip to my parents\u2019 home. When we pul ed into the drive, he let go.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>I turned off the ignition and searched each window for any sign of Cynthia, but the house was dark. Ryan fol owed me up the stairs to my father\u2019s office, and I closed the door behind him. He looked around, clearly nervous.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk, now?\u201d he asked. When I nodded, he let out a loud, frustrated sigh. \u201cWhat the hel \u2019s going on with you, Nina? I\u2019m serious...you\u2019re starting to worry me. I wish you would let me help you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes in relief and whispered as quietly as I could. \u201cThere is something you can do.\u201d</p><p>Ryan leaned in, keeping his voice low like mine, \u201cJust name it.\u201d</p><p>I kept my eyes closed, cringing at my coming request. \u201cIt\u2019s real y...real y selfish. It\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s the worst thing I could ask of you, but I think it\u2019s the only thing that wil work. It\u2019s the only way he\u2019l move on.\u201d I peeked up at him, already fearful of his response.</p><p>\u201cThis is about Jared?\u201d he said.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI....\u201d Ryan\u2019s hopeful expression made me hesitate. I wasn\u2019t sure I could go through with it, even if he agreed.</p><p>\u201cNigh, don\u2019t be a pain in the ass. Just say it,\u201d he said, staring me down.</p><p>\u201cI need you to date me,\u201d I breathed, barely above a whisper.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face instantly compressed. \u201cWhat? Why are you whispering?\u201d</p><p>I ignored his last question. \u201cI need you to date me. You know, take me on dates, to the movies, eat lunch with me, walk me to class...and hang out with me in the evenings.\u201d I forced a contrived smile. \u201cI\u2019l pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me to date you,\u201d he repeated in monotone.</p><p>\u201cJared has it in his head that you and I belong together,\u201d I said. Ryan\u2019s face morphed into suspicion. \u201cJust...trust me. That\u2019s what he thinks, and the only way he would ever accept that I was moving on is with you. He said once that he would step aside if I chose you. It\u2019s just for a few months\u2014just until he gives up\u2014and then you don\u2019t have to do it anymore,\u201d I begged.</p><p>Ryan chuckled, taking in my ludicrous idea. \u201cI won\u2019t have to do it anymore? You know this is better than anything I could have ever hoped for, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan....\u201d Afraid he would be offended and decide not to help me, I hesitated, \u201cI have to be honest with you...we wil always be friends. I care about you, but I can\u2019t let you go into this thinking it\u2019s going to end up being something more. We\u2019l just be pretending. I can\u2019t... I don\u2019t see myself being with anyone else. Ever,\u201d I exhaled, glad that part of the conversation was over.</p><p>Ryan rol ed his eyes. \u201cWhy go through the charade? Why not just get a protective order?\u201d</p><p>I looked down to my hands. \u201cHe\u2019s just fol owing me around because he knows I stil love him.\u201d</p><p>Ryan didn\u2019t expect my answer, and his nose wrinkled in response. \u201cIf you stil love him, then why aren\u2019t you with him?\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cAre you going to help me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh is going to think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou can\u2019t tel anyone. Not Kim, not Tucker or Josh, not your mom. If you tel anyone, even just one person, he\u2019l find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he FBI or something?\u201d Ryan said, looking a bit creeped out. \u201cWhat did you get yourself mixed up in, Nigh?</p><p>\u201cWil you do it for me? I know it sounds crazy, and I know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but you\u2019re the only one that can help me,\u201d I said, tugging desperately at his shirt.</p><p>\u201cPretend to be your boyfriend? Lie to al my friends? Let you break my heart when it\u2019s al said and done?\u201d</p><p>I nodded sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if the tears came from the fact that Ryan had agreed to help me, or that my plan would work, but I grabbed him and hugged him to me as if I needed him to breathe. He hugged me back, and then pul ed away, looking into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to regret this. I can already tel ,\u201d he said, smiling softly.</p><p>We drove back to Brown, and as we walked from the parking lot, Ryan took my hand. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do this, we should do it right, right? No one is going to believe us if we never touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I struggled to keep my emotions in check as we walked down the hal s of my dorm. Jared could see us and I fought against the guilt I felt for hurting him. If I was going to fool him at al , I would have to concentrate on feeling comfortable and happy with Ryan.</p><p>We stopped at my door and Ryan let go of my hand. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come with us tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After I nodded, Ryan leaned in and kissed the corner of my mouth. I let my feelings for him as a friend bleed through the awkwardness so Jared wouldn\u2019t be tipped off. I smiled at him as he turned to walk down the hal .</p><p>Over the next weeks, Ryan kept me busy going to the movies, meeting for lunch, and accompanying me to dinner. We spent time together every night, and shared a table at breakfast every morning. He even began to forgo plans with his friends. Soon, everyone was convinced that we were having a not-so-secret relationship.</p><p>It was uncomfortable for both of us at first, but after the first week we settled into our new roles. Ryan made a game of it, as he did everything else.</p><p>We bet on how soon someone would ask us to announce our relationship, and who it would be.</p> <p>Our friendship grew stronger as the days past, and I began depending on him for more than fooling Jared. Ryan anesthetized the pain, and it wasn\u2019t long before I found myself making excuses to be around him.</p><p>The day final y came that I had bet that Kim would ask what our status was. I made a show of stretching my legs across Ryan\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cCheater,\u201d Ryan whispered, too low for anyone else to hear.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Are you guys together or not?\u201d Kim asked.</p><p>Ryan grinned at me and I lifted al five of my fingers, reminding him that he owed me fifty bucks. Ryan shook his head at my gloating and then scanned the table. Everyone waited eagerly for the answer.</p> <p>\u201cObviously,\u201d he said as he rubbed my leg.</p><p>A broad smile spread across Kim\u2019s face. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>Beth and Chad exchanged glances. I didn\u2019t have to ask what was wrong because I already knew; she thought I was making a huge mistake.</p><p>\u201cWel , that explains why you\u2019ve been bailing on us every weekend,\u201d Josh said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we al go out Friday?\u201d Ryan shrugged.</p><p>I shot a surprised look at him and he smiled. Jared\u2019s birthday was Sunday and the only present I could give him was to spend the weekend alone.</p> <p>\u201cI have plans with my mom this weekend,\u201d I explained.</p><p>Ryan reached out to rub my shoulder. \u201cBut not until Saturday, right, Babe? We can go to the pub Friday.\u201d</p><p>I held my breath to keep from lashing out at him. I couldn\u2019t blow our cover by refusing to go to the pub or it would look suspicious. Even worse, I couldn\u2019t tear into him later because Jared would hear.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cIt looks that way,\u201d I said, trying not to glare at Ryan.</p><p>Leaving the Ratty, I noticed something was different. I had held my breath and braced myself for Jared to be outside the door, but Jared wasn\u2019t in his usual spot. He wasn\u2019t waiting for me at al . My eyes fil ed with tears. I had final y hurt him enough to push him away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Nigh?\u201d Ryan asked, touching my back.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak. Jared had final y given in. I had won...and I had lost.</p> <p>\u201cNina,\u201d Beth said, bringing me under her wing like a mother hen. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come?\u201d Ryan cal ed after us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d Beth waved him off as we continued walking.</p><p>As soon as Beth closed the door, her expression was morphed from sympathetic to incensed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you are going to tel me what\u2019s going on, and you\u2019re going to tel me now...or so help me, I\u2019m going to cal Cynthia!\u201d</p><p>While I contemplated whether I would lie or tel the truth, Beth stomped her foot.</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Beth narrowed her eyes. \u201cI know you\u2019re fine. Everyone knows you\u2019re fine. But you\u2019re not fine! And what are you doing with Ryan? You look ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>My head jerked to meet her glare, acutely aware of the microphone in the vent. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for months, Beth. I care about him, and he cares about me. We\u2019re just trying to see where it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d she seethed, rol ing her eyes. \u201cYou love Jared. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s practical y stalking you, or why you won\u2019t talk to him when it was so obvious today that you miss him...but I know that you love him. And he loves you!\u201d she said, the pitch of her voice rising with each point.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know as much as you think you do,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cJared looks miserable, Nina. Don\u2019t you care?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cCan we please not talk about this?\u201d I begged.</p><p>Beth sat beside me on my bed, her voice quiet. \u201cYou need to talk to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only person I can talk to about it is Jared, and I can\u2019t talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d she asked, wrinkling her nose in disgust.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>She rol ed her eyes. \u201cRight. Because you\u2019re saving him.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and looked at her. \u201cWhy are you pushing this? I thought you liked Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But you belong with Jared. It\u2019s your happiness that I\u2019m worried about, and you\u2019re not happy right now. You are the absolute opposite of happy,\u201d</p><p>she said, touching my arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing the right thing,\u201d I said, wiping the tears. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can it be the right thing when you\u2019re so sad?\u201d</p><p>For me, the discussion was over. I walked across the room to pul a pair of pajamas from the drawer.</p><p>\u201cNina, no. You\u2019re not going to sleep. You sleep al the time. You\u2019ve got to find another way to cope. Or just quit coping...go to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Beth.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s attention was drawn to the knocking at our door. I walked over, pajamas in hand, and opened the door. Ryan\u2019s hat was pul ed low over his eyes so that al I could see was his perfect white smile and his deep dimple.</p><p>He thrust a smal stack of papers at me and smiled. \u201cI brought notes,\u201d he said, pul ing his hat up. \u201cWe have finals next week, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, setting the papers on my desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to this afternoon? You wanna go get some coffee?\u201d he asked, his eyes fixating on the pajamas in my hand. \u201cOh, no. You\u2019re not going to sleep.\u201d With that, Ryan grabbed my pajamas from my hands and tossed them across the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. I didn\u2019t sleep wel last night,\u201d I whined.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always tired. You need to get out in the sun. It\u2019s a nice day. We could go hang out on the greens.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, trying to push away any memories that thought created.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes narrowed, and then his mouth broke into a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s it. You and I are going downtown, waste time driving around, and then I\u2019m taking you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we\u2019re going to the pub and getting smashed. You\u2019ve had that kind of day,\u201d he said, stil grinning.</p><p>Beth looked up at us from her book. \u201cShe\u2019s had that kind of month. I\u2019l cal Chad. We\u2019l meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d Ryan said, wiping the mascara from under my eyes with both thumbs. \u201cI\u2019l be back in an hour. I want you dressed for a night out on the town.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cIs that a demand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m a demanding boyfriend and I demand that you have a fun-fil ed afternoon ful of slogan games, boutiques, good food and liquor. I\u2019l even make you to get a manicure. Girls like that crap, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Can I go? I need a mani-pedi so bad!\u201d Beth whined.</p><p>I shot her a dismayed look. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so serious. Ryan and Chad can drop us off, go do boy things, and come back at dinner time. We can get polished and waxed and...I hate to say it, Nigh, but you need a makeover. I\u2019m getting in the shower!\u201d she said, grabbing her things.</p><p>\u201cBe\u2014,\u201d I began, but she was already out the door. I glowered at Ryan. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like going out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he pleaded. He encircled me in his arms and swayed back and forth, pressing his cheek against mine. \u201cOne last hurrah before finals week? If you don\u2019t have a good time, you can make me miserable for the rest of my life. Deal?\u201d he asked, leaning me back until my hair touched the floor.</p><p>I had to smile. He was trying so hard to cheer me up. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>A huge grin swept Ryan\u2019s face and he righted us both. \u201cI\u2019l pick you up in an hour. See you soon,\u201d he said as he disappeared down the hal .</p><p>Fifty-six minutes later, the door was under attack by loud, incessant knocking. When Beth swung the door open, Chad and Ryan were stil knocking on it with both fists.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s open!\u201d Beth shouted over the banging.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you look awesome!\u201d Chad said, kissing Beth sweetly on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cAw...you know I love it when you use the big words,\u201d she laughed, wrapping her arms around him.</p><p>Ryan stared at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, looking down at my little black dress. \u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No...it\u2019s just...I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you in a dress. It\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI thought it\u2019d make me feel better to dress up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Ryan rol ed down the windows of his black Toyota Tundra and cranked the radio to the first rock song he turned to. The boys sang along, but I stil couldn\u2019t understand the words. Beth and I giggled at the funny faces they made as they serenaded amused and sometimes bewildered pedestrians as we passed.</p><p>At the salon, Beth and I stepped out onto the sidewalk and waved as the Tundra disappeared around the corner.</p><p>\u201cThose boys.\u201d Beth shook her head before turning to me. \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d she said, yanking me inside.</p><p>I sunk into my seat as my hands and feet were brushed, scrubbed, filed, de-cuticled, polished and lotioned. Beth prattled on to the nail techs about our plans for the night, how wonderful her boyfriend was and her upcoming apartment hunt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying in Providence?\u201d I asked, my eyebrows shooting upward.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cChad wants to get an apartment together. I didn\u2019t want to say anything before... with everything going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to upset me.\u201d</p><p>Beth bit her lip and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me, Beth. I think it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d I said, grabbing her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are amazing together. You don\u2019t need to worry about me, I\u2019l be fine,\u201d I said, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah...you being fine is exactly what I\u2019m worried about,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Two hours later, Ryan\u2019s Tundra honked from the curb. Ryan opened the door for us and then hopped back in, turning the music down.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good time, Babe?\u201d he asked, kissing my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was fun,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cWel , you look gorgeous. I\u2019m afraid to take you anywhere looking like that. I might have to fight somebody,\u201d he said, winking.</p><p>\u201cQuit it,\u201d I smiled, rol ing my eyes.</p><p>We arrived at the pub, and I could hear the music thumping from the street. I knew Kim had beaten us there, because it was her crazy music filtering through the door. When we walked in, our friends were already on the dance floor, arms up, bouncing around. Ryan grabbed my hand and led me to the middle of the floor, twirling me around.</p><p>In that moment I was just like them. I was a normal col ege student, with my entire normal life ahead of me. I smiled, and it felt natural. I drank shots, toasted to the Big Brown Bear, and hugged my friends. It was bittersweet freedom.</p><p>The music slowed, and Ryan pul ed me to him. We were both sticky from dancing, and I pul ed the wet strands of my bangs away from my face.</p><p>Holding my hand up to the dim light, he smiled. \u201cThose are some pretty nails you have there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend forced me to go to the spa today. He made me spend the afternoon with one of my girlfriends,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cReal y? He sounds like a great guy. If I were you, I\u2019d hang on to him...sounds like a keeper.\u201d</p><p>I watched his face for a moment and then rested my cheek on his shoulder. Ryan wrapped his arms tighter around me and pressed his face into my hair.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be so bad, would it?\u201d he whispered in my ear. \u201cIf we stopped pretending?\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes and remained silent.</p><p>We returned to the bar for another round of shots when I saw Kim heading outside, a cigarette already between her lips. I stumbled out behind her and raked my matted hair from my forehead as she flicked her lighter.</p><p>\u201cCan I have one?\u201d I asked, breathless and weaving.</p><p>\u201cYou want a cigarette?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>I nodded and Kim shrugged, pul ing a stubby white stick from the smal box she was holding.</p><p>I put the cigarette between my lips flicked the lighter. Just as it sparked, Jared appeared in front of me with a disgusted look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He pul ed the cigarette from my mouth, broke it in half, and threw it to the ground. \u201cYou don\u2019t smoke.\u201d He frowned in disapproval, and I shrunk back into Kim.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk, Ryan\u2019s drunk, I\u2019m taking you home,\u201d he said in a father-like tone.</p><p>I turned to open the door to the pub, but Jared grabbed my wrist. \u201cThen let me cal you a cab,\u201d his voice lost its authority and I winced at the pain in his voice.</p><p>Jared\u2019s hand was the same warm blanket I remembered. After the number of drinks I\u2019d had, I couldn\u2019t hide my feelings. Jared\u2019s eyes became animated in reaction.</p><p>He looked down to my hand and caressed my skin with his thumb. He had sensed the pensive feeling I\u2019d had at his touch.</p><p>I pul ed away. \u201cYou need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you go with him when he\u2019s been drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan already\u2014,\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Ryan said, bursting out of the bar. He nodded once at Jared and then looked at me and smiled. \u201cHey, Babe,\u201d he said, jerking me against him and planting his mouth on mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes widened and then I clinched them shut, trying to cover the fact that I was taken off-guard. After a few seconds, he pul ed away, looked into my eyes and then cupped my cheeks, kissing me again. I could tel by the way he held me that it was no longer for show. He had forgotten about our audience as he parted his lips, lightly touching his tongue to mine.</p><p>I pul ed away and immediately watched for Jared\u2019s reaction; his expression frightened me. I slowly moved to stand in front of Ryan.</p><p>\u201cJared....\u201d I warned.</p><p>Jared\u2019s breathing was uneven, and his eyes were raging storms. \u201cMove out of the way, Nina.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s made her choice, Jared. It\u2019s time you found someone else to....\u201d</p><p>Jared lunged forward and then jerked back, held by two smal hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to go,\u201d Claire said as her brother froze under her touch.</p><p>\u201cHey, Claire!\u201d Ryan smiled, unaware of how close he was to another trip to the hospital.</p><p>Claire glanced at him with an uncomfortable expression, keeping firm hands on her brother. She seemed surprised that Ryan had acknowledged her.</p> <p>The cab slowed to a stop beside us and honked. I backed up against Ryan, turning to push him to safety. Jared walked toward me and for the first time I felt safer knowing Claire was near.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Ryan cal ed from inside the cab.</p><p>Jared stood just a few inches from me. \u201cDon\u2019t go home with him,\u201d he begged, his face compressing inward. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. I\u2019l stay away; you won\u2019t even know I exist. Don\u2019t do something we\u2019l al regret just to push me away.\u201d</p><p>Ryan poked his head out of the open door. \u201cWho says she hasn\u2019t already?\u201d he asked, gripping my inner thigh.</p><p>Jared didn\u2019t get far when he charged Ryan for the second time. Claire had kept her grip on him.</p><p>I wanted to tel Jared the truth: that he was the only one I\u2019d ever wanted in that way, and he would always be the only one. But I couldn\u2019t. He had just told me he would move on, and I had to let him.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Jared. She\u2019s not worth it,\u201d Claire said, tugging on him.</p><p>Jared puffed as if the wind had been knocked out of him. \u201cShe\u2019s worth it. She\u2019s worth this a thousand times,\u201d his eyes glossed over then, and he final y tore his stare away from mine to fol ow his sister.</p><p>I slid in next to Ryan and he reached across me to shut the door. The cab ride seemed to take an eternity. I could hear Ryan chattering, but the look on Jared\u2019s face had me spiraling into devastation so deep that it grew difficult for me to breathe. I rol ed down the window and rested my head against the door, letting the icy wind burn my face.</p><p>\u201cHey? You okay?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t answer. My heart was breaking; a real, physical pain radiated from my chest and throughout my entire body. Ryan put a gentle hand on my shoulder and pul ed me against him. I expected to feel the comfort I always felt with him, but it only made me feel worse.</p><p>When we pul ed into Brown, Ryan reached up to pay the driver and then stumbled from the cab. He twirled me a few times as we walked to Andrews, and when we reached the door, he pul ed me to him.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d he said, kissing my cheek. His lips brushed against my skin as he tightened his grip around me and took a few steps, prompting a slow, silent dance in the middle of the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cI should go in,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>Ryan\u2019s lips grazed my cheek and skimmed across my mouth. He sighed as he made his way to my other cheek, and then kissed me again.</p><p>He took a few steps backward and grinned. \u201cI\u2019l cal you tomorrow,\u201d he said, turning to disappear into the darkness.</p><p>With each step to my room I tried to figure out where everything had gone so horribly wrong. I hadn\u2019t set out to hurt anyone, yet every decision I made seemed to cause others pain. I pushed open the door and col apsed onto my bed.</p><p>Through the whiskey fog I searched my past, trying to remember the exact moment that I\u2019d made a mistake, where I could have made a better choice. If I had chosen to stay with Jared, no matter how sure he was, his family would be in danger. My choice to end things had left both of us in agony that didn\u2019t seem to be subsiding. Convincing Ryan to engage in a fake relationship with me had only accomplished Ryan having false hope, and if it were even possible, I hurt Jared worse than I already had.</p><p>Beth\u2019s key rattled the door knob. She walked in to our dark room, throwing her purse onto the bedside table.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d she whispered. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you went to Chad\u2019s,\u201d I said, turning to face her.</p><p>She sat on my bed and placed her hand gently on my leg. \u201cI wanted to make sure you were al right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d The liquor helped to keep my voice even.</p><p>Beth was aggravated with my calm demeanor. \u201cWe al saw what happened. Is Ryan insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just trying to make a point.\u201d</p><p>Beth shot a disgusted glance at me. \u201cWhat point would that be? That he has suicidal tendencies? Jared could have wadded him up like a piece of paper, and considering his state of mind...that was just real y, real y stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep. I have a lot to do tomorrow,\u201d I said, settling against my pil ow.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so calm about this? I don\u2019t understand you anymore, Nina. It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, my eyes closed. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking clearly. I\u2019ve had a lot to drink.\u201d</p><p>Beth shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not acting like yourself. It\u2019s like you left the best part of you behind when you left Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I snapped, turning my back to her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, I just meant....\u201d Beth sighed and then left without saying goodbye.</p><p>Sunday morning I woke up to the sound of the rain pelting against the window. I peered out, seeing Jared\u2019s Escalade just down the street. My chest ached, knowing how hard it must have been for him to be alone on his birthday. I fantasized about bringing him a present, or simply running out to hug him, but I could do neither. As soon as I shut the door behind me from returning from the shower, there was a knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute!\u201d I cal ed, rushing to throw some clothes on.</p><p>I opened the door to Ryan\u2019s smiling face, his hair dripping wet. \u201cI was wondering if you wanted to take a drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour truck is at the pub, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, wiping away the water that ran down his forehead from his hairline. \u201cJosh took me to get it earlier. You wanna go?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s pouring outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...,\u201d he stal ed, shoving his hands in his pockets, \u201cyou wanna hang out here?\u201d</p><p>I smiled apologetical y. \u201cI have a huge test tomorrow, first thing in the morning. I need to cram.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shrugged again. \u201cI can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to do it by myself. You know how I am,\u201d I said dismissively.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just...,\u201d he sighed, \u201cI can\u2019t quit thinking about that kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Ryan walked past me into my room. \u201cI know what you said. But...don\u2019t you have any feelings for me at al ? Can\u2019t we stop pretending long enough to find out if I could make you happy? I could, you know...make you happy.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s mention of our arrangement caused me to glance up at the vent, but it didn\u2019t matter. Jared saw right through me from the very beginning.</p><p>\u201cYou do make me happy. I just don\u2019t have anything left to...,\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about this right now. I have to study,\u201d I said, opening the door.</p><p>\u201cDo you have plans for dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I hugged him. \u201cNo. I\u2019l talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>It would be the beginning of the end for us. Jared had agreed to stay away, and Ryan knew that our time was limited. He nodded and left my room, disappointed.</p><p>Studying was nothing less than impossible, knowing Jared was outside. I peered out the rain-streaked window again to see that Jared hadn\u2019t moved. The urge to go to him became unmanageable, so I grabbed my keys and set out to take a coffee break off campus.</p><p>I drove just a few blocks to the nearest coffee shop and went in, ordering my usual. I took my time, lingering in the booth, watching different faces come and go. Fantasies of surprising Jared with a gift kept creeping into my thoughts, and I final y resorted to returning to my dorm.</p><p>As soon as I walked outside, I noticed Jared in my peripheral. His shirt was wet from standing in the rain, and I held my breath as I passed him. The circles under his eyes were dark, and his face appeared paler than his natural golden tone.</p><p>My feet refused to take another step. No matter what I had said, I stil loved him. I couldn\u2019t make him feel like a ghost on his birthday. I closed my eyes, knowing I would go against everything I had worked for in the last six weeks. I was at a crossroad, and I was about to deliberately take the wrong turn.</p><p>I turned on my heels and walked straight up to him. Jared watched me with wary eyes, obviously unsure of what to expect.</p><p>Although I had made strangers of us over the last weeks, it felt right be close to him again. I felt no awkwardness or tension, and I could see beyond his cautious expression that he felt the same.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cHappy Birth\u2014,\u201d</p><p>Before I could finish, Jared grabbed my shoulders and pul ed me against him into a deep kiss. My lips melted against the familiar heat of his mouth, and as I breathed in his amazing scent, I felt a bit lightheaded. When Jared realized I wouldn\u2019t pul away, he wrapped his arms around me and held me tightly against him, shamelessly taking advantage of the moment. Minutes passed and I could hear the giggling of children and teenage girls as they walked by. When his lips final y left mine, he hugged me tightly and buried his face in my neck, taking in a deep breath through his nose. He caressed his cheek against mine for a few moments more, and then final y released me.</p><p>He scanned my face for some sort of reaction. I wasn\u2019t sure what expression was on my face, but Jared looked cautiously pleased.</p><p>\u201cDay,\u201d I finished, breathlessly.</p><p>His eyes were a few shades lighter than I\u2019d seen them in weeks. I waited for a moment, and al owed my lips to form a tiny smile before returning to my car.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Jared cal ed.</p><p>I turned around and a tired smile touched his face. \u201cThat\u2019s al I wanted today.\u201d</p><p>My heart sank at his words, and I wished the world would leave us alone so I could stay with him. The memory of Harry Crenshaw pressing a gun to Bex\u2019s temple flashed in my mind, and I stiffened.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Jared.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Absolution</p><p>Finals week arrived. The little sleep I\u2019d gotten before became nonexistent with the amount of studying and cramming I had to do. I studied with the group at the Rock every night, only to return to my room to read and memorize in solitude.</p><p>Ryan continued to pretend, walking me to lunch, to classes, and back and forth from my room. He was the perfect boyfriend; he opened doors, brought late night brain food, and he even rubbed my shoulders while quizzing me on study guides. A part of me wondered if he was trying so hard because he knew the end of the week meant the end of pretending, and he hoped I would change my mind.</p><p>Beth and Chad found an apartment, and some of her things were already packed in boxes. A sad air befel the room when we were both in it, surrounded by cardboard. The wal s looked empty and clinical without her teddy bears and tiaras displayed on the wal s and ribbons dripping from the shelves.</p><p>Thursday night, occasional cracks of thunder rattled the windows. The rain beat against the window in a heavy gust, and Beth sighed at her careful y highlighted textbook. I slammed my book shut and put a CD in the stereo, twisting the volume knob as high as it would go.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Beth yel ed over the music.</p><p>I jumped up and down, holding my hands out to her. \u201cIt\u2019s our last night as roomies, roomie! We\u2019re sending you out in style!\u201d</p><p>Beth giggled and stood up, grabbing my hands and shaking her hair to the beat as we bounced together. After a few songs, a loud banging resounded from the door. I shimmied over to open it, laughing when I saw Kim\u2019s smiling face.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a party!\u201d she yel ed, holding up two six packs of cheap beer. \u201cI come bearing gifts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoo!\u201d Beth squealed. Her hair flapped about as she danced in her bare feet.</p><p>Before I\u2019d finished my first can, another knock on the door revealed a rather wet and confused Ryan, who cringed at the volume of the stereo.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ryan yel ed. A wide grin stretched across his face as he watched us bounce.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our impromptu going away party for Beth!\u201d I yel ed back.</p><p>\u201cCool! I\u2019l make phone cal s!\u201d Ryan exclaimed, pul ing out his cel phone.</p><p>Within twenty minutes, our room was shoulder to shoulder with our entire study group, plus a few girls from down the hal that had wandered in out of curiosity. Kim and Tucker were jumping on Beth\u2019s bed, and the rest of us were dancing and laughing.</p><p>By midnight, everyone except Beth, Chad, and Ryan had cleared out to study. Beth grabbed her purse and hugged me.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much! I needed that. It\u2019s been so sad around here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m going to miss you terribly,\u201d I said, jutting out my bottom lip.</p><p>Beth squeezed me until it was hard to breathe. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, too. But we\u2019l stil see each other, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we wil .\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I waved goodbye to her and Chad, and then sat on my bed, exhausted. As usual, any normal, content feelings I had left with the moment.</p><p>Ryan turned to see the look on my face. \u201cWhat is it, Babe?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNo one\u2019s here, Ryan. You don\u2019t have to cal me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do it for other people,\u201d he said, an amused grin spanning his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRyan...,\u201d I began. Knocking at the door provided a perfect excuse to postpone the inevitable. \u201cBeth must have forgotten her keys.\u201d I opened the door and gasped.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have come unless something was horribly wrong. The adrenaline exploded through my bloodstream as I braced myself for what she might say.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Claire? Is it Jared?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>She looked at Ryan and then back at me, and for the first time she didn\u2019t have a murderous expression on her face. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Ryan said, standing in front of me.</p><p>She rol ed her eyes. \u201cIf I wanted to hurt her, Ryan, you standing there with your hands in your pockets wouldn\u2019t do much in the way of a deterrent,\u201d</p><p>she said, looking back to me. \u201cIt\u2019s important, Nina.\u201d</p><p>I could feel my heart thudding against my chest wal . \u201cWhat? He\u2019s okay, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s at home. He final y agreed to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The numbness came like second nature, and automatical y an emotional wal surrounded me.</p><p>Claire frowned at my generic answer. \u201cOh? I can\u2019t stand to see him like this anymore, and you\u2019re the only one that can fix it. He\u2019s been a mess since his birthday. He\u2019s been a mess for weeks, but he\u2019s been real y bad since Sunday.\u201d She looked to the floor, clearly disturbed by whatever image was in her head. \u201cI think it\u2019s final y hit him that you\u2019re not going to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>I found my focus again, grateful to Claire for the reminder. \u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Claire looked at Ryan and then at me in disgust. \u201cYou two aren\u2019t fooling anyone. Jared knows exactly what\u2019s going on. It was a stupid idea, Nina.</p><p>You\u2019re putting him through hel for nothing. I could understand if you didn\u2019t feel the same, but I know you do.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, the consequences to his family coming to the forefront of my mind. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s face twisted into a heartbreaking expression, and I was taken aback when I saw her eyes gloss over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like this, Nina. Not even when Dad died. I was hoping he would snap out of it, that after awhile he would get over it, but he hasn\u2019t. He won\u2019t sleep, he can\u2019t eat, he\u2019s forced to watch you ignore him every day...it\u2019s torture,\u201d she said, stubbornly wiping a rogue tear from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cStop it. I don\u2019t want to hear anymore,\u201d I said, closing my eyes.</p><p>Claire blinked the tears away and glared at me. \u201cWel , that\u2019s too bad. He has to live it, the least you can do is listen to it,\u201d she said, pul ing my arm toward her. Ryan took his hand out of his pockets and moved toward Claire. She pressed one hand against his chest and effortlessly pushed him against the door, holding him there. Ryan leaned forward, but he was helpless against her angel\u2019s strength.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her,\u201d Ryan said, glowering at Claire.</p><p>Claire took her eyes from me and glanced at Ryan, taking her hand from his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt her. Stay out of it, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Ryan stood in place against the door and looked at me. \u201cNina?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I assured him. \u201cYou have to go, Claire. Please, just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s broken, Nina,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cDon\u2019t you see it? Don\u2019t you care? The pain he\u2019s going through is enough, but he has to feel your pain, too. Can you imagine the pain you feel missing him, being without him, wanting him...doubled? He kept saying that you just needed space...that you would come around, but after Sunday, after you told him goodbye...it broke him.\u201d</p><p>My resolve waivered, but I fought my weakness for Jared, knowing I was at another crossroad. I had to make the right decision.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI know you think you\u2019re atoning for Jack\u2019s sins. But what you\u2019re doing, Nina? It\u2019s kil ing Jared. Nothing can be worse than watching him die a little more every day.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and the tears final y overflowed.</p><p>Claire looked down at her hands, her next words not coming easily. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault we lost our father, Nina.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips and then sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look him in the eye if it happened again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping my family safe isn\u2019t your job. It\u2019s Jared\u2019s, and it\u2019s mine. And I\u2019m very, very good at my job. You can\u2019t keep making him suffer because you\u2019re afraid to repeat Jack\u2019s mistakes.\u201d Her eyebrows pul ed in. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good enough reason to break his heart.\u201d</p><p>Ryan watched both of us, confused by the exchange.</p><p>\u201cTime wil make it easier,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cTime wil make it worse!\u201d she snapped, disgusted at my suggestion. \u201cYou\u2019re his Taleh, Nina...the other half of his soul. He\u2019s never going to get over you. And no matter how much you hope that you wil ...you\u2019l never get over him. You\u2019re going to wake up one day and realize what you\u2019ve done, and you\u2019re going to regret the time you wasted apart from him for the rest of your life.\u201d A tear careened down her perfect cherubic cheek and she left it there, too intent on convincing me to save her brother.</p><p>I felt my face crumple. I knew she was right.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s hand lightly touched my back. I looked at him, and although his eyes were ful of hurt, he smiled.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said.</p><p>I smiled at him and began to speak, but he simply shook his head, hugged me tightly, and walked out the door.</p><p>I wiped my eyes and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I nodded, and for the first time I saw Claire\u2019s face light up. She threw her arms around me, hugging me a little too tight.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d She pul ed me by the hand down the hal , unable to contain her triumphant smile. I had to jog keep up with her.</p><p>I squinted, recoiling from the remnant rain of the departing thunderstorm. The Lotus chirped when she clicked the keyless entry, and I slid in beside her, wiping the water from my arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ryan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBex is home,\u201d Claire smiled. She slammed the gear shift into place and we peeled away from the curb, the engine growling as she soared toward Jared\u2019s loft.</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak; I fumbled with my ring and tried to imagine Jared\u2019s reaction when I showed up unannounced.</p><p>Claire pul ed beside the curb behind the Escalade. I took a deep breath and opened my door with shaking fingers.</p><p>Jared was already standing in front of the loft under the light of a street lamp, looking exhausted and confused. He tore his eyes away from mine for just a moment to look at Claire, who stood with her door open on the other side of the car.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d he asked Claire.</p><p>Claire only offered a smug smile.</p><p>He looked back at me with concern. \u201cDid Claire force you to come here?\u201d he asked, wary.</p><p>I shook my head, afraid to speak. His wasn\u2019t the reaction I expected.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, his eyes darting back and forth between me and Claire. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t make her beg, Jared. Just take her back.\u201d And with that she ducked into her car and pul ed away.</p><p>Jared\u2019s face darted back to mine. \u201cW...What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared stared at me, his light blue t-shirt transparent from the rain.</p><p>I realized that Claire had a point to what she\u2019d said to her brother. \u201cI\u2019l beg,\u201d I nodded, taking a step toward him. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve forgiveness, I know, but I was hoping....\u201d I sighed and shook my head. Nothing I could say would be enough.</p><p>\u201cYou came here to beg me back?\u201d Jared asked, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cOr humiliate myself by babbling incoherent nonsense in the rain....\u201d I laughed nervously. Thunder rol ed in the distance and I pul ed my arms around me, chil ed by wet clothes.</p><p>Jared took a few steps toward me and stopped. He watched me for a moment, though I wasn\u2019t sure what he was searching for.</p><p>\u201cThis was a bad idea. I should have cal ed.\u201d I fidgeted, feeling more embarrassed by the second.</p><p>\u201cYou came here to apologize?\u201d Jared asked again, taking a few more steps.</p><p>The humiliation boiled the blood under my cheeks. \u201cI made a mistake. A huge, horrible mistake and I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you hated me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me in disbelief and I shifted nervously, worrying that I had hurt him beyond forgiveness.</p><p>I took another step. \u201cYou were right. I was afraid they would hurt your family trying to get to me. But to save them, I hurt you. I don\u2019t expect you to trust me again, but I am so, so sorry. I love you, Jared, and if I\u2019ve learned anything over the past weeks, it\u2019s that no matter what happens...I\u2019l love you the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Jared watched me prattle on with an indiscernible expression on his face.</p><p>I bit my lip; the suspense of his answer was insufferable. \u201cPlease say something.\u201d</p><p>Jared took a few more steps until he was only inches from me. The rain dripped off his chin and nose as he looked down at me. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you, now,\u201d he said, cupping my cheeks in his hands as if he was holding his most precious possession. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if I\u2019l ever stop.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste a second longer. He pressed his lips against mine, and I wrapped my arms tightly around his neck. My feet left the ground and the rain disappeared as Jared whisked me into the loft and up the stairs, his feet barely touching the steps.</p><p>In seconds his mattress was beneath me. Caution was non-existent; Jared\u2019s mouth begged mine to open as his lips worked impatiently against mine. My lips parted as my knees did, and Jared reached back to lift his shirt over his head.</p><p>His lips found their way to my waist, and his kisses ran up the midline of my stomach as he pushed my tank top up and over my head. His breathing grew uneven as he hovered above me, watching me slowly pul the straps of my bra from my shoulders. I arched my back to unsnap the clasps behind me and he tenderly kissed my lips as he pul ed the straps from my arms and tossed the lacey fabric to the floor.</p><p>He clenched the hem of my skirt and panties, pul ing them down until they were lost somewhere in the mangled sheets. I sighed as he pressed his bare chest against mine, kissing my neck while I reached down to pul his belt from the loops. Jared moaned as I ripped open the top button of his jeans and shoved them down over his hips. He used his feet to push them passed his ankles, and I heard them drop to the floor at the end of the bed.</p><p>Jared paused to look into my eyes for a long moment, and his fingers glided down my face and neck.</p><p>\u201cI guess no one is going to interrupt tonight,\u201d I said.</p><p>The corners of his mouth turned up and he slowly shook his head.</p><p>The grin faded to a serious, focused expression and he leaned down to kiss my lips. Jared took a deep breath in through his nose and his body tensed. I clinched my eyes shut, and involuntarily turned my head away, feeling pain and pleasure at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he whispered, breathless.</p><p>I nodded; we were final y close enough. My hands slid down his neck to his shoulders and I dug my fingers into his flesh at the intense pleasure searing through my body. A quiet groan escaped his lips as he tensed again.</p><p>His tongue tasted the inside of my mouth. My senses were overwhelmed to the point where I couldn\u2019t think straight, so I couldn\u2019t imagine what he must have felt. The hours passed as minutes, and the minutes as hours. I had no concept of time; I had no need for it. That moment was al I\u2019d ever wanted, and I never wanted it to end.</p><p>I awoke on my stomach, sprawled across Jared\u2019s bed with nothing on but the sheets tangled around my waist. I peeked over at Jared, who was on his side, watching me with a sweet expression.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he crooned.</p><p>\u201cDid you get any sleep? I asked.</p><p>Jared chuckled. \u201cFive hours. The longest I\u2019ve slept since I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and leaned over to kiss his lips. My body felt stiff and relaxed at the same time, and my muscles ached in a wonderful way.</p><p>He touched my face. \u201cYou were sleeping so soundly I didn\u2019t want to wake you, but your last final is in ninety minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I scrambled off the bed with Jared\u2019s sheet twisted around me and I held it to my chest as I shuffled to the bathroom. I stopped in my tracks, flipped around and returned to the bed, planting a ridiculously long kiss on his lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d I cal ed back as I ran to the bathroom to get in the shower.</p><p>Everything felt different; the water, the soap, my skin. I couldn\u2019t stop smiling as I recal ed the events of the night before. My fingers were starting to prune when I heard a soft knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cBetter get a move on, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I shut off the water and rushed through my morning routine.</p><p>\u201cClaire brought my clothes this morning?\u201d I guessed, trotting down the stairs.</p><p>Jared smiled, standing by the door with my coffee. \u201cShe dropped them off at the door.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his lips as I passed, and he fol owed me to the Escalade.</p><p>I made it to my desk just as the professor began passing out tests. It was difficult to concentrate; my mind wandered to Jared\u2019s lips\u2014and other parts of his body\u2014and the fact that we had the entire summer to make up for lost time.</p><p>I was the last person to finish, and when I handed in my paper, the professor added it to the thick pile, nodding politely.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your summer, Miss Grey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wil ,\u201d I said, smiling when I saw Jared standing in the doorway.</p><p>When we pul ed to the curb in front of the loft, he turned off the key and sat in his seat, keeping my hand in his.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I should apologize to you for last night,\u201d he said, kissing my fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jared shifted in his seat. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly planned. I feel like I ambushed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of ambush I don\u2019t mind,\u201d I smiled, leaning over to kiss him. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anything more.\u201d</p><p>Jared cautiously smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m better than okay. I\u2019m looking forward to the next ambush, actual y.\u201d I leaned over to kiss his neck, making my way to his ear.</p><p>Jared chuckled. \u201cWe might not leave the loft for the rest of the summer with you behaving like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be so bad, would it?\u201d I whispered, grazing my tongue along the edge of his ear.</p><p>\u201cAnd when do you plan on getting your things from Andrews? Your mother is expecting you to move back home this weekend. I have quite a bit of work to do, taking down the tech from your room, the hal ....\u201d he trailed off, distracted by my mouth on his ear.</p><p>I pul ed back and stared at him for a moment. Before I could verbalize the ingenious idea that popped into my head, a broad smile spread across my face.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, smiling as wel .</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re moving my things...why don\u2019t we just bring them here?\u201d I said, searching his eyes for a reaction.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyebrows shot up in shock. \u201cYou want to move into the loft?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, unsure what his reaction meant. I wasn\u2019t exactly confident that the offer was stil open. \u201cIf it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s okay? Do you know how happy you just made me?\u201d he said, scanning my face with unconditional devotion in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a yes?\u201d</p> <p>Jared laughed out loud, shook his head, and then kissed me enthusiastical y. \u201cThat is a definite, without a doubt, absolutely yes.\u201d</p><p>I giggled with excitement as Jared pul ed me over to his lap, kissing me with every bit the joy that I felt. In the course of just twelve hours, the last six weeks dissolved as if they\u2019d never happened. Before the nightmare had ended, we\u2019d gotten our miracle. It had turned out that it was up to us al along.</p><p>We spent the rest of the weekend moving boxes and smal pieces of furniture. Jared insisted on doing most of the lifting, and I hummed along with the stereo as I unpacked my things. We seemed to only get a few boxes unpacked at a time before we were celebrating my homecoming upstairs, only to come downstairs, unpack a few boxes and start the process over again.</p><p>After a heated weekend inside, Jared decided that we should get some fresh air. Monday morning I walked outside to perfect weather. The air smel ed of freshly cut grass and sunshine. I lifted my head towards the cloudless sky, closing my eyes and smiling as the sun filtered through my eyelids.</p><p>Jared climbed onto his Vulcan and smiled. \u201cLil ian wanted me to ask you to dinner. Before you say anything,\u201d he hedged, seeing my shocked expression, \u201cshe suggested we meet in a restaurant. She doesn\u2019t want you to feel obligated, but she would like to see you again. She misses you.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cHow can she miss me? I assumed the undeserved partial treatment would end after she heard what happened.\u201d</p><p>Jared tucked my hair affectionately behind my ear. \u201cShe knows what you\u2019re going through, and you\u2019re the only one that knows what she went through. You have a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go to a restaurant. She can come to our place or we can go over there. I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p> <p>Jared\u2019s eyes poured over my face, wearing a perfectly content expression.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned soft. \u201cOur place.\u201d</p><p>He started the engine and I slipped on my sunglasses, climbing on behind him. The summer air whipped around us as Jared flew down the streets, and I pressed my cheek against his back, feeling happier than I ever had.</p><p>We came to a stoplight and Jared rested his hand on my knee. \u201cWe can get the rest of your things from Cynthia\u2019s in the morning. And if you want to get some paint, we can do that, too,\u201d he said, trying too hard to sound casual.</p><p>I peered around to see his face. \u201cAnd why do we need paint?\u201d</p><p>Jared shrugged. \u201cThe loft doesn\u2019t exactly scream cohabitation. If you want to make it your own, we can get you what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw!\u201d I lilted, making Jared cringe and shake his head.</p><p>I tightened my grip and then rested my forehead on his back. He stiffened and I raised my head to see what had caused him to tense. Samuel stood in front of us, massive and dark as night. His arms were crossed over his chest, making him seem even more ominous. I cowered behind Jared, my heartbeat instantly pounding in my chest.</p><p>\u201cHel o, Nina,\u201d Samuel spoke. His expression seemed to soften but his features were so severe it wasn\u2019t as comforting as he might have meant for it to be.</p><p>\u201cYou must have news,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Samuel said, breaking his stare from me. \u201cShax has received information that Jack had the book secured in a bank that you and Nina alone have access to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bad,\u201d Jared said in a low, portentous tone.</p><p>\u201cThey also know that Nina\u2019s ring has a code embedded in it that they need. There is talk, Jared. They\u2019l be coming for her soon.\u201d</p><p>Jared sat for a moment, lost in thought. His head jerked up to look at Samuel. \u201cNot if we give it to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d I cried.</p><p>He turned to me and touched my face. \u201cNina, I don\u2019t know why Jack has the book. But it\u2019s not worth your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming Shax wil stop once he has the book,\u201d Samuel said, his voice matching his frightening features.</p><p>\u201cHow did they come into this knowledge?\u201d Jared growled.</p><p>\u201cHow else?\u201d Samuel narrowed his eyes. \u201cHumans.\u201d</p><p>I began to ask Samuel what he meant, but just as before, the space he occupied lost any memory of him.</p><p>Jared revved the engine and flew to the loft. He dismounted and pul ed me off the seat, barely letting my feet touch the ground before ushering me up the stairs.</p><p>He kicked the door shut and held my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m going to figure this out, Nina. No one\u2019s in danger. I\u2019m going to end this, okay?\u201d His words were so fast they blurred together, and his eyes were stormy and tense.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, wrapping my arms around him and kissing his lips.</p><p>He watched me warily when I pul ed away. \u201cOkay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I touched his face lightly with my fingertips. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away from you even when I thought I had to. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes turned soft, and he lifted my hand with his ring stil in place. \u201cAnd you keep your promises.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Shax</p><p>The next morning I awoke in the same state I had the five days before: tangled in sheets, muscles aching, eyes tired, stomach hungry, and everything else in an utter state of bliss.</p><p>Jared tightened his arms around me as I stretched. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to sleep?\u201d he said, kissing my neck.</p><p>I slid my bare leg over his hip. \u201cWhy would I want to waste time sleeping when you\u2019re awake?\u201d</p><p>He grinned as he ran his hand up my thigh. \u201cBecause you\u2019re human, and you need more than two hours of sleep a night. Not that I\u2019m complaining, I just need to quit being so selfish and make sure you get to sleep earlier than six A.M.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d I yawned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hungry. I\u2019l make breakfast,\u201d he said, pushing himself off the bed.</p><p>After a long shower, I dressed and trotted down the stairs. I grabbed the newspaper and sat at the table with my coffee, freezing mid-sip as I saw the headline.</p><p>Local Banker Found Dead, Mutilated \u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sweetheart?\u201d he replied, distracted by the pan of eggs in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen this morning\u2019s paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, what\u2019s up?\u201d He turned when he felt my fear as I read over the article.</p><p>I swal owed nervously before meeting Jared\u2019s eyes. \u201cJames Stevens from the bank...the man that let us into the vault...he was found dead yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I handed the paper to him and watched his eyes scan over the words.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean, Jared?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s irises were clear and his features smooth. \u201cHe must have been one of the humans Samuel was referring to. I would have to see the body to be sure if it was Grahm or....\u201d</p><p>I nodded, realizing where he was getting at.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jared handed the paper back to me, pointing to what he\u2019d read.</p><p>Local Jeweler Robbed, Assaulted Police Say String of Crimes Coincidence \u201cVincent!\u201d I said, looking up at Jared. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes darkened a shade. \u201cIt just says assaulted, so I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s alive,\u201d he said, sitting in the chair beside me.</p><p>I fidgeted. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head, sliding his fingers in between mine. \u201cYou and I wil get the book, and then I\u2019m going to return it to Shax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean we\u2019re going to return it to Shax,\u201d I said, squeezing his fingers between mine.</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nina, it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared....\u201d The fear choked off my objections.</p><p>Pul ing me into his lap, Jared shrugged his arms around me. \u201cNina, I\u2019m going to take care of this. Claire wil stay here with you. I promise you\u2019l be safe.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my cheek against his and closed my eyes. \u201cWhat about you? Isn\u2019t that like walking behind enemy lines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something he wants. As long as you\u2019re here, safe, I\u2019l be fine. Trust me?\u201d he said, holding me at arm\u2019s length to search my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do. Just...be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019l be careful. I\u2019ve got plans for you.\u201d He pressed his forehead against mine. \u201cYour eggs are getting cold. I\u2019m going to cal Claire...get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Claire walked through the door less than an hour later, her casual expression matching Jared\u2019s. She also seemed significantly more relaxed around me, even smacking me on the backside when she walked by.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have fun, Nina. I brought movies.\u201d</p><p>My face slowly morphed to disgust. \u201cMovies? You think I\u2019m going to be able to watch a movie while Jared is in a room ful of demons?\u201d</p><p>Claire rol ed her eyes and a smirk sharpened her features. \u201cDon\u2019t you know what Jared is capable of? I\u2019m not worried. You shouldn\u2019t be, either.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s mouth turned up a bit, shoving a handgun in the back of his jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re overdoing it, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Claire shot an expression of chagrin at her brother, and they traded glances.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me to freak out and leave again,\u201d I said. I looked at the floor and then back at her. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me, Claire.\u201d</p><p>She pul ed one side of her mouth into an appreciative smile. \u201cGood. Because I\u2019d just track you down and bring your butt back here.\u201d</p><p>Jared walked toward me and kissed my forehead first, and then my lips. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>My fingers involuntarily gripped his jacket. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re waiting for us at the bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019l protect you. Claire is coming with us...if anyone should be afraid it\u2019s Grahm and his men.\u201d</p><p>My body felt rigid from the moment we stepped out of the door into the al ey. Jared kept my hand in his until we pul ed up to the front entrance of the bank. Claire on one side of me, Jared on the other, we walked inside and across the lobby. An older gentleman in a dark suit and tie approached us.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we wil be retrieving our effects from the vault downstairs,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cEr...c-can I have your name, sir?\u201d he stuttered, anxiously tapping the ends of his fingers against each other.</p><p>\u201cJared Ryel. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...no sir, there\u2019s no problem. I\u2019d be glad to help you.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes swept the room, and I noticed Claire was on alert, as wel . They kept close, both of them in contact with my arms as we walked. Just before the elevator opened to the sub-floor, I noticed a break in Claire\u2019s breathing. It was completely silent for a fraction of a second until the doors slid open to a large, empty room.</p><p>Claire quietly exhaled and Jared gripped my arm, cautiously pul ing me forward. We went through the tedious procedure to gain access to the vault while Claire nonchalantly glanced around the perimeter. Her ice blue eyes would miss nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou put the paper in the safe, Jared,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it,\u201d he said, shoving the key into the lock.</p><p>I looked over at Claire, whose eyes focused on the closing vault. Once it closed, she looked up and slowly scanned the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Claire?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she murmured. \u201cSomething.\u201d</p><p>Jared kept the book under his arm on the return trip to the loft. He escorted me to the end of the al ey and then leaned down to kiss me goodbye.</p><p>Before our lips touched, he looked up as if he sensed something around us.</p><p>\u201cI should go. It\u2019s already attracting them.\u201d</p><p>I clenched his jacket. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire needs to stay here with you. I can\u2019t leave you unprotected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bex? Can\u2019t he stay here with me?\u201d I asked, searching his face as my mind raced to find an alternative.</p><p>\u201cBex is with Lil ian,\u201d he said. I immediately understood his indicative reply; he was covering al the bases.</p><p>\u201cJared....\u201d I said, tightening my grip.</p><p>He pul ed me to him. \u201cIf we wait much longer, they\u2019l come to us, and we don\u2019t want that. This is our only option.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leaned back and closed my eyes, shaking my head. \u201cThere has to be another way. There has to be\u2014,\u201d</p><p>Jared cupped my jaw and his thumb brushed my cheek. \u201cAs long as your heart is beating, so is mine.\u201d</p><p>I tried to forge a brave expression on my face. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes grew soft and the corners of his mouth moved upward. \u201cI love you. I\u2019l see you soon.\u201d</p> <p>Claire gently rested her warm hands on my shoulders as we watched him pul from the curb and then disappear around a corner down the street.</p><p>I felt my insides wrench. \u201cTel me he\u2019s going to be al right.\u201d</p><p>Claire turned me to face her and grinned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t overdoing it, earlier. He wil come back. And if they piss him off, he\u2019l come back with a few demon notches in his belt. Jared doesn\u2019t know how to fail.\u201d</p><p>We walked upstairs and I sat on the couch, trying to relax so Jared wouldn\u2019t be distracted by my fear.</p><p>Claire sat beside me, fidgeting.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to watch a movie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I slowly turned my head toward her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou want to watch TV?\u201d she asked, leaning over to grab the remote from the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Claire blew her bangs from her face and sat quietly beside me for awhile. After a long, awkward silence, she took in a deep breath of air.</p><p>\u201cI was a daddy\u2019s girl,\u201d she mused. \u201cWhen we used to go on vacations, tagging along with your family, of course, I\u2019d get so jealous when my dad would compliment you or even mention your name. When he would be away, with Jack, I would get so angry that you were spending time with him instead of me. My mom would try to explain, but...to a little girl that would rather be with her dad than at an amusement park, I refused to even try to understand.\u201d</p> <p>Claire\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cWhen Jack died...I hated him,\u201d she swal owed. \u201cWhen my father started feeling weak just an hour later...I hated you. My Dad was an Archangel. I never thought I would lose him. He was lying there, fading away, and al I could think about was that I had al of this strength, this speed, the intel igence...I was built to be a savior and I couldn\u2019t save my own father.</p><p>\u201cAs hard as it was for me, Jared took it harder. When Dad took his last breath, I thought Jared was going to die with him,\u201d she closed her eyes and a tear fel down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI was angry with him at first. I felt betrayed that he went to you. But now I see that he didn\u2019t have a choice. You were the only hope he had left...you were the only one that could make sense of his purpose for existing, and he needed you. He needed to know that our lives were worth something. I can see that now. And I\u2019m glad you have each other.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize my mouth was open until she looked at me with wet eyes and chuckled.</p><p>She scooted closer. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have hated you. My father loved you like family and it was just as important to him to keep you safe as it was any of us. It didn\u2019t mean he loved me any less, I know that now. I\u2019m sorry for the way I\u2019ve treated you.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to hug her, but thought better of it. To my surprise she clasped my hand between hers.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI owe you for so much\u2014for the time away from your father, for my life...for Jared. You don\u2019t owe me anything.\u201d</p><p>A warm smile spread across Claire\u2019s face and she squeezed my hand. \u201cSo we\u2019l start over.\u201d</p> <p>I started to speak but her eyes widened, and in the same second she stood with her back to me. I peeked around her to see the door slowly open, and for one fleeting moment I expected Jared to walk in.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Jared.</p><p>A man in a charcoal-grey suit and tie strol ed in through the door, looking around as if he were appraising the loft. When he smiled at me, Claire\u2019s hands bal ed into fists at her sides, and her knuckles turned white under the pressure of her grip.</p><p>He was extraordinarily handsome, teeth gleaming white, black hair perfectly trimmed and slicked back. At first glance he seemed benign, but I recoiled when his black eyes bored into mine.</p><p>\u201cHow nice to see you, Claire,\u201d he spoke, a low hissing sound underlying his voice.</p><p>Claire reached down and gripped my shirt in her fist, slowly pul ing me up behind her. \u201cYou just missed Jared, Shax.\u201d Claire said.</p><p>My blood ran cold. A Duke of Hel was standing just feet from me in my home. I gripped Claire\u2019s arm and she reached around to pul me against her back, slowly side-stepping until we were standing exactly between the kitchen and the front door. Shax watched us shift with his shark\u2019s eyes, as if he were alert to our every breath.</p><p>\u201cJared is looking for me?\u201d he said, dropping his chin to look straight at Claire. \u201cHow interesting.\u201d</p><p>The iron stairs clanged with heavy footsteps, and five men encroached upon the doorway. Shax took a few casual steps forward as the men positioned themselves in a half-circle behind him. I dug my fingers into Claire\u2019s arm when I saw a familiar pair of eyes. It was Grahm.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he nodded with a smug smile.</p><p>\u201cYou take one step near her and you\u2019re a dead man,\u201d Claire seethed.</p><p>A wicked smirk twisted Shax\u2019s mouth. \u201cNow, now, Claire. That\u2019s no way for a young lady doing His work to behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Shax?\u201d Claire snapped.</p><p>The demon looked down, and then his eyes shot up to target me from under his thick, black eyebrows. \u201cI think we al know what I want, Claire.</p><p>Nina\u2019s father took something from me,\u201d he tilted his head and stretched his long neck, \u201cit\u2019s quite an embarrassment for a thief to be stolen from\u2014 especial y the greatest thief that\u2019s ever lived.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed without humor. \u201cYou\u2019ve never lived, Shax. And it\u2019s nice to see that you\u2019ve developed some humility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the ring, Claire,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need the ring. Jared has your stupid book.\u201d</p><p>Shax\u2019s beady eyes narrowed. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>Claire shrugged, slowly pushed me back as she took a half-step forward. \u201cHe took it to you. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s in your building as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want a filthy demon for a house guest,\u201d Claire growled.</p><p>Shax eyed me with curiosity. \u201cOr was he trying to avoid us coming near his Taleh? I understand he\u2019s fal en in love with her. How precious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave, now,\u201d Claire said, more of a demand than an offer.</p><p>Shax\u2019s crooked mouth pul ed up into a half-smile. \u201cThank you, Claire. We were just on our way out. But we\u2019l be taking Nina with us. Jack owes me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I owe Jared one,\u201d Grahm said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l rip out your throat before I\u2019l let you touch her!\u201d Claire snarled. The guttural sound that came from her throat when she spoke was frightening.</p><p>Grahm signaled his men, and they walked cautiously past Shax. Claire gestured behind her for me to stand back as she crouched slightly, set to defend me. One of the men lunged at her, and so quickly that I missed some of her movements, she incapacitated him without effort. The second man tried to swing at her, but she jerked to the side just as two other men rushed from the side. I took a few more steps back as I watched her head butt one of the men, blood spattering in the air, and then strike another in the throat with her fist. The man made a horrific gurgling noise before fal ing to the ground.</p><p>Just as Claire turned to face Shax, Grahm pul ed out a gun and held it to Claire\u2019s forehead. She froze.</p><p>\u201cI was just going to take Nina, but I think it would better settle the score if he came home to see your pretty face blown away and a sweet little note to let him know we\u2019re violating his girlfriend in a hundred different ways before we kil her.\u201d</p><p>I felt my legs disappear, and I reached back to steady myself against the table as Grahm gave me a lewd once-over with his eyes.</p><p>Claire smirked. \u201cYou\u2019l fit right in where Jared\u2019s going to send you, Grahm.\u201d</p><p>Grahm cocked his weapon, and I felt a solitary tear seep from my eye and trickle down my cheek. Time passed in slow motion as I looked at Grahm\u2019s arrogant expression and then back to Claire. The scene was surreal: Ful grown men sprawled on the floor in pools of their own blood, and tiny Claire, a fair-haired teenaged-girl moments away from execution. I held my breath as I watched her slowly close her eyes and wait for the bul et to leave its chamber.</p><p>In the same second that Grahm\u2019s finger pressed against the trigger, Claire\u2019s body blurred. The bul et from his gun whirred past me and into the tile above the stove, and Claire rammed her elbow in Grahm\u2019s face, sending blood exploding from his nose. The blow sent him flying through the air, landing at Shax\u2019s feet. Grahm sat up on his knees, teeth gnashing in pain. The blood pooled in his palms and dripped through his fingers onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Shax commanded.</p><p>Claire immediately backed up against me. She turned her head slightly, stil keeping her eyes on Shax. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold him off, Nina...you\u2019re going to have to run. Jared wil find you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can hold me, Claire? You\u2019re nearly human.\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled. \u201cMaybe so, Shax, but my angel side can stil kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Shax wasn\u2019t amused. He crouched in preparation to attack, and a strange snarl emanated from his chest. Inside his throat, a screech and an animalistic growl intertwined. It was the most terrifying sound my ears had ever experienced. The demon\u2019s black irises bled into the whites of his eyes, and I braced for impact.</p><p>As if I had blinked and missed a second of time, a dark massive figure stood between us and Shax. Claire\u2019s body relaxed and she maneuvered us around him, bringing Shax back into view.</p><p>Jared stood in the doorway, glowering at Shax with a lethal expression. Sensing my fear and relief, his attention broke to me and instantly he was at my side, pul ing me from Claire\u2019s grip to the safety of his arms.</p><p>Shax was cautious in the Archangel\u2019s presence. \u201cThe book is mine, Samuel!\u201d His sinister eyes were wild and shifted between each of us like a cornered animal.</p><p>Samuel tossed the book at the demon\u2019s feet, just beside Grahm. \u201cTake your blasphemous book and leave from here. In the name of the Most High, I wil end your existence if you come near this family again, foul beast!\u201d Samuel bel owed, his voice shaking the wal s.</p><p>Shax recoiled from the command of the Cimmerian and backed slowly out the door, hissing at his injured minions to fol ow.</p><p>Grahm smiled at me with blood-stained teeth. \u201cI\u2019m going to see you again soon, baby dol .\u201d</p><p>Jared lunged at him, but Samuel held his hand to Jared\u2019s chest. \u201cLet them go,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Jared watched Grahm, reluctantly al owing him to retreat with his wounded partners. Claire stood at the entryway and made sure they were gone before she closed the door.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone told you that you have excel ent timing?\u201d Claire asked, smiling at her brother.</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Claire ran towards Samuel at ful speed, leaping up to wrap her arms around him, her legs dangling two feet from the ground. I jumped at the sudden movement, but as soon as Samuel hugged her and a wide smile flashed across his face, I sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cI think you missed your cal ing, little girl. You were meant to be Cimmerian,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>Claire giggled and squeezed his neck. \u201cI\u2019m half human so it evens up the odds, Sam. If I were Cimmerian, you\u2019d be out of a job.\u201d</p><p>Samuel bel owed a laugh and shook his head. \u201cAnd you accuse Shax of lacking humility!\u201d</p><p>Jared turned to me. \u201cAre you al right?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to lie, so I remained silent.</p><p>Jared pul ed me into his chest and kissed my hair. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to Grahm,\u201d Claire said after Samuel set her on her feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Jared said in a firm voice.</p><p>Claire wiped the blood from the floor and straightened the furniture. She skipped about, the confrontation and victory making her a tad giddy. I watched her as she hummed an indistinct tune while she cleaned.</p><p>An hour later, Claire said her goodbyes to drive to Ryan\u2019s hometown as the sky outside faded to deep blue. The loft was as before, the furniture in place, the broken glass hidden in the trash, the blood mopped up and the red stained rags thrown away.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Jared asked, poking his finger through the bul et hole above the stove. I shook my head and Jared turned to face me. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head again.</p><p>\u201cNina,\u201d he chided. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely said a word since I\u2019ve been back. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal to be afraid. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...don\u2019t leave me again. Okay? Claire was prepared to defend me with her life, but I was so scared, Jared. I was so afraid they were going to kil me and you would die.\u201d</p><p>He walked across the room and held my cheeks gently in his hands, raising my eyes to his. \u201cYou were afraid to die only because I would?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, but my face crumpled around it. \u201cI\u2019m so weak, Jared. I\u2019m just a stupid, weak, human, and that makes you so vulnerable. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>Jared chuckled in amazement and shook his head. \u201cNina...,\u201d he breathed out a smal laugh, rendered speechless. He leaned down and kissed my lips, his mouth conveying what he couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Saving Grace</p><p>Over the next weeks life had returned to normal. Jared and I spent our time painting and rearranging the furniture, and the space metamorphosed from Jared\u2019s dark loft to our bright and cheerful home.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have thought to change a thing, but Jared insisted I add a feminine touch. I hung up self-portraits we\u2019d taken of ourselves, bought a new floral comforter, and even picked out new china. Jared regarded the transformation with wholehearted gratitude. There were times that I thought Jared wanted me make the changes so that he had tangible proof that I was in fact living there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A month after I had official y moved in, Jared wanted to celebrate with an evening out. I put on a strapless black dress with red pumps and Jared made the effort of putting on a tie. We walked out to the curb and Jared straddled his Vulcan. I raised an eyebrow, pointedly looked down at my short skirt and then back at him.</p><p>Jared laughed out loud and dismounted. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the Escalade and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cSomewhere new. You\u2019l like it,\u201d he said before closing my door.</p><p>We pul ed up to a dark, brick building. He helped me to the curb and held open a glass door, kissing my cheek as I passed. A smal Asian woman greeted us, and Jared grabbed my hand, leading me to a table bearing a beautiful arrangement of pink and white tulips. We were the only patrons in the smal eatery and I smiled at Jared as he sat in front of me. The woman walked half-way across the room to a waiter\u2019s station to fil our water glasses, and I leaned against the table.</p><p>\u201cAre they getting ready to close?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Jared chuckled. \u201cNo...I arranged for us to have the place to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, watching the woman bring our water and menus.</p> <p>Jared uttered something in Japanese to the woman and she nodded, leaving us alone.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you how exceptional y beautiful you look tonight?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly four or five times,\u201d I smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The woman returned, chattering something I didn\u2019t understand. Jared looked to me and then back at her. \u201cNo, I think we\u2019l need a few more minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we meeting your mother here or something?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was just wondering...why al the effort? The tie, the flowers, the empty restaurant...the secrecy.\u201d</p><p>Jared raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat secrecy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were sneaking around the loft earlier. I may be human, but I\u2019m not blind.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s laughter fil ed the room. \u201cI can sneak past trained assassins, but I can\u2019t get anything by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re not around you every second of the day,\u201d I qualified.</p><p>Jared smiled, pressing his lips together. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month of cohabitation. You mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he smiled, an edge of nervousness to his voice.</p> <p>I narrowed my eyes and pursed my lips at his evasive answer, but I let it go. He was obviously having fun keeping it from me.</p><p>I chose a dish from the menu that seemed close to my usual. When the waitress returned, Jared ordered in perfect Japanese.</p><p>I tapped my finger on the table.</p><p>Jared watched me fidget with an amused expression. \u201cDo you have somewhere to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just waiting for the explanation.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cYou\u2019re very impatient this evening.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and leaned back against my chair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just feel a surprise coming on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, now?\u201d he teased. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Jared. I know something\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at the waitress as she brought our plates of food, and I sighed.</p><p>Jared led us into conversation about other things as we ate. He had made plans for us to have dinner at Lil ian\u2019s that weekend. Ryan had returned to spend a few days with Josh, so Claire was in town. I discussed my fal schedule, and we talked about the changes living off-campus would pose.</p><p>We also decided to cal Beth and Chad and invite them to our place for dinner as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked Beth,\u201d Jared mused.</p><p>\u201cMe, too!\u201d I teased, feigning surprise.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always been a good friend to you, but I particularly appreciate the talks she gave you in my favor. She\u2019s a smart girl, that Beth,\u201d he said, nodding with a smug smile.</p><p>I spun the noodles around my fork as I spoke. \u201cThere were moments I thought you had her on the payrol . She was very persistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I like her,\u201d he smiled. \u201cShe knows what\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew better than I did that we would end up together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think we\u2019d end up together?\u201d Jared asked, looking a bit surprised.</p><p>\u201cWel ...I wanted to. But at the time I didn\u2019t think we should,\u201d I explained, stabbing my fork into some type of meat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you got over that,\u201d he said, deep in thought. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if...,\u201d he looked at me with deep affection. \u201cYou make me so happy, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me happy, honey,\u201d I cooed.</p><p>Jared raised his brow at my uncharacteristic use of an endearing term and smiled, but his expression changed as his thoughts did. \u201cI know things have happened pretty fast between us,\u201d he grimaced. \u201cMost people would say too fast, but we\u2019re not most people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d I said. I rol ed the broccoli to one side of my plate and noticed Jared\u2019s expression twisting to chagrin.</p><p>\u201cI should have ordered that without broccoli, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Jared. I can separate the broccoli from my food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want tonight to be perfect...I\u2019m forgetting things,\u201d he said, glowering at the broccoli on the rim of my plate as if it had insulted him.</p><p>That one phrase caught my attention. \u201cWhy does it have to be perfect?\u201d</p><p>Jared shifted uncomfortably in his chair and sighed with relief when the waitress came to refil our water glasses.</p><p>\u201cWhere was I?\u201d he asked after the waitress left.</p><p>I blotted my lips with a napkin. \u201cWe\u2019re moving too fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I mean yes, that\u2019s where I was at, but no, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re moving too fast,\u201d he paused for a moment and then looked warily at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t think we are, do you?\u201d</p><p>I giggled and shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d My eyebrows moved in as I watched him get increasingly nervous. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019m perfect. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...you\u2019re kinda freaking me out, though,\u201d I turned my head to the side slightly as I eyed him with suspicion.</p><p>Jared closed his eyes and then took a deep, relaxing breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just a little keyed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. It\u2019s just dinner,\u201d I said, reaching across the table to his hand.</p><p>\u201cHuh...yeah,\u201d Jared said, laughing once at my suggestion, and then looking down at his plate.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking St. Lucia for our vacation. They have air conditioners, there,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l make the cal s tomorrow,\u201d he said, distracted.</p><p>I pondered that for a moment and then narrowed my eyes. \u201cMy mother must pay you wel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery wel ,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>I rol ed another piece of broccoli to the side of my plate. \u201cWel , technical y, I pay you wel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared said, freezing in the middle of a bite.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWel , when Jack died\u2014his estate, his assets, everything...it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I thought your mother....\u201d Jared shook his head, taken off-guard.</p><p>\u201cOh, she can live there, she can deal with the bil s and the taxes and the rest of it until I graduate. I can\u2019t deal with it al right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you pay me?\u201d Jared asked, grimacing. He didn\u2019t seem happy at the idea.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you want a raise?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Jared laughed. \u201cAs much as I love my job, maybe I should be paying you.\u201d I smiled at his words, and he worked to relax his expression. \u201cSo, it\u2019s been a month since you moved in. Are you comfortable? Does it feel like home, yet?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, looking into his breathtaking blue-grey eyes. \u201cIt felt like home before I moved in. You\u2019re my home, Jared.\u201d</p><p>He beamed at my words and reached down into the inside pocket of his jacket. \u201cNina, there\u2019s something I....\u201d</p><p>The waitress approached the table and Jared slumped against his chair, looking slightly disappointed. She took our plates and left us alone with the dessert menu.</p><p>\u201cAngel Food cake is on the menu,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to have a slice of that.\u201d</p><p>I watched Jared scrol over the list of pies, cakes and ice cream. While he searched, I noticed a smal , glowing red dot appear over his shoulder and then slowly make its way across the table. I lowered my menu as I watched it hit the edge of the table, and then travel up the bodice of my dress, settling over my heart.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d I said in a higher, bewildered pitch.</p><p>\u201cWhat, sweetheart?\u201d Jared asked, stil looking over the menu.</p><p>\u201cThere must be someone else in here. They\u2019re playing with one of those laser-pointer thingies,\u201d I said, stil watching it quiver on my chest.</p><p>My body jerked, and I felt the world spin in slow motion. The sounds of war impeded the air around me and I struggled to gain my bearings. Glass crashed to the floor, and high-pitched buzzing noises accompanied the staccato of gunfire. My arms and legs felt constricted and heavy, but at the same time weightless; flying through the air, higher and higher. I closed my eyes and tried to sift through the confusion.</p><p>Jared\u2019s voice cal ed to me from far away, and as his voice grew closer, so did the buzzing and tapping noises.</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d Jared yel ed.</p><p>Sitting on the ground with my back to the inside of the waiter\u2019s station, time sped up and the noises blurred together. Jared reached above me, and I heard a ripping noise. With one hand he placed a large board behind my back, leaning me against it. He ducked once and cal ed my name again.</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d</p><p>My mind abruptly caught up with the present. Jared had reached across the table the second he\u2019d noticed the red dot, and we flew together under a slew of gunfire to the middle of the room. He quickly righted me and ripped the marble countertop off above us, placing it behind me as a shield.</p><p>A hail of bul ets soared around us again, and I could hear the waitress screaming from the back in Japanese. Jared yel ed something back to her and then turned to me.</p><p>The red table cloth had made the journey with us, and I was tangled in it. I covered my head as the next barrage of bul ets surged through the restaurant. When I looked up, I noticed a red stain on Jared\u2019s shirt that grew larger with every passing second.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with confusion and then fol owed my line of sight to his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, shaking his head dismissively. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he yel ed over the breaking glass and gunfire, ducking as he spoke.</p><p>I nodded, watching Jared\u2019s confused expression turn to concern. He looked down at his thigh and touched his pants.</p><p>\u201cDid you get hit in the leg, too?\u201d I asked, ducking with another onslaught of gunfire.</p><p>\u201cNo...I....\u201d he said, looking back at me. Suddenly his eyes widened and he looked down to my lap, pul ing at the tablecloth twisted around me.</p><p>Final y freeing me from the fabric, he yanked up the skirt of my dress, seeing a bloody mess on my thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Nina, you\u2019re hit.\u201d</p><p>We exchanged fearful expressions just as the next barrage of bul ets ricocheted through the room. My brain registered the pain the moment I saw the wound, and a searing sensation immediately radiated from the bul et hole in al directions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay!\u201d Jared yel ed over the breaking glass, his face tightening.</p><p>The restaurant was being torn apart by bul ets. The wal s and tables were splintered, the floor covered in glass shards. He pul ed the tie from his neck and looped it around my upper thigh, yanking it tight, and then he wadded up the table cloth and pressed it against my leg. The sting intensified as it shot throughout my body, and I cried out in pain.</p><p>Jared\u2019s face tensed and he lifted his hand from the table cloth, both dark red with my blood. He put more pressure on it and I cried out again.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>He kept his hand on my leg as he backed up to the station beside me, and then slowly leaned his head out. He immediately jerked back, narrowly dodging dozens of shots aimed directly at him. Whoever was outside only had to keep us pinned down until I bled to death, and they would succeed in kil ing us both.</p><p>Jared\u2019s eyes searched the room in desperation. He scanned the ceiling and wal s, and attempted to see what was in the back, ducking at another set of bul ets. When more firing resounded, I noticed that those shots sounded different, closer.</p><p>I pul ed his hand from my leg and pressed my hand on the tablecloth, wincing. \u201cGo, Jared. Find a way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you,\u201d he said, desperate.</p><p>I took in a deep breath, trying to focus beyond the pain. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, we\u2019re both going to die.\u201d</p><p>Jared clinched his eyes shut and pressed his lips together, the clash of priorities sending him into anguish. He turned to me, his eyes midnight blue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go straight down the hal to see if there\u2019s another way out, and then I\u2019m coming back, okay? I\u2019m going to get us out of here,\u201d he promised.</p><p>I smiled and nodded, my eyes glossing over. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed each side of my face and kissed me on the lips first, and then on the forehead.</p><p>More bul ets cascaded through the building, and the different pitch of gunfire was just behind us. Jared pul ed me close and I flinched at our impending end.</p><p>Jared laughed and I looked up, seeing Claire ten feet away, her back against a concrete pil ar.</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d come join the party!\u201d Claire cal ed to us, throwing a gun to Jared and then situating herself with her rifle.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby sister!\u201d Jared cried.</p><p>Claire winked at him. \u201cI told you that you\u2019d figure that out one of these days!\u201d She cocked her gun and then looked up, took a deep breath, and then twisted her body, taking several shots before turning back around to escape the return fire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned to Jared, then. \u201cYou\u2019ve got four in the upper floors of the North building, two behind the dumpster, four each on both roofs, and three on the ground, on your ten, twelve and two. I\u2019l stay here with Nina. You go clean house.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled and turned to me. \u201cHang on, honey. I\u2019l be back in a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good day at work,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Claire tossed him a few more clips of ammunition, and then he leaned into me, his lips pressing hard against mine. \u201cPromise me you\u2019l stay awake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promise,\u201d I whispered, and then he disappeared.</p><p>Claire was beside me in the next moment, and she immediately pressed down on the table cloth.</p><p>\u201cAgh!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep pressure on that, dummy, or you\u2019re going to bleed out before we get you to the hospital,\u201d she barked, taking a few shots behind us with her rifle.</p><p>I closed my eyes and shook my head. \u201cBitch,\u201d I said, laughing when Claire did.</p> <p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Nina! You have to stay awake!\u201d she yel ed, patting my cheek.</p><p>I widened my eyes and blinked a few times. \u201cI feel nauseous,\u201d I said, swal owing.</p><p>She looked down at my hand on my thigh, both covered in scarlet. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re losing so much blood. I\u2019ve got to cover Jared, but you stay awake!\u201d</p><p>Claire pul ed a hand gun from the holster on her back and shot several rounds, simultaneously whipping a rifle over her head and stabilized it on top of the remaining wood of our make-shift fort. Staring down her sights, her tiny frame jerked back with each shot as large brass casings flipped out and over, landing al around me.</p><p>\u201cYour SIX, Jared!\u201d Claire screamed as she took more shots with her rifle with one hand, and intermittently straightened her head to use her hand gun with the other.</p><p>The bul ets no longer showered the restaurant as they seemed to be mostly out in the street. Claire repacked her guns on her person and grabbed the back of my dress, pul ing me across the floor. She side-stepped down the hal to the kitchen in a crouched position, and I swal owed back the nausea as I noticed the thick trail of blood along the white tile behind us.</p> <p>She propped me against a cabinet and appraised my condition. \u201cYikes, you\u2019re real y pale,\u201d she said, leaning back quickly to look down the hal and then righting herself to reload her firearm.</p><p>\u201cI feel pale, thanks,\u201d I mumbled, my eyes feeling heavy.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, Jared,\u201d she muttered, wiping my bangs from my eyes. I noticed, then, that I was sweating, my wet hair matting against my brow.</p><p>The gunshots were quieting down outside, with only sporadic shots fired every minute or so. I began to shiver and Claire frowned, concerned with my diminishing state.</p><p>The waitress was curled up in a corner across from us. She looked at me with wide, terrified eyes, noticing my leg.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting quiet,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Jared has taken care of most of the people shooting at us,\u201d Claire said with a contrived smile.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jared? Why isn\u2019t he back, yet?\u201d I struggled for breath.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming. Just hang on, Nina,\u201d she said, distracted as she checked the hal once again.</p><p>I needed a more specific time frame. Worried about how much longer I would have to fight to hang on, the question fel short. I looked around the room and it began to blur and spin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re losing too much blood. We have to move,\u201d Claire said, pul ing me to the doorway. She peered out quickly before leaning back to speak to the waitress, asking her something in Japanese. The woman pointed and nodded, whimpering back an answer.</p><p>Claire smiled at me. \u201cThere\u2019s a back door. We\u2019l pick Jared up on the way...let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be right behind you,\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>With her rifle in one hand, she tossed me over her shoulder with the other. As if I weighed nothing, she carried me down the hal , took a turn, and then stopped for less than a second before issuing a damaging blow with her foot to a heavy steel door.</p><p>I could feel the night air cooling the warm blood on my leg, and I breathed a sigh of relief that we had final y escaped into the al ey. We had almost made it to the street when Claire froze and lowered me to the ground.</p><p>\u201cRookie mistake, Claire Bear,\u201d Grahm said, pointing his gun. His nose was stil taped from where she\u2019d shattered it with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cAwful y brave of you to come alone,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>I had seen Claire\u2019s smug expression before, but this time it was different. She had an edge of fear in her eyes. She knew that I was running out of time.</p><p>Grahm turned to me. \u201cI told you I\u2019d see you soon, Nina. Looks like I\u2019m not even going to have to waste a bul et...you look pretty close to death\u2019s door. Such a waste, too,\u201d he said, clicking his tongue in disapproval. \u201cI was looking forward to spending some time with you.\u201d</p><p>I held myself up with my hands, but my arms were quivering from exhaustion. I struggled to keep my eyes focused, and my lungs were having a hard time feeling satisfied with each shal ow breath. Grahm was right, but I would fight it; I had to keep my heart beating to save Jared.</p><p>\u201cIf she dies, Grahm, I won\u2019t kil you quickly,\u201d Claire said through her teeth, her voice quivering with anger. \u201cYou wil suffer...for days. Maybe even weeks...Hel wil be a sweet relief compared to what I wil do to you.\u201d</p><p>Grahm laughed, pointing his shotgun at me. \u201cI could end her life right now, but I think I like watching you squirm while we watch her die.\u201d</p><p>I coughed, and fel to my elbows, my palms flat on the damp pavement of the al ey. The nausea became more of a promise than a threat, and the sweat dripped from my hairline into my eyes. Grahm planned to hold us at gunpoint until my heart stopped beating, and Jared would soon become sick and die. The rage wel ed up inside me and I gritted my teeth in anger.</p><p>I looked up at the barrel of the gun. \u201cI wish I could watch what she does to you, Grahm, you sorry sack of\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now...\u201d he laughed. \u201cDo you kiss your mother with that mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you even have a mother, Grahm? Or did you just come straight from the bowels of Hel ?\u201d I gasped, feeling my life slipping away.</p><p>Grahm cocked his gun. \u201cYou\u2019re sassy, Nina. I like that. Maybe I wil show a little mercy...not real y my style, but I\u2019l make an exception for Jack\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes tight and waited, but the end never came. When I looked up, Grahm stood with his back arched, his eyes wide and bulging, staring straight ahead. A string of drool fel from his mouth as he fel forward. Jared stood in his place with a bloody fist.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Claire said, lifting my limp body from the ground.</p><p>\u201cI ran out of bul ets,\u201d Jared quipped, taking me from Claire\u2019s arms. We surged forward, taking off so fast I thought he had final y sprouted wings.</p><p>I tried to focus as he lifted me into the backseat of his Escalade, cradling me in his arms. Claire jumped into the driver seat. \u201cRhode Island Hospital is closer, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Jared cried. \u201cGo, Claire, Go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bleed on the seat,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>Jared laughed nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the seat...you just stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold,\u201d I whispered. My body shivered uncontrol ably even against his warm body.</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d Jared warned, holding me tightly against him.</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d she said as the SUV jerked with a sharp turn.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have two minutes,\u201d Jared groaned.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I cal ed into the dark.</p><p>I felt his warm hand on my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I cried. I was so tired, and I was afraid. I didn\u2019t know if I was strong enough to keep us both alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Nina. You stay with me, do you hear me?\u201d I heard his voice break. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you.\u201d</p><p>I felt the Escalade screech to a halt and the door flew open. Jared scrambled from the back, holding me tightly in his arms.</p><p>Jared yel ed for help, and then a large group of people surrounded me.</p><p>\u201cSir, I need you to put her on the gurney,\u201d I heard a woman say.</p><p>I felt Jared\u2019s warm lips on my forehead and his grip tightened.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised me,\u201d Jared choked. \u201cKeep your promise, Nina.\u201d</p><p>Jared lowered me onto a hard mattress and his hand squeezed mine before he let go. \u201cI\u2019l see you soon.\u201d</p><p>I searched for Jared\u2019s face with my unfocused eyes as the doctor\u2019s and nurses\u2019 voices blurred above me.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d I cal ed to him.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave the room, sir. Sir? You\u2019l have to leave!\u201d I heard as I reached out for his hand with the last bit of strength I had left.</p><p>When I rose to the surface again, the early morning sun was peeking through the blinds. I looked over to my right hand that was tangled in Jared\u2019s large, warm fingers. His head rested on the hospital bed beside me, his face stil and peaceful. It was such an extraordinary sight to see him sleeping, so I let him be. I sat completely stil , keeping my breaths even, watching the shadows dance down the wal with the rising sun.</p><p>When the sun lit up the room, Jared stirred. His eyes blinked and he lifted his head, looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I smiled, running my fingers through his tousled hair.</p><p>\u201cYou kept your promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always keep my promises,\u201d I said, arching my back against the bed, wincing with the pain that ensued.</p><p>His face tensed. \u201cYou had me worried there for awhile. We lost you a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y? I feel cheated. I don\u2019t remember a single white light. My life didn\u2019t even flash before my eyes.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together. \u201cLeave it to you to joke about dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? When that happens and they bring me back...that doesn\u2019t hurt you at al , does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he shook his head both in answer and in disapproval at my question.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood as new,\u201d he said, making a show of patting the point where the bul et had entered.</p><p>\u201cYeah...I think my leg is going to take longer than your shoulder to heal.\u201d I looked down, seeing the thick layers of gauze wrapped around it.</p><p>He nodded, but his face was pained.</p><p>I touched his cheek with my fingers. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head, trying to keep the corners of his mouth up. His smile faded to a compressed frown and his eyes glossed over.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d I said, trying to think of something comforting to say. I couldn\u2019t imagine what he had gone through, letting someone else try to save my life.</p><p>He sucked in a breath and held my hand against his cheek. \u201cI thought I lost you...,\u201d he cried, his eyes closed, \u201c...I thought I lost you.\u201d His voice was agonized, and he groaned as he buried his face into my stomach.</p><p>I rested my hand on his head, unsure of what to say. He sucked in another quick breath and wrapped his arms around my hips, pul ing me gently to him.</p><p>He kept his face hidden against me. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do...I begged Gabriel to take me at the same time. I didn\u2019t want to live a single second without you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his face to meet mine, his eyes moist and red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I smiled, sweeping his cheek with the back of my fingers.</p><p>Jared wiped his eyes and sighed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how I wanted to do this, but it wil do.\u201d</p><p>I watched him with confusion as he leaned down to pick something off the floor. He sat up and placed a petite box on my lap.</p><p>It was a takeout box from Blaze on Thayer.</p><p>I giggled. \u201cSweet potato fries?\u201d</p><p>Jared smiled. \u201cSweet potato fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor breakfast?\u201d I asked, lifting the lid. It was empty except for a smal black box. I looked at Jared, and felt my eyebrows shoot up. He lifted the box and held it in front of me.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d Jared whispered, wiping his eyes again.</p><p>I careful y lifted the lid, revealing a golden band. A large diamond sparkled in the center.</p><p>I gasped and looked at Jared.</p><p>\u201cI exist for you. And I live for you. And I live to love you,\u201d he paused. \u201cMarry me, Nina.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at the ring, and a broad smile stretched across my face.</p><p>Jared watched me as I stared at the glittering diamond. \u201cWil you marry me?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, tears overflowing my eyes. I nodded emphatical y and laughed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s smile matched mine, and he took the ring from the box and lifted my hand, pul ing the silver band from Corn Island off, and slipping the delicate gold band onto my finger.</p><p>He stared at it for a moment in awe, and then leaned forward, touching his lips to mine. I wrapped my arms around his neck, crying tears of pure joy.</p><p>Jared smiled, triumphant. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to get through the nightmare to get our miracle. You, Nina....you\u2019re my miracle. It\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>I subdued my laughter while Jared washed the paint from his hair in the kitchen sink. He\u2019d just finished rendering the bul et hole above the stove invisible; it was the last item on his list of things to remove, replace or repair since Shax\u2019s visit just two months before.</p><p>Jared was covered in ivory specks, and I found it amusing that he was so graceful and agile; yet he couldn\u2019t seem to pick up a paint brush without half the bucket inexplicably appearing al over him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, smiling as he scrubbed his hair with a towel.</p><p>\u201cYou look good in Honeysuckle Beige. I think it\u2019s your color,\u201d I giggled.</p><p>Jared tossed the towel onto the counter and walked to the couch where I rested. \u201cHow\u2019s the leg? Need anything for the pain?\u201d he asked, crouching beside me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. How\u2019s the shoulder?\u201d</p><p>Jared grinned at me for a moment and then intertwined his fingers in mine. \u201cDid something happen to my shoulder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that like the tree fal ing in the woods making a sound question?\u201d I asked, watching the large diamond glitter on my finger.</p><p>Jared\u2019s bel owing laughter fil ed the room. \u201cYeah, something like that. Claire wil be here soon with Mom. They\u2019re bringing over some magazines, catalogs, things like that.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled and ran my fingers through his wet hair. \u201cYou keep me fairly entertained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bringing wedding stuff. Lil ian has resorted to harassment to get me to let her come here. I made her wait until you were a little stronger before she ascended the loft with swaths and centerpiece options. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s just given her time to col ect more supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tel them about the island, did you?\u201d I accused.</p><p>Jared squint one eye. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to need back up for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting them come over here thinking we\u2019re planning a big wedding? Jared!\u201d</p> <p>He cringed at my reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s okay! We\u2019l explain it together.\u201d</p><p>I rol ed my eyes and nervously twisted my engagement ring around my finger. \u201cIf I can tel Cynthia I\u2019m getting married before I graduate col ege, you can tel your mom we\u2019re going simple.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked down and smiled. \u201cYou used to do that with Jack\u2019s ring. It\u2019s funny to think this time last year I would smile when I\u2019d see you fidgeting with the Peridot. Now you\u2019re twisting your engagement ring around when you\u2019re nervous. It\u2019s very....surreal,\u201d he mused.</p><p>\u201cTel me about it,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>Jared nodded once. \u201cCranky when planning weddings...check.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together, trying not to smile.</p> <p>Jared pul ed my hand to his lips and kissed my fingers tenderly. \u201cIt wil be fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The sheer white curtains swayed lazily back and forth with the summer breeze. The wal s of the loft were now in beiges and whites, and when the sun filtered through the windows, everything seemed to glow. Light seemed to engulf Jared, and I smiled at the halo it created around him. His eyes were a soft blue-grey, cloud free since he\u2019d brought me home from the hospital.</p><p>Seconds later there was a knock at the door. Claire, Lil ian and Bex walked through, arms ful of sacks and thick catalogs.</p><p>Jared smiled at the sight of his family, and then laughed when he turned to see my overwhelmed expression.</p><p>\u201cBe brave, sweetheart. Show no fear,\u201d he whispered into my ear before affectionately greeting his mother.</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d Lil ian gushed. \u201cYou look so much better, honey. You had us so worried!\u201d</p><p>Claire set white sacks on top of a hot pink duffle bag while Lil ian straightened a stack of bridal magazines on the coffee table.</p><p>Lil ian smiled as she looked around the room. \u201cOh...Oh! I just love what you\u2019ve done in here! It\u2019s so light and peaceful! I\u2019ve been tel ing Jared for years to brighten this place up and you manage to talk him into it within weeks!\u201d She winked. \u201cThat a girl, Nina.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe practical y forced me to choose a new color palette and shop for new d\u00e9cor. He was sure I didn\u2019t like it before.\u201d I smiled warmly at Jared who watched me with a soft expression.</p><p>\u201cNew color palette and d\u00e9cor?\u201d Bex snorted.</p><p>Jared lunged at him and wrestled him to the floor, putting him in a headlock and rubbing his knuckles against Bex\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l understand one of these days, punk,\u201d Jared said, laughing.</p><p>Laughter fil ed the loft as we watched them wrestle on the floor. Bex made an impressive effort, but he was unsuccessful in escaping Jared\u2019s grip.</p><p>Jared final y stood up, bringing Bex with him by the col ar. Jared hooked Bex\u2019s neck with the crook of his arm and squeezed, and Bex threw his arm up and over his big brother\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen this one, Nina?\u201d Lil ian asked, grabbing a magazine from the top of the stack. She licked her thumb and flipped to an earmarked page.</p><p>The picture was of a woman standing on a beach, the bright blue sky and azure waters behind her, looking quite bored and desperately in need of a meal. She wore a bright white v-neck dress, clinging to the edges of her shoulders. The bodice was gathered from shoulder to the silver beaded empire waist. The chiffon and silk dropped straight down into a flowing a-line skirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I said, sighing over its beauty.</p><p>Jared peered over from the end of the couch and Claire covered his eyes with her hand. \u201cYou can\u2019t look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , you\u2019re going to be easy to shop for!\u201d Lil ian giggled. \u201cDoes your mother have any favorites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCynthia doesn\u2019t...do weddings,\u201d I said with a smirk.</p><p>Jared pul ed his sister\u2019s hand from his eyes and smiled at me. \u201cYou like that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , I\u2019d have to try it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my, you wil look so beautiful in that dress, Nina.\u201d Lil ian said as she hugged me to her, kissing the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cDoes it go with a smal white chapel on a tiny island off Nicaragua?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>I looked up at him, trying to keep the corners of my mouth from turning up. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lil ian asked, looking at Jared with a confused half-smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen we went to Little Corn during Spring Break, we found a little chapel on the island. That\u2019s where the ceremony\u2014the very smal ceremony\u2014wil be. It only seats about fifty...possibly less.\u201d</p><p>Lil ian looked at me with surprise.</p><p>Claire gasped and then laughed, her mouth formed into an \u2018O\u2019. \u201cYou are so dead, Jared!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Nicaraguan island?\u201d Lil ian said softly. \u201cOkay...we\u2019l make it work,\u201d she said with a sweet smile.</p><p>\u201cYou have to take a boat to get there, Mom,\u201d Jared added.</p><p>Lil ian looked at Jared and then at me, trying to find words. \u201cWedding guests taking a plane to Nicaragua, and then a boat to a tiny island with huts for accommodations,\u201d she thought aloud.</p><p>I shut the magazine as Jared walked over to his mother, patting her shoulder. \u201cIt gives us a good excuse to keep the guest list to a minimum.\u201d</p><p>Lil ian\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cThere\u2019s always the reception,\u201d she chirped, thumbing through another magazine.</p><p>Jared laughed at his mother\u2019s unfailing optimism.</p><p>Lil ian hugged me again and stood up, hooking her arm around the shoulders of her youngest son. \u201cBex has an early training session in the morning. Let me know if you need anything, Nina. I love you both,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>Claire shook her head at her mother with amused affection and then looked at me. \u201cShe lives for this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get away with anything like this, young lady,\u201d Lil ian cal ed to Claire. \u201cPlan on a ridiculously lavish church wedding, now.\u201d</p><p>Claire waved to her mother, and I could see her expression turn to unease as I looked down to flip through more pages of the magazine.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Claire?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cWe left a few loose ends at the restaurant. Those men are loyal to Grahm, Jared.\u201d</p><p>After several moments of silence, I looked up. Jared\u2019s expression was impatient. \u201cThis could have waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d Claire said in a concerned tone. \u201cBex wil be watching Ryan for me. I won\u2019t let them come after Nina again.\u201d She looked at me with a maternal softness.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d I asked, feeling a twinge in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find every person involved, every enemy of Jack\u2019s, every cop that is wil ing to avenge Grahm\u2019s death...and I\u2019m going to eliminate the threat.\u201d She looked at Jared. \u201cIt\u2019s what Dad would have done.\u201d</p><p>Jared looked at his baby sister with an appreciative smile. \u201cAnd when do you plan on doing this?\u201d</p><p>Claire walked over to the table and unzipped the hot pink duffle bag. Within seconds, she molded a rifle from several pieces and then clicked on the scope, swinging the thick black strap over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you coming back?\u201d I asked, leaning forward in reaction to her apparent departure.</p><p>\u201cWhen the job\u2019s done,\u201d she smiled, loading her holsters. She lifted her foot to the table and twirled a large knife around her finger, shoving it into a case in her thick, black boot.</p><p>Jared rested his hands gently on her shoulders, kissing her forehead. \u201cWatch your six,\u201d he said, joining me on the couch.</p><p>\u201cClaire....\u201d I said, feeling my eyes gloss over.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I never miss.\u201d Her eyes became unfocused and her expression turned menacing. \u201cThey ended their lives when they aimed at my sister.\u201d</p><p>She pul ed her sunglasses over her eyes, and her straight, platinum bangs fel over the top of the rims. Walking to the door, she gripped the strap of her rifle with one hand, and twisted the knob with the other.</p><p>\u201cGotta go to work,\u201d Claire smiled wickedly, and then shut the door. </p> </body></html>"]
