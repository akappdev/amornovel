She sat in the attorney\u2019s office with Maryellen, her oldest daughter, who\u2019d come with her to offer support. Grace reminded herself that this should be straightforward, that her decision was made. She was ready to end her marriage, ready to piece together her shattered life. To begin again...But her hand shook as she picked up the pen.</p><p>The inescapable fact was that she didn\u2019t want this\u2014but Dan hadn\u2019t left her with any other option.</p><p>Five months ago, in April, her husband of almost thirty-six years had disappeared. Vanished without a trace. One day everything was perfectly normal, and the next he was gone. Apparently by choice and without a word of explanation. Even now, Grace had difficulty believing that the man she\u2019d lived with, the man she\u2019d loved and with whom she\u2019d had two daughters, could do anything as cruel as this.</p> <p>If Dan had fallen out of love with her, she could accept that. She would\u2019ve found enough pride, enough generosity, to release him without bitterness. If he was that miserable in their marriage, she would\u2019ve gladly set him free to find happiness with someone else. What she couldn\u2019t forgive was the misery he\u2019d heaped on their family\u2019s shoulders, what he\u2019d done to their daughters. Especially Kelly.</p><p>Dan had disappeared shortly after Kelly and Paul had announced that after years of trying, they were finally, excitedly, pregnant. Dan had been thrilled, and Grace too. This baby was going to be their first grandchild. They\u2019d waited so long.</p><p>Kelly had always been close to her father and his disappearance at this critical time in her life had devastated her. She\u2019d pleaded with Grace to postpone the divorce proceedings, convinced that her father would return before Tyler was born. When Dan did return, he\u2019d have a logical reason and would explain everything to their satisfaction.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t come back, though, and there\u2019d been no further information. Nothing but doubts, questions and a churning, deepening anger that intensified in the endless weeks that followed.</p><p>When Grace couldn\u2019t stand not knowing any longer, she\u2019d hired Roy McAfee, a private detective and former policeman she trusted. Roy had done an extensive search, certain that Dan had left a paper trail, and he\u2019d been right. What Roy had uncovered was a complete shock to Grace. A year earlier, Dan had purchased a travel trailer, paying cash for it. Grace had no idea where he\u2019d gotten that kind of money, nor did she know anything about the trailer. He\u2019d never mentioned it, nor had she seen it. To this day she had no idea where he\u2019d kept it all those months. Or where it was now.</p> <p>Given the mounting evidence, she had her suspicions. Grace believed that Dan had used the travel trailer to sneak away with another woman. There\u2019d been one sighting of him and it had come late in May. It almost felt as if her husband had orchestrated this brief reappearance, as if he was taunting her, challenging her to find him. That day had been a low point for Grace.</p><p>A co-worker of Dan\u2019s had spotted him at the marina and hurried to the library to fetch her. But by the time Grace reached the marina, Dan was gone. A woman had pulled up to the curb and Dan had climbed into the vehicle and driven away, never to be seen or heard from again.</p><p>In retrospect, she\u2019d come to believe that Dan was providing her with the answers she so desperately needed. She could think of no other reason he would mysteriously arrive at the busiest place in town, where he was most likely to be seen\u2014and recognized. The library where she worked was less than two blocks away. Clearly, her husband lacked the courage to tell her there was someone else. Instead he\u2019d chosen another, crueler way to inform her; he\u2019d humiliated her in front of the entire community. Grace knew without being told that everyone in Cedar Cove pitied her.</p><p>That sighting had settled the matter in Grace\u2019s mind. Whatever love she still felt for Dan died that afternoon. Until then, she hadn\u2019t wanted to believe there was someone else. Even when the VISA bill showed up with a hefty charge from a local jeweler, Grace had refused to accept that her husband was involved with another woman. Dan just wasn\u2019t the kind of man who would be unfaithful to her. She\u2019d trusted him. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Mom?\u201d Maryellen asked, touching her arm.</p><p>Grace\u2019s hand tightened around the pen. \u201cFine,\u201d she snapped, instantly regretting her tone. She hadn\u2019t meant to sound so sharp.</p> <p>Her daughter looked away. Grace focused on the divorce papers, hesitated a moment longer and then with haste signed her name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that this is filed immediately,\u201d Mark Spellman said.</p><p>Grace relaxed, leaning back in her chair. This was all there was to it? You could end a thirty-five-year marriage simply by signing your name? \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Since you haven\u2019t heard from Daniel in five months, I don\u2019t foresee any legal complications. The divorce should be final in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Almost four decades tossed out the window like so much garbage. The good years, the bad years, the lean ones, the years they\u2019d scrimped and saved. Like all couples, they\u2019d had their share of problems, but despite everything they\u2019d held their marriage together. Until now, until this\u2014</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Maryellen whispered.</p><p>Grace nodded abruptly, surprised at the emotion that choked her. She\u2019d shed all the tears she intended to. In the months since Dan\u2019s disappearance, Grace had deeply grieved the loss of her marriage and the man she thought she knew. The truth of it was, she no longer had a choice; divorce had become inevitable. It was essential that she protect her financial interests. According to the attorney, she couldn\u2019t afford the luxury of doing nothing.</p><p>Her legal situation was one thing, and she\u2019d dealt with that, but the emotional impact had left her badly shaken. Despite her resolve, the grief hadn\u2019t diminished. And the humiliation of what Dan had done was with her constantly. Everyone in town was aware of her circumstances and the fact that her husband had walked out on her.</p> <p>Slowly, Grace set the pen aside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait to hear from you, then,\u201d she said to her attorney, rising out of the chair. Maryellen stood with her.</p><p>The attorney, a young man closer to Maryellen\u2019s age than her own, escorted them to the office door. He began to say something, then merely looked down and murmured a brief goodbye.</p><p>Outside his small home office, the sky had turned a depressing leaden gray. Grace felt a burden of sadness settle over her; she\u2019d known this appointment wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but she hadn\u2019t expected it to exact such a toll on her self-confidence.</p><p>Maryellen glanced at her watch. \u201cI need to get back to the gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Grace said. Her daughter had offered to go to this appointment with her for moral support. Although she was grateful, Grace had thought it unnecessary. But Maryellen was right.</p><p>Her daughter was divorced, too. Maryellen had married young and unwisely, and the marriage had ended in less than a year. The experience had so biased her against men, she\u2019d steered away from relationships ever since. Grace had tried to assure her that she\u2019d meet a wonderful man someday, a man waiting for someone exactly like her. Maryellen had considered that naive and refused to listen and now Grace understood why. Divorce hurt, and it was the kind of vicious pain that reached deep inside a person. Grace felt off-balance and guilty, as though she had somehow failed. As though it was all her fault. Maryellen knew what it was like because she\u2019d experienced these emotions herself when she was much younger and without the wisdom or perspective maturity brings.</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right?\u201d Maryellen asked, obviously reluctant to leave.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Grace said, forcing a smile. She ought to be feeling a measure of relief, after all. She\u2019d finally taken action. She\u2019d given Dan every opportunity, even issued a series of mental ultimatums and deadlines. He would come back when Kelly\u2019s baby was born. By the Fourth of July. By their wedding anniversary. First one, then another, until she faced the truth. He wasn\u2019t coming back. If she hadn\u2019t heard anything from him by now, she shouldn\u2019t expect that she ever would. Dan had no intention of being found.</p><p>\u201cAre you going back to work?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, refusing to allow herself to succumb to self-pity. \u201cI\u2019m going to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch? It\u2019s after four. You didn\u2019t eat earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Grace didn\u2019t add that her appetite had been nonexistent for days as the appointment with the attorney grew closer. Then, because she knew her daughter was worried, she added emphatically, \u201cI am going to be all right, Maryellen.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen gazed down the steep hill toward the waterfront, where boats gently bobbed in the protected waters of the cove. Vehicles cruised down Harbor Street</p><p>, so close together they looked like one continuous line. The Bremerton shipyard workers were out, and traffic filled the roads as husbands and fathers hurried home to their families. The same way Dan once had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so furious with Dad I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I ever saw him again,\u201d Maryellen said between gritted teeth.</p><p>Grace knew, though. She was convinced that Maryellen would be grateful, that she wouldn\u2019t care what he\u2019d done as long as he came home. And Kelly, their youngest, would shout with joy and tell them all how wrong they\u2019d been. She\u2019d run to her father with open arms, eagerly awaiting the excuse that would explain everything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Grace insisted. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Still Maryellen hesitated. \u201cI hate to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get over this.\u201d Although that was hardly the way she felt. But if Grace had learned anything in life, it was the importance of balance. For each loss, there were compensations, and she reminded herself to keep the good things firmly in sight. \u201cI have so much to be grateful for. You and Kelly, and now a grandson. I\u2019m so sorry it had to end this way with your father and me, but I\u2019m going to come back stronger than ever.\u201d Even as she said the words, Grace knew they were true. The sense of loss was profound, but balance would return to her life and so would joy.</p><p>It was Justine Gunderson\u2019s lunch break, and all she wanted to do was run home and check the mail. She hadn\u2019t heard from Seth in nearly a week. All right, five days, but each one of those days felt like a year. Her husband of little more than a month was in Alaska, fishing the crab-rich waters of the Bering Sea. Seth had warned her when she drove him to the airport that he\u2019d be working sixteen-hour days. He\u2019d assured her that he was crazy in love with her and would be back before she had time to miss him.</p><p>Seth had been wrong. Justine was miserable. They\u2019d married, as the old western hit said, \u201cin a fever,\u201d unable to delay the wedding even one minute once they\u2019d made the decision. Without telling either set of parents, they\u2019d raced to Reno, gotten the license, found a preacher and afterward headed straight for a hotel room.</p><p>They were young and healthy and very much in love. Justine had known Seth nearly her entire life. He\u2019d been her twin brother\u2019s best friend\u2014until Jordan drowned at age thirteen. Justine and Seth had been in the same high school graduating class. In the ten years that followed, he\u2019d lived in Cedar Cove but they hadn\u2019t been in contact until recently, when they\u2019d both reluctantly joined the committee planning their class reunion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the time, Justine had been dating Warren Saget, a local developer. Warren was quite a few years older than Justine; in fact, he was just a little younger than her own father. Warren liked having a beautiful woman on his arm and Justine suited him perfectly. It helped that she was willing to keep his little secret\u2014while he might be successful in the boardroom, his powers didn\u2019t extend to the bedroom. When they were together, she often spent the night at his plush hillside house overlooking the cove, but that was more for show than anything. She had her own bedroom in Warren\u2019s home. Justine knew very well what people thought, but she\u2019d never much cared.</p><p>However, her mother did. Olivia Lockhart shared the general assumptions about her arrangement with Warren and had plenty of opinions on the matter. Justine didn\u2019t enlighten her, because it was none of Olivia\u2019s business. This disagreement between them had put a strain on the mother-daughter relationship. Her grandmother hadn\u2019t been particularly pleased, either, but Charlotte wasn\u2019t nearly as open in her disapproval. No doubt hoping to distract her from Warren, her mother had encouraged Justine to date Seth\u2014although even Olivia had been shocked when Justine phoned to tell her she\u2019d impulsively married him.</p><p>The marriage was practically as big a surprise to Justine as it was to her family. After a spat having to do with Warren, Seth had walked away from her. Justine couldn\u2019t let it end like that, not with Seth, and she\u2019d gone to him, hoping to make amends. To say they\u2019d settled their differences was something of an understatement.</p><p>After the wedding, they\u2019d only had that one weekend before Seth had to return to Alaska. In the weeks since, she\u2019d heard from him intermittently, but he couldn\u2019t call\u2014or receive calls\u2014while he was at sea, so their communications were few and far between.</p> <p>Justine glanced at the time and tried to decide whether she should drive home and check the mail or not. If there was no letter, she\u2019d feel depressed for the rest of the afternoon. On the other hand, if Seth did happen to send her a message, she\u2019d be walking on clouds for days afterward. She needed a letter, a phone call, anything that would remind her she\u2019d made the right choice in marrying him. Getting married was the only impulsive thing she\u2019d ever done in all her twenty-eight years. She liked her life orderly and precise. The need for control had always ruled her choices\u2014until she fell in love with Seth.</p><p>This commitment to order was one reason she fit in so well at First National Bank, rising quickly to the position of manager. Numbers made sense; they added up neatly; they were unambiguous. To the best of her ability, that was the way Justine lived her life\u2014with strong convictions and with exactness, leaving little room for frivolity and impulse.</p><p>Out of habit, she looked up when the bank\u2019s double glass doors swung open and watched as Warren Saget walked in, bold as could be. He moved directly toward her desk, his manner confident. Justine hadn\u2019t seen him since her impromptu wedding. Unfortunately they hadn\u2019t parted on the best of terms. Warren had been angry when he learned she\u2019d married Seth and had made some ugly, spiteful remarks. Frankly Justine wasn\u2019t up for a second confrontation.</p><p>She rose from her chair. At five-ten, plus her heels, she was as tall as Warren. She wore her straight brown hair long and parted in the middle, just as she had in high school, which emphasized her height. By standing, she sent a nonverbal message that she wasn\u2019t about to let him intimidate her\u2014and that she intended to keep this meeting short. She absolutely would not allow him to create a scene in front of her staff and customers. Zach Cox, a local accountant, nodded in her direction as he left the bank. Justine acknowledged him and returned her attention to Warren. \u201cHello, Warren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine.\u201d He met her eyes and the expression she read on his face told her that her fears were unfounded.</p> <p>\u201cI came to apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cI owe you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d She crossed her arms and shifted her weight from her left foot to her right, conveying impatience.</p><p>\u201cCan I take you to lunch?\u201d he asked, then rushed to add, \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do. I said some things I shouldn\u2019t have, and I\u2019ve regretted it ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think being seen together is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Warren\u2019s pale brown eyes revealed his disappointment. \u201cI can understand that,\u201d he said, graciously accepting her refusal. To her astonishment, he sat down in the chair across from her desk.</p><p>Unsure what to expect next, Justine sank into her own seat.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Seth?\u201d he asked. \u201cStill in Alaska?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe won\u2019t be home for a few more weeks.\u201d Twenty-eight days to be precise, if everything went according to schedule. She crossed off the days on her calendar every night as she slipped into her bed, alone and lonely. They hadn\u2019t discussed the future; there hadn\u2019t been time. One thing was certain\u2014Justine hated the thought of her husband leaving her for several months each year. Already she dreaded next year\u2019s fishing season, which would start in May.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good,\u201d Warren said with a glint of admiration.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, unsmiling.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI know you don\u2019t believe me, but all I want is for you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>Warren had been married and divorced twice and had asked her to be his wife on several occasions. Justine had always refused. She\u2019d never had any interest in marrying Warren.</p><p>Aware of her growing attraction to Seth, Warren had purchased a startlingly large diamond ring in the hope of changing her mind. Justine hated to admit that the size of that diamond had briefly weakened her resolve. She knew Warren would have loved slipping the ring on her finger and claiming her as his exclusive property. But the man who\u2019d pampered her was hurt and regretful now. He was asking her to forgive his angry reaction to her marriage.</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps we could go for lunch,\u201d Justine said and knew she\u2019d made the right decision when Warren\u2019s face instantly brightened. She laughed at the way he bounded out of his chair, not bothering to disguise his eagerness. Seth wouldn\u2019t mind her seeing Warren on a social basis now and then; Justine was sure of that. He respected her independence and her good sense, and he realized she\u2019d never abuse his trust.</p> <p>\u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d he asked. \u201cAny place you want, you name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD.D.\u2019s on the Cove,\u201d she suggested, choosing his favorite restaurant.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d He smiled approvingly.</p><p>Justine reached for her purse and followed him toward the front door, which Warren held open for her. \u201cShall we walk?\u201d she asked. D.D.\u2019s was only a couple of blocks away, but Warren usually preferred to drive.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. He was making a real effort to be accommodating. He stopped himself from taking her hand, she noticed, and was grateful. She\u2019d actually missed Warren. Yes, he had his faults, but he could be a good conversationalist and had a sharp mind. There was a history between them, too, a history that had more to do with friendship than romance. In his own way he loved her and she cared for him, too, although not with the same intensity she did Seth. With her husband, the attraction was physical and powerful, but in the few days they\u2019d spent together before he left for Alaska there hadn\u2019t been time for much conversation. Their intense hunger for each other had overwhelmed them both. Justine didn\u2019t need words to know how Seth felt. His lovemaking proved it again and again.</p><p>That weekend seemed like a dream now, and she wondered if what they\u2019d discovered could possibly be real.</p><p>At the restaurant, Warren and Justine were seated outside. The patio wouldn\u2019t be open much longer. Already autumn was in the air, but Warren chose to dine alfresco instead of at a table inside, knowing she enjoyed the sunshine.</p><p>\u201cI hope we can still be friends,\u201d Warren said, smiling as the waitress handed them menus.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice.\u201d She told herself again that lunch every now and then wouldn\u2019t bother her husband. Seth wasn\u2019t the jealous type and for that matter, neither was she.</p><p>Justine and Warren had a common interest in the financial world, so there was plenty to discuss. Their conversation over lunch went smoothly and the ache in Justine\u2019s heart had lessened by the time they finished. She still missed Seth dreadfully, but didn\u2019t feel nearly as alone and lost as she had earlier in the day. Warren hadn\u2019t asked to see her again, hadn\u2019t pressured her at all. After lunch they said farewell outside the bank, she thanked him for the meal and he left.</p><p>Later that afternoon, as she drove toward her apartment, Justine\u2019s spirits were high, higher than they\u2019d been all week. But when she approached the row of mailboxes outside her building complex, she hesitated, afraid to find out if there was a letter from Seth.</p><p>She needed to be reassured of his love because her greatest fear was that he regretted their sudden marriage. Her heart pounded as she unlocked the box and slid out the mail.</p><p>No letter.</p><p>She sorted through the advertisements, junk mail and two bills a second time, just to be sure. Another Friday night alone in front of the television, she thought. She could phone her mother, but Olivia had been dating Jack Griffin from The Cedar Cove Chronicle and was probably busy anyway. Feeling defeated, Justine walked into her apartment and tossed her mail on the kitchen counter, kicking off her heels.</p><p>A few weeks ago, she would\u2019ve relished a Friday night to herself. Warren almost always had plans for them. But all of that was irrelevant now, and feeling sorry for herself didn\u2019t serve any useful purpose. If she missed Seth, then she should do something that would make her feel close to him.</p><p>His sailboat came immediately to mind. The Silver Belle was moored at the marina and Seth had given her the key. When he wasn\u2019t fishing in Alaska he lived aboard the vessel. Or at least he had until their marriage. They hadn\u2019t even talked about where they\u2019d live when he got back.... That could wait, but right now, she needed the comfort of being in his home, among his things. If she spent the night there, she could wrap herself in his blanket, sleep in his clothes, breathe in his scent. She\u2019d slept there several times and always felt better.</p><p>Pleased with the idea, Justine changed out of her business suit and into jeans and a sweatshirt. She collected a novel, a new CD for her Walkman and fresh clothes for the morning. She\u2019d pick up dinner on the way to the marina.</p><p>She\u2019d just reached the parking lot when she realized she\u2019d left her cell phone behind. If Seth phoned, he\u2019d call that number. Heading back to the apartment, she unlocked the door and opened it to hear the muted peal of her phone. She lurched for it, pushing the talk button with a sense of urgency.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello!\u201d she shouted. \u201cSeth? Seth, is that you?\u201d</p><p>Only a dial tone greeted her question. Quickly she checked Caller ID\u2014the number was unfamiliar, although prefaced by 907, the Alaska area code. She punched it in, letting the phone ring ten times before finally giving up.</p><p>Grinding her teeth with frustration, Justine sagged onto the edge of the sofa and rammed her fingers through her hair. It was Seth; it had to be. He must\u2019ve called her from a pay phone on the wharf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One minute away from her phone and she\u2019d missed talking to her husband.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d Zach Cox let himself in the back door off the garage and stepped into the kitchen. His jaw tightened at the mess that greeted him. The sink was piled high with breakfast dishes, and the milk from this morning\u2019s cereal was still on the countertop.</p><p>\u201cWho left out the milk?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>His two children\u2014conveniently\u2014didn\u2019t hear him. Fifteen-year-old Allison was sitting at the computer in their home office, cruising the Internet, and Eddie, who was nine, lay prone on the family-room carpet in front of some mindless television program.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d he asked next, standing directly over his son.</p><p>Eddie lifted one arm and pointed wordlessly toward the sewing room.</p><p>Zach ambled in that direction on his way to the bathroom. \u201cHi, Rosie, I\u2019m home,\u201d he told his wife of seventeen years. \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, honey,\u201d Rosie said, glancing up from the sewing machine. \u201cWhat time is it, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d he muttered. He couldn\u2019t remember when he\u2019d last come home and found dinner in the oven. \u201cThe milk was left out again,\u201d he said, thinking it would need to be dumped after sitting for ten hours at room temperature.</p> <p>\u201cEddie fixed himself a bowl of cereal after school.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he figured, the milk might be salvageable.</p><p>She lined up the shiny black material and ran it rapidly through the machine, pulling out pins as she went.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sewing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA Halloween costume,\u201d she mumbled with four or five pins clenched between her lips. \u201cBy the way\u2014\u201d she paused and removed the pins \u201c\u2014Eddie\u2019s school is having an open house tonight. Can you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen house?\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou can\u2019t be there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cI have choir practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He\u2019d had a long, trying day at the office and had hoped to relax that evening. Instead, he was going to have to attend this event at his son\u2019s school. \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>His wife shrugged. \u201cCall for a pizza, okay?\u201d</p><p>It was the third time in the last two weeks that they\u2019d had pizza for dinner. \u201cI\u2019m sick of pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that new Chinese place deliver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He should know; he\u2019d had Chinese just that afternoon. Janice Lamond, a recently hired employee, had picked up an order of sweet-and-sour shrimp for him. \u201cBesides, that\u2019s what I had for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d Rosie asked, busying herself with the cape that was part of the Harry Potter costume Eddie had requested.</p><p>\u201cMeat loaf, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob and a fresh salad.\u201d</p> <p>Rosie frowned. \u201cI think there\u2019s a meat loaf entr\u00e9e in the freezer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomemade meat loaf,\u201d Zach amended.</p><p>\u201cSorry, not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he asked, cranky now. It wasn\u2019t too much to ask that his wife have dinner ready when he came home from work\u2014was it? As an accountant, Zach made enough money to ensure that Rosie could stay home with the kids. This arrangement was what they\u2019d both wanted when they started their family.</p><p>At one time, Zach had assumed that when Allison and Eddie were in school, Rosie would come and work in the office with him. The firm of Smith, Cox and Jefferson often required additional staff. Rosie had always intended to get a job outside the home, but it just never seemed to happen. The school needed volunteers. Then there was Brownies when Allison was eight or nine, and now Cub Scouts for Eddie. And sports, after-school clubs, dance lessons...It soon became obvious that the demands on Rosie\u2019s time wouldn\u2019t be alleviated as the kids grew older. Because they both believed their children\u2019s needs should come first, they\u2019d decided Rosie shouldn\u2019t re-enter the work force.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Zach told his wife, \u201cand I\u2019m hungry. Is it unreasonable to expect dinner with my family?\u201d</p><p>Rosie took a deep breath, as though she was struggling to hold on to her patience. \u201cEddie\u2019s got open house at school tonight, Allison\u2019s coming with me to practice with the junior choir and I\u2019ve got to finish this Halloween costume before Friday. Eddie needs it for his soccer team\u2019s party. I can only do so much.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the annoyance in his wife\u2019s voice and resisted asking her what she\u2019d been doing all day while he was at work.</p><p>Rosie glared at him. \u201cIf you want me to stop everything right now and fix you dinner I will, but I have to tell you, I think you are being unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>He considered her words, and then feeling defeated and a bit guilty said, \u201cFine. I\u2019ll order pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure and tell them no green peppers,\u201d she said, refocusing her attention on the costume.</p><p>\u201cI like green peppers,\u201d he muttered, not realizing Rosie could hear him.</p><p>\u201cEddie and Allison hate them\u2014they prefer black olives. You know that. Now stop being difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll order sausage with olives on one half and green peppers on the other.\u201d</p><p>His wife rolled her eyes expressively. \u201cI\u2019m not all that fond of green peppers myself, you know.\u201d</p><p>So, in addition to being unreasonable, he was selfish. Well, at least he was batting a thousand. \u201cSausage and black olives, then,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He walked over to the kitchen phone, having memorized the number for Pizza Pete\u2019s. He placed the order and made his way to the master bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going now?\u201d Rosie asked as he passed the sewing room.</p><p>\u201cTo shower and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She pushed away from the sewing machine and stood up. \u201cI thought you might wear your suit to the open house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He\u2019d been waiting all afternoon to remove his tie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll make a better impression if you meet Eddie\u2019s teacher wearing a suit. Mrs. Vetter will know you\u2019re a professional.\u201d She coaxed him with a smile, then brushed a piece of lint off his shoulder and smoothed away a wrinkle. \u201cYou look so handsome in your suit,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cMaybe you should shave, though.\u201d</p><p>Zach ran his hand down his face, feeling the bristle scratch against his palm. She was right. \u201cIf I shower and shave, then I\u2019m changing out of this suit.\u201d</p><p>Rosie\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you have to be so difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had a decent dinner every once in a while, maybe I\u2019d be more inclined to do as you ask,\u201d he snapped. He couldn\u2019t help remembering how pleasant lunch with Janice had been. She\u2019d joined the staff the first of the month and had already proved herself as far as Zach was concerned. She was a quick learner, competent, cooperative. Twice she\u2019d gone out of her way to make sure he had what he wanted for lunch. Only that afternoon she\u2019d insisted on driving over to Mr. Wok\u2019s for the shrimp dish.</p><p>Sitting on the end of the king-size bed, Zach yanked off his jacket and laid it beside him. Unfastening the buttons at his wrist, he rolled up his shirtsleeves and headed into the bathroom.</p><p>He was running hot water for a shave when Rosie came into the room. \u201cDo you have enough cash for the pizza guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he said. \u201cCheck my wallet.\u201d</p><p>His wife met his gaze in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was crazy today,\u201d Rosie said, sitting on the edge of the Jacuzzi tub. They\u2019d special-ordered it when the house was built three years earlier and it\u2019d taken months to arrive. Rosie had wanted it badly enough to give up using tile on the hallway and kitchen floors. Zach would have opted for the tile floors but he hadn\u2019t been able to refuse his wife this small luxury. Yet he couldn\u2019t remember the last time Rosie had actually used the tub. Like him, she was in and out of the shower, rushing from one obligation to the next.</p><p>She went on to tell him about her day, the committee meetings, Allison\u2019s dental appointment and some library function she\u2019d agreed to coordinate. \u201cI don\u2019t know how mothers who work outside the home get everything done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d Zach said, although he suspected that his associates\u2019 wives put dinner on the table at night and still managed to work forty hours a week. He also suspected those other wives were better organized than Rosie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cook dinner tomorrow night,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Zach spread shaving cream across his face. \u201cMeat loaf and mashed potatoes?\u201d He didn\u2019t hold out much hope, but it sounded good to hear the promise.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, big boy.\u201d</p><p>Despite his irritation, he grinned. Maybe he was just being difficult.</p><p>Two</p><p>The credit card must belong to the woman who\u2019d sat across the restaurant from him last Monday, Cliff Harding decided. He\u2019d noticed her. It wasn\u2019t like he could have missed her; they were the only two people in the PancakePalace that afternoon. The lunch crowd had left and it was too early for dinner.</p><p>She was attractive and about his age, but she seemed distracted, caught up in her own thoughts. He\u2019d be surprised if she even remembered he was there. They\u2019d paid for their meals at about the same time and that was when it must have happened. His bill was correct, but it was Grace Sherman\u2019s credit card he\u2019d slipped back inside his wallet. She apparently had his.</p><p>All week he\u2019d gone about his business, oblivious to the fact that he was carrying someone else\u2019s VISA card. If an attentive clerk at the pharmacy hadn\u2019t pointed it out, he might not have noticed for that much longer.</p><p>As soon as he was home, he\u2019d looked up Grace Sherman in the phone book with no luck. However he did find a listing for a D &amp; G Sherman at 204 Rosewood Lane</p><p>, Cedar Cove. The voice on the answering machine was that of a woman, so he left a message and waited for her to return his call. Thus far, no one had phoned and he suspected he had the wrong Sherman. What he should probably do was give the credit card to the manager at the PancakePalace and request a replacement for his own.</p><p>Lately Cliff had found plenty of reasons to drive into Cedar Cove. Charlotte Jefferson had called him in June regarding the grandfather he\u2019d never known. Cliff certainly didn\u2019t have any warm feelings toward Tom Harding, even if he was the famous Yodeling Cowboy, popular from the late thirties to the mid-fifties. Tom Harding had deserted Cliff\u2019s father and grandmother in his quest for fame. Toward the end of his life, Tom must have regretted the pain he\u2019d caused his family but by then it was much too late. Cliff was his only grandson and\u2014at least according to Charlotte Jefferson\u2014the old man had intended to contact him.</p><p>Charlotte had to be in her seventies, but she was a woman with plenty of spunk. She\u2019d befriended his grandfather while doing volunteer work at the CedarCoveConvalescentCenter and had taken a liking to the old man. They were friends, Charlotte explained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Old Tom had lost his ability to speak after a massive stroke, but apparently Charlotte was able to communicate with him just fine. She told Cliff that Tom had given her a key shortly before he died. Upon investigation, she\u2019d found his personal effects in a storage unit and concluded that Tom was the onetime movie and television cowboy star. As Tom\u2019s only surviving relative, Cliff was entitled to these mementos.</p><p>In the beginning, Cliff wanted nothing to do with the old man, but Charlotte wouldn\u2019t hear of it. She\u2019d made it her mission to make sure Tom\u2019s things, which included posters, scripts and his six-shooter\u2014were delivered to Cliff, whether he wanted them or not.</p><p>Once he met Charlotte, Cliff understood why his grandfather had felt so comfortable with the older woman, and over the course of the summer, they\u2019d become quick friends.</p><p>He made a habit of stopping in to see her or giving her a call every couple of weeks. She appeared to enjoy these visits and bragged proudly about her two children and her grandchildren. Her son, William, lived somewhere in the south, if he remembered correctly, and a daughter, Olivia, was a family court judge right here in Cedar Cove. Cliff had yet to meet Olivia, although he did wonder if any woman could live up to everything her mother had said about her.</p> <p>Now that Cliff had spent some time studying the items Charlotte had rescued from the storage unit, he\u2019d come to appreciate what she\u2019d done. He could think of no better way to thank her than by giving her one of the movie posters, which he\u2019d had mounted and framed. Charlotte had genuinely loved Tom Harding and that was before she\u2019d identified him as the Yodeling Cowboy.</p><p>Cliff parked his truck on the steep hill above the cove, angling his tires into the curb. Carrying the unwieldy poster, he walked up the few steps that led to the large family home. As usual, Harry, her \u201cguard cat,\u201d was curled up asleep in the living room window. Even before he had a chance to ring the bell, Cliff heard Charlotte turning the door locks.</p><p>He\u2019d never had the opportunity to count how many locks Charlotte had, but he suspected Houdini couldn\u2019t have gotten inside. He wasn\u2019t sure what she had hidden that was so valuable; he did know that anything precious was likely to be buried underneath a pile of panty hose. He was also aware that at some point in their conversation Charlotte was likely to ask him about his bowels.</p><p>\u201cCliff,\u201d she said happily, unlatching the screen door, first one and then a second lock. \u201cThis is a pleasant surprise. I wish you\u2019d let me know you were planning to stop by. I would\u2019ve baked you a batch of cookies.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly the reason he hadn\u2019t phoned ahead. The woman was intent on fattening him up. Cliff didn\u2019t need any assistance in that area\u2014he already had a paunch that had come with middle age and he was trying hard to lose it. So far he was down ten pounds from the first of the year, although he swore it would\u2019ve been easier to chip away rock. Until retirement, he\u2019d never had to worry about his weight.</p> <p>\u201cI brought you a little something,\u201d he said as she swung open the screen door for him. Harry raised his head, stared at him and apparently decided Cliff was a friend. The cat closed his eyes and resumed his nap.</p><p>\u201cSit down and I\u2019ll make us a cup of tea,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got some pound cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to any bother.\u201d He knew it wouldn\u2019t do much good to protest, but he tried anyway. He was only going to stay for a few minutes. After leaving Charlotte\u2019s, he\u2019d drop off Grace Sherman\u2019s credit card at the PancakePalace. He might ask Charlotte if she knew Grace, since the older woman seemed acquainted with nearly everyone in Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cYou must be hungry,\u201d Charlotte said, sounding hurt that he\u2019d refused her offer.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d he insisted, \u201copen your gift.\u201d It wasn\u2019t wrapped, but the frame shop had slipped it inside a cardboard container.</p><p>Charlotte looked up at him quizzically. \u201cThis is for me?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned and nodded, enjoying her flustered reaction. Charlotte was the kind of person who was constantly giving to others but felt uncomfortable receiving anything herself.</p><p>She opened the cardboard, and Cliff helped her remove the frame. He held up the poster and heard the soft gasp when she realized what it was. She covered her mouth with one hand as her soft gray eyes flooded with tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cliff, you shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d she said, blinking furiously. \u201cThis is far too valuable to give me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I\u2019m sure my grandfather would\u2019ve wanted you to have it. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t even have any of these things.\u201d Nor would Cliff have known anything about his grandfather, other than what his father had told him. He now saw Tom as more than a selfish, fame-obsessed bastard; he saw a regretful old man who would\u2019ve liked to turn back the years and make different choices.</p><p>\u201cYou were a difficult nut to crack,\u201d Charlotte reminded him, frowning.</p><p>He had to agree. She\u2019d been persistent in calling and writing. If he hadn\u2019t arrived on her doorstep when he did, Cliff figured she would\u2019ve brought everything to him herself, venturing onto the freeway in a car he was sure had never been driven over forty miles an hour.</p><p>Charlotte reached for a lace-trimmed handkerchief in her apron pocket and blew her nose loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to hang it for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d come prepared to do that, assuming the task would require his assistance.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it would be inappropriate for me to hang it in my bedroom?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think that would be a perfectly fine choice,\u201d he assured her. He followed her into the long hallway to the master bedroom at the far end of the house. The double bed against the wall had a plain curved headboard. An old-fashioned dresser with a large mirror sat on the opposite side of the room. She had a comfortable chair with worn green upholstery and a table with a reading lamp. Cliff guessed she did most of her reading there, gauging by the pile of books on the table.</p><p>\u201cHow about here?\u201d Charlotte asked, pointing to a bare space on the white wall across from the bed.</p><p>Several pictures crowded the dresser top, but Cliff didn\u2019t have a chance to study them. One did catch his notice, however. Charlotte saw what he was looking at and reached for the frame. \u201cThis is Olivia when she was six months,\u201d she said, pointing to the picture of a baby. \u201cShe was an exceptional child even then.\u201d</p><p>Cliff swallowed a smile. Six-month-old Olivia was sucking on her big toe and grinning with toothless delight. Cliff could only imagine what the judge would say if she knew he\u2019d seen the photograph.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Almost as if the picture had conjured up Charlotte\u2019s daughter, he heard a woman\u2019s voice call from the living room. \u201cAre you all right? The front door\u2019s open and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear...\u201d Charlotte rushed out of the bedroom. \u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe door was unlocked and you never\u2014\u201d Olivia said, meeting Charlotte in the hallway. She stopped abruptly when Cliff walked out of the bedroom.</p><p>Olivia stared at her mother and then Cliff.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, enjoying the perplexed look. Olivia had matured into a strikingly attractive woman. Now probably wasn\u2019t the time to ask if she was still agile enough to lift her foot to her mouth. He couldn\u2019t keep from grinning, though. The resemblance between mother and daughter was most apparent in the eyes, although hers were more blue than gray. If he hadn\u2019t known Olivia was a judge, he would have guessed she held some responsible position from the dignified way she carried herself. She was medium height, close to his own age, and her hair was still a lustrous brown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cliff Harding,\u201d he said, stepping forward and offering his hand.</p><p>\u201cTom\u2019s grandson,\u201d Charlotte explained. \u201cHe was just hanging up a poster of the Yodeling Cowboy for me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia frowned as they shook hands. \u201cOh, my goodness, you\u2019re Cliff Harding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I just said,\u201d Charlotte murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe has Grace\u2019s credit card.\u201d</p><p>Actually Cliff saw Grace as the one who had his VISA card. \u201cYou know Grace Sherman?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for years. She was planning to return your call this evening.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte glanced helplessly from one to the other, as if she\u2019d somehow missed hearing the punch line to a good joke.</p><p>As best he could, Cliff explained the situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better take care of that right away,\u201d Charlotte advised. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t use credit cards. It\u2019s like carrying Monopoly money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped to get my own card back,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cDo you think I could drop in on Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe works at the library,\u201d Charlotte told him. \u201cYou could leave your truck parked here and walk over there. It\u2019s only a few blocks away and I don\u2019t expect we\u2019re going to have many more of these sunshiny afternoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should meet Grace,\u201d Olivia encouraged. She shifted her gaze from him and Cliff wondered if he was missing something.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Charlotte agreed. \u201cOlivia\u2019s right, you should meet Grace. She could use a male friend after what Dan did to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Olivia added quickly, \u201cis her husband, correction...was her husband. He disappeared earlier in the year.\u201d</p><p>The two women became engaged in a discussion about Dan\u2019s whereabouts and their own suspicion\u2014that he\u2019d left Grace and run away with another woman.</p><p>\u201cGrace filed for divorce last Monday,\u201d Olivia told him.</p><p>The same day as the credit card mishap. No wonder she\u2019d seemed distracted and preoccupied. No wonder she\u2019d been alone. Although Cliff would\u2019ve noticed her if she\u2019d been in the middle of a crowd.</p><p>Grace Sherman was like...like a mountain wildflower. He wasn\u2019t normally poetic and couldn\u2019t really say why he thought of her in those terms, but that was the image that came to his mind. A flower that bloomed despite cold, wind and hardship. He\u2019d tried not to be obvious, but she\u2019d attracted him and he\u2019d wondered about her. It\u2019d been a very long time since he\u2019d looked at a woman, any woman, the way he had Grace.</p><p>\u201cI think I will take a walk over to the library,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Olivia said brightly.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s daughter seemed eager to send him off. Perhaps she was trying to encourage him to meet her friend. If that was the case, Cliff didn\u2019t need any prompting. After saying goodbye to Charlotte and Olivia, he left and strolled down the steep incline toward the waterfront. This was his first visit to the library and he stopped to admire the mural painted on the outside. The town sported several other murals, as well, which he\u2019d often admired.</p><p>Grace Sherman stood at the front desk when Cliff entered the library.</p><p>She glanced up when he approached the counter. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cliff Harding,\u201d he said and waited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It obviously took a moment for his name to register. \u201cOh, hi\u2014you\u2019re the one who has my credit card and I have yours.

If you\u2019ll wait a moment, I\u2019ll get my purse.\u201d Grace took a deep breath, then said, \u201cI was going to call you back this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Olivia said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met this afternoon at Charlotte\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Again she hesitated, as if needing time to connect all the dots. \u201cYou\u2019re Tom Harding\u2019s grandson.

His credit card was tucked inside a small white envelope. They exchanged credit cards, laughed about what had happened, then stood gazing at each other for an awkward few seconds.</p><p>It was now or never, Tom decided. \u201cI was thinking maybe we could laugh over this at dinner one night.\u201d It\u2019d been years since Cliff had asked a woman out on a date, and he felt a little uneasy. When she didn\u2019t respond, he was sure he\u2019d bungled the invitation.</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d Grace finally echoed. \u201cThe two of us?\u201d</p> <p>Cliff spoke rapidly. \u201cI\u2019ve been divorced for the last five years. I haven\u2019t dated since my wife left and...well, I think maybe it\u2019s time I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, staring at him again. \u201cI mean...\u201d She paused and took another deep, audible breath. \u201cThank you.\u201d She raised her hand to her throat. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how flattered I am that you\u2019d ask. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not ready just yet.\u201d</p><p>That was a fair reply. \u201cWhen do you think you might be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t say. I recently filed for divorce. I don\u2019t feel it would be right for me to see anyone else until I\u2019m legally free to do so.\u201d She looked away. \u201cI take it you heard about my husband?\u201d</p><p>Cliff nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting, Grace, and I\u2019m a patient man.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his and he saw the beginnings of a smile. That was something he hoped to see again. Soon.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d Jack said, his stocking feet propped up against the ottoman in front of Olivia\u2019s large-screen television. Tuesday night was their date night. Olivia had invited him over for dinner and The New Detectives on the Discovery Channel. Lately they\u2019d taken turns supplying the meal. This week it had been Olivia\u2019s turn and she\u2019d baked a chicken casserole that was worthy of a cooking award. He generally brought takeout.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve barely said a word all night.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed and rested her head on his shoulder. It\u2019d been his lucky day, that morning nine months earlier when Jack had strolled into her courtroom. New to Cedar Cove and the newspaper, he\u2019d visited the divorce court, jaded by his own experience and expecting to hear what he always did.</p><p>But Olivia was different. A young couple, Ian and Cecilia Randall, had stood before her, accompanied by their attorneys. Another divorce, two people with broken hearts pretending they were above the pain. Only it radiated from both of them. Jack saw it and wondered if anyone else did. He assumed all those involved in the legal process had become blind to the human wreckage that appeared before these judges. Couples walked in battered and broken, emotionally crippled by the pain husbands and wives so often inflicted on each other.</p><p>The Randalls had lost an infant daughter, Jack recalled, and were asking Olivia to rescind their prenuptial agreement so they could file for divorce. Olivia denied the petition and, in essence, had denied their divorce. Jack\u2019s column that weekend had praised her courage.</p><p>Olivia hadn\u2019t appreciated the unwanted attention, but she\u2019d forgiven him. In the months since, he\u2019d gotten to know Olivia Lockhart. They\u2019d grown close, and he was beginning to hope this relationship had a future.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me?\u201d he asked, wondering if he was reading more into her silence than he should. He\u2019d had his own bit of troubling news this afternoon, but he wasn\u2019t ready to disclose it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Justine,\u201d Olivia said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d As far as Jack knew, Olivia\u2019s daughter was deeply in love with her fisherman husband.</p><p>\u201cShe was seen having lunch with Warren Saget last Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren?\u201d Jack had never understood what Olivia\u2019s daughter saw in the land developer. Now that Justine had married Seth, he\u2019d hoped Warren would move on to greener pastures\u2014which in his case probably meant an even younger woman.</p><p>\u201cYou heard it or Justine mentioned it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard it,\u201d Olivia said and gnawed on her lower lip. \u201cJustine doesn\u2019t share much with me.\u201d She gazed at him with wide anxious eyes. \u201cI think...she regrets marrying Seth.\u201d</p><p>Jack removed his feet from the ottoman and leaned forward. This was serious. He frowned, trying to think of something reassuring he could say. But he was hardly an expert on the parent-child connection. His relationship with his own son was on rocky ground and with good reason. As a child, Eric had suffered from leukemia. Jack had turned to the bottle for solace, and for years he\u2019d emotionally abandoned his wife and son. Following the divorce, Eric hadn\u2019t wanted anything to do with his father. Jack couldn\u2019t blame the boy; nevertheless, it stung. Now after several years of sobriety and with Olivia\u2019s encouragement, he\u2019d made a determined effort to reestablish contact.</p><p>Olivia and her daughter struggled with their relationship, too, but on an entirely different level.</p><p>\u201cJust ask her,\u201d Jack advised. \u201cShe\u2019d probably be willing to tell you.\u201d</p><p>A quick shake of her head dismissed that idea. \u201cI can\u2019t...Justine will resent the intrusion. I don\u2019t dare say a word unless she brings it up. Besides, I don\u2019t want her to know I heard about her lunch with Warren. She\u2019ll accuse me of listening to gossip.\u201d Olivia dropped her feet and bent forward. \u201cHow is it,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat I can make judgments in a courtroom that affect the future of our community and yet I can\u2019t speak openly with my own daughter?\u201d</p><p>It was the same question he\u2019d asked himself with regard to his son. Each week Jack editorialized in The Cedar Cove Chronicle. He was never at a loss when it came to expressing his opinion. But talking to his only child\u2014well, there his confidence disappeared. He was afraid of saying too much or not enough, of sounding either judgmental or indifferent.</p><p>\u201cEric phoned this afternoon,\u201d Jack said bleakly. \u201cHe was upset and I didn\u2019t know what to tell him. I\u2019m his father, he came to me with a problem and I should\u2019ve been able to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Like Jack, Olivia knew it was a breakthrough in this difficult relationship for Eric to contact him at all. When he didn\u2019t immediately answer, Olivia ran her hand down the length of his back. \u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl Eric\u2019s living with is pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t using birth control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He didn\u2019t think it would happen.\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed softly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why any couple would take chances with birth control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Jack said, turning to face Olivia. \u201cSince Eric had cancer as a youngster, the drugs and the different procedures left him sterile. The doctors told us that years ago.\u201d</p><p>Olivia frowned. \u201cYou mean the baby isn\u2019t his?\u201d</p><p>Jack rubbed his hand over his eyes. \u201cIt can\u2019t be, and Eric knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>Jack had wanted to say something helpful to Eric, but he had no words of comfort or advice. He\u2019d hung up feeling that once again he\u2019d failed his son.</p><p>The Harbor Street Gallery was quiet for the moment. Taking advantage of the respite, Maryellen slipped into the back room to get herself a cup of coffee. Weekdays tended to be slow, especially in the fall. During the summer months, the gallery was a drawing point for tourists and constantly crowded. As the manager, Maryellen welcomed the lull that came with autumn, especially since the Christmas rush would soon begin. Already they were gearing up for it.</p><p>At some point today, Jon Bowman would drop by. She\u2019d last seen him in June and remembered their meeting with embarrassment. Jon was a reserved, perhaps shy man, who had little tolerance for small talk. She\u2019d hoped to engage him in conversation; instead she\u2019d babbled on about all manner of irrelevant things. By the time he left, she\u2019d wanted to kick herself for falling victim to her own eagerness.</p><p>No sooner had she poured her coffee than she heard footsteps on the polished showroom floor. After a quick, restorative sip, she set the mug aside, and hurried out front, prepared to greet her customer.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d she said, then brightened when she saw who it was. \u201cJon, I was just thinking about you.\u201d His photography had long been her favorite of all the art they sold. The gallery carried work in a variety of artistic media: oil and watercolor paintings, marble and bronze sculpture, porcelain figurines and one-of-a-kind pottery. Jon was the only photographer represented at the Harbor Street Gallery.</p><p>His photographs were both black-and-white and color, and his subjects included landscapes and details of nature, like a close-up of some porous stone on a beach or the pattern of bark on a tree. Sometimes he focused on human elements, such as a weathered rowboat or a fisherman\u2019s shack. He never used people in his compositions. Maryellen was impressed by the way he found simplicity in an apparently complex landscape, making the viewer aware of the underlying shapes and lines\u2014and the way he revealed the complexity in small, simple details. This was an artist with true vision, a vision that made her look at things differently.</p><p>It was through his work that she knew Jon. As she\u2019d discovered, he wasn\u2019t a man of many words, but his pictures spoke volumes. That was why she wanted to know him better. That, and no other reason. Even if she found his appearance downright compelling...</p><p>Jon Bowman was tall and limber, easily six feet. His hair was long, often pulled away from his face and secured in a ponytail. He wasn\u2019t a conventionally attractive man; his features were sharp, his nose too large for his narrow face, hawklike in its appearance. He dressed casually, usually in jeans and plaid shirts.</p><p>He\u2019d started bringing his work into the gallery three years ago\u2014a few at a time, with long lapses in between. Maryellen had worked at the gallery for ten years and was well acquainted with most of the artists who lived in the area. She often socialized with them, but other than to discuss business, she\u2019d rarely spoken to Jon.</p><p>She found it odd that her favorite artist would resist her efforts at friendship.</p><p>\u201cI brought in some more photographs,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would. I\u2019ve sold everything you brought me last June. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That news produced a small grin. Jon\u2019s smiles were as infrequent as his conversations.</p><p>\u201cPeople like your pictures.\u201d</p><p>Praise embarrassed him. Whenever customers had asked to meet him, he\u2019d refused. He didn\u2019t explain why, but she sensed that he felt the public\u2019s focus should be on the art and not the artist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the photographs,\u201d he said brusquely, disappearing out the back door.</p> <p>When he returned, he held an armful of framed photographs of varying sizes. He carried them to the back room, placing them on Maryellen\u2019s work table.</p><p>\u201cCan I interest you in a cup of coffee?\u201d she asked. She\u2019d offered before and he\u2019d always declined.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen was sure she\u2019d misunderstood him. She told herself it was absurd to feel this elation that he\u2019d finally agreed. She poured him a cup and gestured toward the sugar and cream. He shook his head.</p><p>They sat on stools across from each other, both staring into their coffee. \u201cYour work is gaining recognition,\u201d she finally said.</p> <p>He ignored her remark. \u201cYou\u2019re divorced?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>The question caught Maryellen off guard. She\u2019d certainly realized he wasn\u2019t much for small talk, but this verged on rude. She decided to answer him, anyway\u2014and then turn the subject back to him.</p><p>\u201cThirteen years.\u201d She hardly ever mentioned her marriage. She\u2019d been young and immature, and had paid a high price for her mistake. As soon as the divorce was final, she\u2019d reverted to her maiden name and chosen to put the experience behind her. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Jon apparently had his own agenda because he answered her question with one of his own. \u201cYou don\u2019t date much, though, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you married?\u201d She didn\u2019t think he was.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorced?\u201d she asked next.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He certainly didn\u2019t bother with sharing, nor did he feel obliged to offer much personal information in exchange for hers.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you date?\u201d he asked next.</p><p>Maryellen shrugged, choosing a nonverbal reply instead of a lengthy explanation.</p><p>Jon sipped his coffee. \u201cDon\u2019t you get asked?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d She preferred parties and other social events to individual dates. \u201cWhy the interest, all of a sudden? Would you like to ask me out?\u201d she asked boldly. If he did, she just might be tempted. Then again, maybe not. Dark, mysterious men were dangerous, and she\u2019d already learned her lesson.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d Jon pressed.</p><p>Maryellen got off the stool, uncomfortable with the way he continually parried her questions with his. Each question dug a little deeper, delving into territory she\u2019d rather leave undisturbed.</p><p>\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know about you,\u201d she said, challenging him with a look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a chef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you enjoy cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a chef at Andr\u00e9\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The elite seafood restaurant was on the Tacoma waterfront. \u201cI...I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t. It\u2019s how I pay the bills.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s voice rang from inside the gallery. \u201cAnybody here?\u201d</p><p>Her sister couldn\u2019t have chosen a worse time to visit and Maryellen glanced regretfully toward the showroom. \u201cThat\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be going.\u201d Jon took a swallow of the cooled coffee, then put down the mug.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave yet.\u201d She reached out impulsively, touching his forearm. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll only be a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to Andr\u00e9\u2019s one night,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make you something special.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen wasn\u2019t sure if he meant she should come alone or if she should bring a date. But it seemed inappropriate to ask. \u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d she said as Kelly walked into the back room. Her sister stopped suddenly, her face filled with surprise and delight at finding Maryellen with a man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jon Bowman,\u201d Jon said into the awkward silence. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to visit. Nice seeing you again, Maryellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d she said, her feelings a mixture of surprise and regret. Anticipation too, she admitted privately. And that was something she hadn\u2019t felt in years.</p><p>Kelly watched him go. As soon as Jon was out of earshot, she asked, \u201cWas that anyone special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one of our artists,\u201d Maryellen returned, not elaborating.</p><p>Kelly claimed the stool recently vacated by Jon. \u201cHow\u2019s Mom holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than I expected.\u201d Making that first attorney\u2019s appointment had been difficult, but her mother\u2019s resolve had seen her through.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s coming back, you know,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Maryellen didn\u2019t argue, although she\u2019d long since abandoned hope that he would.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me, do you?\u201d Kelly challenged.</p><p>Maryellen had, in fact, given up. For whatever reason, their father had disappeared. When it came to men, she didn\u2019t expect much, even from her own father.</p><p>Could Jon Bowman be any different? She wasn\u2019t going to think about that now, she decided.</p><p>\u201cDaddy will come back,\u201d Kelly insisted again when Maryellen ignored the question.</p><p>\u201cTime will tell, won\u2019t it,\u201d Maryellen said and reached for her coffee.</p><p>Three</p><p>She must be in the grip of some insanity, Justine decided as she stepped off the small commuter plane in King Cove, Alaska. It\u2019d been almost two weeks since she\u2019d heard from Seth and she couldn\u2019t stand waiting another day.</p><p>She\u2019d contacted the cannery where Seth and his father sold their fish and crab, but they didn\u2019t have any information about the boat\u2019s schedule. Justine had left a message with the frazzled secretary, although there was no guarantee Seth would ever receive it. She\u2019d asked the woman to please let Seth know Justine would be arriving that weekend. She could only hope he\u2019d gotten word of her impending visit.</p><p>Walking carefully down the steps of the ten-seater aircraft, Justine looked up expectantly, longing for Seth and praying he\u2019d be at the small airport waiting for her. The wind stung her face, shocking her with its chill. The last weekend of September, and already there was evidence of winter\u2019s approach in this cold Alaskan wind.</p><p>\u201cIs someone meeting you, miss?\u201d the pilot asked when Justine reached for her overnight bag in the cart outside the plane.</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2014I think.\u201d But Seth wasn\u2019t at the airstrip. She took a taxi into town and listened with half an ear while the driver droned on about life on the Alaskan coast. He dropped her at a waterfront motel with a partially burned-out neon sign that read TEL.</p><p>The room was small and plain and dreary with its utilitarian beige carpeting, stained in several places. The curtains and bedspread were a faded floral pattern that wouldn\u2019t have been attractive even when they were new. She sat on the edge of the thin mattress, feeling sad and lost. Coming here had been crazy, a sign of how truly desperate she was. Now that she\u2019d arrived in Alaska, she had to accept that this trip was a waste of time.</p><p>Her marriage had seemed right and perfect only a few weeks earlier, but now she was overwhelmed by doubts. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d actually married Seth. She sighed, a long, heartfelt sigh. Quite simply, she needed to know he loved her. And since she\u2019d only heard from him a handful of times, she was beginning to think he didn\u2019t. Or rather, that his love was just a temporary passion, a desire he\u2019d now satisfied.</p><p>Well, she could spend all weekend in the motel room feeling sorry for herself or she could try to find out where he was. Determined to locate her husband, she dressed in her warmest clothes and asked Betty, the lady at the front desk, for directions to the cannery. She was on foot, but it was only a short distance from the motel to the docks. The wind whipped her long hair about her face as she walked toward the water, her hands buried deep inside her pockets. Because it was late in the fishing season, plenty of boats were tied along the pier.</p><p>Justine talked to several fishermen. They were all familiar with Seth and his father, but no one had any information to give her. Disheartened, she headed back to the motel.</p><p>As she left, she noticed a large commercial fishing vessel preparing to dock, its huge boom reaching toward the sky. The smaller picking booms stretched out like thin steel arms on either side of the vessel. A large muscular man with a blond head covered in a blue knit cap had his back to her; he resembled Seth in coloring and stature. Was it possible? Could she be this lucky?</p><p>Increasing her pace, she hurried down the dock toward the fishing boat. \u201cSeth!\u201d she called, but the wind carried his name away. Still, the man must have heard something because he turned. It was her husband. When he saw her, he took one gigantic leap from the vessel to land with both feet on the dock.</p><p>Justine ran down the wooden pier and with a joyous shout, hurled herself into his embrace. He grasped her tightly about the waist, lifting her several inches off the ground. He was kissing her and every doubt, every question, vanished with that one frenzied kiss.</p><p>Justine heard men chuckling somewhere nearby, but she barely noticed and apparently neither did Seth.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked, brushing the hair from her face. His eyes were warm with love. \u201cHow\u2019d you know we were coming back in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I just prayed you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his mouth to hers once more and murmured something about prayer being highly underrated just before his lips claimed hers.</p><p>\u201cI have a motel room,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Seth glanced over his shoulder. \u201cWait here.\u201d He hurried back to the boat, leaped aboard and quickly disappeared belowdecks. Justine was beginning to wonder what had happened to him when he reappeared with a dark duffel bag draped over his shoulder. Even though he needed a shave and a shower, he was the most handsome, thrilling, incredible man she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cHow long do we have?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo days.\u201d She slid her arm through his and leaned her head against his shoulder. \u201cWe need to talk, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d he promised, but any conversation would come second if she read the glint in his eyes correctly.</p><p>\u201cI see you found your husband,\u201d Betty said as they approached the motel.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Justine said, her voice light with happiness. By the time they reached her room, Justine had the key out and ready.</p><p>Seth hauled her into his arms the instant the door was unlocked and carried her inside, flicking on the light as they entered. What had seemed plain and ugly only an hour ago felt like a honeymoon suite just now.</p><p>Her husband set her on the worn carpet, and his hands delved into her hair, angling her mouth toward his. Their kiss was long. Passionate. \u201cI need a shower,\u201d he muttered impatiently when it was over. \u201cWait right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured, eyes closed, still consumed by his kiss.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Justine opened her eyes and gazed into his. Seth was stripping off his coat and had started to unfasten the buttons of his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she told him, but they both knew she wasn\u2019t talking about food.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jussie, me too.\u201d</p><p>He was the only person in the world who dared to call her that.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here,\u201d he said. He rapidly discarded his clothes, sitting on the far edge of the bed to remove his boots. He stood before her unzipping his pants. Even in his rush, he took time to drape his clothes over a chair. Then he stalked naked into the bathroom.</p> <p>The shower had to be the fastest one on record. Justine had just slipped out of her shoes and pulled the sweater over her head. She\u2019d started to unbutton her blouse when he returned. The intense look in his eyes stopped her, and her fingers froze on the last button. It was ridiculous to feel so shy with him. They were married and had already spent one glorious weekend together as husband and wife. But that had been weeks earlier and already seemed as distant as a dream.</p><p>Ever sensitive to her moods, Seth seemed to know her thoughts, to sense her apprehensions. With a tenderness that made her weak in the knees, he gently drew her to him. His mouth was warm and moist and there didn\u2019t seem to be any part of her that he didn\u2019t want to kiss. Soon her blouse was on the bed next to her sweater.</p><p>Their kisses appeared to have the same knee-weakening effect on him because he sank to the bed and wrapped his arms about her waist. He kissed her belly, then reached up and released her bra, freeing her breasts. He moaned and she lowered her mouth to meet his.</p><p>Not long afterward, he urged her onto the bed with him and they were caught in a sensual tumult that lasted until Justine was breathless and spent. Wrapped in her husband\u2019s embrace with only a sheet covering their legs, she rested her head on his chest, one arm flung about his waist.</p><p>Half inclined, his back against the headboard, Seth ran his hand along the length of her hair. Justine had closed her eyes, but not because she was sleepy. These moments needed to be savored, especially if they had to last her another few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what brought you here,\u201d Seth whispered. \u201cBut whatever it is, I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to know,\u201d she said, her voice more breath than sound. \u201cI had to ask if you were sorry we got married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was adamant. Tilting her chin up, he studied her eyes. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Her smile developed slowly. Feeling deliciously relaxed and sated, she had no problem giving him the answer he wanted. \u201cI\u2019m so in love with you it\u2019s driving me crazy. I want us to be together, Seth. I hate having you so far from home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been hard on me, too,\u201d Seth told her, his hand continuing its soothing motion. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved fishing, but my heart\u2019s been with you from the moment I left.\u201d</p><p>Justine stroked his shoulder, delighting in the smooth skin there. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone at home what I was doing. I knew if I told my mother or grandmother I was flying up to find you, they\u2019d tell me it was impossible, that I was taking too big a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always had an incredible sense of timing,\u201d Seth teased.</p><p>\u201cI do, don\u2019t I?\u201d She rubbed her cheek against the hard muscles of his chest, loving the feel, the sight, the scent of this man. She eased her leg over his.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you have to leave?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLate Sunday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>His hands were in her hair again. \u201cIn that case, we\u2019d better make up for lost time, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Justine was in full agreement.</p><p>Grace woke early Monday morning, feeling more contented than she had in a long while. Buttercup, her golden retriever, who slept on the floor beside her, got to her feet, tail waving vigorously as Grace folded back the covers and climbed out of bed.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sweetheart,\u201d she said, reaching for her robe. She wondered what Dan would think if he learned that she\u2019d replaced him with a dog.</p> <p>Buttercup ambled behind Grace into the kitchen and then let herself outside, through the pet door. While the dog did her business, Grace brewed a small pot of coffee. Humming softly to herself, she showered and chose a red plaid blouse and jean jumper to wear to the library. She slid her feet into a pair of matching red shoes, and then popped two slices of whole wheat bread into the toaster for breakfast.</p><p>When it was time to leave, Buttercup followed her to the car. Grace rubbed her companion\u2019s ears, grateful that her dog would be waiting for her when she returned.</p><p>Buttercup was the perfect housemate: loving, obedient, reliable. She\u2019d return to the kitchen through her dog door as soon as Grace left. And then, when Grace got home, Buttercup would come out to greet her again.</p><p>The sun was out, but rain was forecast for the afternoon. Grace loved the autumn months; she remembered that Dan used to feel the same way. Having worked as a logger most of his career, he\u2019d always been at home in the woods. Only in recent years, with much of the forest land closed to lumbering, had Dan taken a job with a local tree service. He\u2019d never complained, but she knew he\u2019d hated it and longed to return to the woods.</p><p>The sadness was back, and Grace forced her thoughts away from her soon-to-be ex-husband. Wherever Dan was now and whoever he was with, she wished him happiness. She\u2019d never been able to give him that, even in the early years. They\u2019d married young. Grace was pregnant with Maryellen by the time they graduated from high school. She\u2019d married Dan and he\u2019d enlisted and gone off to Vietnam, but the man who returned wasn\u2019t the same man who\u2019d left. Almost forty years later, he still suffered from nightmares and memories he refused to share. She never knew what had happened in those dark jungles and Dan always said it was better that she didn\u2019t.</p><p>As usual, Monday morning at the library was slow after the heavy weekend activity. Grace decided to change the bulletin board and brought out the packet with a scarecrow, a black cat and a pumpkin patch. They had sets of cardboard cutouts for every season and holiday; Thanksgiving would be next, followed by Christmas. She was busily working on it, when she heard a male voice behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to apply for a library card,\u201d Cliff Harding told her assistant, Loretta Bailey.</p><p>\u201cI can help you with that.\u201d Loretta pulled out a form and set it on the counter. She paused when she saw Grace watching her.</p><p>Cliff looked over his shoulder. \u201cHello, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She hoped her voice didn\u2019t betray how flustered she felt.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was time I got a library card, since I\u2019m in Cedar Cove practically every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have the highest percentage of people with library cards per capita of any town or city in WashingtonState,\u201d Loretta informed him proudly as she handed him a pen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d Cliff said as his gaze moved back toward Grace.</p><p>She tried to ignore his appreciative stare but couldn\u2019t. All at once she found herself fumbling and a tack fell and rolled across the floor. Bending to retrieve it, she nearly bumped heads with Cliff Harding as he, too, bent down. He was dressed in the same western style as he had been earlier, complete with a Stetson and boots. She even thought she detected the scent of hay on him.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to have dinner with me yet?\u201d he asked in a stage whisper while both of them were crouched.</p><p>She glanced up at Loretta, who was carefully studying some paper or other, but Grace wasn\u2019t fooled. Her co-worker was keenly interested in Grace\u2019s answer, perhaps more so than Cliff.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t think so.\u201d She could feel the heat radiate from her face. His interest left her uncomfortable and out of her element. Her last date had been with Dan, when they were both teenagers. That was almost four decades ago\u2014in a different century! The world was a vastly different place now.</p><p>\u201cWould you consider having coffee with me, then?\u201d Cliff asked.</p><p>Before Grace could respond, Loretta stood on her tiptoes, leaned over the counter and smiled down at them. \u201cYou can take your break now if you want.\u201d</p><p>Grace resisted the urge to groan out loud.</p><p>\u201cThe PancakePalace?\u201d Cliff suggested, grinning boyishly. He seemed thankful for Loretta\u2019s encouragement, even if Grace wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFive o\u2019clock,\u201d she said, none too pleased.</p><p>His smile broadened as he stood. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Grace came to her feet and glared across the counter at Loretta. Cliff, meanwhile, had started toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your library card?\u201d Grace called out.</p><p>Cliff didn\u2019t break his stride. \u201cI\u2019ll fill out the form next time I stop by,\u201d he told her.</p><p>By five o\u2019clock, Grace still wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d meet Cliff Harding. Good manners won out. She might be nervous about seeing him, but she\u2019d agreed to be there, and Grace believed in keeping her word.</p><p>Cliff slid out of a booth at the restaurant and stood when she approached. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d come,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I would, either,\u201d she admitted and got into the red upholstered bench across from him. She righted the beige ceramic cup.</p><p>Cliff raised his hand in order to catch the waitress\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d Goldie announced from behind the counter. The elderly waitress had been with the PancakePalace for as long as Grace could remember\u2014as far back as her high school days. It was a new employee, not Goldie, who\u2019d confused the credit cards.</p><p>Bringing the glass coffeepot, Goldie poured Grace\u2019s cup first, then refilled Cliff\u2019s. \u201cYou two planning to stay long?\u201d she asked Grace. \u201cThe Chamber\u2019s coming here for dinner.\u201d</p><p>This was Goldie\u2019s subtle way of informing Grace that if she didn\u2019t want the entire business community to know she was having coffee with Cliff, she\u2019d better cut this meeting short.</p><p>Grace wanted to kiss the older woman\u2019s hand. \u201cWe won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp to you,\u201d Goldie assured her with a wink.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, Goldie.\u201d</p><p>Now that he had her attention, Cliff stared down at his coffee, avoiding eye contact. \u201cI have a fairly good notion of how you\u2019re feeling just now.\u201d</p><p>Grace sincerely doubted that. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nervous, a little agitated and your stomach\u2019s full of butterflies. Am I close?\u201d</p><p>Actually, he was. \u201cClose enough. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m feeling the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d been divorced five years?\u201d Did that mean this state of tension in the presence of the opposite sex went on indefinitely?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to discuss it?\u201d It\u2019d help if he talked about himself because she had no intention of spilling out the private details of her life.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne daughter. She\u2019s married and lives on the East Coast. We talk every week, and I make a point of flying out to see her once or twice a year.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least he kept in contact with his child, unlike Dan who\u2019d abandoned both Grace and their daughters.</p><p>\u201cSusan\u2014my wife\u2014fell in love with a colleague from work,\u201d Cliff said. His hand tightened around the mug and she noticed a spasming muscle in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cAccording to what she said at the time, she\u2019d never been happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. After the divorce I retired and moved to Olalla,\u201d he said, mentioning a local community ten miles south of Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cThe locals call it Ou-la-la,\u201d Grace told him.</p><p>\u201cI can understand why. It\u2019s beautiful there. I have forty acres and raise quarter horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, except for one thing.\u201d His eyes locked with hers. \u201cI\u2019m lonely.\u201d</p> <p>That was something Grace understood far too well. Her marriage had never been completely happy, but over the years Grace and Dan had grown content with each other. There was a lot to be said for contentedness\u2014conversation over dinner, a night out at the movies, a repertoire of shared experiences. Dan had usually been there to greet her when she walked in the door after work. Now there was only Buttercup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a friend,\u201d Cliff told her. \u201cSomeone who\u2019d be willing to attend a concert with me every now and then, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>The idea appealed to Grace, too. \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d think so.\u201d His tone was gentle and encouraging.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she hurried to add, \u201conly after the divorce is final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Cliff said.</p> <p>\u201cOne more thing.\u201d She met his eyes again. \u201cI\u2019ll call you next time. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cAgreed, but does that mean you don\u2019t want me going into the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always welcome,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust as long as it\u2019s on library business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He reached for his mug and raised it to his lips, but not before Grace saw a smile lift the edges of his mouth.</p><p>She had the sneaking suspicion that he was about to become a frequent library patron.</p><p>Things had been strained between Rosie and Zach ever since the night of Eddie\u2019s open house at school. Rosie blamed her husband for that. Zach simply didn\u2019t appreciate how much she did. He seemed to think she sat around the house and watched soap operas all day while he was at the office. He didn\u2019t understand how complicated her life was. She was so busy she sometimes left the house before he did and didn\u2019t return until late in the evening. Now Zach expected her to cook a four-course dinner on top of everything else, she thought angrily.</p><p>She\u2019d asked him to attend Eddie\u2019s school function and he\u2019d been annoyed with her for days afterward. Eddie was Zach\u2019s son, too, and meeting his teacher was a small thing. Yet Zach had complained the entire evening. First about ordering pizza for dinner, then about the green peppers, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to wear his suit to the school meeting, and...Later that night, despite her best efforts, their discontent with each other had escalated into a full-blown argument.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t resolved it in the days that followed, either.</p> <p>After two weeks of this nonsense, one of them had to make a conciliatory gesture. Despite the fact that she\u2019d been up past midnight reading over the committee report for the PTA planning meeting scheduled that evening, Rosie rose at the crack of dawn and fried bacon and eggs. She used to take the time to cook a real breakfast for her family. She hoped Zach would realize she was trying and that would appease him.</p><p>Rosie broke the eggs into the pan once she heard Allison stir. The kids were on different schedules now that Allison was in high school, which made coordinated meals more difficult. But if it was important to her husband that she spend half the morning in front of a stove, she\u2019d do it in order to maintain the peace.</p><p>\u201cI have eggs cooking for you,\u201d she told her daughter when Allison stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI hate eggs,\u201d Allison said, slamming her backpack onto the table.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter eyed her as if Rosie were mentally lacking. \u201cSince forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot.\u201d Vaguely Rosie could recall long-ago battles over breakfast. \u201cWhat about some bacon then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck.\u201d Her daughter opened the refrigerator and pulled out a soda.</p><p>Rosie was appalled. \u201cYou can\u2019t have that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Allison looked at her with disdain. \u201cI have a pop every morning. Why can\u2019t I now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d It wasn\u2019t worth a fight. All the books Rosie had read about raising teenagers recommended carefully choosing your battles. Giving in on the soda seemed minor compared to not letting Allison pierce her nose.</p><p>Rosie turned off the burner and slid the fried eggs onto a couple of plates, together with the fast-cooling bacon. Walking down the hallway she knocked and opened Eddie\u2019s bedroom door. His room was an environmental disaster area, and as much as possible, she averted her eyes. Her son was sprawled across his bed, comforter on the floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you interested in breakfast?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Eddie lifted his head and blinked at her. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want breakfast?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He sat up, suddenly wide-awake. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said with enthusiasm.</p><p>This was more like it.</p><p>\u201cThe chocolate ones are my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPop-Tarts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fried you bacon and eggs.\u201d</p><p>Eddie wrinkled his nose as if she\u2019d suggested he dine on slugs. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d He flopped back on his pillow and reached for the comforter on the floor.</p><p>All right, so much for that. Venturing toward the master bedroom, she found Zach just as he was coming out of the walk-in closet, dressed in his suit and tie.</p><p>\u201cI cooked breakfast,\u201d she said, a bit stiffly.</p><p>He nodded as though he approved.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t now,\u201d he said, looking down at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got an early-morning appointment.\u201d</p><p>That was just great, dammit! No one appreciated her efforts or the fact that she was functioning on less than five hours\u2019 sleep. Whirling around, Rosie returned to the kitchen, dumped the congealed bacon and egg in the garbage and forcefully opened the dishwasher. She shoved in the plates.</p><p>Zach entered the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good day,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>Her husband stopped in front of the door leading to the garage. \u201cWould you like to meet for lunch this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>So Zach did realize what she was doing. Now he was making an overture, too. \u201cI think that\u2019s a lovely idea.\u201d She offered him a grateful smile and he smiled back.</p><p>\u201cEleven-thirty?\u201d</p><p>Rosie nodded and he walked over to her and kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Allison called, racing into the kitchen. \u201cCan I get a ride with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet you at the car.\u201d</p><p>Allison dashed toward her bedroom and returned two seconds later with her sweater, grabbing her backpack from the table as she went.</p><p>\u201cDo you have your lunch money?\u201d Rosie asked.</p><p>\u201cDuh? Of course I do.\u201d Allison kissed her cheek in the same fashion Zach had and was out the door.</p><p>No sooner had they left than Eddie appeared in the kitchen doorway. \u201cIs my Pop-Tart up yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d she muttered and searched the cupboards until she located a box of her son\u2019s favorite breakfast food.</p><p>An hour later, Eddie left to catch the school bus and Rosie straightened up the kitchen, turning on the dishwasher. Still in her ratty, ten-year-old housecoat, she went to the bedroom and pulled open the dresser drawer to take out fresh underwear.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she was in the shower that she remembered she had to be at the school by noon as a lunch volunteer for Eddie\u2019s class. She groaned and raised her face to the water. She\u2019d be away tonight, too. As it was, Zach didn\u2019t approve of her chairing this PTA committee. She\u2019d taken the position a year earlier and had promised to serve until the end of term and no longer. But last June not a single parent had stepped forward to volunteer. Rosie had no choice but to continue as chair.</p><p>She dressed and was about to call Zach\u2019s office when the phone rang. A half hour later, she was rushing out the door, about to ward off an emergency concerning the new choir robes at church. Somehow their order had gotten switched with that of another church, somewhere in Florida. It was imperative that the correct robes show up before the end of the month. At the church, she painstakingly repackaged the robes, made half a dozen phone calls and took the boxes to the post office to return to the company. Not until eleven-thirty did she realize she still hadn\u2019t called Zach. Taking out her cell phone, she punched in the number to her husband\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cSmith, Cox and Jefferson,\u201d came the pleasant\u2014and unfamiliar\u2014female voice.</p><p>Rose eased to a stop at a red light. \u201cThis is Rosie Cox. Could I speak to my husband, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Cox, this is Janice Lamond. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met, have we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t,\u201d she said. The light changed to green and she sped forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Mr. Cox left the office. I understand he was meeting you?\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t agreed to meet anywhere, at least not that she remembered. Where the hell would Zach go? Think, think, she ordered herself.</p><p>\u201cDid he bring his cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, he didn\u2019t. Mr. Cox said he didn\u2019t want to take any calls.\u201d</p><p>Rosie groaned. \u201cDid he tell you where he was headed?\u201d</p><p>The woman hesitated. \u201cI believe he mentioned D.D.\u2019s on the Cove.\u201d</p><p>Of course. It was her favorite and Zach always took her there for her birthday.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be late?\u201d Janice asked. \u201cI could phone the restaurant and let him know, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make lunch at all,\u201d Rosie muttered, truly regretful. Zach would never forgive her. Especially when he learned she had to cancel because she was volunteering yet again.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Zach had never mentioned how helpful this new employee was. Rosie liked her already. She pulled into the school parking lot and cut the engine.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind phoning him for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to tell him where you can be reached?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, not eager to have Zach call her in the midst of a volunteer activity. \u201cTell him I\u2019ll explain everything once I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it immediately,\u201d Janice said.</p><p>Rosie appreciated that the firm\u2019s new assistant was so friendly and accommodating.</p><p>If Zach was upset with her for skipping out on lunch, he didn\u2019t give any sign of it when he walked into the house that evening. Rosie was thawing hamburger in the microwave for spaghetti, Eddie\u2019s favorite dinner, when her husband came in. As usual, she was in a hurry to get out the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tried to gauge his mood. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about lunch,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Zach shrugged as he flipped through the mail. \u201cIt was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve checked my calendar.

They were close to her age and single, but unlike Maryellen they wanted men in their lives.</p><p>Every second Wednesday morning, Maryellen listened while they bemoaned their fates. She was often amused by the crazy schemes they devised for meeting men. Frankly, she couldn\u2019t understand why Rachel, her nail tech, hadn\u2019t found a decent man. Maryellen considered her attractive and savvy.</p><p>The third Wednesday in October, Maryellen arrived for her appointment. Rachel was, as usual, ready for her. As soon as Maryellen was seated, Rachel doused a cotton swab in nail polish remover and reached for her hand.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Rachel asked.</p> <p>\u201cGreat, how about you? Meet anyone last weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d Rachel returned with a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not getting any younger.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen knew that Rachel had made it her goal to find a husband by age thirty, and her birthday was only a few months away.</p><p>\u201cI read something interesting this week,\u201d Maryellen told her. \u201cIt\u2019s about a town in Ireland named Lisdoonvarna. Every September and the first week of October, eligible men come to town looking for wives. Apparently it\u2019s a tradition that\u2019s been going on for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a joke, right?\u201d Terri asked from across the room.</p><p>\u201cNo, I swear to you this is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do these women come from?\u201d Rachel asked.</p><p>\u201cAll over the world. According to the article, a woman flew all the way from Australia to find a husband\u2014and she did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford to go to Ireland,\u201d Rachel muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, but maybe we could hold our own festival,\u201d Terri suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou could do that,\u201d Maryellen said, wanting to encourage the other women. She didn\u2019t want to get involved herself, but she did hope the crew of Get Nailed would do something with the idea.</p><p>\u201cA Marriage Fest?\u201d Terri\u2019s voice picked up speed with her excitement.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but who\u2019d come?\u201d Rachel asked. \u201cI can see it now. We\u2019d make headlines \u2019cause we\u2019re throwing a party in order to meet potential husbands, and not one man would show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d Terri said with a discouraged sigh.</p><p>\u201cIf I want to get out of a relationship, all I have to do is mention the word marriage and the man drops me like a hot potato.\u201d Rachel frowned as she concentrated on Maryellen\u2019s chipped thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that,\u201d Jane, another tech, added. \u201cMen in America have got it too good.\u201d There was a chorus of agreement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given up on Prince Charming. I\u2019d be happy to meet the guy who grooms his horse,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>Maryellen smiled, and so did petite, blond Jane.</p><p>\u201cActually, forget about the guy grooming the horse,\u201d Rachel went on, \u201cI\u2019d settle for a man who knows how to change the oil in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dated a guy like that once,\u201d Terri told her. \u201cLarry\u2019s head was constantly under the hood of a car. He was far more interested in listening to an engine purr than me. It\u2019s too bad, because he was basically a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you break up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got grease on my white silk blouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke up with a great guy because he ruined your blouse?\u201d</p><p>Terri nodded. \u201cWhat can I say? That blouse cost me seventy bucks, and Larry didn\u2019t seem to think it was any big deal. The way I figure it, if a guy can\u2019t appreciate a seventy-dollar blouse, then I don\u2019t want anything to do with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet a man who has his head screwed on straight when it comes to money,\u201d Jane said. \u201cEveryone I\u2019ve ever dated expects me to pick up the tab because they\u2019re constantly broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met this rich guy once, but he was dead boring,\u201d Jeannie said, leaping into the conversation. \u201cWe dated for three months and I broke up with him because I had more fun washing my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a boring guy over a user any day of the week,\u201d Jane informed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Terri?\u201d Maryellen asked. Terri, who dressed in bold, bright colors, was tall and big-boned, with soulful dark eyes. \u201cWhat kind of man interests you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a man who appreciates good food and isn\u2019t afraid of a woman who likes to eat,\u201d she said without hesitating. \u201cI\u2019m sick of men who want skinny women. I want a man to take me to a fancy restaurant and ask me to order an appetizer and suggest I save room for dessert. Better yet, I\u2019d like a man who did the cooking himself.\u201d She glanced around the shop. \u201cDoes anyone know someone like that?\u201d</p><p>A sudden silence cut off the lively conversation. \u201cWell, actually, I do know someone who cooks,\u201d Maryellen said slowly, thinking of Jon Bowman. \u201cJon\u2019s a chef at a truly wonderful restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you break up with him?\u201d Rachel asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never, uh, actually dated.\u201d Nor would they, despite her curiosity. Maryellen loved Jon\u2019s work and he intrigued her as a person, but her interest in him wasn\u2019t romantic. No men in her life, no matter how attractive: that was her Number One rule. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to introduce you, Terri, if you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d The other woman\u2019s voice lifted with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do next?\u201d Rachel asked, glancing around the shop. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019ve all dated a man who meets someone else\u2019s criteria, which is great but isn\u2019t helping any of us right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could throw a party,\u201d Jeannie said. \u201cSort of drag out our discards for the others to sort through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rummage sale of old lovers,\u201d Terri suggested. Her client laughed, and the other women at the shop joined in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear my black blouse,\u201d Rachel said decisively. \u201cI don\u2019t care if Larry ruins that.\u201d Then, looking at Maryellen, she added in a whisper, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to be picky. My car\u2019s in sad shape.\u201d</p><p>Jane reached for the calendar. \u201cWe could make it a Halloween party,\u201d she announced. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>The immediate consensus was that a Halloween party was a good idea.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll give us a little more than two weeks to come up with some fun ideas. Let\u2019s get this organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount me in.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen wasn\u2019t sure how it happened, but despite her original reluctance, she soon found herself involved.</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to get the guys to come?\u201d Jane, the most practical of the group, asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think Floyd would be interested in dating me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarry could be married for all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk,\u201d Maryellen said. \u201cAnd you need to be up-front with them. Explain to the guy that you\u2019re bringing him to the party as your guest, but he\u2019ll be meeting other women once he gets there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Larry know that someone\u2019s dying to meet him,\u201d Terri said.</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d Rachel sounded absolutely delighted.</p><p>When Maryellen left Get Nailed, her head was spinning. She really hadn\u2019t meant to become part of this scheme, although she\u2019d started the conversation.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how the others planned to handle this, but she certainly wasn\u2019t going to wait for the last minute to mention the party to Jon. When Terri had talked about wanting to meet a man who enjoyed food, he\u2019d come instantly to mind. In retrospect, Maryellen regretted mentioning his name. She didn\u2019t know what had prompted her. It was probably because he\u2019d been in her thoughts ever since their last meeting. This latest group of photographs was some of his best work to date, and she\u2019d been almost sorry they\u2019d sold so quickly.</p><p>Considering that she\u2019d suggested the direct approach to the others, she felt obliged to follow her own advice. She waited a week, and then dialed the phone number listed in her Rolodex.</p><p>Jon answered on the second ring. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, hello, this is Maryellen Sherman.\u201d She hesitated, waiting for some kind of acknowledgment. \u201cThe manager of HarborStreetArtGallery,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d swear he sounded amused, which only served to fluster her more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been invited to a Halloween party,\u201d she said, rushing to explain the reason for her call. \u201cEveryone\u2019s supposed to come with a date\u2014well, not a date exactly. We\u2019ve been asked to bring someone, a man, to introduce to someone else. I have this friend who\u2019s really lovely and she likes to eat.\u201d She grimaced, thinking that sounded kind of dumb, but plunged on anyway. \u201cShe enjoys her food and well, her biggest wish is to meet a man who likes to cook and naturally, I thought of you.\u201d She realized she was rambling and stopped abruptly.</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>\u201cWould you be interested in attending the party?\u201d she finally asked. \u201cYou\u2019d be under no obligation.\u201d She wanted that understood. \u201cBasically, you\u2019d be doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy meeting this friend of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who enjoys a good meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Her name\u2019s Terri, and she\u2019s a lot of fun. I think you\u2019d like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be there?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen sighed. \u201cYes, of course. I\u2019d introduce you to Terri. So\u2014what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I let you know later?\u201d he asked after another long pause.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She figured she should feel encouraged that he hadn\u2019t rejected her outright. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, before you go, did you get a chance to look over my pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, and they\u2019re fabulous! I\u2019ve sold every one of them already. I was hoping you\u2019d be bringing me more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great.\u201d This was by far the longest and most involved conversation of their three-year working relationship.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t come into Andr\u00e9\u2019s,\u201d Jon said. \u201cI was looking forward to cooking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciated the invitation, really I did, but I\u2019m worried about giving you the wrong impression. Like I explained, I\u2019m divorced and I\u2019m not going to remarry and this party is just a friends thing.... If you came, that would be fabulous but only because I want you to meet Terri. Oh, did I mention we\u2019re holding it at The Captain\u2019s Galley, in the bar?\u201d She managed to get all that out in a single breath. \u201cHalloween night,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d</p> <p>Maryellen thought that was fair enough.</p><p>After two glorious days and nights with her husband, Justine no longer had any doubts about her marriage. She was more in love than she\u2019d dreamed possible.</p><p>Flying up to Alaska on the spur of the moment like that, without making any arrangements, had been preposterous, and yet she\u2019d found Seth. Justine considered it a sign. Seth was truly meant to be her husband.</p><p>In a few weeks he\u2019d be home, and they could discuss the future and make the necessary plans for their lives together. There had been so many pressing questions she\u2019d wanted to ask him. But once they were together, none of them had seemed all that important. The only thing that mattered was lying in Seth\u2019s arms, sharing their love.</p><p>Justine vowed that if Seth asked it of her, she\u2019d live aboard his sailboat for the rest of her life. But she suspected he\u2019d probably want to move in with her. Staying in her apartment was more practical than living at the marina.</p><p>She\u2019d told him about sleeping on his boat at her most desperate moments, seeking to feel closer to him. From his reaction, she knew he\u2019d been touched by her fears. He\u2019d kissed her again and again as she described her doubts, all the while whispering reassurances and promises. Justine had left Alaska feeling deeply loved.</p> <p>The following Friday night, Justine dropped by her mother\u2019s house on Lighthouse Road</p><p>. She hadn\u2019t been avoiding Olivia, but she hadn\u2019t sought her out, either.</p><p>By the time Justine pulled up in front of the large two-story house with the wide wraparound veranda, her mother was at the door, waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine! I\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d Olivia said, hugging her tight. \u201cYou haven\u2019t come to the house in ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy\u2014in fact, last weekend I flew up to Alaska to see Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in Alaska? You might\u2019ve let someone know.\u201d The disapproving edge was back, but Justine chose to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I should have,\u201d she agreed mildly. She wasn\u2019t here to fight with her mother.</p> <p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Olivia insisted, wrapping her sweater more snugly around her. \u201cIt\u2019s cool this evening.\u201d</p><p>Justine obediently followed her mother into the house. The kitchen was the most comfortable room and it seemed natural to sit there. \u201cTea?\u201d Olivia asked. It was one of their long-standing rituals.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Her mother turned away as she put water on to boil. \u201cHow is Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. He\u2019ll be home soon. I miss him so much. That\u2019s the reason I flew to Alaska\u2014I just couldn\u2019t stand being so far away from Seth and I had all these air miles from my credit card. I called the airline, got a seat and off I went\u2014without even knowing if I\u2019d find him or not. I was afraid to tell you what I was doing for fear you\u2019d try to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went through all that to be with your husband?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I really am in love with him, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Justine expected this news to be exactly what her mother wanted to hear. Instead Olivia was frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Justine asked.</p><p>Olivia pulled out a chair and sat across from her. \u201cDoes Seth know you had lunch with Warren?\u201d</p><p>So that explained it. Her mother knew. For that matter, so did Seth, and while he hadn\u2019t asked her not to see Warren again, she could tell he wasn\u2019t pleased that she\u2019d accepted his invitation to lunch. Justine had been a bit surprised by that, but she wouldn\u2019t do it again.</p><p>\u201cWarren wants you back, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d her mother said when she didn\u2019t immediately respond.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that Maryellen Sherman and I met for lunch earlier this week?\u201d Justine said, pointedly changing the subject. Warren was off-limits as far as she was concerned. \u201cShe wanted to congratulate Seth and me.\u201d</p><p>Her mother set the bowl of tea bags in the center of the table. \u201cSo you\u2019d prefer not to discuss Warren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Olivia squared her shoulders and nodded firmly. \u201cThen we won\u2019t. Tell me about Seth. When will he be back?\u201d</p><p>Justine filled in the details. The longer she spoke, the more relaxed her mother became\u2014and Justine understood why. Her mother finally had complete confidence in her love for Seth. Olivia now knew that nothing Warren said or did was going to change the way Justine felt about her husband.</p><p>\u201cHow is Maryellen?\u201d Olivia asked as she poured them each a second cup of tea. \u201cI see Grace every week at our aerobics class, but we seldom have a chance to talk.\u201d She laughed. \u201cActually we need all our energy just to breathe. Did Maryellen tell you Grace filed for divorce?\u201d</p><p>Justine nodded. \u201cBy the way, what happened with Maryellen\u2019s marriage?\u201d It\u2019d never occurred to her to ask before. Justine had only been fourteen at the time. All she remembered was her mother and Grace, her best friend, talking on the phone a great deal. Maryellen had moved home for a while, and she\u2019d taken back her maiden name as if she\u2019d never been married at all.</p><p>Her mother stirred a teaspoon of sugar into her tea. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knows, not even Grace. When Maryellen got married, I remember Grace telling me she didn\u2019t feel Clint Jorstad was a good match for her daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently she was right,\u201d Justine said. Then a frightening thought occurred to her. \u201cWhat do you feel about Seth and me?\u201d she asked, raising hopeful eyes to her mother, trusting her judgment and wisdom.</p><p>\u201cOh, Justine, I think the world of Seth. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased for you both. Seth\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>Justine smiled. \u201cI think so, too, Mom, I really do.\u201d For the first time in a while, she thought about her brother. Seth and Jordan were best friends, and then Jordan had drowned the summer they were all thirteen. Seth was in Alaska with his father and hadn\u2019t learned of the accident until he\u2019d returned home. Justine had been with Jordan that dreadful August day. She\u2019d held his lifeless body until the paramedics arrived. He was her twin, her best friend and her brother. Her entire world had changed that summer. Only a few months afterward, her parents had divorced and within a shockingly short time her father had remarried. Her younger brother, James, seemed oblivious to the uprooting of their security, but Justine had felt it all, lived it all.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d her mother asked, a slight frown on her face.</p><p>Justine shook her head. \u201cNothing important,\u201d she said, which wasn\u2019t true. But she didn\u2019t want to bring up the one memory that would never stop hurting. The one death her mother could never recover from. Drinking the last of her tea, she carried the cup and saucer to the sink and said, \u201cI\u2019d better get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming by.\u201d Olivia touched Justine\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled about you and Seth. Honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy, Mom,\u201d Justine said and impulsively hugged her mother. \u201cNext time I won\u2019t wait so long to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Olivia walked her to the porch and waved as Justine drove off.</p><p>When Justine got back to the apartment complex, she found a note from the manager taped to her door; it said she\u2019d accepted a delivery on Justine\u2019s behalf.</p><p>After dropping off her mail, she hurried down to the manager\u2019s office and learned that a huge flower arrangement had arrived. The large crystal vase was filled with an array of carnations, pink lilies, irises and a handful of others she couldn\u2019t name, as well as artful sprigs of greenery. It could only be from Seth.</p><p>Justine could hardly wait to read the card. Seth loved her, missed her, and her sweet, wonderful husband must have realized she\u2019d need an emotional boost to get her through the next few weeks.</p><p>Justine discovered almost immediately how wrong she was. Only one word was written on the card.</p><p>Warren.</p><p>She groaned with disappointment and tossed the small card onto the kitchen counter. She set the vase carelessly on the table, cringing every time she looked at it.</p><p>An hour later, while she was scrounging around her refrigerator, seeking out something easy and edible for dinner, the doorbell rang.</p><p>She answered it to find Warren Saget standing there, wearing a flashy thousand-dollar business suit and an even flashier smile. \u201cHello, Justine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Warren,\u201d she said without enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cDid you get my flowers?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t invite him inside. \u201cI did, but I wish you hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you for having lunch with me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d guessed as much. \u201cIt was very thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes, then stared at the handle on the door. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d If her mother had heard about their lunch date, Justine wondered how many other people in town already knew. She had no intention of adding to the gossip by having Warren\u2019s visit to her apartment reported next.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Warren said, looking hurt and a little confused. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, it\u2019s just that...\u201d She stopped herself from saying more. Warren was far to clever when it came to getting his own way and she wasn\u2019t going to make it any easier.</p><p>He waited for her to continue and when she didn\u2019t, he asked, \u201cDo you have any plans tonight?\u201d</p><p>She certainly wasn\u2019t telling him that the most exciting plan she had was a rerun of Nash Bridges. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d have dinner with me. No pressure. It\u2019s just that I figured you might be lonely with Seth gone for so many weeks. I thought you might enjoy a night on the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, Warren.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNo harm in asking,\u201d he said with a forced smile.</p><p>\u201cActually I think there might be.\u201d</p><p>He arched his eyebrows as if she\u2019d surprised him.</p><p>\u201cThe two of us shouldn\u2019t be seeing each other. It\u2019s...inappropriate. In fact, I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t visit me again\u2014either at work or at my apartment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hurt-little-boy look was back. \u201cJustine, you don\u2019t think I\u2019d purposely do anything to jeopardize your relationship with Seth, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think. I mean it, Warren, stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Warren\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThat big Swedish oaf is jealous.\u201d He laughed, although the sound was humorless.</p><p>She refused to defend Seth or make excuses for him. Her husband was uncomfortable with her seeing Warren and that was the end of it. Her relationship with Warren was over; it had been for a long time, regardless of their recent lunch date. Nothing he said or did was going to change her mind.</p> <p>\u201cThe next thing I know,\u201d he said bitterly, \u201cyou\u2019ll be telling me that big oaf got you pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren, please.\u201d She dragged out his name, implying that this conversation was boring her. \u201cJust go.\u201d She wasn\u2019t willing to stand in the doorway and argue with him. She started to close the door, but Warren\u2019s words stopped her.</p><p>\u201cYou are pregnant, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t you see what he\u2019s doing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it happen, Justine. I\u2019d hoped you\u2019d come to your senses before\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She was through listening and shut the door with a resounding bang.</p><p>Leaning against it, Justine felt weak with relief. He was gone. She\u2019d been an idiot to go out for lunch with him that day. She saw now that it was disloyal to Seth; furthermore, Warren was too competitive to ever be a friend, as she\u2019d naively thought. Not only that, Cedar Cove was a small town, and perceptions mattered. She couldn\u2019t risk humiliating her husband by allowing people to think she was seeing Warren\u2014her supposed former lover\u2014behind his back.</p><p>Warren had brought up an interesting point, though. Pregnancy. Shortly after Jordan\u2019s death and her parents\u2019 divorce, Justine had decided she didn\u2019t want children. But now that she was married, she realized her views had changed. She could only hope Seth felt the same way.</p><p>Jack Griffin slapped cologne on his freshly shaved cheeks and blinked at the sting. He caught his reflection in the spotted and foggy mirror and wiggled his eyebrows a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d he said aloud, reminding himself that this could very well be the evening he lured Olivia Lockhart into his bed. Their relationship had been progressing nicely\u2014very nicely. But they were both mature adults, and with those years had come a certain...patience. A kind of caution. They weren\u2019t twenty-year-olds at the mercy of their hormones. Still, he was a man in every sense of the word, and he\u2019d like nothing better than to take their relationship to a physical level. Beyond kissing and cuddling...He was ready to make the leap and hoped she agreed.</p><p>The divorced family court judge wasn\u2019t like other women he\u2019d known. Olivia had class and culture, and he was a no-account drunk who remained sober one day at a time.</p> <p>Grace Sherman had told him about Olivia\u2019s upcoming birthday and he was grateful. This was exactly the occasion he\u2019d been looking for, a chance to show her exactly how much he cared. Jack had searched long and hard for the perfect birthday gift. His quest had been to find something that would let her know the message of his heart. Something that suited a woman who was both sophisticated and unpretentious. The diamond tennis bracelet was it.</p><p>Choosing a clean shirt, he reached for the gray velvet box and examined the bracelet. It was stunning, if he said so himself. He\u2019d never bought anything as beautiful as this, not even for his ex-wife. The jeweler had sold him on the quality, and had then shaved off an extra ten per cent when Jack showed more than idle interest. Nothing wrong with being practical, he figured. The extra cash would go toward a fancy dinner at The Captain\u2019s Galley. He enjoyed imagining Olivia\u2019s reaction when she opened the box. Twice now he\u2019d wrapped it, and then because he wanted to be assured it was as lovely as he remembered, he\u2019d unwrapped it just to take another peek.</p><p>Whistling, Jack finished dressing. Tonight, he said again, his blood already heating at the thought of Olivia lying in his arms.</p><p>A sound came from the direction of his living room and he stuck his head outside the bedroom door. \u201cAnyone here?\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>Jack frowned, then checked his reflection one last time.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>Jack froze. Eric was here? Now?</p> <p>\u201cEric?\u201d Jack stepped out of the bedroom to find his twenty-six-year-old son standing in the middle of his living room, a suitcase in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou were on your way out?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not expected for a while,\u201d Jack assured him. The boy looked dreadful, his complexion pale with pain. His shoulders were hunched and his misery was evident in every line of his body. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Eric shrugged.</p><p>Experience had taught him that only a woman was capable of bringing a man to this point. \u201cDid you and Shelly have a fight?\u201d</p><p>Eric\u2019s returning snort was devoid of humor. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at the suitcase in his son\u2019s hand, he assumed this was more than the usual disagreement. \u201cShe kicked you out?\u201d</p><p>Eric nodded.</p><p>His son slumped onto the sofa and gazed pleadingly up at Jack. \u201cDo you have time to talk, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s relationship with his son was tenuous at best. For almost his entire life, Eric had lived with his mother. Even after Jack became sober, Eric had rejected every effort he\u2019d made to establish a relationship. This year, this past spring, was the first time Eric had agreed to see Jack. Afraid he might inadvertently say or do something to distress his son, Jack had invited Olivia along for the initial meeting. They\u2019d all had dinner on the Seattle waterfront. Buoyed by the success of that outing, Jack and Eric had gotten together every month or so since.</p><p>Jack was thrilled with the prospect of having a good relationship with his only child. He had a lot to prove, both to Eric and himself. He didn\u2019t want anything to injure this fragile beginning.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have time. Tell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d Jack sat down across from his son, leaning forward so Eric would know he was interested and that he cared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Shelly and her pregnancy,\u201d Eric murmured.</p><p>That much Jack had guessed, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cThe baby can\u2019t be mine. I told her that and she blew up at me. She said if I seriously think she\u2019s pregnant by someone else, then I should get out of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d Jack murmured. \u201cWomen say things like that when they\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe meant it enough to throw me out of the apartment.\u201d</p><p>So much for that pearl of wisdom, Jack mused. He cursed himself for not being better at this.</p><p>Eric looked as if he was about to weep. \u201cShe said she never wanted to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mean that, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she did when she said it, but she\u2019ll have a change of heart later.\u201d Jack winced at his own glibness. \u201cSoon,\u201d he added. \u201cShe\u2019ll ask you to come home soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she does,\u201d Eric said emphatically. \u201cThe apartment\u2019s leased in my name,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want her to move. She can have the apartment if she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Where will you go?\u201d</p><p>Eric hesitated, then glanced up. \u201cWould you mind very much if I stayed here with you? Just for the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jack echoed, and was instantly sorry. \u201cMe\u2014well, I guess we won\u2019t get in each other\u2019s way too much, if it\u2019s only for a few days.\u201d So much for romantic evenings with Olivia anytime in the near future.</p><p>\u201cIt probably won\u2019t be for long.\u201d Eric sounded hopeful.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Jack said, his voice as confident as he could manage. \u201cMy guess is that Shelly will call tomorrow, wanting you to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Eric\u2019s eyes brightened.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>Eric shook his head, his expression grim. \u201cI doubt it, Dad. First of all, I didn\u2019t tell her I was coming here and secondly...\u201d He paused and rubbed his face. \u201cDo you think the doctors might\u2019ve made a mistake about me?\u201d The appeal in his eyes was painful to see.</p><p>\u201cYou mean about being able to father children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is there any chance?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cIt was a lot of years ago. There are ways of finding out about these things, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Shelly says...\u201d He sighed deeply. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t suspect her of being with another man, but a little while ago she mentioned this new guy she\u2019s working with and they seemed to be real buddy-buddy. They were doing a lot of overtime together\u2014and now she turns up pregnant. What else am I supposed to believe?\u201d</p><p>Jack glanced at his watch. Olivia was expecting him to pick her up in five minutes.</p><p>\u201cYou have somewhere to go, don\u2019t you?\u201d Eric asked. \u201cYou should leave,\u201d he urged, but if anything, he sounded worse than when he\u2019d first arrived.</p><p>\u201cLet me see what I can do,\u201d Jack said, his own heart sinking fast. He couldn\u2019t leave Eric like this. The boy was hurting and needed to talk. For so many years, he hadn\u2019t been any kind of father to his son, and he wasn\u2019t about to fail Eric again.</p><p>\u201cLet me call Olivia,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Disheartened, Jack sequestered himself in his bedroom and dialed Olivia\u2019s number.</p><p>She answered almost immediately, and seemed surprised to hear from him.</p><p>\u201cI have to break our date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur date tonight?\u201d She sounded as disappointed as he was.</p><p>\u201cEric\u2019s here,\u201d Jack explained.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelly kicked him out and he came to me. He needs to talk. And he may end up staying here for a few days.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI hate to do this to you, but you understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m sorry about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Mom and keep the reservation. I\u2019d rather have dinner with you, but I understand. Children\u2014regardless of their age\u2014always need to come first. You know how strongly I believe that. Thanks for telling me, Jack, and good luck.\u201d</p><p>Jack understood that she was praising his effort to communicate with his son\u2014and with her. The one thing Olivia hated above all else was secrets, a lesson he\u2019d learned early on in their relationship when he\u2019d tried to hide the fact that he was a recovering alcoholic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Jack repeated and then because he\u2019d almost forgotten, he added, \u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cDo you have plans for tonight?\u201d Grace phoned to ask Olivia late Friday afternoon, the following week. It was a clear, crisp day toward the end of October, and Olivia had been waiting to hear from Jack ever since his phone call on her birthday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlans? I wish...\u201d Olivia said. \u201cDo you have any suggestions?\u201d she asked with a little more enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHow about taking in a football game?\u201d Grace said. \u201cWe could go to dinner afterward. It\u2019s been ages since we had a chance to catch up.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was delighted that Grace had called her. During the months since Dan\u2019s disappearance, Grace had closed herself off from almost everyone. She\u2019d kept her conversations brief and superficial, clearly unwilling to disturb the bedrock of pain and grief that had become the basis of her life. Again and again she\u2019d found excuses to postpone visits or social plans. Olivia was concerned, but she respected her friend\u2019s need for privacy. It was no reflection on their long and very solid friendship. Grace was dealing with the loss of her marriage. Olivia stood by her, encouraged her with notes and cards and called frequently, just to maintain communication and to let Grace know she was there. This was the first time in a long while that Grace had called her to suggest an outing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to take in a game,\u201d Olivia told her friend.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you would,\u201d Grace said. \u201cHave you heard from Jack yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Grace had that right. Olivia was tired of making excuses for him, even in her own mind. He\u2019d been absent from her life all week. He hadn\u2019t called once. Nor had he shown up for their usual Tuesday night get-together. She couldn\u2019t help being disappointed that he\u2019d had to break their date on Saturday; she certainly understood. But at the same time she\u2019d hoped he would, at the very least, leave a brief message telling her how Eric was doing\u2014and maybe saying he missed her. He could\u2019ve called to make a tentative plan for next week or even the week after that. Instead, he\u2019d ignored her.</p><p>\u201cMeet me at the football field at seven,\u201d Grace said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was grateful to have somewhere to go and something to do. Especially with her best friend, who seemed to be emerging from her self-imposed isolation. Her social life had revolved around Jack for months. Almost always, they spent part of a weekend together.</p><p>At seven o\u2019clock, Olivia met Grace just outside the chain-link fence at CedarCoveHigh School\u2019s football stadium. The field was ablaze with lights and the stands on both sides of the field were quickly filling up. Grace had dressed in gray wool slacks with a blue-and-green plaid wool jacket. She wore her thick salt-and-pepper hair shorter these days, and it suited her. Dan had always preferred a shoulder-length style, reminiscent of her high-school appearance, but Grace didn\u2019t need to please Dan anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Olivia commented as they stood in line to purchase their tickets.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. The only thing you ever see me in these days is my sweats for aerobics class.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled because it was all too true.</p> <p>\u201cRemember in high school when we used to come and cheer on the team?\u201d Grace asked as the line moved slowly toward the ticket counter.</p><p>\u201cDo I ever. Bob Beldon and Dan were our football heroes\u2014\u201d Olivia paused. She regretted bringing Dan\u2019s name into the conversation.</p><p>Grace touched her arm. \u201cI was thinking the same thing. Dan was a wonderful athlete when he was young. I still remember the year he scored the winning touchdown that put Cedar Cove in the playoffs for the first time in a decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Olivia said, glancing at her friend. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to talk about Dan?\u201d</p><p>Grace gazed into the distance. \u201cNot really. But it\u2019s easier to think about the early years, before Vietnam.\u201d She was silent for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he left me the way he did. I\u2019ve gone over it a thousand times and can\u2019t come up with an answer. I just don\u2019t understand how he could do this. I realize I might never know. All I can say is that this was his choice. I have my own choices to make, and I need to move forward with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were a strong woman,\u201d Olivia said, not hiding her admiration, \u201cbut you\u2019re stronger now than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish that was true,\u201d Grace murmured and then she changed the subject, looking up at the night sky. \u201cI love this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d The weather in the Pacific Northwest had taken a decided turn in the last couple of weeks. Soon the autumn rains would start, and the clear bright evenings would become storms of wind mingled with a steady drizzle.</p> <p>After paying for their tickets, they purchased a program from one of the drill team members hawking the small booklets just inside the field. Making their way toward the stands, Olivia paused to see what seats were still available.</p><p>\u201cOlivia! Grace!\u201d Charlotte\u2019s voice rang out from the home field section.</p><p>Olivia glanced around until she found her mother waving her right arm high above her head. Charlotte sat next to Cliff Harding about halfway up. Her lap was draped with a small red quilt and Cliff was wearing a fringed leather jacket and his ever-present cowboy hat.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind sitting with Mom?\u201d Olivia asked, although her real question had to do with Cliff Harding.</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s fine.\u201d Grace\u2019s eyes were on Cliff and she gave a slow smile.</p><p>Now, that was an interesting development, Olivia mused as they climbed the steps.</p><p>Olivia hugged Charlotte as she edged past her mother. Moving down, she left plenty of room for Grace. Cliff sat on the outside of the row, closest to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pleasant surprise to run into you two,\u201d Charlotte said, sounding positively delighted. \u201cCliff\u2019s never been to a Cedar Cove football game. My column in the newspaper this week was about supporting our youth, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read it, Mom, and it was a great piece.\u201d Her mom derived real pleasure from writing the Seniors\u2019 Page for the Chronicle.</p><p>\u201cCliff read it, too, and I told him he\u2019d never be part of the community until he\u2019s cheered for our football team.\u201d</p><p>Cliff was studying the program and seemed impressed with all the community advertisement that supported the team. \u201cThe last time I was at a high school football game was when I was in high school myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis town takes its football seriously,\u201d Olivia told him.</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d The game was about to start and there was standing room only. In addition to the football team itself, the school band, the cheerleading squad and drill team were all present.</p><p>\u201cDo you two have plans for after the game?\u201d Cliff asked, but Olivia noticed that he directed the question at Grace.</p><p>\u201cOlivia and I are going to dinner,\u201d Grace explained.</p><p>\u201cCliff invited me out, as well,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two join us?\u201d She glanced from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cSure, that sounds like fun,\u201d Olivia said. From Grace\u2019s reaction to seeing Cliff, she knew her friend wouldn\u2019t object.</p><p>The game was close, and at halftime the score was tied. Olivia was, once again, amazed by how many people her mother knew. Not a moment passed without Charlotte calling out to one person or another. Her weekly column had increased her recognition among the townspeople, and she was obviously well-loved for her charitable activities, including her volunteer work at the local convalescent center where she\u2019d met Tom Harding.</p><p>Cedar CoveHigh School won in the last five seconds with a field goal. The mood was festive as the stadium emptied. Since the PancakePalace would definitely be crowded after the win, Cliff suggested The Captain\u2019s Galley in the downtown area.</p><p>They met there and were quickly escorted to a table for four. Olivia noticed that Cecilia Randall still held the position of hostess, but there wasn\u2019t time to chat with the young Navy wife. Once they were seated, conversation was light and flowed smoothly both before and after they ordered.</p><p>Try as she might, Olivia found her thoughts wandering to Jack, and that distracted her. Without being obvious, she\u2019d searched for him throughout the game. He generally wrote the sports articles for the high school teams, simply because he loved going to the games. Olivia had given up counting the number of sporting events they\u2019d attended together. But if he was at the game tonight, she hadn\u2019t seen him.</p><p>Of course, she could phone him. They weren\u2019t fighting, although she had to wonder why he hadn\u2019t called her. Perhaps Eric was still with him, but his son couldn\u2019t possibly take up every minute of Jack\u2019s time. Olivia was getting downright irritated.</p><p>Conversation ceased as their meals arrived and then it resumed. They\u2019d moved from the football game to the state of the local economy. Olivia added a comment every now and then as she nibbled at her crab salad, but her spirits weren\u2019t high and she struggled to keep her thoughts away from Jack.</p><p>Even though she\u2019d dated occasionally since her divorce, she hadn\u2019t gotten close to another man the way she had with Jack. Because their personalities and backgrounds were so different, he brought balance and spontaneity to her rigid schedule. With him she was free to laugh and shed the formality that had taken over her life after she was elected to the bench. Jack was unconventional, witty, fun\u2014and, damn it all, she missed him.</p><p>The bill came, and before anyone could argue, Cliff reached for it. \u201cMy treat, ladies,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Olivia objected. She\u2019d never have agreed to join them if she\u2019d known Cliff was buying. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey, how often does a man get the chance to be seen with three beautiful women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is very thoughtful of you,\u201d Charlotte said and patted his hand, sending Olivia a sharp glance. Sighing, Olivia decided to accept graciously and murmured her thanks.</p><p>Grace chuckled. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not using my credit card?\u201d</p><p>They all laughed and after savoring the last of their coffee, they parted for the night.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Grace asked as they strolled to the parking lot next to the library. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet all evening.\u201d Olivia had hoped for a few minutes to speak privately to Grace, but with her mother and Cliff present that hadn\u2019t been possible.</p><p>\u201cWho can get a word in edgewise with my mother?\u201d Olivia joked.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay between you and Jack?\u201d How like Grace to care about her friend\u2019s petty concerns when she was the one whose life was in upheaval.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Olivia told her, and then added. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>They parted with promises to talk soon, and Olivia drove home. As she walked into the hallway, she saw that the message light on her answering machine was flashing. She stared down at it for a few hopeful seconds. Pressing the button, she waited and was rewarded by the craggy sound of Jack\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, hi. Sorry I haven\u2019t been in touch lately, but I\u2019ve had my hands full with Eric. I was hoping you\u2019d be home so we could talk. You\u2019re not out with some other guy, are you?\u201d There was a forced laugh. \u201cListen, I\u2019m really sorry about last week, but I hope to make it up to you. Phone me back, all right? I\u2019ve got a special birthday gift for you. Can we get together soon?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia checked her watch. It was close to eleven and too late to return his call. Anyway, he\u2019d kept her waiting all week; she\u2019d keep him guessing until morning. As she readied for bed, Olivia was smiling.</p><p>Maryellen wanted to kick herself for coming up with this ridiculous \u201cswap meet for men\u201d idea. It\u2019d all started out innocently enough with her mentioning the article she\u2019d read about that town in Ireland. Next thing she knew, she was part of the party-planning. By her following nail appointment, this Halloween get-together had gathered momentum to the point that she\u2019d lost count of how many people were attending.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still bringing that chef friend of yours, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Terri asked. Maryellen had barely sat down when Terri started grilling her with questions she couldn\u2019t answer about Jon.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, he\u2019s just a friend\u2014no,\u201d she amended. \u201cJon\u2019s more of a business acquaintance. And he hasn\u2019t given me an answer yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Terri sounded disappointed. \u201cSo you don\u2019t know if he\u2019s coming or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d She hadn\u2019t talked to him since that initial conversation a week ago. \u201cIf he\u2019s not there, I\u2019ll make sure you get introduced some other time.\u201d</p><p>Terri\u2019s dark eyes lit up. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>The following evening\u2014Halloween night\u2014Maryellen stood in the darkest, creepiest corner of the decorated bar with a fake spider dangling from the ceiling directly above her. More than ever, she felt convinced that this had all been a mistake. The room was crowded with maybe a hundred men and women, some in costume, some not.</p><p>Then without warning, without her seeing him arrive, Jon was standing next to her. He held a frosty mug of beer. \u201cHi,\u201d he said, looking out over the crowded room.</p> <p>\u201cYou came.\u201d Now that was brilliant. Nothing like stating the obvious. \u201cI mean...you didn\u2019t call me back and when I didn\u2019t hear, I assumed you wouldn\u2019t show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve phoned, but I wanted to make sure I could get the evening off first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right\u2014don\u2019t apologize.\u201d He hadn\u2019t but...</p><p>\u201cBetween the restaurant and my photography, I\u2019ve been working a lot of hours. Sometimes I lose track of time.\u201d</p><p>An artist\u2019s working habits weren\u2019t new to Maryellen. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of beer. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d Then, glancing around the room, she saw Terri, who\u2019d dressed as Cleopatra complete with heavy eye makeup and black wig. \u201cThere\u2019s the woman I wanted you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jon said, following as she wove her way through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cTerri,\u201d Maryellen said, interrupting the other woman\u2019s conversation with someone\u2014male or female?\u2014dressed as a wizard in voluminous robes. \u201cThis is Jon, the man I was telling you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Jon,\u201d Terri returned, as though she\u2019d waited her entire life for precisely this moment. The wizard, having lost her attention, drifted off.</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you, Terri,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re a chef.\u201d Terri edged closer to him, and Maryellen could see she\u2019d already had more than enough to drink. She bit her lip, wanting to suggest that it might be best if they talked another time. \u201cI know my way around a kitchen, too. Want to stir up something together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be interesting.\u201d Jon took another sip of beer, and Maryellen could see he was trying hard to disguise a smile.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen said you also take pictures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do a little of that on the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Jon\u2019s a brilliant photographer,\u201d Maryellen rushed to explain, mortified at what he must think.</p><p>Trying not to be conspicuous about it, she wandered away and eventually returned to her protective corner. She wasn\u2019t there long before Jon joined her.</p><p>\u201cSo, Terri\u2019s the woman you wanted to set me up with?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done something you regret?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is one of those situations.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but didn\u2019t respond, and they stood in silence for a few minutes.</p><p>Someone put a bunch of quarters in the jukebox, and the music started. Several couples formed an impromptu dance floor. Jon made a sweeping gesture. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t give her a chance to object. He put his beer aside and gently pulled her into his arms.</p><p>He felt strong and solid against her, but Maryellen was having none of it. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should,\u201d she said, her posture rigid. She didn\u2019t want Jon to hold her, didn\u2019t want this relationship to be anything but professional. Yet she recognized that she\u2019d broken her own rule in calling him, inviting him here\u2014in acknowledging her attraction to Jon Bowman.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered close to her ear.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Jon, I\u2019m serious, this isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne dance,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay? Think of it as your penance for setting me up with your friend.\u201d</p><p>Refusing would be ungracious. \u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed, but reluctantly. She tried to keep her distance, although it was difficult with Jon\u2019s arms around her, urging her closer. The song was that slow-dance classic, \u201cCherish,\u201d and she couldn\u2019t help feeling affected. If Jon wasn\u2019t so gentle and warm and considerate, it would\u2019ve been easier to maintain her reserve. She began to relax in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cBetter, much better,\u201d he whispered, leading her across the floor. He stroked her back in a slow circular motion that was doing crazy things to her pulse. The music ended long before she was ready to stop.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad, now was it?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>She blinked up at him, not realizing she\u2019d closed her eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d It was scary and wonderful, both at once. She didn\u2019t want to feel any of this. Warning bells were clanging in her head. Nevertheless, when the next song started\u2014even before he asked\u2014she slipped her arms around his neck and swayed toward him.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t say anything, but she could feel his smile. To her own amazement, she was smiling, too.</p><p>They danced for what seemed like hours, danced to song after song. They didn\u2019t talk, but the communication between them was unmistakable. The way he held her close told her he\u2019d been interested in her for some time. And the way she responded to his touch told him she found his work brilliant and beautiful, and that he intrigued her\u2014as an artist and a man.</p><p>She wanted to know why he answered every question with a question. Did he have secrets? She suspected he must. After all, she had her own. Secrets that had remained buried since the early days of her marriage. No one knew, not even her mother. Not her sister. No one. Perhaps it was this that drew them together. Perhaps this was what he sensed in her and she felt in him. Of one thing Maryellen was sure. Secrets could be dangerous.</p><p>The Halloween party was breaking up and Jon suggested he walk her to her car. Maryellen agreed. Knowing that parking would be scarce, she\u2019d used her space behind the art gallery. It would be dark and deserted, and she was glad Jon had offered to escort her.</p><p>\u201cI had a good time,\u201d he told her as they entered the alley.</p><p>\u201cI did, too.\u201d Darkness swallowed them up no more than two feet from the street.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you for wanting to pawn me off on your friend.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s face instantly went hot, and she felt grateful there wasn\u2019t enough light for Jon to notice. \u201cThat was all a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>As she fumbled in her purse for her car keys, Jon stopped her. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to know you better for years,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>Maryellen couldn\u2019t have muttered a word had the fate of the world depended on her reply. She envisioned herself thanking him in a flippant, matter-of-fact way, then whirling around and unlocking her car door. Instead she stood rooted to the spot, staring up at him. He was going to kiss her. That couldn\u2019t happen; she simply couldn\u2019t allow it. Yet, all the while objection after objection marched through her mind, she found herself slowly\u2014against every rational dictate\u2014leaning toward him. Her head was raised, her eyes half-closed.</p><p>When his lips met hers, it wasn\u2019t the slow, seductive kiss she\u2019d anticipated. Jon lifted her from the pavement until she stood on the very tips of her toes. His mouth was hungry, urgent, needy as his lips seduced hers. She tasted his passion as his tongue swept her mouth and swallowed his moan as it went on and on and on until she was sure she\u2019d faint.</p><p>No man, not even her husband, had kissed her so thoroughly, so passionately. When he broke it off, Maryellen was breathless and speechless. Had he released her, she would\u2019ve crumpled into a heap on the ground.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d When she could manage to speak, these were the first words that emerged.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>\u201cOh...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ego\u2019s taking something of a bruising here. Can\u2019t you do better than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d She gave herself a moment to gather her composure. \u201cThat was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty damn wonderful if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...it was.\u201d Maryellen couldn\u2019t begin to explain to him why this was such a mistake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that all evening,\u201d he said in a satisfied tone.</p><p>Arms dangling at her sides, Maryellen slumped against her car. It was still hard to breathe, and for some reason, she felt as if she was about to cry. \u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk,\u201d Jon promised, kissing her again. She\u2019d been half expecting it, and even though she was prepared this time, his touch devastated her, left her gasping with shock and pleasure.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he said as he eased his lips from hers. \u201cAll right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed hoarsely, although she couldn\u2019t recall what was going to happen \u201csoon.\u201d</p><p>Once secure and inside her car, she placed her hands on the steering wheel. She was trembling so badly she found it impossible to insert the key into the ignition. What had she done? What had she unleashed on them both?</p><p>Dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt, Grace started outside to look around the house and garage. She couldn\u2019t delay winterizing her home any longer. Dan had always taken care of such chores; now, for the first time in her marriage, Grace would need to complete these unfamiliar tasks herself.</p><p>Thankfully, her son-in-law had stepped in whenever she\u2019d required help. He\u2019d shown her how to change the furnace filter, fixed a leaking faucet and repaired the dryer, but Grace couldn\u2019t continue to rely on Paul, dear as he was. She had to learn to cope with these situations on her own.</p><p>The first thing she did was stare at the open garage door. For the last two weeks, the automatic door had refused to budge. Grace had managed to open it manually, but last evening it had stuck in the open position. It needed to be fixed before someone saw it as an invitation to rob her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing in front of the garage, wearing Dan\u2019s oversized gloves, hands on hips, Grace regarded the garage door like a dragon ready to roar down sulfur and fire upon her.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip,\u201d she muttered under her breath. \u201cYou can do this. You\u2019ve done everything else\u2014you can tackle a garage door, too.\u201d Okay, first she had to find the manual and the necessary tools. Dan was always so proud of his workbench. He had every gadget imaginable. Yet he hadn\u2019t taken a single one with him when he walked away. Like everything else about his disappearance, this baffled her.</p><p>Was this other woman so incredible, so amazing, that she provided for his every need? Or did the things that used to matter to him no longer mean anything? He\u2019d left behind his clothes, his tools, even his wedding band. He\u2019d taken nothing more than the clothes on his back.</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d find the manual. She thought Dan kept his various instruction books in a box somewhere in the garage. She saw a stack of boxes piled beneath the workbench; she slid the top one out. Kneeling on the concrete floor, she opened the lid. Instead of the manual, she found the thick woolen shirt she\u2019d bought him last Christmas. She lifted it and gasped. The shirt had been shredded. It looked as though Dan had taken a pair of scissors to it and systematically cut the fifty-dollar shirt into strips. All that remained intact was the collar and cuffs.</p> <p>Grace remembered asking Dan about the shirt, remembered him telling her it was his favorite, but she\u2019d never seen him wear it. After a while, it had completely slipped her mind.</p><p>Another box revealed a second ugly surprise. Kelly had given Dan a highly touted book on World War II for his birthday. He\u2019d thanked her profusely and said he\u2019d read it. But he hadn\u2019t. Instead it, too, had been destroyed, the pages ripped from the binding. Grace discovered two more boxes of his carnage. It was as though he\u2019d planted them there for her to find. Dan couldn\u2019t have shouted his hate more loudly had he been standing directly in front of her.</p><p>Shaken to the core, Grace discarded the boxes in the garbage and sat down on the back porch steps. Her first reaction was anger. How dare he do such a thing. How dare he! Then she felt the overwhelming urge to weep. Tears stung her eyes, but she refused to give in to them. She refused to hand her husband the power to reduce her to a sniveling, spineless weakling.</p><p>Buttercup joined her and seemed to sense Grace\u2019s distress.</p><p>\u201cWhat would make him do this?\u201d she asked her golden retriever.</p> <p>Buttercup looked up at her with big, soulful eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either, girl. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d Needing to hold someone, Grace put her arms around the dog\u2019s neck and buried her face in Buttercup\u2019s fur.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long she sat there, feeling intense anger, regret and simmering emotion. After a while she got to her feet. The garage door wasn\u2019t going to fix itself.</p><p>In the process of digging through the neat stack of boxes, she eventually happened upon the manual. She flipped through it and quickly read over the information. The book offered suggestions for troubleshooting, which she studied in detail. Again and again she reminded herself that she could handle this.</p><p>She\u2019d just positioned the stepladder when a pickup truck pulled into the driveway. Grace recognized Cliff and hesitated, her feet on the fourth rung up.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he called, climbing out of the truck. Buttercup trotted over to greet him. While friendly, the golden retriever was protective of Grace and wasn\u2019t keen on letting strangers into the yard. To Grace\u2019s surprise, Buttercup greeted Cliff as if he were family.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, wishing now that she\u2019d worn a newer pair of jeans and a less faded sweatshirt.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte mentioned that you had a problem with your garage door,\u201d he said, bending down to scratch her dog\u2019s ears.</p><p>Grace blinked, unsure how Olivia\u2019s mother had known about her problem, but then Charlotte always did have a way of finding out things.</p><p>Cliff straightened and seemed to await her invitation. \u201cI came to see if I could give you a hand.\u201d</p><p>At this point, Grace wasn\u2019t about to refuse help. \u201cI\u2019d be grateful if you\u2019d look at it. I\u2019ve been reading the manual but I haven\u2019t had a chance to check out the mechanism yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a knack for stuff like this.\u201d He glanced around. \u201cI\u2019m gifted at cleaning leaves out of rain gutters, too.\u201d</p><p>Grace laughed. \u201cYou must be an angel in disguise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He helped her down from the ladder and even before Grace could get inside the house to brew a pot of coffee, he had the garage door working again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was wrong?\u201d she asked, astonished that it had been so easy.</p><p>\u201cThe wheels jumped out of alignment. I just put it back on track. Nothing to it.\u201d</p><p>While Cliff carried the ladder over to the house, Grace reached for the rake and started gathering together a huge pile of oak leaves. When she\u2019d finished, Cliff helped her pack them inside plastic bags.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for that coffee?\u201d she asked, when they\u2019d tied the last bag.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>She welcomed him into her kitchen and set out two big mugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d</p><p>He studied her a moment, then grinned boyishly. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you will.\u201d Grace laughed\u2014and suddenly realized that just a couple of hours earlier, she\u2019d been fighting back tears. The contrast was all the more apparent when she saw the way Buttercup had warmed to Cliff.</p><p>\u201cButtercup normally isn\u2019t friendly with strangers,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Cliff petted the dog. \u201cShe probably smells the horses.\u201d</p><p>Grace propped elbows on the table. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten you raise quarter horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a big part of my life. Do you ride?\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t been around horses much.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for a while, the ebb and flow of their conversation completely natural. Rarely had Grace felt more at ease with a man. More than once, she had to remind herself that legally she was still married to Dan. While he might have run off with another woman\u2014or at any rate, run off\u2014she intended to remain true to her vows.</p><p>As he was getting ready to leave, Grace saw Cliff glance toward the living room. A framed family photograph stood on a bookshelf. \u201cThat\u2019s Dan?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Cliff walked over to the bookcase and picked up the photograph, which had been taken almost twenty years earlier. Both girls were teenagers then, and Kelly was in braces. Dan\u2019s gaze had been somber as he stared straight into the camera, not revealing any emotion.</p><p>After an extraordinarily long moment, Cliff replaced the faded color photograph.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he left,\u201d Grace whispered. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Cliff didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the not knowing that\u2019s dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed tightly.</p><p>He brushed the hair from her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel guilty about me being here this afternoon. This wasn\u2019t a date.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled tremulously.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to suffer pangs of remorse, then you should worry about how much I want to take you in my arms right now. If you\u2019re going to feel guilty, then do it because I\u2019m having one hell of a time not kissing you.\u201d</p><p>Grace closed her eyes, knowing that if she looked at him, Cliff would realize it was what she wanted, too.</p><p>Sighing, he stroked her cheek with his knuckle before he turned away.</p><p>Eyes still shut, she heard him open the door and leave.</p><p>Six</p><p>Janice Lamond had been a valuable addition to Zach Cox\u2019s office staff. She\u2019d taken on more and more duties and had developed an excellent rapport with his clients. He appreciated her attitude and her strong work ethic. When it was time for her six-month evaluation, Zach called her into his office.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Janice,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the chair across from his desk.</p><p>Janice sat on the edge of the chair and met his look with a tentative smile, almost as if she were nervous about what he might say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been with the firm half a year now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it really been that long?\u201d</p><p>It felt as though she\u2019d always been part of his office team. She was well-liked and fit in smoothly with the firm\u2019s other employees. Eager to please, she wasn\u2019t quick to rush out the door at the end of the day. He appreciated the effort she took to make the clients who visited the office feel welcome.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, we review employee performance twice a year.\u201d</p><p>Janice squeezed her hands between her knees. \u201cIs there an area where I can improve?\u201d she asked.</p><p>If there was, Zach didn\u2019t know what it would be. She was about as perfect an employee as he could find. \u201cNo, no. You\u2019ve done an excellent job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her eyes shone at his praise. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to come into work each day. I like my job.\u201d</p><p>She made it a pleasure for Zach to come into the office, too. Janice was organized. Her desk was orderly and she kept his appointments running like clockwork. When he arrived at the office in the morning, Janice was there to greet him, the coffee was made and the mail was on his desk. It was a stark contrast to his life at home. With so many committee appointments, Rosie often left the dinner dishes on the table or stacked in the sink overnight. The house was a continual mess, and even the most mundane tasks just never seemed to get accomplished. Still, Rosie was his wife and he loved her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to give you a ten-percent raise,\u201d Zach told Janice. \u201cThe other partners are in agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen percent?\u201d she repeated as if she\u2019d misunderstood him. \u201cAfter just six months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that if we want to keep good employees, we need to compensate them adequately. We\u2019re happy with your work here at Smith, Cox and Jefferson. We hope that you\u2019ll be part of our team for many years to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that very much.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t have anything more to add. He stood, and Janice did, too. He walked her to his office door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who should be thanking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ten-percent raise,\u201d she added excitedly, covering her mouth with both hands. \u201cThis is just great.\u201d</p><p>Before he could react, Janice threw her arms around his neck and gave him a hug. As soon as she realized what she\u2019d done, she blushed and hurriedly left. Zach figured it was just an impulsive gesture from a warm, emotionally generous woman.</p><p>But Zach enjoyed that little hug, and found himself smiling for the next few minutes.</p><p>At five-thirty, when the workday was technically over, he remained behind to finish up some paperwork. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to get home these days. Rosie was generally busy with some volunteer project or other, and Allison and Eddie were involved with their own friends and activities. Janice was closing down her computer as he walked out of his office at six o\u2019clock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were still here,\u201d he said, glancing at his watch.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to review these numbers one last time before I put the Mullens Company report in the mail.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. It was exactly this attention to detail that had earned her the raise. \u201cGood night, Janice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Mr. Cox, and thank you again.\u201d</p> <p>As Zach turned off Lighthouse Road</p><p>and headed toward Pelican Court</p><p>, the smile left him. It was doubtful Rosie would have dinner ready. In all likelihood, she was preparing for some function outside the house. She never seemed to plan ahead for such events, and as a result she went into panic mode, shoving something that passed for dinner onto the table. Most likely, the meal would consist of some packaged crap she\u2019d bought at the grocery store, something that could be slapped together without any effort. Some nights she brought home dinner from the deli. There was nothing he liked less than Chinese food that had been sitting under lights all afternoon. The deli-roasted chicken wasn\u2019t half-bad, but he was as tired of that as he was of pizza.</p><p>Zach parked the car in the garage and loosened his tie as he entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Rosie said, rushing to place silverware in the center of the table. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we having?\u201d</p><p>She reached for a container on top of the garbage can and read the label aloud. \u201cLasagna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it cooked all the way through this time?\u201d The last entr\u00e9e she\u2019d served was still frozen in the middle.</p><p>\u201cIt should be. I had it in the microwave for twenty minutes.\u201d Then without a pause, she turned her head and yelled for the kids. \u201cDinner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you this morning I have my book club tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you read the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has time? But I want to hear what everyone else has to say.\u201d There was a decided edge to her voice, as though she disapproved of him questioning her about her activities.</p><p>Zach picked up the mail and sorted through it. He stopped at the VISA bill, which he\u2019d paid off a month earlier. Slipping his finger under the flap, he slit it open. To his dismay he found a three-hundred-dollar charge from Willows, Weeds and Flowers.</p><p>He asked Rosie about it.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I forgot to tell you. I used the card to buy flowers for the ladies\u2019 auxiliary luncheon at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree hundred dollars for flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe committee\u2019s going to reimburse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t take that tone of voice with me, Zach,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have the check by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat card is for emergencies only.\u201d</p><p>Rosie glared at him, her hand on her hip. \u201cThat was an emergency. The lady delivered the centerpieces for the banquet, and the treasurer hadn\u2019t arrived yet. She had to be paid. Surely even you can understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you volunteered?\u201d Zach didn\u2019t know why his wife found it necessary to leap in and rescue the world.</p><p>\u201cSomeone had to. Why are you so upset about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than just this one incident,\u201d Zach said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything. I\u2019m sick of the dinners you throw together because you\u2019re in a hurry to go somewhere else. I\u2019m sick of you rushing out the door every night, sick of the house being a mess.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Rosie\u2019s eyes, and her cheeks turned a deep shade of red. \u201cYou have no appreciation for everything I do around here.\u201d</p><p>Zach glared right back. \u201cEverything you do? Tell me, exactly what is it you do all day, except race from one unpaid venture to another? In the meantime, your family\u2019s eating garbage. Our home is a mess and I haven\u2019t seen you for more than ten minutes all week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I care more about my committees than I do my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m suggesting nothing. I\u2019m saying it outright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI\u2019m definitely getting the message and so are our children. The kids and I are running a distant second in your life. You fill up your days with volunteer work so you\u2019ll feel valued and important, and frankly I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly saw that Allison and Eddie had walked into the kitchen and were standing frozen in the doorway. Zach hated fighting in front of the children, but these negative emotions had been corroding inside him far too long.</p><p>Rosie looked at him as if he\u2019d physically struck her, then burst into tears and stormed into their bedroom.</p><p>For a stunned moment Zach stood there as his children accused him with their eyes. He didn\u2019t understand why his home life was in constant turmoil. It was little wonder that he preferred being at the office with its well-organized environment.</p><p>Needing time to clear his head, Zach removed his tie and headed toward the garage.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Dad?\u201d Eddie called after him.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t know. \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>Neither of his children said anything to stop him and the truth was, Zach didn\u2019t want to be delayed. Once in his car, he drove around for a while until his stomach rumbled. It\u2019d been a long time since lunch, and returning home to a half-cooked frozen entr\u00e9e held no appeal.</p><p>It was nearly eight by his watch. Zach stopped at the Taco Shack on the outskirts of town. The Mexican restaurant was better than scarfing down fast food, but at this point he didn\u2019t much care. Zach decided he\u2019d order a couple of tacos and eat them in the car.</p><p>As he stepped up to the counter, he noticed a woman sitting by herself at a table. He didn\u2019t think anything of it until he realized she looked familiar. Turning, he gave her a second glance.</p><p>\u201cJanice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cox, what are you doing here? I mean\u2014I didn\u2019t know you ate here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do every now and then,\u201d he said. The teenage girl working the counter hurried over to take his order. Zach examined the menu and decided on a chili relleno and a cold drink. While he waited for his meal, he sauntered back to where Janice sat.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to the Taco Shack on a Tuesday night?\u201d</p><p>She looked sweet and pretty when she smiled up at him. \u201cI\u2019m celebrating my raise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy ex-husband has our son on Tuesday nights, and I was too excited to go home and sit in front of the television all by myself.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s order came a few minutes later, and he went to collect it. \u201cDo you mind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>Zach lingered over his dinner and they both ordered coffee afterward. The tension that had been with him all evening dissolved and he found himself laughing and enjoying this visit.</p><p>When Zach finally returned to the house it was almost ten. Rosie was in bed, pretending to be asleep. She lay on her side, her back to him. He stared at her for a moment and debated whether he should apologize. No, he mused, he was finished apologizing to his wife. She was the one who needed to make amends. But if she wanted to give him the cold shoulder, that was fine with him.</p><p>Jack sat at his desk at The Cedar Cove Chronicle and stared at his computer monitor. The cursor blinked accusingly back at him from a screen that was almost blank. This article about the bond issue for the local park should have been finished two days ago. Jack didn\u2019t lack an opinion on the subject. He had plenty to say, and he\u2019d write it out in fine form, just as soon as he chased Olivia from his thoughts.</p><p>It\u2019d been almost a month since he\u2019d canceled her birthday dinner. These had to be the longest thirty days of his life. The fact that Eric was living with him had complicated everything. His routine, his hard-won peace of mind, his productivity had been shattered all to hell.</p><p>This was what Jack got for dwelling on life\u2019s regrets. He wanted to be a good father to Eric; he longed to make up for the lost years, and here was the opportunity. Unfortunately, the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse.</p><p>Naturally Eric would decide he needed a father at the same time Jack was falling in love and wanted to spend every spare moment with Olivia Lockhart. The first week Eric was with him, Jack had spent hour after hour listening to his son\u2019s woes. It seemed Eric had at least fifteen years of hurt and doubt that he needed to release. Patiently Jack had listened and when he could, he offered comfort and advice.</p><p>When Jack eventually did have a chance, he\u2019d phoned Olivia, dying to see her, dying to take a break from his son\u2019s troubles. He\u2019d hoped that an hour or two with Olivia would rejuvenate his spirits. Instead he\u2019d hit rock bottom when she wasn\u2019t home. He waited around all night for her to return his call. She didn\u2019t until the next morning, and by then he\u2019d left to cover the Christmas Bazaar for the newspaper\u2019s Neighbors Section.</p><p>They finally did connect, early the following week, and Jack noticed that her feelings for him appeared to be cooling. It wasn\u2019t anything she said, exactly. Her son-in-law was back from Alaska, and she was working with Charlotte on putting together a wedding reception for Seth and Justine.</p><p>Every time he\u2019d talked to Olivia since then, she was busy. Too busy to see him. Even their Tuesday night get-togethers had fallen by the wayside. Just how much trouble could a wedding reception really be? It seemed Olivia constantly needed to run somewhere or talk to someone. Someone other than Jack.</p><p>The hustle and bustle of this wedding reception aside, what worried Jack was her changing attitude toward him. Yes, there was a decided cooling. Whenever they managed to chat, Jack braced himself, half expecting her to suggest they break it off. It was this expectation\u2014the feeling that she was looking for a kind way to tell him to take a hike\u2014that prevented him from giving her the bracelet. He was afraid she\u2019d view the expensive gift as a means of manipulating her and so he\u2019d held on to it, not knowing what else to do.</p><p>The cursor on his screen continued to blink, and Jack wheeled his chair around, gazing out the window. This wasn\u2019t going to work. He needed an AA meeting and a talk with his sponsor.</p><p>He found a meeting near Bangor, but because he was in unfamiliar territory, he sat at the back of the room and listened to the speaker, who had over twenty years of sobriety. At the end of the session, when the group stood, joined hands and said the Lord\u2019s Prayer followed by the Serenity Prayer, Jack\u2019s voice rose and blended with the others. These people were family. They might be strangers but they all shared a problem that bonded them.</p><p>On the drive back to the office, Jack stopped at Thyme and Tide, the bed-and-breakfast on the waterfront owned by his sponsor and friend, Bob Beldon, and his wife, Peggy.</p><p>Bob was busy tinkering in the garage with one of his woodworking projects when Jack pulled into the driveway. Bob came out of the garage to meet him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Jack asked, not quite ready to launch into his reason for visiting.</p><p>\u201cGood. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged.</p><p>Bob smiled knowingly. \u201cI figure if you\u2019re coming by to see me in the middle of the day, something\u2019s up. Want to talk about it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack sighed, grateful he didn\u2019t need to lead into the subject delicately. \u201cHave you got a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Come on in. Peggy\u2019s visiting her sister, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s still coffee in the pot.\u201d</p><p>Jack was grateful. He was feeling unsettled, and even after ten years without a drink, the urge still came, especially at times like this. The meetings helped, but talking to Bob would give him a sense of perspective. It\u2019d been a long while since the cravings had hit this hard.</p><p>\u201cHow are things with Eric?\u201d Bob asked, heading into the kitchen. He paused on the back porch and removed his sweater, which he hung on a hook there. Then he led the way into the large, spacious room. Despite its size, the kitchen was warm and inviting, with its oak table, its woven rug on the polished floor and bunches of drying herbs by the window.</p> <p>\u201cEric\u2019s still with me. He doesn\u2019t like it any better than I do, but he\u2019s stuck until he can work out this mess between him and Shelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with him and the girl?\u201d</p><p>The hell if Jack knew. Twice now, at Jack\u2019s suggestion, Eric had phoned Shelly. Jack had made himself scarce, but it didn\u2019t take a psychic to figure out that the conversations hadn\u2019t gone well. Within minutes the calls were over, leaving Eric more depressed than ever.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come to talk about Eric,\u201d Jack told his friend. \u201cI\u2019ve got a problem with Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Bob silently offered him coffee, which Jack refused. Apparently Bob thought better of it himself and reached inside the refrigerator for a cold soda. Jack declined that, as well.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy about Olivia,\u201d Jack admitted, although this wasn\u2019t news to Bob, who\u2019d encouraged the relationship from the first.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Bob opened the soda and leaned against the counter as he waited for Jack to continue.</p><p>Jack remained standing, too. Soon he was pacing. \u201cI used to think she felt the same way about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed her mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I had to break our dinner date on her birthday when Eric showed up unexpectedly. She seemed to understand, but lately...\u201d He shook his head, unsure how to put into words what he sensed. \u201cI keep thinking she\u2019s had a change of heart and is looking for the right moment to tell me to take a flying leap into some cow pasture.\u201d</p><p>Bob considered his words. \u201cSo you\u2019re waiting and wondering and making yourself insane, anticipating the end\u2014even though she hasn\u2019t actually said anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I guess I am,\u201d Jack conceded.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather know what she\u2019s thinking?\u201d</p><p>Jack let the question roll around in his mind, and decided that, in all honesty, he didn\u2019t. He wanted to hold on to Olivia as long as he could because, dammit, he was falling in love with her. \u201cShe\u2019s preoccupied with Justine\u2019s wedding reception,\u201d he said, offering an excuse.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question. In fact, you\u2019re skirting the issue entirely and I know why. You don\u2019t want to face the truth, in case it isn\u2019t what you want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might want to end it, and I don\u2019t. Like I told you before, I think I\u2019m in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014Olivia might decide to call it quits. But if she does, you\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Bob had more confidence in him than Jack did. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t knowing be better than all this doubting?\u201d</p> <p>Well...yes, he supposed so. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he muttered. The only way to find out was to ask Olivia outright. He might not like the answer, as Bob had said, but this anxiety was damned hard to cope with. If she was going to reject him, he might as well get used to it. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll talk to Olivia.\u201d He stopped pacing and nodded at his friend. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Bob nodded solemnly in response, then downed the last of his cola and walked Jack to his car.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d made up his mind, Jack decided he had to take immediate action. He checked his watch: four-thirty. Olivia should be home from the courthouse. He drove directly to her house on Lighthouse Road</p><p>. He hadn\u2019t phoned her all week because he was afraid of what she might say; she hadn\u2019t called him, either. Parking in front of her house, he cursed his own weakness, his own need. This would be a lot easier if he didn\u2019t care so much. One thing he knew\u2014if she told him to get lost, he wasn\u2019t going to reach for a drink.</p><p>He rang the doorbell and waited.</p><p>The next millennium came and went before Olivia opened the door. She held the phone to her ear, but when she saw it was Jack, she smiled, unlatched the screen door and gestured him inside, still talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Marge can\u2019t make it, Stan, but I\u2019m sure Justine will understand.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so she was speaking to her ex-husband. Jack had met Stan several months earlier, just before he\u2019d gotten serious about Olivia. Her ex was a pompous SOB as far as Jack was concerned.</p><p>\u201cCan you get here before three?\u201d She smiled apologetically at Jack, who sat down on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cOf course your aunt Louise is invited.\u201d She rolled her eyes and made a wind-it-up motion with her hand, as though eager to get her ex off the line. \u201cI have to go\u2014I have company...Jack. You remember Jack, don\u2019t you? You don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Liar, Jack thought. Her ex knew exactly who he was.</p><p>She laughed but Jack couldn\u2019t tell what was so funny. No doubt old Stan had made some derogatory remark about him.</p><p>\u201cI have to go, Stan,\u201d she said again, a little more loudly this time. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next weekend with your aunt Louise. Give Marge my best. Bye.\u201d</p><p>A second later, she clicked the off button on the portable phone and sank onto the sofa next to Jack. \u201cWere we supposed to meet this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...no, but I hadn\u2019t seen you in a while. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too. I swear this reception is going to be the death of me. But Justine\u2019s my only daughter and I want it to be perfect for her and Seth. She frowned slightly. \u201cYou did get the invitation, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. He was beginning to feel better already. \u201cYou look worn-out,\u201d he told her. Maybe she\u2019d noticed that he was emotionally spent himself, but he didn\u2019t plan to drag Eric into the conversation. This was about him and Olivia, not their families or their obligations.</p><p>\u201cI am worn-out,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much time and organization a simple wedding reception requires. I hope both you and Eric will come.\u201d</p><p>It felt good to be invited. \u201cIf you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want you there. I\u2019m going to need all the moral support I can get.\u201d The phone in her hand rang and she pushed the Talk button and raised the receiver to her ear. \u201cMom, sorry, I\u2019m on my way. Yes, yes, tell the caterers I\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d She clicked off the phone, then leaped up from the sofa and started toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re busy.\u201d Jack stood, thinking it would be best if he left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack.\u201d She turned abruptly to face him. \u201cCan we meet later?\u201d</p><p>His heart sank. \u201cI\u2019m covering a school board meeting tonight.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although he doubted she\u2019d heard him.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, and took her by the shoulders.</p><p>She seemed mildly startled but smiled when she realized he intended to kiss her. Her arms slipped around his neck and she met his mouth with her own.</p><p>Slowly, after their kiss had ended, he eased his mouth from hers. \u201cI needed that.\u201d</p><p>All too briefly, she pressed her head to his shoulder. \u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>Justine was exhausted but jubilant as she held open the apartment door while Seth unloaded the last of the wedding gifts from the car. The reception had been wonderful\u2014she couldn\u2019t believe her mother and grandmother had pulled it off. The entire afternoon had been as close to perfect as she could imagine. The food was incredible, the music lovely, the atmosphere festive. She\u2019d met Seth\u2019s relatives and he\u2019d met all of hers. His were easy to locate in a crowd; they were the big, husky, outgoing Swedes, while hers were comparatively restrained and tended to group together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how Mom and Grandma did it.\u201d Justine said, sitting down on the pale-blue sofa and propping her feet on the matching footstool. \u201cI think this was the most magical day of my life, other than our wedding day, of course.\u201d She found their elopement wildly romantic.</p><p>Seth sat beside her and leaned his head against the sofa back. His large feet, crossed at the ankles, joined hers on the footstool. He seemed as exhausted as Justine.</p><p>\u201cI feel so spoiled,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Seth slid his arm around her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I had that many relatives,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been years since I saw my dad\u2019s aunt Louise.\u201d</p><p>Seth kissed her neck and drew her closer against him. \u201cSecond thoughts?\u201d</p><p>Justine smiled. \u201cNot a one. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Seth vowed. \u201cI love my wife.\u201d</p><p>Seth had been back from Alaska for almost three weeks and their lives had been a whirlwind from the moment he stepped off the plane. Preparing for the reception had taken up some of their time and adjusting their lives to each other\u2019s had been more of a challenge than she\u2019d anticipated. Seth worked at the marina and his hours changed from week to week. Slowly, he\u2019d started moving his personal items into her place. Living together involved all kinds of accommodations, some of them delightfully easy and some more difficult, since neither of them was used to sharing decisions or routines with another person.</p><p>Still, every time Justine woke up and realized the man in her bed was her husband, she became so giddy with happiness she couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. They found ways to amuse themselves in those early-morning hours. Unfortunately that made for extra-long days at the bank and she arrived home exhausted, her eyes stinging from lack of sleep.</p><p>\u201cWho was that man with Grace Sherman?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>\u201cCliff Harding,\u201d Justine told him and giggled. \u201cShe went out of her way to tell me they weren\u2019t dating, but I think they must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone heard from Dan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of. Mom said the divorce will be final the Monday before Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The idea of divorce had a sobering effect on Justine. Her father had been at the reception, but Marge wasn\u2019t. She wondered if there was anything wrong between her father and his second wife. If so, she didn\u2019t want to know about it. Maybe Marge had purposely stayed away, realizing the situation would be awkward. Jack Griffin had been one of the first to arrive and then stood in the background while her mother and father took center stage. It must have been difficult for him, since Olivia had barely had a moment to spend with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning.\u201d</p><p>Justine looked at her husband, and all she could see was his love. She didn\u2019t want that to change, not ever. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll always love me, Seth,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cJussie, how can you say such a thing?\u201d he asked, \u201cI\u2019ll draw my last breath loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith my very heart,\u201d he said, gathering her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want what happened to my parents to happen to us.\u201d</p><p>Seth kissed her brow. \u201cIt won\u2019t. We won\u2019t let it.\u201d</p><p>Her parents\u2019 divorce had taken place a long time ago; nevertheless, Justine remained affected by it. She knew she must sound insecure and emotionally needy, and blamed the fact that she was so tired. Seeing her parents together, laughing and chatting with their guests at the wedding reception, had reminded Justine of the happy life they\u2019d all shared before Jordan\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cI miss my family,\u201d Justine whispered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry James couldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Her brother was in the Navy, stationed in San Diego, and had been unable to attend the reception. \u201cI wish he could\u2019ve come, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t your brother you were talking about, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I so badly want everything to go back the way it was before the summer of 1986.\u201d She paused, swallowing hard. \u201cI remember how furious I was at Jordan that morning for reading my diary. And...and then that afternoon my twin brother was dead and my parents\u2014my entire family was never the same again.\u201d Justine turned to look at her husband, tears in her eyes. \u201cNone of us ever got over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Seth rubbed her cheeks softly with his thumb, catching the first tears. He continued to hold her close. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you,\u201d he promised again.</p><p>Raising her head, she sought his mouth. Their kisses quickly deepened, taking on an urgency that was growing familiar.</p> <p>Seth lifted her into his arms as though she weighed next to nothing. He carried her into the bedroom and helped her remove her dress before stripping out of his own clothes.</p><p>Their lovemaking was slow and emotional, and they clung to each other for a long time afterward.</p><p>\u201cWill it always be this good?\u201d she asked, kissing her husband\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Seth teased.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren? You mean, as in us having a baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d That was exactly what she meant.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She took a moment to mull over the question. \u201cI was hoping very soon, say in nine or ten months. If you agree.\u201d She let her smooth, silky leg stroke his.</p><p>\u201cYou once told me you didn\u2019t want children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind. How do you feel about a child\u2014or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be thrilled, but only if you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Seth kissed her neck and let his lips travel over her collarbone and then lower. Justine arched her back and moaned softly as he gently sucked her nipple.</p><p>Seth moved from one breast to the other, pausing in between. \u201cOne question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d she whispered, panting and eager for him to make love to her again.</p><p>\u201cDo twins run in your family?\u201d</p><p>Justine laughed. \u201cEvery generation.\u201d</p><p>Seth gave an exaggerated groan. \u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we happen to have a boy...\u201d she murmured as he continued to explore her body. She ran her hands over his broad shoulders and sighed at the exquisite sensations she experienced.</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to name him after my brother.\u201d</p><p>Seth raised his head so that their eyes met in the moonlit room. \u201cSo would I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Jordan would be honored to have our son carry his name.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes seemed to glisten. \u201cI think we should start on this baby project now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A moment later, he moved over her, and Justine opened her body and her heart to receive his love. Her life could never return to the way it was before that summer afternoon sixteen years ago. Yet for the first time since that day, she felt truly free to create a new happiness. Hers and Seth\u2019s.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Now that Justine and Seth\u2019s wedding reception was over, Olivia could concentrate on Thanksgiving. Sitting in chambers after a day spent working out legal solutions in family court, she flipped the pages of her calendar and was dismayed to see that the holiday was almost upon her. Where had the days gone? She could barely remember when she\u2019d last seen Jack. Was that her fault or\u2014No, he was the one avoiding her, she decided. Olivia shook her head; she didn\u2019t want to dwell on her on-again, off-again relationship with Jack Griffin.</p><p>There was a polite knock on the door. A tap Olivia instantly recognized as her mother\u2019s. Charlotte enjoyed sitting in Olivia\u2019s courtroom from time to time. She claimed she got her best knitting done while listening to Olivia\u2019s cases. Only rarely did she visit Olivia while she was in chambers, and then it was usually because she had a strong opinion on one of her daughter\u2019s cases. Charlotte usually managed to convey her views in a direct and unequivocal manner.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Mom,\u201d Olivia called.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know it was me?\u201d Charlotte asked, stepping into the room. She carried her knitting bag, which was twice as large as her not insignificant purse. Her mother gazed approvingly at the dark mahogany bookcases, which lined three walls.</p><p>Olivia swallowed a smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte set her knitting bag on the green leather sofa and sank into its thick cushions. \u201cDo you realize it\u2019s almost Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now. I swear I don\u2019t know what happened to this month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking we should invite Jack over this year. How do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>Actually, Olivia felt fine about it. Regardless of who\u2019d been avoiding whom, an invitation to Thanksgiving dinner might go a long way toward healing the breach. \u201cThat\u2019s a marvelous idea.\u201d</p><p>Her mother glowed with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHis son is still living with him, so we\u2019ll want to include Eric, too,\u201d Olivia reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Charlotte readily agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Cliff Harding? Will he be alone?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte picked up her knitting bag and rested it on her knees. \u201cI talked to him just the other day, and he\u2019s flying to the East Coast to join his daughter and her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice.\u201d Olivia was fond of Cliff, and she especially liked the patient way he dealt with Charlotte\u2014and with Grace, too. She was pleased that he\u2019d accepted the invitation to attend Justine and Seth\u2019s wedding reception. His presence had obviously made the event that much more pleasurable for Grace, especially since he\u2019d spent most of the afternoon at her side. Grace seemed more like her old self when Cliff was around. It was touching to see her respond to a man\u2019s attention. When Dan disappeared, Grace had assumed she must be lacking in some way. For months, she\u2019d blamed herself, although Olivia was certain the blame couldn\u2019t be hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the pies,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cMincemeat, apple, pumpkin and pear. I do love a good pear pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the dinner rolls?\u201d Olivia asked hopefully. Her mother\u2019s homemade rolls were a treat not to be forgotten.</p><p>\u201cOf course. That\u2019s understood.\u201d</p><p>They completed the menu\u2014who\u2019d be bringing what. Olivia was responsible for the turkey, dressing and all the trimmings. Olivia would ask Justine to provide the fruit salad and whatever else she wanted to contribute. Jack and Eric would be their guests.</p><p>As soon as her mother left, Olivia reached for the phone and punched in Jack\u2019s number at the newspaper office. She was connected to his line right away.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d he barked, sounding preoccupied.</p><p>\u201cLockhart,\u201d Olivia returned.</p><p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d His voice softened. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re wearing first.\u201d That teasing quality was back in his voice.</p><p>\u201cJack! I\u2019m at the courthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what do you have on under your robe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop?\u201d</p><p>He sighed as if restraint demanded a lot of effort. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Miss me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called to invite you and Eric to Thanksgiving dinner with Mom, Justine, Seth and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are? I mean, sure. Great. We\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any other plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Jack told her. \u201cWell, I was going to get a frozen turkey-in-a-box out of the freezer department and bake that. This\u2019ll be something to look forward to. It\u2019d be perfect if only...\u201d He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cIf what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind inviting one other person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this other woman I\u2019ve been dating for the last few weeks who\u2019s lonely and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a moment.\u201d Olivia was having a hard time not laughing out loud. She\u2019d been worried about their relationship, but everything seemed back to normal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious about inviting someone else,\u201d he said, and the teasing left his voice. \u201cWould you mind terribly if I asked Shelly Larson to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric\u2019s girlfriend? The one he thinks is pregnant with someone else\u2019s baby?\u201d Olivia frowned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m desperate for those two to reconcile,\u201d Jack told her. \u201cMy son is miserable without her. He loves Shelly, and I think if they were to meet on neutral ground they just might be able to patch things up. Yes, it\u2019ll take some adjusting on Eric\u2019s part, but he\u2019s willing if Shelly is, too.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t want to get caught in the middle of this conflict, but she realized that Jack was at his wits\u2019 end. Eric and Shelly were obviously at an impasse\u2014and Eric showed no sign of moving out of Jack\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cWould you do that, Olivia?\u201d Jack pleaded. \u201cFor the sake of my sanity.\u201d</p><p>And their relationship, Olivia added silently. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d She said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to spring this on Eric, or on Shelly, for that matter. You have to tell Eric I\u2019m inviting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut will you talk to Shelly for me? Please? I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m meddling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are,\u201d Olivia pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t see any other alternative. They can\u2019t seem to resolve this on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, give me her phone number,\u201d she said with a sigh. She wrote it down and then made little squiggly lines around the numbers while they continued to talk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou doing anything exciting tonight?\u201d Jack asked, and his voice dipped to a sexy growl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What have you got in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Chamber of Commerce is having an open house. Wanna go?\u201d Jack\u2019s suggestive tone implied a night of passionate lovemaking, not a rather dull business event.</p><p>\u201cI just might be able to fit it into my busy social calendar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I pick you up at seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear something sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the Chamber of Commerce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Olivia,\u201d he said blandly, \u201cfor me.\u201d</p> <p>The smile lasted a long time after the conversation had ended.</p><p>As soon as Olivia got home, she called Shelly Larson. After a lengthy explanation of who she was and why she\u2019d phoned, she waited for a response to her invitation.</p><p>\u201cDoes Eric know about this?\u201d Shelly asked.</p><p>Her voice was soft and well-modulated. Olivia tried to match it to the photograph Eric had once shown her. As she recalled, Shelly was a petite brunette who worked for a Seattle-based advertising agency. She\u2019d been living with Eric for almost two years.</p><p>\u201cJack suggested I invite you,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI agreed on the condition that neither of you walked into this blind. He\u2019s hoping you and Eric can settle things once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Shelly didn\u2019t respond; apparently she was still considering the invitation.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have family in the area?\u201d Olivia asked, wanting to get some idea of Shelly\u2019s support system.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014my mother died when I was a baby and my dad hasn\u2019t really been part of my life. I was raised by my grandmother, but she\u2019s been gone for three years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem interested in continuing with that theme. Instead, she burst out, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why Eric doesn\u2019t believe the baby is his. It\u2019s an insult to me and to everything I stand for.\u201d</p><p>Olivia certainly didn\u2019t want to take sides. According to Jack, his son was incapable of fathering children, but stranger things had happened. \u201cMen are just dense sometimes,\u201d she said, hoping she sounded sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cI very much appreciate the dinner invitation,\u201d Shelly said, her voice gaining strength and conviction, \u201cbut I have to refuse. Eric and I are finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re carrying his child,\u201d Olivia reminded her. \u201cIn that case, the relationship is far from over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Eric doesn\u2019t believe me, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, the courts can deal with this. I don\u2019t want to put a damper on your Thanksgiving\u2014that wouldn\u2019t be fair to you or Jack or your other guests. It was very thoughtful of Jack to want to include me, but it just won\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia didn\u2019t feel comfortable ending the conversation just yet, now that she knew Shelly was alone in the world. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep in touch, Shelly, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that would be okay. Jack has a right to know his grandchild.\u201d</p><p>They hung up shortly afterward, and Olivia stood there, thinking over what had been said. The young woman had shown extraordinary wisdom in declining the invitation, in Olivia\u2019s opinion. She could sense how badly Shelly wanted to be included in the festivities, yet she\u2019d refused, knowing that the others would be made uncomfortable by the situation between her and Eric.</p><p>Jack arrived promptly at seven. \u201cWell?\u201d he asked hopefully. \u201cDid you talk to Shelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, and she turned us down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jack groaned and ran all ten fingers through his hair in abject frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Eric say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d come to dinner if Shelly came, but otherwise he was thinking of joining a few of his friends over in Kirkland where he works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s for the best,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d Jack cried.</p><p>And not for them either, Olivia supposed.</p><p>\u201cDamn, I was counting on better news than this.\u201d He slumped onto her chair, then reached inside his jacket. \u201cI\u2019ve had this for weeks and was waiting for the right time to give it to you.\u201d He took out a gaily wrapped package. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday gift.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in complete astonishment.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he urged. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia took the gift, sat down next to Jack and untied the ribbon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s late,\u201d he said, watching her anxiously.</p><p>She peeled away the paper and lifted the lid of a gray velvet box. The instant she saw the diamond tennis bracelet, she let out a gasp.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJack, I...I\u2019m not sure what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to know how important you are to me, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack...\u201d She struggled to tell him how thrilled she was and then decided that words weren\u2019t necessary. With great care she set the box aside and slipped her arms around Jack\u2019s neck, kissing him in a way that would leave him in no doubt of her appreciation.</p><p>Thanksgiving would be a quiet day for Grace with just Maryellen for company. The divorce had been declared final on Monday. She didn\u2019t have to appear in court; Mark Spellman had phoned her late in the afternoon with the news that everything had gone smoothly. As of Monday afternoon, she was no longer married to Dan. All the paperwork had been signed, sealed and notarized. She was a single woman again.</p><p>Thanksgiving morning, Grace woke early. Just as she had a year ago. But last Thanksgiving she\u2019d bought a twenty-pound turkey. While she stuffed the bird and prepared it for roasting, Dan had bantered with her and then gone outside to cut firewood. Later, Kelly and Paul had come to dinner and Maryellen did, too. It had been a pleasant day, a family day, full of laughter and warmth.</p><p>This year, Kelly and Paul were driving to his parents\u2019 home, Dan was gone and the twenty-pound turkey had been replaced by a small turkey breast and a store-bought pumpkin pie.</p><p>Grace found it impossible to contain her emotions. The house had never felt so big and empty. Sensing her mood, Buttercup stayed close to Grace as she wandered aimlessly from room to room.</p><p>Shortly after she\u2019d filed for divorce, Grace had cleaned out Dan\u2019s side of the closet. Although she\u2019d searched his clothes before, desperate for some hint as to why her husband had disappeared and where, she\u2019d gone through each shirt and pants pocket a second and even a third time. Then she\u2019d folded up his clothes and set them aside to donate to charity. They were neatly piled in bags and boxes, which she\u2019d left in one of the empty bedrooms for the moment.</p><p>The phone rang, and glancing at her watch, Grace saw that it was barely seven.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, wondering who would phone this early.</p><p>A burst of static answered her.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said again, more loudly this time. An uneasy feeling came over her when the line was suddenly disconnected. She hung up but kept her hand on the phone for a few seconds. How...strange. This was just the kind of stunt Dan would pull. Dear God in heaven, could it have been him?</p><p>Was he, too, thinking about their Thanksgiving just a year ago? Perhaps he missed her; perhaps he\u2019d read about the divorce in the paper\u2019s legal announcements. Dear God, this was craziness! Sheer absurdity. She had to let go of Dan, she had to stop thinking about him. Her marriage was over, and she had to move on to the next stage of her life.</p><p>Maryellen got to the house around noon. By then, Grace had the potatoes on to boil and the turkey breast was baking, browning nicely. She planned to mash the potatoes with garlic and serve broccoli and a small salad. \u201cIt smells good in here,\u201d her daughter said as she let herself in the kitchen door.</p><p>She set a small pot of bronze chrysanthemums in the middle of the table and kissed Grace on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI made that orange-cranberry relish you like so much,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom, that\u2019s great. It just wouldn\u2019t seem like Thanksgiving without your relish.\u201d She opened the refrigerator and peeked inside. \u201cMy goodness, how much did you make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what the recipe calls for.\u201d Maryellen\u2019s question was yet another reminder that it was only the two of them this year. \u201cTake whatever you want home with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Maryellen moved restlessly around the kitchen. \u201cDo you need me to do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s pretty much under control.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter walked down the hallway to what had once been her bedroom. She returned a couple of minutes later. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got Dad\u2019s stuff packed up.\u201d</p><p>Tears clogged Grace\u2019s throat. She nodded. \u201cThe divorce was final on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Maryellen gently squeezed her arm. \u201cHow are you handling this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the same as you did when your divorce came through.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen sighed deeply. \u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>Grace looked away, determined not to allow this day of giving thanks to become a day of grief and anger.</p><p>The phone rang and Grace motioned for Maryellen to answer, fearing that if she spoke now, her voice would crack.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Maryellen said, then frowned. \u201cHello? Hello?\u201d After a moment, she hung up the receiver. \u201cThat was weird. There was no one at the other end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a call like that earlier,\u201d Grace said. \u201cNo one answered then, either.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen stared at her with stricken eyes. \u201cDo you...think it was Dad?\u201d</p><p>Grace had already guessed exactly that, but she had no way of knowing for sure. Cutting back on expenses had been important, and soon after Dan\u2019s disappearance, she\u2019d cancelled Caller ID and the other extras the phone company offered.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do such a thing?\u201d Maryellen demanded, sounding angry now. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he just stay out of our lives instead of playing these sick games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose he misses us,\u201d Grace said. It was the only reason she could think of.</p><p>\u201cIf he misses us so much, why doesn\u2019t he come home?\u201d Maryellen shouted. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him that.\u201d She reached for the phone and started punching in numbers.</p><p>\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cStar 69.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d Grace said, her voice tight. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford all those extras.... Dan must\u2019ve known that. He must\u2019ve figured out that I wouldn\u2019t be able to trace the call.\u201d She closed her eyes in a futile effort to regain her emotional balance. \u201cSometimes I think I hate him for doing this to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s all right. We can\u2019t let him ruin our day....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father and I were married for more than thirty-five years.\u201d Her legs felt shaky and she sank into a kitchen chair.</p><p>The phone rang again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer it!\u201d Grace said. \u201cDon\u2019t give him the satisfaction. Let it ring, just let it ring.\u201d</p><p>On the fifth ring, the answering machine came on, and once more the only sound they heard was static. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maryellen pulled out a chair and sat down across from Grace. She took her mother\u2019s hands, clasping them tightly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Dad left,\u201d she whispered, \u201cbut whatever the reason, it wasn\u2019t because of anything you did or didn\u2019t do. You\u2019re a wonderful mother and you were a good wife.\u201d</p><p>Grace hung her head, watching as her tears dripped onto the quilted place mat. \u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d She wished she could believe Maryellen, but she didn\u2019t think men walked away from long-term marriages if they were content.</p><p>She sniffled and made an effort to put the phone calls out of her mind. Maryellen released her hands, passing her a tissue to wipe her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wish Cliff Harding was here,\u201d Maryellen said forcefully. \u201cThat would shake Dad up, wouldn\u2019t it? It\u2019d serve him right if a man answered the phone.\u201d</p> <p>Grace smiled shakily. \u201cThat it would.\u201d</p><p>The potato water had begun to boil over, and Grace leaped up to turn down the burner. She used those few seconds to compose herself and when she returned to the table, she was smiling.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Maryellen said hesitantly. \u201cWhat about you and Mr. Harding? Are the two of you going to start dating now that the divorce is final?\u201d</p><p>Grace had been thinking about this for weeks, unable to arrive at a firm decision. In fact, she\u2019d put Cliff off once already. \u201cProbably not,\u201d she told her daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Maryellen urged. \u201cI like him. I know Kelly might have a hard time accepting another man in your life, but she\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t because of what Kelly will say\u2014or you or anyone else, for that matter,\u201d Grace confessed. \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me, I like Cliff, but I\u2019m not ready to enter the dating world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon. I still feel too raw. I thought...I hoped I\u2019d find some closure when the divorce became final, but I can see now that isn\u2019t going to happen. I have to know, Maryellen. I need answers. Where\u2019s your father? Why couldn\u2019t he tell me where he went or why? What deep, dark secret is he hiding from us?\u201d</p><p>Grace knew very well that life didn\u2019t always supply the answers. Perhaps one day she\u2019d find peace. But for now there was none. Instead, the uncertainty and the anger and grief raged inside her, as strong as they\u2019d been the day her husband disappeared. Not that her life was devoid of happiness or that she didn\u2019t still have plenty to be thankful for. She had her daughters, her friends, her job, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou have to, Mom. You have to.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter said this with such urgency Grace didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll end up like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly is wrong with you?\u201d Grace asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d Maryellen cried. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-five and I\u2019m terrified of falling in love again. I don\u2019t trust my own judgment. I practically have a panic attack if a man wants to kiss me. I\u2019m so afraid of what might happen that I refuse to allow any man close to me. I look at Kelly and Paul, and they seem so happy and so normal. Why couldn\u2019t my marriage have been like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Maryellen...\u201d Grace had no idea what to tell her daughter. Maryellen so rarely spoke of her marriage that she felt at a loss as to how to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cI love little Tyler so much. But I\u2019m never going to have a child of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You\u2019re still young,\u201d Grace insisted.</p><p>Maryellen shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t let your divorce do to you what mine did to me,\u201d she repeated. \u201cPlease, Mom. You have a lot of good years ahead of you. If you get another chance at love, take it! Promise me you\u2019ll take it\u2014and that you\u2019ll be happy. Otherwise I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever find any kind of contentment myself.\u201d</p><p>Thanksgiving with her mother had been one of the most disturbing days of her life, Maryellen thought as she opened the gallery first thing Friday morning. She still felt emotionally drained from it. If she could\u2019ve taken today off, she would have. But she expected to be swamped with customers in what was traditionally the biggest shopping day of the year.</p> <p>With so many people stopping by the gallery, it was almost two before she had a chance to eat her leftover-turkey sandwich. The only reason she had a moment to herself then was due to her assistant, Lois Habber-smith, who\u2019d agreed to work the afternoon with her. The gallery\u2019s absentee owners, the Webbers, lived in California and trusted Maryellen to handle all aspects of the business.</p><p>Sitting on a stool in the back room, Maryellen crossed her legs and had just taken the first bite of her sandwich when Jon Bowman entered the room.</p><p>\u201cJon...\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected him. Already her heart was hammering wildly. He\u2019d phoned twice since the Halloween party and she\u2019d managed to avoid speaking to him both times.</p><p>\u201cStill running away?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d she lied.</p><p>He grinned, letting her know she hadn\u2019t fooled him. \u201cCould you use some more pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, eager for as much of his work as he was willing to let her have. \u201cThat last group completely sold out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get them to you this evening?\u201d</p><p>She wondered why he hadn\u2019t brought them now. \u201cYes, that would be fine. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d</p><p>The gallery closed at six. \u201cI can wait for you here,\u201d she told him. She\u2019d hang the photographs right away so they\u2019d be ready for sale tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cI want you to pick them up at my house,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cI promise you, the drive will be worth your while.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen frowned. How clever of him to make sure she didn\u2019t have a previous commitment. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to have you bring them here.\u201d That was how their arrangement had worked in the past.</p><p>\u201cI know you would, but not this time. I\u2019m making dinner for you. If you want the pictures you\u2019ll be at my place at seven.\u201d</p><p>She started to argue, to tell him she wouldn\u2019t be blackmailed, but he didn\u2019t give her the opportunity. He simply walked away. If she was going to argue, she\u2019d have to follow him into the crowded gallery, and he knew she wouldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>Twice that same afternoon, Maryellen had inquiries about Jon\u2019s work, and she found herself promising they\u2019d be available the next day. His pictures sold almost as fast as they appeared on the walls. If she wanted more, he\u2019d made it plain she\u2019d have to come and get them herself.</p><p>At seven, muttering under her breath, Maryellen drove down a dark country road, using a flashlight to check addresses on mailboxes, searching for Jon\u2019s driveway. When she finally located the proper drive, she turned into the dirt-and-gravel lane and drove another mile. Just when she was about to give up, the two-story house came into view.</p><p>She parked in the back, climbed out and stopped to look over the dancing lights of Seattle twinkling on the other side of Puget Sound. His home must be close to the waterfront. A ferry, with lights blazing, glided across the water in the distance.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d come,\u201d Jon said from somewhere in the darkness. He emerged from the shadows to welcome her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t leave me much choice.\u201d She wasn\u2019t happy about this and she wanted him to know it.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he agreed. \u201cCome inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I can\u2019t stay for dinner. I hope you didn\u2019t go to any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to a tremendous amount of trouble. I\u2019d like you to stay. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d He left her no option but to follow him into the house.</p><p>The interior was only partially finished, she noticed. Pieces of furniture were positioned on bare floors. The walls were mostly framed in although unpainted. The kitchen had new appliances and white-tile countertops, but only a plywood sub-floor. A linen-covered table with candles sat in what must be the living room. The light was dim, coming entirely from a couple of small table lamps and what spilled through from the kitchen. Large picture windows revealed a staggering view of the Seattle skyline.</p><p>\u201cLet me take your coat,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>Maryellen wanted to resist, she really did. Instead she slipped the coat from her shoulders. Jon took it and walked over to a closet without doors and placed it on a hanger.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see my home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWho\u2019s the builder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything myself.\u201d</p><p>She remembered Jon telling Terri he was a jack-of-all-trades. Now she realized how accurate that statement was. He led her through the house. The only room with a door was the bathroom. The master bedroom was upstairs and had a balcony facing the water.</p><p>\u201cI sit out there in the summer with my morning coffee,\u201d Jon told her.</p><p>Maryellen could imagine it\u2014the peace and silence, the clear, fresh beauty of Puget Sound in early morning.</p><p>\u201cI have five acres here,\u201d he continued. \u201cBefore you wonder how could I afford this property, I should tell you the land belonged to my grandfather. He purchased it back in the 1950s for practically nothing. When he died he left it to me.\u201d A timer rang in the kitchen. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>He helped her down the stairs, leading the way and clasping her hand in his own. Once back in the main part of the house, he escorted her to the table and pulled out a chair.</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>First he lit the candles. The he poured the wine, a spicy Gewurztraminer. After that, he brought out a salad\u2014lettuce with sliced fresh pear, shaves of Roquefort cheese and wonderful honey-coated roasted walnuts. The dressing was a delicate raspberry vinaigrette.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Maryellen whispered after one taste. \u201cThis is incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the beginning,\u201d Jon promised.</p><p>They had one glass of wine with the salad and another before the entr\u00e9e of baked salmon with a dill sauce so creamy Maryellen closed her eyes to savor the first bite. Dessert was an apple-and-date torte.</p><p>Between courses, Jon filled her wineglass again, opening a second bottle, and when they\u2019d finished dinner, Maryellen was warm and slightly dizzy. He brought her to a comfortable sofa. A classical CD\u2014she recognized Vivaldi\u2019s \u201cFour Seasons\u201d\u2014played in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need lots of coffee,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already brewing.\u201d</p><p>She could smell the rich aroma. Feeling flushed and utterly content, she leaned her head against the back of the sofa and looked out over the astonishing view. Lights twinkled like fireflies in the distance, and the dark water reflected a three-quarter moon. Jon had turned off the lights, so her own image wasn\u2019t mirrored in the glass. There was nothing to interfere with the view.</p><p>He sat down next to her. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad now, was it?\u201d Then as if she might misunderstand the question, he added, \u201cBeing here with me, I mean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been very...nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it. I\u2019m not so frightening, am I?\u201d</p><p>She shifted sideways to look at him and smiled. \u201cYou can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you kiss me.\u201d It must be the wine talking, yet it was the truth.</p><p>Jon took her hand and examined her long, tapering fingers. \u201cThis might come as s surprise, but your kisses frighten me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI frighten you?\u201d This didn\u2019t surprise so much as amuse Maryellen.</p><p>As if to prove his point, he bent forward and pressed his mouth to hers. It was a gentle, undemanding kiss but one that promised so much more.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said in a low voice, sounding unlike himself. He flattened her hand against his chest. \u201cFeel my heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes...It\u2019s beating hard.\u201d Her own heart was pounding, too. Wanting to reveal what his kisses did to her, she leaned toward him and placed her mouth over his. The kiss was deeper, longer, more involved. By the time it ended, Maryellen\u2019s head was swimming. \u201cFeel my heart,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Jon laid his large hand over her chest, but then as though he couldn\u2019t resist, he cupped her breast. He gave her ample opportunity to stop him, but she couldn\u2019t. The feelings his touch produced in her were too exciting. Too enticing. His fingers fumbled with the buttons on her blouse as he continued to kiss her. Even before he\u2019d finished, she reached behind and released her bra, letting her breasts spill forward. Jon caught them with both hands and groaned when she leaned closer and ran her tongue along the inner edge of his ear.</p><p>After that, everything happened so fast, Maryellen lost track of who undressed whom. All she knew was that they were on the sofa and Jon was about to make love to her. His eyes held hers as he positioned himself above her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She closed her eyes and nodded, so eager for him that she wrapped her arms tightly around him and urged his mouth back to hers.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Their lovemaking was long and slow. And it was exquisite, unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced. At some point during the night, they moved upstairs to his bed. Exhausted, Maryellen fell into a deep sleep with Jon\u2019s body curled around hers, his arm over her waist, his hand pressing her close.</p><p>Shortly before dawn, with morning just beginning to light the sky, she stirred. Startled, barely aware of her surroundings, Maryellen woke and abruptly sat up. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with me,\u201d Jon said and brought her back into his arms. He kissed her again and she turned to face him.</p><p>The second time they made love, she sat atop him, her long hair streaming over her shoulders and onto her breasts.</p><p>In the morning, Maryellen woke first and lay quietly in his arms for several moments, considering what she\u2019d done. Jon Bowman had seduced her\u2014and she\u2019d let him. He\u2019d wined and dined her and then he\u2019d lured her into his bed\u2014and she\u2019d let him. She\u2019d been a willing participant, without a thought to birth control or any form of protection. This was insanity.</p><p>Careful not to disturb him, she slipped out of the bed, mortified to find she was completely nude. Tiptoeing down the stairs, she gathered her clothes piece by piece and held them against her breasts. She\u2019d put her underwear on and was stepping into her wool slacks when Jon appeared at the top of the stairs, naked from the waist up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sneaking away?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t answer. Her intentions were obvious, and they didn\u2019t include breakfast over coffee and a newspaper, either. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it did. Are you going to pretend it didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Her face burned red. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen, be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014we have a professional relationship. It can\u2019t be anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any answers without launching into explanations she didn\u2019t want to give. \u201cBecause it can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, but this is the way it has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you nothing.\u201d She continued dressing as fast as she could, zipping up her pants. \u201cYou planned this little seduction. The wine, the dinner, the music...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I did! You wanted me as much as I wanted you. If you\u2019re going to be angry, fine, but at least be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I wanted you, but I would never have slept with you if you hadn\u2019t blackmailed me into coming out here. You had everything planned\u2014right down to the three glasses of wine, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She flipped the hair away from her face and grabbed her blouse. She jerked her arms into the sleeves and didn\u2019t bother to fasten the buttons before walking over to the closet and grabbing her coat. She yanked it free and left the hanger swinging.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cDon\u2019t leave like this. Don\u2019t lie to me, and don\u2019t lie to yourself. I didn\u2019t plan what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that you did.\u201d When she was young and naive and a virgin, Clint had lured her into his bed with wine and promises. They\u2019d taken wild, irresponsible chances with pregnancy, just as she\u2019d done now. In all the years since her marriage and divorce, she\u2019d apparently learned nothing.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBelieve what you want, but I know the truth and so do you.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen stomped out, and it wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d driven halfway home that she remembered the photographs.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t know how much longer he\u2019d be able to stand having Eric in his house. His very small house. When he went to make breakfast that morning, he discovered an empty bread sack. Eric had eaten the last of the bread. That was just the most recent instance of his son\u2019s thoughtlessness. He wondered how Shelly coped with Eric\u2019s slovenly behavior, cursing as he shoved plates and cups into the dishwasher.</p><p>Doing his best to control his irritation, Jack decided he could go without his morning toast. It would be good for his waistline. However his attitude didn\u2019t improve when he discovered that Eric had used up most of the hot water for his own shower and then thrown in a load of wash.</p><p>Unaware that the hot water tank was empty, Jack stepped into the stall and turned on the water, only to be drenched in icy spray. Yelping, he slammed open the glass door, scrambled out and grabbed a towel. Unfortunately it was damp from Eric\u2019s shower. His son had managed to use both towels, so there wasn\u2019t a dry one for Jack.</p><p>\u201cThat does it!\u201d he shouted, flinging down the towel. When Eric had first come to live with him, it was supposed to be for a few days. This had gone on for weeks now, and Jack was putting an end to it.</p><p>His disposition was quickly moving from irritation to outrage as he tried to dress, still wet from the shower. Twice he had to stop and take deep breaths in order to calm his thundering heart. As far as he could see, Eric and Shelly were at a stalemate. Neither one of them was going to budge. Jack had hoped they\u2019d patch things up on Thanksgiving Day at Olivia\u2019s. Unfortunately, Shelly had refused the invitation.</p><p>Eric had tried to hide his feelings, but they were all too transparent. His son had pinned his hopes on seeing Shelly over the Thanksgiving holiday, and her refusal had left him reeling. He was convinced she was involved with someone else now. That was when Jack had convinced Eric to visit a fertility clinic. Following the visit, Eric had gone into a depression that had lasted for days.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, Jack felt he had no choice but to take matters into his own hands. By the time he reached the newspaper office, he\u2019d formed a plan of action. He was going to call Shelly himself.</p><p>Luckily he had her work number, and when they connected, he suggested they meet for dinner. Shelly agreed and they set a time, choosing a place on the Seattle waterfront. Things had to change, and quickly. For his son\u2019s sake...and his own.</p><p>At six-thirty that same day, Shelly met Jack at the fancy seafood restaurant. She\u2019d already been seated and was waiting for him. She hadn\u2019t seen him yet and he took advantage of the moment to study her. Shelly was a pretty girl, petite and fragile-looking, especially now. Jack was surprised to see that she was already wearing a maternity top. Easy enough to guess that she was pregnant.</p><p>\u201cHello, Shelly,\u201d he said, kissing her on the cheek before sitting across from her.</p><p>\u201cMr. Griffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he insisted, \u201ccall me Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She lowered her gaze, apparently reading the menu, but Jack had the feeling she already knew what she wanted to order. He knew what he wanted. The crab cakes were excellent. But this meeting wasn\u2019t about crab cakes or any other menu item.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019re wondering why I called you,\u201d Jack said as he set aside the menu.</p><p>\u201cI assume it has to do with Eric.\u201d Then, as if she couldn\u2019t help herself, she asked. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot great,\u201d Jack told her. \u201cHe misses you.\u201d</p><p>Shelly looked toward the pier and the expanse of black inky water beyond. \u201cI miss him, too.\u201d Her voice was soft.</p><p>\u201cWas my son always such a slob?\u201d Jack tossed in the question, hoping for a lighter mood. Eric could well have come by it naturally. His own lack of orderliness had never bothered Jack much, but Eric\u2019s drove him to distraction. Besides, Eric far surpassed him in any slob competition.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Shelly said with the beginning of a smile. \u201cI\u2019m the organized one. Is he eating all right?\u201d</p><p>It probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to admit his son was eating him out of house and home. \u201cHe seems to be doing just fine in that department. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Shelly smiled a little more, and Jack noticed how pale she was. \u201cI\u2019m constantly hungry. I\u2019ve never had an appetite like this in my life. I have breakfast and then by midmorning I\u2019m so ravenous I have a second breakfast.\u201d</p><p>That explained why she was already into maternity tops. The poor girl had turned to food to help her through this difficult time. Jack wished he knew what to say.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Eric recently?\u201d he asked, carefully broaching the subject.</p><p>\u201cNo...we haven\u2019t spoken since a week before Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t know.\u201d Jack\u2019s heart fell. So Eric hadn\u2019t told her.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI convinced Eric to visit one of those fertility clinics and have his sperm tested. You claim this baby is his and Eric says it can\u2019t be because of something a doctor told us years ago.\u201d</p><p>Shelly brightened immediately. \u201cThat was a great idea. Then he knows the baby is his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d Jack glanced around, surprised they hadn\u2019t seen a waiter yet. As if on cue, the man stepped forward. Jack asked for coffee and the crab cakes; Shelly ordered the garden salad, with extra ranch dressing on the side, chicken fettuccini Alfredo, plus an order of garlic-and-cheese bread. Jack suspected that if desserts had been listed on the main menu, she would have ordered that, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExplain what you meant about Eric. If he went to the clinic, then he must know he\u2019s the baby\u2019s father,\u201d Shelly pressed. She spread the linen napkin over her lap and smoothed it out vigorously, as if a wrinkle were cause for disciplinary action. Her face was tight with anxiety.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the report, the likelihood of Eric fathering children is highly improbable.\u201d Jack hated to be the bearer of bad news, but he assumed Eric had told her. He\u2019d figured their subsequent conversation, more than the report, was the cause of his son\u2019s depression. \u201cI read the clinic\u2019s report myself. His sperm count is very low. There is a minuscule possibility he fathered the child, but he doesn\u2019t see that. All he read were the words highly improbable.\u201d</p><p>Shelly lowered her eyes and Jack wondered if she was struggling not to weep. \u201cThat explains a great deal,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jack didn\u2019t mean to pry, but if she was going to volunteer the information...</p> <p>\u201cIt explains why he hasn\u2019t called me. He doesn\u2019t believe the baby\u2019s his. He obviously thinks I cheated on him, and I resent that. His lack of faith in me is very hurtful, Jack.\u201d She stared down at the table. \u201cBut despite all that, he\u2019s continuing to make the rent payments. He knows I can\u2019t handle them with what I\u2019m earning.\u201d</p><p>Jack wanted to groan out loud. While he appreciated the fact that Eric was generous, it also meant it could be years before he moved out on his own. Jack was stuck with his son.</p><p>\u201cI told Eric not to, that I\u2019d make the payments on my own, but he\u2019s still covering the rent.\u201d She paused, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m grateful. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I had to manage rent plus everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me for being blunt here,\u201d Jack said, \u201cbut I need the truth. Is Eric the father of your baby?\u201d</p><p>For the first time Shelly\u2019s eyes met his. \u201cThis baby is your son\u2019s. As soon as he or she is born, I\u2019ll be able to prove it without a doubt. Until then, I don\u2019t think it would do any good for Eric and me to see each other again.\u201d</p> <p>That answered Jack\u2019s other question even before he had the opportunity to ask. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your concern, Jack,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI appreciate it. But it doesn\u2019t matter what that clinic told Eric. Because I know differently. I\u2019ll be giving birth to the evidence in less than five months.\u201d</p><p>By the end of dinner, Jack didn\u2019t feel any closer to a solution. When he arrived home, Eric was sitting in front of the television eating from a large bag of potato chips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d his son said, keeping his gaze focused on the television.</p><p>\u201cI had dinner with Shelly in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Eric reached for the remote control and turned off the TV. \u201cYou were with Shelly?\u201d He frowned at Jack, as if waiting for him to elaborate. \u201cDid she call you?\u201d he finally asked.</p> <p>\u201cI called her.\u201d Jack shrugged off his raincoat and considered the best way to approach this dilemma.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her about the sperm test?\u201d Eric demanded. His son was on his feet now, outrage flashing from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any bread left this morning,\u201d Jack said, \u201cand the hot water was used up and then both towels were wet and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke my trust because I ate the last stale piece of bread in the house? Is that what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I was hoping that if I reasoned with Shelly, we might clear this up once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want me out of here, all you have to do is ask.\u201d Eric stormed into what had once been the spare bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I wanted you to move out,\u201d Jack said, but his words held little conviction.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, Dad,\u201d Eric said, rushing out of the room a minute later with his duffel bag. Clothes spilled out from all sides. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. You weren\u2019t much of a father when I needed one as a kid. I don\u2019t know what made me think you\u2019d be any different now.\u201d</p> <p>Jack groaned in frustration. He\u2019d made a mess of this when all he\u2019d been trying to do was get their lives back to normal. \u201cEric, listen, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d Eric repeated as if this was the most ridiculous comment he\u2019d ever heard. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201d</p><p>With that, he was gone and Jack wondered how long it would be before he heard from his son again.</p><p>Cedar Cove was a wonderful place to be at Christmastime, Maryellen mused as she opened the gallery the first Friday in December. Evergreen boughs were strung along both sides of Harbor Street</p><p>and large festive candy canes hung from each of the streetlights. The gallery itself was decorated with tiny white lights and elegantly draped swags of spruce that scented the air. It was the smell of Christmas to Maryellen, the smell she associated with childhood holidays\u2014and with her father. She had a sudden sharp memory of him, bringing in a fresh Christmas tree, stamping snow from his feet. Maryellen blinked back unexpected tears.</p><p>For some reason, she found herself thinking of Jon. It\u2019d been two weeks since Maryellen had last seen him, but, she suspected it wouldn\u2019t be long before he arrived at the gallery with more of his photographs. Especially since she hadn\u2019t brought them with her when she\u2019d left his house. Maryellen had done her best to prepare emotionally for this next confrontation. She couldn\u2019t allow what had happened to taint their business relationship. A thousand times since that night she\u2019d wanted to kick herself for giving in to her baser instincts. She had plenty of excuses to justify her actions, but time and truth had knocked down every one of them. It wasn\u2019t the wine or the moonlight, nor could she blame Jon for seducing her. She\u2019d been fully involved.</p><p>Almost as if Jon was aware that she was thinking of him, he showed up shortly after the gallery officially opened for business. Maryellen was busy with a customer when he came into the large open studio. She noticed that he had two framed photographs with him and guessed there were more in his vehicle.</p><p>Maryellen was still waiting on the customer as Jon made a second and then third trip, carrying photographs into the back room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to think it over,\u201d Mrs. Whitfield said.</p><p>It took Maryellen a moment to realize the doctor\u2019s wife was referring to the watercolor she\u2019d been considering as a Christmas gift for her husband.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Maryellen said. Then, with far too little warning, she was alone in the back room of the gallery with Jon.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said stiffly, doing her best to remain cordial and polite. Before leaving his house, she\u2019d told him their relationship, from that point forward, would be strictly business. She\u2019d meant it.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d His eyes probed her with such intensity she looked away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely morning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe sky\u2019s a dull gray and it\u2019s threatening to rain.\u201d</p><p>She smiled weakly. Obviously, small talk wasn\u2019t working, but when had it ever with this man? \u201cI see you\u2019ve brought me a few pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are the ones you left at my house. If you hadn\u2019t been in such a rush\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your bringing them by,\u201d she said, cutting him off before he could say something else to remind her of that evening.</p><p>\u201cI came for another reason,\u201d he said. He tucked his hands in the back pockets of his jeans. His pacing was making her nervous, and then she realized he was nervous, too. He stopped abruptly. \u201cAre you free Sunday afternoon? There\u2019s a dinner train I\u2019ve always wanted to take and I was hoping you\u2019d agree to come as my guest.\u201d</p><p>This was exactly what Maryellen had feared was going to happen. She held her breath so long that her lungs began to ache. \u201cThank you, but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He sounded hurt and confused.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said earlier. It\u2019s important that our relationship not become personal.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cA little late for that,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She ignored his remark. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in seeing you outside the gallery.\u201d She couldn\u2019t make it any plainer than that.</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who invited me to the Halloween party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and that was a mistake. The first of several. Listen, Jon, this is all rather embarrassing and awkward, but I\u2019d consider it a favor if you forgot all about what happened.\u201d</p><p>His frown darkened. \u201cThat\u2019s really what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>It looked as though he was going to argue with her, but then he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have any other choice do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Again, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen wrote him a receipt for the pictures and held it out to him.</p><p>An uncomfortable moment passed before he took the slip, turned and walked out of the gallery. As soon as he was gone, Maryellen closed her eyes and released her pent-up tension in the form of a deep sigh. She sagged onto the stool and tried to compose herself.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute here,\u201d Jon said, bursting back inside the room. \u201cI don\u2019t do a good job of pretending. Maybe you can forget what happened, but I can\u2019t. Dammit, Maryellen, what we had was good. Surely you can see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. Please don\u2019t make things any more difficult than they already are.\u201d She should\u2019ve known he wouldn\u2019t be willing to drop this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one making things difficult\u2014you are. Let\u2019s meet and talk this out. You decide when and where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d Jon said, pacing again. The old boards creaked beneath his feet as he walked around a gorgeous blue porcelain vase she was getting ready to display. \u201cIf you want to pretend it didn\u2019t happen, fine, be my guest, but I can\u2019t. I wish to God I could because I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about you. About us....\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest assured the matter is out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at that, recognizing her remark for the lie it was. \u201cIf you gave us a chance,\u201d he argued, \u201cyou might discover we have something worthwhile here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d she said as blandly as she could, wanting him to assume that this conversation was boring her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve misread the situation.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cYou do this sort of thing on a regular basis?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, hoping to sound amused when in reality she felt humiliated and ashamed. \u201cNot in a while...Jon, I\u2019m sorry if you read more into our night together than you should have, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he said, and raised his hands to stop her. \u201cI get the picture.\u201d</p><p>She sincerely hoped he did.</p><p>\u201cOur relationship is strictly business.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, forcing herself to smile. It probably looked more like a grimace.</p><p>He slowly surveyed the back room of the gallery. \u201cThat being the case, I won\u2019t trouble you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI appreciate that, Jon,\u201d she said gratefully.</p><p>\u201cWill you mail me a check once the photographs sell?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Maryellen didn\u2019t immediately make the connection. \u201cMail you a check? You mean you won\u2019t be in again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said starkly.</p> <p>\u201cAh...\u201d He had her flustered now. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I wanted to keep the personal out of this! There\u2019s no need to end our professional relationship, is there? I mean, your pictures are wonderful, really wonderful, and\u2014You will let someone else drop off your work, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The question fell between them and hung there for several tense seconds. While she waited for him to consider her solution, Maryellen clenched her hands behind her back. This wasn\u2019t what she wanted. She was proud to display his photographs. His work brought in customers and paid him well. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. A business relationship.</p><p>Jon held her gaze, and in him she saw anger and regret.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time I made arrangements with another gallery,\u201d he said with a shrug that looked anything but casual.</p><p>Maryellen bit back words that would ask him to reconsider, that would plead with him to stay. In a small voice she managed, \u201cIf this is what you prefer, then I can only wish you the best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t what I\u2019d prefer,\u201d he told her flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s what you want. Goodbye, Maryellen.\u201d</p><p>A thickness formed in her throat as Jon turned and for the second time started to leave. \u201cOh, hell,\u201d he muttered, turning back. He walked quickly toward her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, taking her by the shoulders. \u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t plan to bother you again, but I would like one last memory before I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling, reacting to the shock of his touch.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said hoarsely. Then he kissed her as if it was the only thing that had been on his mind from the moment she\u2019d dashed out of his home. His kiss was hard and hot and unbearably slow. By the time he tore his mouth from hers, the blood was pounding in her ears.</p><p>Maryellen tried to prevent herself from giving him the satisfaction of a response, but when he released her, she staggered back two steps and gasped for air. Her hand went to her throat in an instinctive reaction.</p><p>Muttering something she couldn\u2019t quite hear, Jon left and this time she knew it was for good. Her legs were unsteady and Maryellen felt close to tears. Making her way to the coffeepot, she poured herself a cup and was shocked by how badly her hand trembled as she filled the mug.</p> <p>He\u2019d kissed her like that because he wanted her to remember him. To remember the night they\u2019d spent together. His ploy had worked far too well. Maryellen shut her eyes, and their slow, seductive lovemaking played back in her mind. She recalled how he\u2019d touched her, the feel of his strong, masculine hands as he\u2019d explored her body, caressing her first with his fingers and then his tongue. She remembered in vivid detail the sensations she\u2019d experienced as he made love to her. She\u2019d wanted him with a passion that was difficult to renounce.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t set out to hurt Jon, but she could see that she had. In the process she was hurting herself, too. Jon didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d rejected him. He didn\u2019t know, and he never would. She\u2019d sent him away for a reason that lay buried deep inside her.</p><p>She\u2019d walked this path once before and still bore the scars. Sometimes emotional wounds were harder to heal than physical ones. Sometimes they never healed at all.</p><p>Strings of Christmas tree lights were spread out on the living room floor when Zach woke on Saturday morning.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d Eddie said when Zach looked in, yawning, on his way to the kitchen. His son sat amid the lights, straightening them and draping the long cords along the back of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with those?\u201d he asked. Rosie liked having the outside of the house decorated with Christmas lights, but he\u2019d always found it a nuisance. He glanced at the clock and saw it was barely seven. Apparently Rosie was already up.</p><p>\u201cMom got them out,\u201d Eddie explained, and stuck the plug into an outlet. Lights instantly blazed, nearly blinding Zach.</p><p>He suspected this was his wife\u2019s less-than-subtle hint that she wanted him to string up the lights this morning. Great, just great. She might\u2019ve mentioned it earlier, but then they weren\u2019t on the best of terms these days. Remaining civil during the Christmas holidays was going to be difficult if Thanksgiving was any indication. Somehow they\u2019d made it through the day without a major blowup\u2014probably because Rosie had spent most of the afternoon in the kitchen with her sister, no doubt complaining about him.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mother?\u201d he asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Zach checked the time again. \u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas Bazaar at the high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing there?\u201d</p><p>Eddie shrugged. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me. Can we go to McDonald\u2019s for breakfast? I\u2019m getting tired of Pop-Tarts.\u201d</p><p>Zach stared at his son. This nine-year-old kid actually believed the alternative to Pop-Tarts was a meal outside the home. Rosie had gotten so lax in carrying out her responsibilities as a full-time wife and mother that their children didn\u2019t even know that most families ate meals together around a table.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>Eddie\u2019s urgent cry cut into his thoughts. \u201cLook!\u201d He pointed to the television. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Zach studied the screen and watched some remote-controlled monster truck propel itself over a huge dirt mound with a deafening roar.</p><p>\u201cMom said I could have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did, did she?\u201d Zach would talk to Rose about that. He wasn\u2019t forking over a couple of hundred bucks for a stupid toy. Wandering into the kitchen, he discovered that the coffee wasn\u2019t on but his wife had taken a moment to jot him a note, which she\u2019d propped up next to the automatic drip pot.</p><p>Working until four at the Bazaar. Put up the outside lights, okay? Allison\u2019s at a slumber party and will need a ride home. If you have a chance, would you buy the Christmas tree? See you later.</p><p>Rosie</p><p>His wife had forgotten to mention she\u2019d be working at the bazaar. That was predictable enough. But he\u2019d hoped that for once they\u2019d have a day together without obligations or demands. It used to be that buying the Christmas tree was a family event; they\u2019d go to the lot together and everyone had a say. Decorating it was fun, with music playing in the background and popcorn popping and hot cider. These days, getting and trimming the tree was an afterthought, a nuisance that had to be fitted into the cracks in Rosie\u2019s overbooked schedule.</p><p>\u201cCan we go to McDonald\u2019s for breakfast?\u201d Eddie asked a second time.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he muttered, noting that there wasn\u2019t any milk in the refrigerator. Not only had Rosie left him with a to-do list, but the house was devoid of groceries.</p><p>Zach was furious all morning about his wife\u2019s lack of attentiveness when it came to her family. He remembered what Janice Lamond had told him about the special Saturday she\u2019d planned for her son. She was clearly the type of mother who made her child a priority.</p><p>After breakfast at McDonald\u2019s, Zach collected Allison from her friend\u2019s place, and then, with Eddie\u2019s help, tackled putting up the Christmas lights.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to buy our tree today?\u201d Eddie asked while Zach stood on the ladder and attached the lights along the roofline of the house. He gazed down on his son, who was looking anxiously up at him.</p><p>\u201cAsk your sister if she wants to come,\u201d Zach called.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Eddie raced into the house. He wasn\u2019t gone more than fifteen seconds. \u201cAllison said she\u2019ll come if she has to. We don\u2019t need her, do we, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her we need her.\u201d</p><p>Eddie stared up at him, his face a picture of disbelief and disgust. Zach couldn\u2019t keep from laughing. With a twinge of regret he realized it was the first time he\u2019d smiled all day. It wasn\u2019t his children\u2019s fault that Rosie chose to spend her day with strangers rather than her own family. Once she was home, Zach intended to have a very long talk with his wife.</p><p>Buying the Christmas tree proved to be one more annoying episode in a day that had started off badly and quickly gotten worse. By the time they returned to the house, the kids were bickering and hungry. When Zach pulled into the garage, he saw that Rosie\u2019s car was there.</p><p>\u201cWe got the tree, Mom,\u201d Eddie announced as he rushed into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Zach said, determined to put on a happy front until he had a private moment with his wife. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>Rosie sat on the sofa with her feet up. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. How did everything go at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cDad and I got the Christmas lights up. We went out to breakfast at McDonald\u2019s and then we stopped at the store and bought milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got groceries?\u201d Rosie asked, a look of relief in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust milk and bread.\u201d Again it was Eddie who answered. \u201cDad thought we should make tomato soup and toasted cheese sandwiches for lunch, and we needed stuff for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you guys had a nice day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to decorate the tree tonight?\u201d Allison asked, her expression bored.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, sweetheart,\u201d Rosie answered simultaneously.</p><p>Allison glanced from Zach to Rosie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just spent nine hours on my feet,\u201d Rosie said. \u201cThe last thing I want to do now is decorate a tree. We can do it tomorrow after church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Allison complained. \u201cThe French Club is having their bake sale in the mall, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Rosie rubbed a hand over her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to help with that, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom...\u201d Their daughter sounded both hurt and provoked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about dinner?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>They\u2019d already had pizza once that week and KFC another night. Zach realized this was an especially busy time of year, but it seemed important that they have at least one meal a week as a family.</p><p>\u201cWho wants what?\u201d Rosie asked.</p><p>\u201cPizza,\u201d Eddie shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Allison insisted.</p><p>Zach frowned.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you want meat loaf and mashed potatoes,\u201d Rosie muttered just loudly enough for Zach to hear.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be nice,\u201d he said, and then added, \u201cfor once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to do the tree or not?\u201d Allison asked, slouching on the sofa next to her mother.</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what your father wants.\u201d Their voices mingled as, again, they spoke at the same time.</p><p>Allison stood and headed toward the hallway. \u201cYou two work it out and when you\u2019ve decided what you want to do, let me know. I\u2019ll be in my room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if he, too, sensed that a fight was brewing, Eddie disappeared into his bedroom immediately afterward.</p><p>The silence after they left was deafening.</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve told me you planned to be gone all day,\u201d Zach said, unable to hold back his resentment.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Rosie flared.</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday night, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I remembered, I wouldn\u2019t be bringing it up now, would I?\u201d</p><p>Rosie propelled herself off the sofa and marched into the kitchen. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I don\u2019t want to argue, either. But I\u2019m sick of this, Rosie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it with you?\u201d she demanded, whirling around. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I said was that I don\u2019t remember you telling me you\u2019d be gone all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you said.\u201d He was fast losing his temper. \u201cYou might\u2019ve reminded me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, so I could listen to you complain about it?\u201d</p><p>Ah, so that was it. She saw him as complaining. The finger had been pointed and it was aimed in his direction.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m making up a to-do list for you,\u201d he snapped, grabbing a pen and paper. \u201cFirst, we need groceries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were at the store. You might\u2019ve picked up more than milk and bread, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work forty hours a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cLook around you and answer that question for yourself. If you are employed, exactly who are you working for? Not your family. Not me. Not our children. A Christmas Bazaar is more important than a Saturday with your family. A bake sale at the mall outweighs decorating a Christmas tree.\u201d</p><p>Rosie slammed a pound of frozen hamburger into the microwave. \u201cDon\u2019t paint yourself as a martyr in this marriage, Zachary Cox. If you think you\u2019re so perfect, then you can start doing more to help around here. Who said it was my responsibility to buy the groceries? You seem to think that because I don\u2019t have a nine-to-five job, you can rule my days. I have a life, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell!\u201d Eddie screamed. \u201cDon\u2019t yell anymore!\u201d He stood in the kitchen entrance, tears in his eyes, his hands covering his ears.</p><p>\u201cEddie, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Rosie cried, sounding close to weeping herself. She bent down to hug their son and cast an accusing glare at Zach. \u201cNow look what you\u2019ve done!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d Funny how everything got turned around so that he was the one at fault.</p><p>Zach waited until after dinner\u2014a pot of chili thrown together in about twenty minutes, but still an improvement over recent meals\u2014before approaching his wife again. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we have several issues that need to be addressed,\u201d he began as she watched a rerun of \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral issues,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou sound like an attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I sound like an attorney. Let\u2019s just get through the holidays. The kids are hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly overwhelmed with happiness myself.\u201d He walked out of the family room and into the bedroom. A second television was set up there. He put on the History Channel and tried to watch a documentary about Napoleon.</p><p>Rosie came in an hour later. \u201cDo you want to talk this out?\u201d</p><p>He glanced in her direction and frankly couldn\u2019t see the point of any discussion. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Just remember I tried, Zach. I sincerely tried. But you\u2019re impossible.\u201d</p><p>If she was trying so hard, then she\u2019d be with her family where she belonged, Zach thought and steeled himself against giving in. Rosie was the transgressor here, and he wasn\u2019t going to drop this until she owned up to her faults.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Grace hadn\u2019t been sleeping well since Thanksgiving Day. The more she dwelled on the phone calls, the more she came to believe it\u2019d been Dan on the other end of the line. For some sick reason, her ex-husband felt it was necessary to destroy what little peace she\u2019d found in the months since his disappearance. It had occurred to her that he might even have someone feeding him information about the details of her life. That would explain the timing of the calls.</p><p>During the last three weeks, she\u2019d consistently awakened about four in the morning, when the night was its darkest. She was unable to return to sleep and lay there overwhelmed by guilt and fear and pain. She felt anger, too, as she imagined where he was and who he was with\u2014imagined them laughing at her. It had been like this in the beginning, but gradually she\u2019d come to terms with the shock of Dan\u2019s actions. Now, following the phone calls, it was bad again, as bad as it had been those first few weeks.</p><p>When Grace arrived at the library on Monday morning, her eyes burned from lack of sleep and her spirits were in the doldrums. The only positive feeling she had about the holidays had to do with her grandson. Little Tyler was almost four months old now, and the very light of her life. The problems of the world faded away when she held her grandbaby.</p><p>Cliff Harding entered the library just before noon. Grace sensed his presence even before she saw him. He returned a book and then casually strolled toward her desk. He wore a lazy smile that touched her with its warmth.</p><p>Grace\u2019s mouth went dry, and despite herself, she felt flustered. She knew he\u2019d gone to see his daughter on the East Coast, but she hadn\u2019t heard from him since, and for that she was grateful.</p><p>\u201cIf I asked you to lunch, would you come?\u201d he whispered, leaning against her desk.</p><p>Before she could answer, he added, \u201cCharlotte told me your divorce was final Thanksgiving week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d She swallowed hard, unsure how to tell him what was in her heart. She wasn\u2019t ready to get involved in another relationship. And she didn\u2019t know when she would be. The divorce might be final but the questions, the doubts and fears, continued to haunt her. Legally she was free, but emotionally she clung to the past.</p><p>\u201cLunch?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a walk along the waterfront? The sun\u2019s out and a leisurely stroll would do us both good.\u201d</p><p>Grace agreed; it seemed like a reasonable compromise. \u201cLet me check with Loretta first.\u201d</p><p>Her assistant was more than willing to switch lunch hours. Grace gathered her coat and gloves and met him in front of the library. Cliff was studying the mural when she joined him. The painting was a favorite of hers; the artist had depicted a late 1800s waterfront scene with a family picnicking in the background.</p><p>\u201cHow was your visit with Lisa?\u201d she asked. From previous conversations, Grace had learned that his daughter was twenty-eight and married to a financial advisor in Maryland.</p><p>\u201cWonderful. She asked me if I was dating yet.\u201d He looked meaningfully in her direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d Grace asked. She buried her hands in the pockets of her long wool coat and matched her pace to his as they walked toward the gazebo and picnic area. The grandstand was where the Concerts on the Cove were staged each Thursday night during the summer. Now, in mid-December, the whole park was bleak and empty. Their only company was a bevy of seagulls who circled above looking for a handout. Their piercing, discordant cries echoed across the waterfront.</p><p>\u201cI told Lisa not yet, but I\u2019d picked out the girl.\u201d Again he studied Grace. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for the girl to notice me.\u201d</p><p>Notice him? Grace nearly laughed out loud. She\u2019d noticed Cliff, all right. But she stood frozen with one foot in her old life and the other unwillingly thrust into a new one.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep me waiting long, Grace Sherman?\u201d</p><p>She wished she had an answer for him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cI promised myself I wasn\u2019t going to press you.\u201d He exhaled, and his breath created a fog in the cold, crisp air. \u201cYou asked about my visit with Lisa and I can tell you it was definitely an experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day after I arrived, a blizzard hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about that on the news,\u201d Grace said, remembering the report of the snowstorm that had struck the East Coast Thanksgiving Week. \u201cDid you lose your electricity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight in the middle of cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Naturally, the turkey was only partially done. I suggested we serve sushi turkey but no one seemed interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat any enterprising soul would. The turkey got barbecued in the middle of a snowstorm.\u201d</p><p>Grace laughed, picturing Cliff huddled over a barbecue with wind and snow whirling all around.</p><p>\u201cHow about your Thanksgiving?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was quiet with just me and Maryellen.\u201d She gnawed on her lower lip, wondering if she should mention Dan\u2019s phone calls. In the end, she didn\u2019t. Then, feeling guilty and uneasy about what she had to say to him, she sank onto the edge of a picnic bench. \u201cListen, Cliff, maybe this isn\u2019t such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Us taking a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...Your daughter\u2019s anxious for you to get out into the dating world again and you appear to be ready. I want you to start, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for me just yet.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as if she\u2019d completely missed the point. \u201cWhat you apparently don\u2019t understand, Grace, is that the only woman I\u2019m interested in dating is you.\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head. \u201cCome on, Cliff\u2014I don\u2019t believe that. Ask Charlotte to recommend someone. She knows just about everyone in town and once you\u2019ve met a few other women, you can decide if you still feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>His frown was back in place. \u201cYou\u2019re not the jealous type, I take it?\u201d</p><p>A year earlier her response would have been automatic. There wasn\u2019t a jealous bone in her body, she would\u2019ve said. She couldn\u2019t say that any longer. Until a few months ago, she hadn\u2019t viewed herself as possessive. Then she\u2019d learned that Dan had been seen with another woman. Afterward she\u2019d been filled with such rage that she\u2019d torn the bedroom apart and dumped his entire half of the closet outside. Dan\u2019s clothes had been strewn across the front porch and the yard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d she told him. \u201cI think most people are capable of jealousy. Anyway, I want you to promise me you\u2019ll at least consider meeting other women. It\u2019ll be good for you, Cliff.\u201d Good for her, too, perhaps.</p><p>He walked over to the middle of the large gazebo, stood there a moment, then purposefully strolled back. \u201cOkay. I considered it.\u201d</p><p>Grace laughed, shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking me seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I am.\u201d Cliff sat down on the bench beside her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see any other woman, Grace. I\u2019ll wait for you. Like I told you before, I\u2019m a patient man. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to pressure you, but I might give you a gentle reminder every now and then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace didn\u2019t know why he remained persistent. She hadn\u2019t given him any encouragement. And so far, she\u2019d been the only one to benefit from this relationship\u2014she and her garage door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to show you my place someday,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cYou and Charlotte can both come. In fact, I\u2019d enjoy it if you would. It\u2019d be completely nonthreatening,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cYou can even bring Buttercup if you want.\u201d</p><p>Grace thought about it. She\u2019d formed an image of his home, and she was curious to find out if the reality matched her expectations. She nodded. \u201cI\u2019d enjoy a tour,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to learn how to ride, Brownie\u2019s the one who\u2019ll teach you everything you need to know. She\u2019s gentle as the day is long, and she\u2019s the perfect horse for a beginner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s agreeable to that, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure is.\u201d Cliff\u2019s eyes danced. \u201cSo, should I schedule an outing this month?\u201d</p><p>December was usually crowded with engagements, but in her current frame of mind, Grace wasn\u2019t in the mood to socialize. The prospect of visiting Cliff\u2019s ranch strongly appealed to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free on Saturday afternoon, if Charlotte is.\u201d</p><p>Cliff looked pleased. \u201cI\u2019ll find out and get back to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou meant that, about Buttercup coming along?\u201d Her dog was an important part of her life and Grace liked the idea of the golden retriever accompanying her.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Cliff reached for her gloved hand, taking it between his own. His eyes met hers, and he smiled. \u201cI keep telling you I\u2019m patient, Grace, and it\u2019s true. I\u2019m willing to wait for what I want.\u201d Then he turned over her hand and kissed the inside of her wrist.</p><p>Grace closed her eyes to savor the moment. She wanted this too. As much as he did\u2014maybe more\u2014but first she had to get Dan out of her head. And out of her heart. Because, despite everything, he still claimed a piece of it.</p><p>Maryellen didn\u2019t need the pregnancy test kit to tell her what she already knew. Sitting on the edge of her bathtub, she stared at the little blue stick and felt the numbness spread into her arms and legs. It\u2019d been nearly a month now, and she\u2019d done her best to ignore what was becoming increasingly obvious.</p><p>Striking her forehead with the heel of her hand, she closed her eyes. \u201cStupid, stupid, stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Panic grew inside her until she was sure she was going to faint. Regaining control of her emotions required a monumental effort.</p><p>When she could manage it, she stood and studied her reflection in the bathroom mirror. How pale she was. That explained a comment she\u2019d received earlier in the day. A longtime customer had stopped by the gallery, taken a hard look at Maryellen and asked if she\u2019d had the flu.</p><p>A bad case of the flu would\u2019ve been welcome, compared to confronting the truth of her situation.</p><p>What should she do? The question rolled around in her mind like a marble inside a tin can. Difficult as it was, she tried for a while to pretend that nothing was wrong. But after heating a frozen entr\u00e9e in the microwave, she sat at the kitchen table and sorted through her emotions.</p><p>One thing was clear. She wasn\u2019t telling Jon Bowman. He was completely out of the picture as far as she was concerned. There was no reason to tell him. No reason to see him. Jon\u2019s work was now being represented elsewhere. He need never know about the pregnancy until after the baby was born, and then he\u2019d no doubt assume some other man was the father. That was exactly what Maryellen wanted.</p><p>The thought that perhaps he had a right to know wasn\u2019t something she could accept at the moment. The thought that perhaps he, too, had a responsibility toward this baby\u2014no. She rejected the idea without further consideration.</p><p>Another concern arose: the necessity of keeping this news a secret from her friends and family for as long as possible. A year earlier when Kelly was pregnant, her sister had barely showed. Even in her seventh month, Kelly had worn her everyday clothes. Maryellen hoped she might be able to hide her condition until then, as well. She\u2019d wear loose dresses and make a point of staying away from formfitting business attire. Hiding her pregnancy would be a challenge but she\u2019d do it while she could.</p><p>She needed to make room in her life for the baby. This unplanned pregnancy was a shock but she\u2019d quickly adjusted to it. In a sense, she was getting an opportunity she\u2019d never anticipated. This child, her child, was taking shape within her womb, and for a moment she was almost giddy with joy. Then reality hit.</p> <p>In a little less than eight months she\u2019d be a mother. Life was giving her a second chance, and this time she wasn\u2019t going to repeat the mistakes of the past. This time she wouldn\u2019t allow a man to dictate her life\u2014and that of her child.</p><p>Overwhelmed by emotion and full of half-formed plans, Maryellen found that sitting at home held little appeal. The Christmas shopping season was in full swing, and if ever there was a night she needed gaiety and fun, it was now.</p><p>She headed for the shopping complex on Cedar Cove Drive</p><p>, next to the six-plex theater. The strip mall held several small businesses, a Wal-Mart, a huge craft store and a hardware outlet. The parking lot was nearly full. Maryellen walked toward the cinemas and glanced over the selections offered, but didn\u2019t see any that piqued her interest.</p><p>Rummaging around the craft store seemed a far more interesting prospect. It wasn\u2019t until she was walking across the parking lot that she saw Jon, coming in her direction. Instinctively, Maryellen froze. Jon saw her and he, too, stopped in his tracks. Each seemed to be waiting for the other to make the first move.</p><p>Maryellen recovered before he did and even managed a smile as she continued toward him. \u201cMerry Christmas, Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Maryellen.\u201d His look was guarded, closed. \u201cChristmas shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrowsing.\u201d Her shopping had been finished months earlier.</p><p>He merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019ve taken your photographs into Seattle.\u201d The rumor mill had been quick to inform her that his work was now being displayed in a large Seattle gallery. It was a coup for him and she was pleased to hear it, although the Harbor Street Gallery would miss the money his work generated.</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Jon.\u201d She genuinely meant that.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>No need to stand in the middle of a parking lot. \u201cWell, it was nice seeing you.\u201d That was stretching the truth, but it would be impolite to say anything else. She started to walk past him when he stopped her.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She knew she sounded impatient.</p><p>\u201cAbout that night.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, not wanting to hear it. \u201cHaven\u2019t we already discussed it to death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said.\u201d She didn\u2019t dare look at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that I didn\u2019t protect you, if you know what I mean.\u201d He shrugged when she failed to respond. \u201cDo you really need me to spell it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d An explanation was the last thing she needed. Not when she knew better than he did exactly what the consequence of that night could be\u2014what, in fact, it was.</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right? I mean, is there a possibility that...you know.\u201d His concern was evident in his anxious frown.</p><p>She forced a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am worried.\u201d His eyes clouded. \u201cI need to know\u2014to be sure.\u201d</p><p>For one terrifying moment, Maryellen was afraid he\u2019d guessed. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Jon. I appreciate your concern but the situation\u2019s under control.\u201d</p><p>His relief was evident as the tension eased from his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>He held her eyes a second or two longer, then abruptly turned away.</p><p>Now Maryellen could finally relax. She expelled her breath and hurried into the Tulips and Things Craft Store.</p><p>On Friday, five days before Christmas, Maryellen took her lunch break down at the Potbelly Deli, which served wonderful soups and inventive sandwiches. The restaurant was a local favorite, and she went there as often as she could. Enjoying a cup of the seafood chowder, Maryellen sat in the corner by herself, reading an art magazine, when her mother stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw you in here,\u201d Grace said. \u201cDo you mind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it.\u201d Although they lived and worked in the same town, a week would slip past without the chance to talk or visit.</p><p>Her mother ordered a bowl of the tomato bisque soup and a cup of coffee, then sat in the chair across from her. \u201cI had a visitor not long ago.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Maryellen long to guess. \u201cCliff Harding?\u201d</p><p>Blushing, Grace nodded. \u201cHe invited me and Buttercup to see his horse ranch. I went out there on Saturday.\u201d She stirred her soup and didn\u2019t look up. \u201cCharlotte was going to come originally, but she wasn\u2019t feeling well, so it was just Cliff, me, Buttercup and the horses. He has magnificent horses.\u201d After a slight pause she continued, adding comments about the home, a two-story log house, and the acreage\u2014pastures, woods and even a stream.</p><p>Maryellen couldn\u2019t remember seeing her mother more animated about anything in quite a while. \u201cThat sounds wonderful.\u201d It was a step in the right direction that her mother had agreed to this outing with Cliff.</p><p>Grace tasted the soup, crumbled a package of oyster crackers and dumped them in. When she glanced up, she stared at Maryellen for a moment, her eyes narrowed. \u201cMy goodness, you\u2019re terribly pale,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you feeling sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pale?\u201d She tried to pretend this was news.</p><p>\u201cYou look anemic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Her mother studied her, frowning slightly. \u201cI want you to promise me you\u2019ll make a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to see a doctor,\u201d she said, wanting to laugh off her concern. \u201cThe next thing I know, you\u2019ll be lecturing me about eating prunes the way Mrs. Jefferson always does.\u201d</p><p>Grace swallowed another mouthful of soup. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make the appointment, then I will. I don\u2019t remember ever seeing you this pale. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think you were pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The words shocked Maryellen so badly that she choked on her soup. She coughed and wheezed, tears springing to her eyes, and her mother leaped up and pounded her hard on the back.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen reached for her water glass and sipped. \u201cI\u2019m fine...I think.\u201d</p><p>A minute or more passed, and Maryellen could feel her mother\u2019s scrutiny. When Grace finally spoke, her voice was low. \u201cYour father was always closest to Kelly,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were the one I identified with most. We\u2019re quite a bit alike. You realize that, don\u2019t you? My hair was once the exact shade of yours. My eyes are the same dark brown.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen didn\u2019t know where this conversation was leading, but she had her suspicions. \u201cYou\u2019re my mother,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cOf course I look like you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mother\u2019s voice fell to a whisper. \u201cI was a senior in high school when I discovered I was pregnant with you.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen swallowed hard. The details of her birth hadn\u2019t ever been openly discussed, although she\u2019d figured out in her early teens that her mother had gotten pregnant in high school.</p><p>\u201cI told Dan, and we had no idea what we were going to do. It was important that we wait until after graduation before we told our parents, but my mother knew. I never had to tell her about you, and do you know why?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s eyes filled with tears and she picked up her napkin, crumpling it in her hands. \u201cBecause you were so pale?\u201d</p> <p>Her mother nodded. \u201cI was anemic, too. Young and healthy though I was, the pregnancy drained me and I looked deathly pale. It wasn\u2019t a severe case, just enough for me to need a prescription for iron tablets.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything else, didn\u2019t press Maryellen or throw questions at her. Instead she waited.</p><p>\u201cThen you know,\u201d Maryellen said after a moment, fighting hard not to weep openly in public.</p><p>\u201cThe father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the picture,\u201d she said, not wanting to mention Jon\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maryellen...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said, putting on a brave front, \u201creally I will. Mom, I\u2019m almost thirty-six years old. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took some adjusting, but now that I\u2019ve accepted this, I\u2019m happy.\u201d The joy was decidedly absent at the moment with tears making wet tracks down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWe always had this connection, Maryellen,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI knew. Somehow I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t always, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Grace looked up at her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we had this special connection fifteen years ago, you would\u2019ve known then, too.\u201d</p><p>Her mother stared at her with wide, disbelieving eyes.</p><p>There, it was out\u2014a piece of the truth that she\u2019d assumed would remain forever buried. Her sin, her pain, the guilt she\u2019d carried with her for all these years.</p><p>\u201cYou were pregnant before?\u201d</p><p>The lump in her throat was so big, she could only answer with a nod.</p><p>\u201cLeave it to you to wait until the last minute to put up a tree,\u201d Olivia teased Jack as he took the first package of decorative balls from a shopping bag. Actually, Olivia thought it was rather a sweet gesture on Jack\u2019s part. Eric had briefly moved out but was back, much to Jack\u2019s relief. He\u2019d bought the Christmas tree in an effort to lift his son\u2019s spirits over the holidays and Olivia had agreed to help him decorate it. This had entailed buying lights and decorations, since Jack hadn\u2019t bothered much with Christmas since his divorce.</p><p>Eric had grown progressively more depressed at the approach of Christmas. Jack had done what he could to pull his son out of his melancholy but to no avail. Two days before Christmas, he invited Olivia over to decorate a Christmas tree while Eric was out. They hoped the surprise would jolt him into a more cheerful frame of mind.</p><p>\u201cI kind of like this pitiful tree,\u201d Jack said, stepping back to examine it. The branches all seemed to be bunched on one side, while the other side was almost bare.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Charlie Brown tree for sure.\u201d In Olivia\u2019s opinion, this was the sorriest-looking evergreen in the lot, but she agreed it held a certain appeal. She\u2019d brought some leftover ornaments, along with a CD of Christmas music, and they were in business.</p><p>Andy Williams\u2019s voice crooned as a small fire blazed in the fireplace. \u201cSo?\u201d Jack asked, rearranging the string of twinkling white lights. \u201cAre you doing anything special after this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I\u2019d let you take me to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Taco Shack?\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed. Nine times out of ten, that was the restaurant Jack chose. \u201cDo they still owe you for advertising?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can eat there for another twenty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>Jack hung a plastic gingerbread man on a drooping tree limb. \u201cYou like Mexican food, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\u2014but I enjoy the company more.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Jack grabbed her around the waist, preparing to kiss her. Olivia certainly wasn\u2019t objecting, but then the door opened and Jack stopped abruptly. He loosened his grip and Olivia nearly fell to the floor, catching herself just in time.</p><p>\u201cEric,\u201d Jack said, sounding startled. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you for a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>His son walked into the room, looking about as gloomy as a man can get. He didn\u2019t appear to notice that Olivia and Jack had been in the middle of a kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou picked up the mail?\u201d</p><p>Eric nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Olivia asked. The boy seemed to be in shock.</p><p>Eric slouched forward and dropped the mail on the coffee table. \u201cI heard from Shelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wrote you?\u201d Jack seemed encouraged by this development.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Eric covered his face with his hands. \u201cShe sent me a picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA picture?\u201d Jack frowned. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby,\u201d Eric supplied. Then he straightened and looked them both full in the face. \u201cCorrection, babies. Shelly\u2019s having twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins!\u201d Jack fell back onto the sofa.</p><p>Eric reached for the top envelope and withdrew a folded paper. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jack clambered to his feet. He took the paper and examined it, with Olivia glancing over his shoulder. Sure enough, the fuzzy photograph revealed two distinct fetuses. They were positioned in such a way that it was easy to detect the sex. \u201cBoth boys from the look of it,\u201d Jack announced.</p><p>\u201cShelly didn\u2019t include a note with the ultrasound results?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eric said, \u201cbut when I got this, I thought we should talk, so I drove over to the apartment...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Jack pressed.</p><p>Eric ran his hand over his face and didn\u2019t seem to know where to start. \u201cThe thing is, I love Shelly. These last few months have been hell, the two of us being separated like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been hell for me, too,\u201d Jack muttered, and Olivia elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cDid you have the chance to talk to Shelly?\u201d she asked sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI told her the truth,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI love her, I\u2019ve always loved her. I don\u2019t care if the baby\u2014the babies are mine or not, I want to be with her.\u201d He rubbed his face a second time and Olivia thought he might break into tears. \u201cI can\u2019t do any better than that, can I? I\u2019ve already given her my heart. I offered her my forgiveness, too. What more can I do?\u201d</p><p>Olivia groaned. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need your forgiveness, Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be my babies,\u201d Eric cried. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to make them mine, if she\u2019d let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe refused?\u201d Jack was clearly outraged. \u201cThe woman needs to see a shrink! You both do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d His son didn\u2019t need chastisement now; he was already depressed. It wouldn\u2019t help to heap more blame and censure on his burdened shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShelly wouldn\u2019t talk to me. She threw me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf your own home?\u201d Jack was practically growling. \u201cThe woman is a fruitcake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Olivia elbowed him again. He was making matters worse instead of better. \u201cLet the boy tell us in his own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jack said, although he didn\u2019t sound it.</p><p>\u201cI went to talk things over with Shelly. I wanted her to know that I don\u2019t care who the father is. Me, this new guy she works with or some man on the street.\u201d His face hardened, and while he might be saying the words, Olivia found it difficult to believe them.</p><p>\u201cAnd she threw you out?\u201d Again it was Jack whose voice rose in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cShelly was crying too hard for me to hear what she said, but she made one thing plain,\u201d Eric murmured. \u201cShe wanted me out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen,\u201d Jack muttered. \u201cCan\u2019t live with \u2019em, can\u2019t live without \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop,\u201d Olivia demanded. \u201cCut the clich\u00e9s and the unhelpful comments, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jack cast her an apologetic look.</p><p>\u201cShelly said it would be best if I was completely out of her life.\u201d Eric spoke in dull tones, and his misery was breaking Olivia\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the babies?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said...it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late? What did she mean by that?\u201d Jack shouted.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want anything more to do with me.\u201d He seemed even closer to tears. \u201cAt least, I think that\u2019s what she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might\u2019ve been saying something else,\u201d Jack said desperately. \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t understand....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understood the door she slammed in my face,\u201d Eric told him. \u201cIt\u2019s over for us, I know that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not be hasty,\u201d Jack said. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric, sit down,\u201d Olivia instructed, ignoring Jack. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a pot of coffee, and then the three of us are going to discuss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to discuss?\u201d Eric asked, shrugging hopelessly.</p><p>\u201cQuite a bit, actually, because those babies are going to need their daddy and\u2014\u201d she paused and stared pointedly at Jack \u201c\u2014their grandfather, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat more can I do?\u201d Eric asked again, following Olivia into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said confidently, gathering him close. \u201cLife has a way of turning out for the best. If your mother was here instead of in Kansas City, she\u2019d tell you the same thing. It\u2019s painful just now, but be patient. Shelly will eventually reach out to you. She needs you, Eric, and she wants you back in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d His eagerness to believe, made his expression\u2014so vulnerable and expectant\u2014almost painful to watch.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Olivia nodded, sincere in what she said to him. In her experience, a woman didn\u2019t maintain as much contact as Shelly had\u2014dinner with Jack, sending the ultrasound pictures\u2014if she wanted to sever all relations with a man. The things she\u2019d said to Jack, suggesting that she and Eric would see each other after the birth, struck Olivia as promising, too.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eric echoed. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t answer,\u201d she said and wanted to kick Jack for bringing it up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very wise person, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Eric said, looking at her in admiration. He finally seemed to relax a little.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great,\u201d Jack agreed.</p><p>\u201cNow, how about helping us decorate this Charlie Brown Christmas tree?\u201d Olivia urged.</p><p>Eric hesitated and then gave her a huge grin. \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>In her heart of hearts, Olivia was convinced that everything would work out for Shelly, Eric and the twins\u2014no matter who their father was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ten</p><p>Over the years, Olivia had given a number of speeches. She tended to shy away from accepting these engagements, but in her position as an elected official, they were unavoidable. This was the first time she\u2019d been asked to speak at the HenryM.JacksonSeniorCenter, and she was admittedly nervous.</p><p>The senior potluck luncheons were held on the first Monday of each month. Last June, Mary Berger had asked Olivia to be the January speaker. Six months had never passed so quickly. Olivia had dutifully written the appointment in her date book and then promptly forgotten all about it. Not until she opened her appointment book for the New Year did the reminder jump out at her.</p><p>Naturally, her mother was excited about having \u201cmy daughter, the judge,\u201d come and speak to her friends. Knowing Charlotte, she\u2019d gloat for a month. Olivia appreciated her mother\u2019s support, but found her pride excessive and a little embarrassing. Charlotte took every opportunity to tell friends and strangers alike that her only daughter was a judge; worse, she was prone to detailing Olivia\u2019s various judgments, complete with commentaries of her own.</p> <p>As Olivia dressed for the luncheon, she paused, standing inside her walk-in closet, and frowned as she thought about her mother. Charlotte had overdone it this holiday season, baking for friends, visiting and supervising events at the SeniorCenter, writing the seniors\u2019 column each week.</p><p>By Christmas Day, Charlotte was exhausted. It used to be that nothing slowed her down. For the first time, Olivia realized that her mother\u2019s age had caught up with her. Charlotte just wasn\u2019t her usual self, although she valiantly tried to hide how worn-out she was.</p><p>Christmas afternoon, when the family gathered at her mother\u2019s house, Charlotte had looked pale and drawn. As soon as they\u2019d finished dinner, Olivia insisted she rest. Charlotte had, of course, resisted. Olivia wondered how she was going to convince her mother to take on fewer commitments in the new year.</p><p>Choosing a soft suede dress in a pale tan color with a brown and gold scarf, Olivia arrived at the SeniorCenter a few minutes early. Charlotte and her best friend, Laura, were at the door waiting for her. Beaming with pride, her mother immediately hugged Olivia as though it\u2019d been months\u2014rather than a few days\u2014since they were last together.</p><p>\u201cYou remember Laura, don\u2019t you?\u201d her mother asked unnecessarily, drawing Olivia into the large room, which was set up with tables seating eight, a buffet area and a slightly raised stage that held the speaker\u2019s podium plus the head table.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Olivia said, smiling warmly at her mother\u2019s knitting friend. Charlotte and Laura were the people responsible for inspiring the thriving seniors\u2019 knitting group. The enthusiastic Laura was an accomplished knitter and Olivia had always suspected she could convince the whole world that peace was a possibility if everyone took up knitting needles instead of guns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pleased you could accept our invitation,\u201d Mary Berger, the center\u2019s social director, said as she approached Olivia. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to hearing what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled blandly. She was nervous already and hoped she could pull this off without stumbling over her notes and humiliating herself\u2014and her mother\u2014in the process.</p><p>\u201cDid you want our guest of honor to sit with you?\u201d Mary asked Charlotte. She leaned close to Olivia and said in a low voice, \u201cYour mother tends to want speakers she knows to sit with her and her friends instead of at the head table.\u201d</p><p>Olivia recalled that Jack Griffin had spoken to the seniors last year, and apparently her mother had captured him for herself. She\u2019d paid the price, however, when Jack had convinced Charlotte to contribute to the weekly Seniors\u2019 Page for The Cedar Cove Chronicle.</p><p>\u201cMom? Would you like me to sit with you and Laura and the others?\u201d Olivia asked.</p> <p>Charlotte stiffened and her chin came up as though the question offended her. \u201cI think you should be at the head table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Mary said primly. With that, she turned and walked smartly in the direction of the stage. Olivia was about to follow when Charlotte caught her by the arm.</p><p>\u201cGet your dessert early,\u201d she said in a loud whisper.</p><p>\u201cDessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get it right away, everything\u2019ll be gone by the time we line up for the buffet. So we help ourselves to dessert first. That\u2019s just the way we do things here. I don\u2019t approve, mind you, but no one cares what I think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mom,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>Mary showed her to her seat at the head table, and Olivia reached for her dessert plate as instructed by her mother. The food tables offered a variety that was truly impressive. She chose a piece of lemon sponge cake and returned to her seat just as Mary was about to say a few words of welcome. The social director of the SeniorCenter made a small huffy sound as Charlotte walked past.</p><p>\u201cYour mother might not approve of the practice, but it doesn\u2019t stop her from indulging, does it?\u201d Mary said, leaning down from the podium.</p> <p>\u201cShe knows that if she doesn\u2019t get her dessert beforehand, there won\u2019t be anything left,\u201d Olivia said calmly, setting her piece of lemon sponge cake next to her empty plate.</p><p>Olivia tried not to smile. In many ways, her mother was a rebel, but a much-loved one. There were days Charlotte drove her crazy, yet at the same time Olivia deeply admired her. Charlotte was fully involved in life; she engaged in plenty of creative activities and had a genuine commitment to the welfare of others. Twenty-five years from now, Olivia hoped to be just like her. The fact that the indefatigable Charlotte seemed to be losing energy distressed everyone in the family, and Olivia resolved to talk to her about seeing the doctor.</p><p>As the seniors closest to the wall left their tables to form a long line at the buffet table, Olivia saw Justine and Seth at the back of the room. Her daughter and son-in-law had come to hear her speech. Charlotte got to the newlyweds first, and quickly escorted them to her table. Olivia watched as her mother introduced the young couple to her friends, who were obviously enchanted, especially by Seth. Soon space was cleared next to Charlotte, and they both sat down. Laura urged Seth to his feet a moment later, escorting him to the buffet table to fill plates for himself and his wife.</p><p>Justine and Seth weren\u2019t the only surprise visitors. Olivia saw Jack slip into the back of the room just as she stepped up to the podium to give her talk. Pausing when she noticed him, she was encouraged by his broad smile and his wink. Smiling too, she launched into her speech\u2014which was about the creativity of older people and how much they contributed to society.</p><p>Afterward, Olivia couldn\u2019t remember a word of it, but apparently she\u2019d made sense because there was a nice, appreciative round of applause when she finished. Mary announced that Bob Beldon, the proprietor of the Thyme and Tide B and B, would be the February speaker, made a few other \u201chousekeeping\u201d announcements, and the meeting was over. To Olivia\u2019s astonishment, a small crowd swarmed toward the head table to thank her for coming.</p><p>Charlotte hurried around the table and stood next to Olivia, clutching her arm, telling anyone and everyone that Olivia was her daughter\u2014as if this was news! Mary had announced the fact earlier, but apparently that didn\u2019t satisfy her mother.</p><p>Justine and Seth waited until her admirers had drifted off. \u201cYou sounded really good, Mom,\u201d Justine said. \u201cI understand why Grandma\u2019s so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>This was quite a compliment coming from her daughter. For a moment, Olivia was too overwhelmed to speak. Her relationship with Justine wasn\u2019t always easy, although God knew she tried. The most difficult aspect of being a parent to an adult child was holding one\u2019s tongue, she\u2019d discovered. \u201cIt was wonderful of you and Seth to be here.\u201d</p><p>Seth, her son-in-law, stood a head taller than everyone else in the room. \u201cGreat job, Olivia,\u201d he said with a respectful nod.</p><p>\u201cWe came by to ask you to dinner tonight,\u201d Justine told her, \u201cAnd I\u2019m cooking.\u201d</p><p>This was the first invitation she\u2019d received from her daughter, and Olivia didn\u2019t know quite what to make of it. \u201cThank you. I\u2019d enjoy that.\u201d Then, because she thought\u2014and hoped\u2014there might be more to this invitation than met the eye, she asked, \u201cAny special reason?\u201d</p><p>Seth chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we aren\u2019t going to ask for a loan or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I\u2019m not worried. Just...curious.\u201d She was thrilled to see her daughter this happy. Justine looked more at peace with herself than she had in years, and it was clear to Olivia that this marriage had brought her daughter contentment. She didn\u2019t know what had happened to Warren Saget, but he was apparently out of her life. That certainly didn\u2019t hurt Olivia\u2019s feelings any.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>As Charlotte escorted her to the door, she said, \u201cLaura and I are going to take a trip out to the Silverdale yarn store this afternoon.\u201d Charlotte needed more yarn about as much as the desert needed more sand, but Olivia didn\u2019t say so. If buying yarn of every weight and color made her mother happy, Olivia could only approve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your car,\u201d Jack said, coming up behind her. \u201cHello, Charlotte.\u201d He kissed Olivia\u2019s mother on the cheek, then placed his arm around Olivia\u2019s shoulders. \u201cExcellent speech. I took lots of notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d she cried. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to put anything about this in the paper, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Charlotte said sternly, shocking them both. \u201cI am. Olivia is my daughter and I write the Seniors\u2019 Page. She spoke at the SeniorCenter, so don\u2019t traipse on my territory. I don\u2019t care if you are the editor, this story is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Jack raised both hands in mock surrender, but his eyes were twinkling.</p><p>Jack kept his arm around her shoulder as they walked outside. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad, now was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cbut I survived.\u201d</p><p>Jack checked his watch and grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m late to report on a City Council meeting. I\u2019ll call you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her and it was more than just a short kiss of farewell. He was saying he missed her, missed their Tuesday-night dinner dates. She told him she did, too. Amazing how much a single kiss could say.</p><p>They parted, and Jack reluctantly turned and hurried across the street to his battered car. Olivia hated to see him go. Sighing, she returned to the courthouse for her afternoon session.</p><p>By that evening, as she drove to Justine and Seth\u2019s apartment, Olivia had begun to wonder again about the reason for this unexpected invitation. Would there be an announcement?</p><p>Her daughter answered the door, looking so radiantly happy that it was all Olivia could do not to stare. She\u2019d only been to the apartment one previous time, when it\u2019d been filled with gifts from the wedding reception and boxes were scattered every which way. Her daughter had done a wonderful job of incorporating Seth\u2019s things into her utterly feminine home, making it his home, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth brought out a bottle of sparkling wine while Justine hung up Olivia\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cAre we celebrating something?\u201d Olivia asked, sitting on a delicate chair with petit point upholstery.</p><p>\u201cWe have news,\u201d Justine said, smiling warmly at her husband.</p><p>Seth set the wine bottle on the counter and then sank down on the sofa next to Justine. \u201cWhen I returned from fishing this last time, Justine and I decided we didn\u2019t want to spend half the year apart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just too hard on both of us,\u201d Justine added.</p><p>This was their news?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving up fishing?\u201d Olivia asked. It was in Seth\u2019s blood. The Gunderson family had a long history as fishermen, dating back four or five generations.</p><p>\u201cSeth and I are buying a restaurant,\u201d Justine announced. \u201cThe Captain\u2019s Galley has been for sale for a couple of months and we made an offer, which the owner has accepted.\u201d</p><p>Okay, this wasn\u2019t exactly what Olivia had hoped, but it wasn\u2019t bad. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t decided on a new name yet,\u201d Justine said. \u201cBut we\u2019re very excited.\u201d She glanced at her husband and he reached for her hand.</p><p>Olivia relaxed. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled for you. It\u2019s going to be a lot of hard work, but you already know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2019s been saving for years for something like this.\u201d Again her daughter looked proudly at her husband. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my job for now, but eventually I\u2019ll be working at the restaurant, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you keeping the current staff or hiring new people?\u201d Olivia asked, wondering about Cecilia Randall, who worked as a part-time hostess at The Captain\u2019s Galley.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know any of the staff yet,\u201d Seth told her. \u201cThis is still very new. In fact, we just found out that our offer had been accepted an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we invited you to dinner before we heard from the real estate broker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh? You mean there\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Justine said, leaning forward and gripping both of Olivia\u2019s hands.</p><p>Her daughter only called her that when she was feeling very emotional; Olivia hadn\u2019t heard it in years. Justine\u2019s beautiful blue eyes filled with tears as she smiled at Olivia. \u201cSeth and I are pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Olivia let out a cry of sheer happiness and leaped to her feet. Justine and Seth stood, too, and Olivia wrapped her arms around them as tears of joy streamed down her cheeks. This was the news she\u2019d come to hear.</p><p>Cliff Harding sat with his long legs stretched out, staring at the television set. The sitcom bored him, but he didn\u2019t blame the writing or the acting. He\u2019d been restless all day.</p><p>Hell of a way to spend a Friday night. What he really wanted to do was see Grace. He\u2019d purposely not talked to her since shortly before Christmas. He was tired of always being the one to contact her; this time, he decided, she\u2019d have to call him. Ten days into the New Year felt more like ten lifetimes, and his resolve was weakening. He\u2019d told her he was a patient man but that was stretching the truth. He could be patient. He didn\u2019t like it, though, not one damn bit.</p><p>Maybe she was right and he should think about seeing other women. The problem was, no one interested him half as much as Grace. He liked everything about her. Her smile, her laugh, the gentle way she had with children and animals. She wasn\u2019t conventionally beautiful, but she possessed beauty in abundance. He liked her salt-and-pepper hair and approved of the shorter cut, preferring it to the longer style she\u2019d worn in the family photograph. Although she\u2019d obviously aged since then, the years had only added depth and maturity.</p><p>Cliff believed in the importance of loyalty\u2014a belief his divorce had confirmed\u2014and he didn\u2019t want to be with a woman who could easily turn her back on a thirty-five year marriage. But it was now nine months since Dan\u2019s disappearance, and from all the evidence, the choice to leave had been his.</p> <p>Everything he\u2019d heard pointed to the fact that Grace\u2019s ex was involved with another woman. The afternoon Grace spent on his ranch, she\u2019d told him a little about those early weeks after Dan had vanished. When she described finding out about a ring he\u2019d charged at a jewelry store, she\u2019d grown tearful. Apparently Dan had bought a ring on their VISA bill. His last paycheck covered the amount of the purchase, and that had been mailed to Grace from his employer.</p><p>What hurt Grace was the fact that other than the plain gold band he\u2019d given her on their wedding day, Dan had never purchased her a ring. It seemed he\u2019d bought one for another woman, though, and that had cut Grace to the quick.</p><p>Walking into his office, Cliff reached for a novel, the latest thriller by an author he particularly enjoyed. But even before he went back into the living room and opened the book, he knew it was useless. His mind was on Grace, not the mindless entertainment of a television sit-com, or even the involved plot of a murder mystery.</p><p>Christmas week was the last time he\u2019d seen her. Again, it had been at his own instigation. After the trip to the ranch, she\u2019d written him a brief note. Three lines. A simple thank-you, and yet he\u2019d read that card over and over, looking for some secret message, some encouragement.</p><p>He waited until just before Christmas, then dropped in at the Cedar Cove Library with a gift. It was nothing creative or terribly expensive. Just a token gift so she\u2019d known he\u2019d been thinking about her. From her brief note, he saw that she\u2019d used a fountain pen. He preferred fountain pens himself. He\u2019d picked up one of his favorite brands, had the store wrap it and then promptly delivered it to her at the library. She\u2019d seemed surprised and grateful but also embarrassed because she didn\u2019t have anything for him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t afford it, he realized. Her ex-husband\u2019s disappearance had obviously created financial difficulties; she\u2019d worked with a budget that included two incomes and now there was only one. Their conversation was brief, the day he saw her at the library, but he could easily read between the lines. This was a difficult Christmas for her, and not only because it was the first since her divorce became final.</p><p>Cliff harbored a secret hope that she\u2019d invite him to Christmas dinner, but she was joining her youngest daughter for the holiday. He\u2019d hoped she might call him on New Year\u2019s Eve, perhaps suggest meeting for a drink. But that hadn\u2019t happened, either.</p><p>Now Cliff was beginning to doubt himself\u2014and Grace. She might never recover from Dan\u2019s disappearance. Even if they got involved, he feared she\u2019d always be looking over her shoulder for Dan. Perhaps the best thing to do was walk away and forget he\u2019d ever met her.</p><p>It should be easy. They\u2019d never kissed. Okay, once on the cheek. They\u2019d held hands a couple of times, but that was about as sensual as it got. Cliff was more man than saint, and whenever they were together the temptation to hold and kiss her, really kiss her, grew more potent.</p><p>The phone rang, startling him out of his reverie. He\u2019d never been one for extended telephone conversations. His gruff, unfriendly voice usually turned telemarketers away, which he considered a definite bonus.</p><p>\u201cHarding,\u201d he barked.</p><p>No one spoke, and Cliff had started to hang up when he heard Grace\u2019s tentative greeting. He jerked the phone back to his ear.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Cliff. I hope you don\u2019t mind me phoning you out of the blue like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Grace.\u201d He kept his voice just a little impatient.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you for the fountain pen. I really like the way it writes.\u201d</p><p>His problem, Cliff decided, was that he was too eager, which was why he\u2019d come up with his wait-and-see strategy, why he hadn\u2019t been in touch since Christmas. If he was a bit more standoffish, she might appreciate him more, seek out his company. Apparently, his plan had worked\u2014although only seconds earlier he was ready to forget the entire relationship. Cool Hand Cliff, that was him.</p><p>\u201cWhen you came by the library, you suggested the two of us might go out for dinner one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d he asked casually, although he knew very well that he had.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sounded pretty certain of herself. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019d take you up on that offer\u2014if you\u2019re still interested.\u201d</p><p>He was interested, all right, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to pretend otherwise. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s a good time for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check my calendar.\u201d He ruffled through the pages of his book, as though he had to consult a full social calendar. \u201cHow about tomorrow night? Seven?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, clearly relieved. \u201cThat would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>All day Saturday, Cliff was in a state of nervous anticipaton. Saturday night, Cliff had shaved, showered and dressed by six. He could leave now, but in evening traffic it only took about fifteen minutes to get from his ranch to her house. He\u2019d rather arrive early, though, than hang around at home.</p><p>As it was, even after taking his time, he got there a whole half hour ahead of schedule, which he was afraid might give Grace the wrong message. Instead, he was pleasantly surprised to discover that she seemed equally nervous.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d drive into Tacoma,\u201d he said. He wanted Grace to feel comfortable, and he wasn\u2019t sure that would be possible if she was constantly worried about who might see the two of them together. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice Italian place I\u2019m fond of on the other side of the bride.\u201d The Narrows separated the KitsapPeninsula from Tacoma and the bridge linked the two communities.</p><p>\u201cI love Italian food.\u201d</p><p>Cliff had called ahead and reserved a corner table. The drive was relaxed, conversation alternating with companionable silence. Their meal took nearly two hours as they lingered first over dinner and wine and then coffee and dessert. Cliff wasn\u2019t eager to leave, but the restaurant was filling up and it didn\u2019t seem right to hold on to the table all night.</p><p>Returning to Cedar Cove, they approached the NarrowsBridge. As traffic slowed, Cliff glanced at Grace and saw she\u2019d leaned her head against the back of the seat, her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cYou look very peaceful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI feel wonderful.\u201d She paused. \u201cIt was a lovely evening.\u201d</p><p>The food was excellent, the merlot some of the best he could remember, but he sincerely hoped Grace was referring to the company and not the meal.</p><p>\u201cI feel...free,\u201d she said, eyes still closed. \u201cI assumed that if I agreed to have dinner with you, I\u2019d spend the entire night feeling guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to feel guilty about\u2014yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet?\u201d She lifted her head and stared at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you Grace,\u201d he said firmly, keeping his eyes on the road. \u201cAnd when I do, you\u2019re going to feel that kiss all the way down to your toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a kiss that\u2019ll knock you for a loop...and then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any objections?\u201d he asked, his voice gruff, fearing rejection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust one,\u201d Grace whispered placing her hand on his knee.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this damn car and just do it.\u201d</p><p>Cliff was more than happy to oblige.</p> <p>Rosie and Zach were tense with each other over the Christmas holidays, and things didn\u2019t seem to be getting any better in the New Year. Rosie tried, she honestly did, but Zach was increasingly demanding and unreasonable.</p><p>They were constantly bickering, constantly at odds. Some days she was convinced her marriage had been a mistake. Zach didn\u2019t want a wife, he wanted a maid. Rosie had tried to live up to his expectations, but when she did manage to juggle her schedule to do these wifely chores, it always backfired. Breakfast was a good example. He apparently wanted her tied to the stove, yet no one was interested in her cooking.</p><p>Shortly before Christmas, in a conciliatory mood, she\u2019d made meat loaf and mashed potatoes and even gravy. Eddie hated the meat loaf, and Allison complained about the potatoes. Rosie could have put up with their dissatisfaction if Zach had shown one bit of appreciation for her efforts. Instead, he\u2019d pointed out that real potatoes didn\u2019t come out of a box and that his mother had never used canned gravy. Well, she wasn\u2019t his mother, as she\u2019d told him. Zach had muttered, \u201cYou can say that again.\u201d Rosie found his remark insulting and hurtful.</p><p>Today, though, everything was beginning to add up. That morning Zach had forgotten his briefcase at the house. On her way to a meeting with the church library committee, Rosie had brought it to the office.</p><p>Seeing Janice Lamond with Zach had opened her eyes. No wonder he was dissatisfied with his home life. Zach and this other woman were involved. They might not be having an affair\u2014or were they?\u2014but there was something going on between them.</p> <p>Rosie brooded about it during her meeting. She skipped her volunteer stint at the school that afternoon. All day she seethed. With an unaccustomed burst of energy she cleared up accumulated clutter in the house, vacuumed and did five loads of wash. She had a casserole in the oven when Zach got home.</p><p>Standing by the kitchen door with her hand on her hip, she glared at him as he walked in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded when he\u2019d taken two steps into the house.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d He loosened his tie, looking weary.</p><p>\u201cI want to ask you about Janice Lamond.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she got to do with anything?\u201d Zach spat out.</p><p>As if he didn\u2019t already know. Whirling around, Rosie slapped a plate into the dishwasher. \u201cI think it would be best if we talked about this after the children are asleep.\u201d</p><p>Zach disappeared for five minutes; then he was back. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem I want to hear it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Rosie yanked open the silverware drawer and took out the knives and forks for the evening meal. \u201cI was at your office this morning, if you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He crossed his arms and leaned against the kitchen counter. \u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the way your assistant looked at you\u2014and the way you looked at her.\u201d</p><p>Zach frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re imagining things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I am.\u201d The more Rosie thought about it, the hotter she burned. All day she\u2019d been wondering exactly what was happening between her husband and this other woman. She was so hurt, so furious, she could barely think straight.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on between Janice and me,\u201d Zach said after a stilted silence.</p><p>\u201cFine. I want you to get rid of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zach nearly exploded.</p><p>\u201cIf what you\u2019re saying is true\u2014\u201d which, frankly, she doubted \u201c\u2014then you won\u2019t mind getting a new assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re paranoid about another woman. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d His jaw was tight and that stubborn expression came over him. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have eyes in my head, Zach. I saw the way she looked at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break.\u201d His hands were clenched now.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder I can\u2019t do anything to satisfy you anymore. You\u2019ve been picking away at me for months. I\u2019m not a good enough housekeeper and our meals are below your high standards. That\u2019s how it started, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never realized what an active imagination you have,\u201d he said, and while his words weren\u2019t insulting, his tone was. \u201cYou\u2019re so far off-base it\u2019s pitiful.\u201d He circled the table as though he found it impossible to stand still.</p><p>\u201cI want her out of your office.\u201d</p><p>Zach clutched a kitchen chair with both hands, his knuckles standing out white. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>Moving behind a chair, too, Rosie mimicked his posture. She stared across the table at Zach, her eyes narrowing. Looking at him now, his face distorted with anger, she wondered if he wasn\u2019t already involved in an affair. Never had she believed something like this would happen to her and Zach.</p><p>\u201cYou refuse to fire her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I do! First of all, this is none of your business. Second, Janice Lamond is organized, efficient and a pleasure to have in my office. I am not going to discharge her because my wife is jealous. If anything, you could take a few lessons from her about keeping this house clean and orderly.\u201d</p><p>The words hit her as hard as a physical blow. \u201cIf that\u2019s the way you feel,\u201d she said, shocked by how cool and unemotional her voice sounded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly the way I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps it would be a good idea if we separated.\u201d</p><p>Zach looked at her sharply. \u201cIs that what you want, Rosie? Be damn sure it is before you start anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting up with an affair.\u201d She wanted that perfectly clear.</p><p>\u201cFor the last time, I\u2019m not having an affair with Janice Lamond and the fact that you\u2019re suggesting I am is an insult to both Janice and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you aren\u2019t involved physically yet, but you are emotionally. You think I can\u2019t tell? Do you honestly believe I\u2019m so blind I can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening right before my eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re even capable of recognizing the truth.\u201d</p><p>Rosie bit her lip. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s blind. I want her fired.\u201d</p><p>Zach laughed derisively. \u201cLike I said, that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say you\u2019d rather lose your marriage, your wife, your children and your home in order to keep your assistant? She\u2019s that important to you? Guess what that tells me, Zach.\u201d</p><p>Allison appeared then and stood tentatively in the doorway to the kitchen. \u201cAre you two fighting again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rosie said, softening her voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zach countered, nearly shouting in his anger. His eyes were as cold as she\u2019d ever seen them.</p><p>Rosie didn\u2019t care; she wasn\u2019t backing down.</p><p>He was being contradictory on purpose, trying to create more havoc and discord than he already had.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue in front of the children,\u201d Rosie said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cYou started this and we\u2019re going to finish it right here and now.\u201d He slammed his hand down on the table, rattling the silverware.</p><p>\u201cMom? Dad?\u201d Eddie stood beside his sister.</p><p>Rosie turned and said, \u201cDinner will be ready in ten minutes. Go wash your hands.\u201d</p><p>Both children stayed where they were.</p><p>\u201cDo as your mother says,\u201d Zach ordered.</p><p>Reluctantly they left the kitchen. Rosie heard them talking as they left. Although she couldn\u2019t make out what was being said, the word divorce was clear.</p><p>\u201cIs this really what you want?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you want? To throw your family away for your assistant?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the comment. \u201cA separation might not be such a bad idea. I don\u2019t want my children subjected to your paranoia.\u201d</p><p>Rosie tried to swallow the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cIf you want this so badly, then I suggest you consult an attorney,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she tossed back at him. Her heart felt numb and the sensation was spreading. Staring sightlessly ahead, she gripped the chair so hard her nails cut into the wood.</p><p>Zach stood there a moment longer, then turned and reached for his briefcase and walked toward the door leading to the garage.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He hesitated only a second. \u201cIf we\u2019re planning to separate, then I\u2019ll need an apartment.\u201d With that he stalked out.</p><p>Rosie remained where she was, hardly able to breathe, hardly able to believe that her marriage had come to this.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>The wind howled and rain pounded the house as Bob and Peggy Beldon prepared for bed. The winter months were slow at the bed-and-breakfast. It was three days since their last guest had departed. This business was their retirement project, but right now Bob didn\u2019t object to the scarcity of paying guests. It gave Peggy and him a welcome break and the opportunity to enjoy their home and each other.</p><p>The wind rattled the winter-bare branches against the windows as Bob turned off the television after watching the eleven o\u2019clock news. The lights flickered. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re in for quite a night,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter have some flashlights handy.\u201d</p><p>Peggy nodded, picking up their coffee mugs and moving into the kitchen.</p><p>Bob was about to head up the back stairs when he noticed a pair of headlights. A car had turned into their driveway. \u201cWe aren\u2019t expecting any guests, are we?\u201d Although he knew the answer, he asked in case Peggy had booked someone and then forgotten to mention it.</p><p>\u201cNot until the weekend.\u201d Peggy stuck the two mugs in the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone might be coming.\u201d</p><p>His wife parted the drape and stared out the window over the sink. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anyone we know, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to tell in this rain, but I don\u2019t recognize the car.\u201d Bob was halfway to the front door when the bell rang. He turned on the porch light and unfastened the lock. A man stood on the other side, wearing a raincoat and slouch hat. He held a small suitcase in one hand. His head was lowered, shadowed, making it impossible to see his face clearly.</p><p>\u201cI saw the sign from the road. Do you have a room available for the night?\u201d he asked in a low, husky voice.</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Bob told him and took a moment to size up the stranger. The man was in his mid-fifties, he guessed, but it was difficult to be sure. He kept his shoulders hunched forward as he stepped into the house. Yet Bob thought he looked vaguely familiar.</p><p>Always warm and welcoming, Peggy ushered their guest into the kitchen, where the registration forms were kept. The man glanced at the form Peggy handed him. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you now,\u201d he said, withdrawing cash from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWe need you to fill out the information card,\u201d Bob said. He had a funny feeling about this guy, although he couldn\u2019t place him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bob Beldon,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might seem like an odd question, but have we ever met?\u201d</p><p>The stranger didn\u2019t answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoney, don\u2019t delay our guest with questions,\u201d Peggy whispered.</p><p>Irritated, Bob frowned slightly. He couldn\u2019t help wondering why the stranger had chosen a relatively remote bed-and-breakfast rather than one of the more convenient motels off the freeway.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something warm to drink?\u201d Peggy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d His response was gruff, almost unfriendly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat brings you out here on a night like this?\u201d Bob pressed. \u201cWe aren\u2019t exactly on the beaten path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that\u2019s important just now,\u201d Peggy said, glaring at Bob. He could tell she was annoyed by his attitude, but he definitely felt a little uneasy.</p><p>The stranger ignored his question. \u201cIf you\u2019d show me to my room, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Peggy led the way down the long hallway off the kitchen. \u201cYou have your choice. We have the Goldfinch room and the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first one is fine.\u201d He seemed impatient to be about his business, whatever that might be. \u201cI\u2019ll have the registration card filled out for you in the morning.\u201d He opened the door and set his case inside, then with his back to them, said, \u201cI hope you won\u2019t mind if I turn in. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p> <p>Bob was about to tell him the paperwork had to be completed first, but Peggy cut him off. \u201cBreakfast is served between eight and ten. Sleep well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He closed the door hard and they heard the lock snap into place.</p><p>Bob waited until they were upstairs before he spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t like the looks of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Peggy said as she went into the master bathroom to remove her makeup. \u201cHe\u2019s a paying guest. You don\u2019t have to like him. My guess is he\u2019ll be gone early in the morning and that\u2019ll be the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Bob muttered, but he had the sinking feeling that wouldn\u2019t be the case.</p><p>The storm continued to rage, and Bob stood at the bedroom window that overlooked the inky waters of the Cove. The lighthouse on the point could be seen in the distance, warning ships of danger ahead. An eerie sensation came over him. More than once, he\u2019d wondered about this business of allowing strangers into their home. He didn\u2019t like the man in the room downstairs, although he couldn\u2019t say exactly why. All he knew was that his gut instinct told him the stranger was trouble.</p> <p>Peggy was such a warmhearted soul that all she saw was the plight of someone caught in a storm, looking for shelter from the night. Bob wished he felt the same.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to bed?\u201d his wife asked, turning down the comforter and sliding between the crisp, clean sheets.</p><p>Maybe Peggy was right. She generally was. The man downstairs was just someone passing through. In the morning he\u2019d be on his way and they\u2019d never see him again. The stranger had already paid in full, and if he was reluctant to fill out the information card, well, that was his prerogative.</p><p>The following morning, Bob was awakened by the sun. He jerked into sudden wakefulness, surprised to see that it was light outside. Peggy had already gone downstairs; he could hear her singing along to the radio as she baked blueberry muffins. They were her specialty, and the blueberries came from their own small patch next to Peggy\u2019s pride, her herb garden. The aroma of fresh coffee wafted up the stairs.</p><p>Bob rubbed his hand down his face, recalling remnants of a familiar nightmare. Not images so much as feelings, impressions, and they hadn\u2019t been pleasant. After he\u2019d climbed into bed, he\u2019d fallen into a light, restless slumber, followed by a deeper sleep. Try as he might, though, he could remember nothing of the dreams he\u2019d had.</p><p>Normally he was up before Peggy and made the coffee. Feeling guilty for sleeping so late, he hurriedly dressed. As an afterthought, he walked quickly to the window. Sure enough, the white Ford was still parked below. So their guest hadn\u2019t sneaked out as Bob had half suspected\u2014and half hoped\u2014he might. Perhaps this morning the stranger would be a bit friendlier than he\u2019d been the night before, and Bob could discover what it was about him that had struck a familiar chord.</p><p>Peggy smiled when she saw him. \u201cGood morning, hon. It\u2019s ages since you slept this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d</p> <p>His wife hesitated. \u201cYou had another of your nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really remember....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right this morning?\u201d Her face creased with worry lines as she studied him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t get up\u2014did I?\u201d Twice over the years, Bob had awakened somewhere outside their bedroom. The only explanation had been sleepwalking.</p><p>\u201cYou were in bed when you woke, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she teased.</p><p>He nodded and was instantly relieved. He hugged his wife, then poured himself a cup of coffee. Taking his Alcoholics Anonymous \u201cBig Book,\u201d he walked into the sunroom and settled in his recliner to read. He had twenty years of sobriety behind him, but he still lived one day at a time. He was a drunk who was one shot glass away from ruin, and he didn\u2019t allow a day to go by without reminding himself of that. Twenty minutes later, Peggy took the muffins out of the oven.</p><p>Their morning routine was set, and it was almost ten before his wife realized they hadn\u2019t seen their guest, although his car was still there. Curiosity led Bob outside to glance through the driver\u2019s window. A map lay on the passenger seat and a half-full water bottle was in the drink holder, but he saw nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>\u201cI did tell him breakfast was between eight and ten, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she asked Bob when he came back into the house.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just sleeping in. He said he had a hard day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after eleven,\u201d Peggy murmured a bit later.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an odd duck.\u201d Bob wasn\u2019t going to change his opinion about that.</p><p>A half hour later, Peggy was again concerned. \u201cMaybe we\u2019d better check to see if he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him sleep,\u201d Bob insisted. \u201cFor all we know, he could be in his room working. He did have a computer with him, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>To Bob\u2019s way of thinking, if the stranger wanted privacy, he\u2019d give it to him.</p><p>His wife sent him a questioning look, then shrugged and went back to the quilt she\u2019d recently started. Bob went to his garage workshop; in retirement, he\u2019d taken up woodwork and enjoyed building furniture. Over the years, he\u2019d created some pretty nice pieces, if he did say so himself. He\u2019d recently finished a chest of drawers and was proud of the workmanship. After he\u2019d added a final coat of varnish, he returned to the house. It was now twelve-thirty. A look out the window revealed the stranger\u2019s car parked where it had been earlier.</p><p>Bob fixed himself a ham sandwich and resumed his tinkering around the garage. A few minutes later, Peggy sought him out.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have to go in there,\u201d his wife said. \u201cI knocked on his door, but there wasn\u2019t any answer.\u201d</p><p>Bob decided Peggy was right. Following her into the house, he pounded on the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d he called loudly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to yell,\u201d Peggy whispered. She looked nervous, and frankly Bob was starting to feel the same way. Although they\u2019d been in business for more than ten years, it was the first time they\u2019d had an experience\u2014or a guest\u2014like this.</p><p>\u201cI have the key,\u201d Peggy told him when there was no response.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I call Troy Davis?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The sheriff was a good friend, but Bob didn\u2019t want to waste Troy\u2019s time if there was a logical explanation. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut something must be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leap to conclusions, Peg.\u201d He wished now that he\u2019d gone with his instincts and told the stranger to seek some other place for the night.</p><p>Peggy handed him the key and Bob reluctantly inserted it in the lock. Slowly, he turned the knob and swung open the door. Their guest was sleeping in the middle of the bed. His coat hung in the closet, with his hat resting on the shelf directly above. The suitcase was open, but it looked as though a surgeon had packed it. Everything was crisply folded and compact. The suitcase appeared to be undisturbed.</p><p>\u201cHe could just be sick,\u201d Peggy said, clinging to Bob\u2019s arm.</p><p>Bob doubted it. He recognized that smell, and his skin crawled with memories of jungle warfare almost forty years earlier. The scent of death was one a man didn\u2019t quickly forget.</p><p>Whatever the stranger\u2019s purpose for being in Cedar Cove, it would likely remain a mystery now.</p><p>Bob moved to the bed and stared down at him. The night before, his face had been shadowed by his hat, which was pulled low over his face. He looked younger now that Bob could see him clearly. Younger and completely at peace.</p><p>\u201cIs he...dead?\u201d Peggy asked, her dread palpable.</p><p>Although he already knew the answer, Bob felt for a pulse in the man\u2019s neck. There was nothing. \u201cI think it\u2019s time we phoned Troy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the yard was filled with emergency vehicles. EMTs, several officers and the medical examiner tramped through the house. Bob answered question after question, but he wasn\u2019t able to provide Troy or Joe Mitchell, the medical examiner, with much information.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll have to be an autopsy,\u201d Troy said.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to take him out of here soon?\u201d Peggy asked. Bob could tell that she was shaken by all of this. Truth be known, so was he.</p><p>The medical examiner came out of the room and peeled off his plastic gloves.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what killed him?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Joe said, frowning. \u201cHe\u2019s driver\u2019s license says his name\u2019s Whitcomb. James Whitcomb, and he\u2019s from Florida. Mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bob could say that with certainty, despite the hint of familiarity last night. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the man in my life.\u201d</p><p>Joe continued to frown. \u201cHe\u2019s had extensive cosmetic surgery.\u201d</p><p>Bob hardly knew what to make of that information.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something unusual going on here,\u201d Joe said, following the body as it was wheeled out of the room and down the hall.</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s popularity at Get Nailed had fallen considerably after the Halloween party. Rachel, her nail tech, had met Terri\u2019s discarded male friend who enjoyed working on cars. Things had looked promising for a while.</p><p>All through November and December, Rachel had been full of praise for Larry and everything he was doing for her car. First, he replaced her failing brakes, and at a fraction of the cost a shop would have charged. Then he got her interior lights working. He even managed to fix her tape deck. Rachel was grateful and managed to convince herself that she was falling madly in love. How could she not love a man who was saving her hundreds of dollars?</p><p>Then her transmission went out. This was a major repair, but Rachel\u2019s hero was confident he could fix it. All she had to do was buy the new transmission. Unfortunately Larry had overestimated his skills. Not only had he bungled the job, but Rachel had to take her vehicle into the shop and pay for the repairs a second time. To add insult to injury, Larry had presented her with a bill for all the labor and parts he\u2019d put into her car. Needless to say, the relationship had taken a sharp turn south. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jane\u2019s experience wasn\u2019t much better. She\u2019d been looking for a man with money sense. Jeannie had once dated a very nice but very boring financial advisor whom she\u2019d introduced to Jane at the Halloween party. Jane and Geoff had instantly hit it off. Jane insisted Geoff wasn\u2019t nearly as boring as Jeannie had said. But then he\u2019d given her a hot stock tip that was close to being insider information. Sure enough, Jane had invested her entire savings and almost immediately, the stock fell eight percent.</p><p>\u201cWhat I learned from all this,\u201d Rachel said, as she finished the polish job on Maryellen\u2019s nails, \u201cis that if one of us dumps a man, it\u2019s for a damn good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d Jane echoed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the guy you met?\u201d Jeannie asked Maryellen.</p> <p>She blinked, pretending not to understand the question. \u201cI didn\u2019t meet anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat guy you brought stuck to you like glue,\u201d Terri called from the other side of the shop, where she was working on an older woman. \u201cI had my eye on him big-time, but he wasn\u2019t having anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re imagining it.\u201d The last person she wanted to discuss with her friends was Jon Bowman.</p><p>\u201cNot likely,\u201d Terri muttered, standing in front of the display of fingernail polish. She picked up a bottle and read the name on the bottom. \u201cHow about \u2018More Than a Waitress\u2019?\u201d she asked her customer.</p><p>Thankfully, attention was turned away from Maryellen.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going out with him?\u201d Rachel asked, ambushing her with the question. \u201cYou might not have noticed how hot that guy was for you, but the rest of us sure did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since before Christmas, but if I do, would you like me to give him your number?\u201d This was the only way she could think of to convince Rachel that she wasn\u2019t interested in dating Jon.</p><p>\u201cNo way. I\u2019ve been with guys who\u2019re hung up on someone else. It\u2019s a real downer, if you know what I mean.\u201d Coloring the last fingernail, Rachel set the timer and lowered the light over Maryellen\u2019s perfect pink nails.</p><p>Once they were dry, Maryellen hurried out of the shop. She was meeting her mother for dinner at the PancakePalace. Her entire schedule was off, due to a meeting with the gallery owners, who\u2019d flown in unexpectedly. Luckily, Rachel could fit her in for a late-afternoon appointment.</p><p>Fearing questions, Maryellen had been avoiding her family. Kelly, busy as she was with Tyler, had readily accepted her excuses, but Grace was having none of it. Given no other option, Maryellen agreed to meet her at the Palace, where the food was plentiful and cheap.</p><p>Grace already had a booth by the time Maryellen arrived. She slipped into the seat across from her and reached for the menu.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d her mother asked immediately.</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d That was a lie, but Maryellen didn\u2019t want Grace to overreact to her situation. At this point, only her mother knew about the pregnancy; she hadn\u2019t been ready to divulge the news to Kelly or any of her friends, especially while she felt ill. Every day for the last month, Maryellen had awakened with a queasy stomach. Invariably, a short time later, she was hanging her head over the toilet. She didn\u2019t recall Kelly having these symptoms when she was pregnant. In any event, if her sister had suffered from morning sickness, Paul was there to love and encourage her and then hand her a washcloth. Maryellen had rarely felt more alone.</p><p>Grace set aside the menu. \u201cSo you\u2019re in perfect health? Ha! I don\u2019t believe that for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Maryellen said, doing her best to remain cordial. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d Grace demanded and then seemed to have a change of heart. \u201cLet\u2019s start again, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Tell me what\u2019s going on with you. Please, Mom, just this once don\u2019t drill me with questions I don\u2019t want to answer.\u201d She bit her lip and prayed her mother was listening.</p><p>Grace stared at her, obviously unhappy about her daughter\u2019s request. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of other news for us to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Maryellen asked gratefully.</p> <p>\u201cWell, for one thing,\u201d Grace said, cradling her water glass in both hands. \u201cI went out to dinner with Cliff Harding last Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>Now, this was news Maryellen had been waiting to hear. \u201cCliff called you?\u201d In her opinion, he\u2019d been patient for far too long.</p><p>Her mother blushed and looked down at the menu. \u201cActually, I phoned him.\u201d She said this as if she\u2019d committed some terrible breach of etiquette.</p><p>\u201cMom, that\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never called a man in my life.\u201d Even now Grace sounded unsure that she\u2019d done the right thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat convinced you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d her mother said without hesitation. \u201cAnd two glasses of wine. She persuaded me Cliff was going to lose interest\u2014and oh, I\u2019ve been so lonely and miserable.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen raised one eyebrow. \u201cWine can certainly loosen one\u2019s inhibitions.\u201d She was in a position to know.</p><p>\u201cOlivia and I were celebrating,\u201d her mother went on to explain. \u201cSeth and Justine are expecting. And did you know they bought a restaurant? It\u2019s all so exciting for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d heard about The Captain\u2019s Galley. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do well and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A flustered teenage waitress came for their order.</p><p>Maryellen waited until the girl was out of earshot. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention anything about me, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grace murmured. \u201cBut I was tempted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can know, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you about this, Maryellen, but every time I try, you clam up and get defensive. I\u2019m your mother. Do you think I don\u2019t realize you\u2019re avoiding me? I want to know why.\u201d</p><p>That should be obvious. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never told you...I knew I\u2019d regret it and I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than the pregnancy,\u201d Grace whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s what you said at lunch that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t.\u201d The lump in her throat was growing thicker. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. I can\u2019t discuss that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d been pregnant before. Fifteen years ago, you said. Was it before you were married or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Maryellen shook her head, refusing to discuss the most painful time in her life. \u201cSo what about your dinner date,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>Her mother gazed at her, eyes dimmed with sadness. \u201cWill you tell me one day?\u201d</p><p>Not if Maryellen could find a way to avoid it. Her entire life had changed because of that pregnancy. The woman she was today, and would always be, was a result of having conceived Clint Jorstad\u2019s baby. She might never have married him otherwise, never have taken a path she now knew had been so wrong. But as much as she wanted to lay the blame at her ex-husband\u2019s feet, Maryellen was well aware of her own failings. It was easy to create excuses, to rationalize what she\u2019d done. She\u2019d been young and vulnerable and so incredibly naive.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me one day?\u201d her mother repeated.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d This pregnancy was a second chance\u2014an opportunity she\u2019d never expected. This time she\u2019d follow the dictates of her heart.</p><p>\u201cHave you told Kelly?\u201d Her mother insisted on asking questions Maryellen didn\u2019t want to answer.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...I\u2019ll tell Kelly when I\u2019m ready to let other people know.\u201d Maryellen loved her sister, but Kelly simply couldn\u2019t keep a secret. The moment she learned the news, it would be all over town.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your dinner with Cliff,\u201d Maryellen said again, eager to hear the details of her mother\u2019s first official date after her divorce.</p><p>\u201cWe ate at a wonderful Italian place in Tacoma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway from prying eyes.\u201d Maryellen nodded. \u201cThat was thoughtful. Did he kiss you?\u201d</p><p>The warm color that invaded her mother\u2019s cheeks was answer enough. \u201cYes.\u201d She picked up her fork and examined it carefully.</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019re blushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only man who\u2019s kissed me in the last thirty-seven years was your father. Until Saturday, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d Maryellen knew it was wrong to enjoy seeing her mother this flustered. She resisted the urge to laugh outright, but she was genuinely delighted by the fact that Cliff had planned such a romantic evening, and by her mother\u2019s innocent reaction to it.</p><p>\u201cThe kiss was nice. Very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing him again?\u201d Maryellen asked next.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as bad as Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, are you?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cProbably, although he hasn\u2019t asked.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived with two Cobb salads. \u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d she asked and put down their bill before they could even respond.</p><p>Maryellen watched the girl leave. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you and Olivia are making more of this evening with Cliff than you should.\u201d She plucked a napkin from the dispenser. \u201cIt was only one dinner and we haven\u2019t arranged another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d go out again if he asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014Oh, I don\u2019t know\u2014dating frightens me. Everyone seems to think it\u2019s the right thing to do, but if that\u2019s true, then why do I feel so damn guilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re divorced.\u201d</p><p>Grace sighed. \u201cBoth you and Olivia have encouraged me to see Cliff, but I\u2019m not sure I should....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, don\u2019t you know?\u201d Her mother\u2019s face was drawn with anxiety. \u201cI need to know what happened to your father. There\u2019s this knot in my stomach that\u2019s been there since he disappeared.\u201d She began to shred the paper napkin. \u201cAfter I went to dinner with Cliff, I felt good. Kind of...liberated. Free. But it didn\u2019t last. I could hardly sleep that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019re divorced. You are free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps legally, but I still feel married. Despite everything, I feel I belong with your father. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll change until I find out where he is and what drove him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Maryellen\u2019s hand covered her mother\u2019s. \u201cWe might never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that, but it doesn\u2019t change how I feel.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sat in Dr. Fred Stevens\u2019s waiting room, knitting furiously as the minutes ticked slowly by. She\u2019d been seeing Dr. Fred for the past twenty years and she had complete faith in him. He\u2019d been Clyde\u2019s physician, and her husband, too, had trusted him implicitly.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor can see you now, Charlotte,\u201d Pamela Johnson said, standing in the doorway that led to the examination rooms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte tucked her knitting into her bag and followed the nurse. When they stopped at the scale, Charlotte slipped off her shoes and stepped on, eyes closed and breath held. Some information it was better not to know.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re down five pounds,\u201d Pamela announced.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d That made sense, though, seeing that her appetite had been nil for weeks. In the beginning, she\u2019d assumed it was all the stress surrounding the holidays. Then Charlotte had noticed how drained she felt at the end of the day. Lately, climbing stairs seemed to strain her heart and there were all those problems with needing to get to a rest room quickly.</p><p>Pamela led the way into the first exam room. She asked a few preliminary questions and took Charlotte\u2019s blood pressure. After making a notation in the chart, she placed it in a slot on the outside of the door.</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead and remove your clothes and put on the gown,\u201d the nurse instructed before she left.</p><p>Charlotte examined the soft blue paper top. It was ridiculous to think such a thing could cover her. She so seldom needed an appointment other than her yearly exam that she couldn\u2019t remember from visit to visit if the gown was supposed to open in the front or the back.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lottie,\u201d Dr. Fred said, entering the room about five minutes later.</p><p>So few people called Charlotte by that name, it shook her for a moment. Naturally Dr. Fred used it because that was what Clyde had always called her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dr. Fred.\u201d</p> <p>The physician sat on the stool as he read her chart, while she sat higher up on the examination table with her bare feet dangling. Looking down at her toenails, she was embarrassed to see that they needed a fresh coat of polish. Oh my, this was embarrassing. She tried to cover one foot with the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Dr. Fred asked. He apparently hadn\u2019t noticed her toes.</p><p>Charlotte described her symptoms. Tiredness, she explained, a lack of appetite and energy and that pesky problem with her bowels. The more she spoke, the more alarmed she became. \u201cIt sounds like I should\u2019ve come in weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Dr. Fred said sternly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so busy and then there was Christmas....\u201d Her voice trailed off. Her excuses all rang false, even to her own ears.</p><p>After a routine exam, Dr. Fred had Pamela take several vials of blood. When she\u2019d finished, he returned to the exam room. Thankfully Charlotte was dressed and prepared for the verdict.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d she murmured, not sure what to think. Perhaps all he had to do was prescribe iron tablets and she could go back to her regular life.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t know anything until I get the results from the blood tests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any suspicions?\u201d she asked, wanting answers.</p><p>\u201cI have a few ideas, but I\u2019ll wait for confirmation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were like this with Clyde, too,\u201d she said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be irresponsible if I indulged in speculation, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I suppose,\u201d she said reluctantly.</p><p>Dr. Fred chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you brought me any of your green tomato mincemeat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re shameless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d He peeked inside her knitting bag.</p><p>Charlotte slapped his hand and then pulled out a tall Mason jar filled with his favorite pie mixture.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I feed you mincemeat,\u201d Charlotte said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call when the test results are in,\u201d he told her as he walked her to the door.</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t have any answers yet, Charlotte felt better during the next few days. For too long she\u2019d ignored her health and now that she\u2019d taken a positive step toward finding out what was wrong, her spirits lifted.</p><p>Dr. Fred\u2019s office phoned early the next week; he\u2019d ordered a barrage of tests. One, a colonoscopy, required a trip to HarrisonHospital in Bremerton. Not wanting to alarm Olivia, Charlotte had her friend Laura drive her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had this procedure done myself,\u201d Laura told her when she arrived to pick her up. Bess and Evelyn had come along for moral support.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to pamper you,\u201d Bess insisted from the back seat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me feel like an old woman,\u201d Charlotte protested\u2014but not too loudly. Actually, she was grateful for her friends\u2019 presence.</p><p>Evelyn snickered. \u201cCharlotte, in case you didn\u2019t notice, we are old women. Now buckle up and stop complaining.\u201d</p><p>Although she was given anaesthetic, Charlotte was awake for part of the procedure. She heard the medical staff whispering together, calling over another doctor, pointing to an area on the screen. She wasn\u2019t sure what it all meant and anxiously awaited the verdict.</p><p>When Dr. Fred joined his associates, she could see from the look on his face that it was serious. When he did speak, she heard only one word and that was enough to send her world into a tailspin.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s friends chatted on the ride home, but her head was buzzing and she scarcely heard a thing they said. Laura came into the house with her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call Olivia?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Charlotte shook her head. \u201cNo...I don\u2019t want to disturb her. She\u2019s so busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her soon,\u201d Charlotte promised.</p><p>Laura fussed about her for a few moments and then, being the good friend she was, realized that Charlotte wanted to be alone. She hugged Charlotte before she left.</p><p>Sitting in her chair, with Harry on her lap, Charlotte reviewed her options. She didn\u2019t expect to live forever, but she felt she had a whole lot of life in her yet. When she was finally ready to talk, it wasn\u2019t Olivia she called but her son, Will, who lived in Atlanta.</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Will was clearly surprised to hear from her. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust grand,\u201d she lied. \u201cI imagine you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m phoning you at work in the middle of the day, since this is when the rates are high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thought did cross my mind,\u201d Will said. How like Clyde he sounded, her son, the nuclear engineer. How proud she was of him and Olivia, too. Suddenly Charlotte found herself trembling.</p><p>\u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Will always seemed to know when something was troubling her. \u201cI was in to see Dr. Fred last week.\u201d</p><p>A pause followed. \u201cWhen I spoke to Olivia, she said you\u2019d been tired lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, that\u2019s true. I have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired enough to decide you needed to visit Dr. Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You know how he loves my green tomato mincemeat. Normally I would\u2019ve baked him a pie, but this time I just brought him a jar. I had plenty of green tomatoes this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, you didn\u2019t call me to talk about your pies, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Dr. Fred have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not much. He wanted me to have a few tests.\u201d She pressed the phone hard against her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhich you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, he was quite insistent about that. The most intrusive one was this morning. It was at HarrisonHospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Olivia go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I couldn\u2019t bother her on a Thursday, especially at the end of the month. You know how busy her court schedule can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, Olivia doesn\u2019t know anything about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get the test results?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte felt the tears fill her eyes and was grateful that Harry was lying on her lap. Petting him soothed her and just then, with her fears close to overwhelming her, she needed him.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d Will said more loudly this time. \u201cAre you still on the line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the doctor say?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cWill, I know it would be a terrible inconvenience to you and Georgia, but I was wondering if you\u2019d mind making a trip to Cedar Cove in the near future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, what did Dr. Fred tell you?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte bit down hard on her lower lip. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have cancer.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t want this separation, but Rosie had taken the choice away from him. His soon-to-be ex-wife was the unreasonable one. He\u2019d been shocked and hurt when she\u2019d had him served with divorce papers. Basically he had twenty-four hours to vacate the family home. He was stunned that she\u2019d resort to seeing an attorney and setting everything in motion. Yes, they\u2019d talked about it, but that had been in the heat of an argument. He certainly hadn\u2019t expected her to kick him out of his own home.</p><p>Since she was obviously determined to go through with the divorce, Zach hoped they could at least handle the whole process in a civilized manner. Nothing he said or did would convince Rosie that he wasn\u2019t involved with Janice. He\u2019d given up reasoning with her. If his wife had so little faith in him, he was better off without her.</p><p>Finding an apartment within a reasonable distance of the house, however, had proved to be a challenge. Luckily Janice had been able to help him look; otherwise, he wasn\u2019t sure what he would\u2019ve done. Rosie knew his work schedule better than anyone, and he\u2019d hoped she would appreciate that with quarterly taxes due and the rush of year-end figures he needed to complete for his business clients, his free time was limited. In that hope, he\u2019d been mistaken. Rosie didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>Zach was trying hard to maintain a positive attitude for the sake of his children. His relationship with Allison and Eddie was the most important thing to him. He intended to remain a large part of their lives, no matter what the terms of the divorce.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to leave?\u201d Eddie asked, looking forlorn. His son sat on the end of the bed in the master bedroom while Zach packed up his half of the closet.</p><p>\u201cFor now that would be best.\u201d Zach refused to drag his children into his problems with Rosie. They were innocent. Rosie was the one he blamed. She\u2019d been acting like a jealous shrew for weeks, although he figured that was just a symptom of her insecurity\u2014an insecurity he\u2019d done nothing to cause.</p><p>\u201cI want you and Allison to come over to my apartment with me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo stay?\u201d</p><p>This was difficult. \u201cYour mother and I need to work that out. Right now I just want you to see where I live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Eddie sounded like he was trying not to cry. \u201cCan I come anytime I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! My apartment is your home, too.\u201d</p><p>Eddie shifted on the mattress and sat on his hands. \u201cDo you still love Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Zach set a work shirt on the stack already in the middle of the bed, then sat down beside his son. He placed his arm around Eddie\u2019s shoulders and struggled for the right words. \u201cSometime two people who love each other can\u2019t agree on certain things anymore. When that happens, it\u2019s better if they live apart.\u201d</p><p>Eddie lowered his head. \u201cMom said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Funny that they could agree on the rationale for divorce more than they could agree on anything to do with their marriage. They hadn\u2019t spoken much in the last few weeks. All communication had been through their attorneys, which was ridiculous as far as Zach was concerned, since he\u2019d continued to live at home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAllison says this whole divorce is bogus.\u201d</p><p>Zach noted that bogus was currently a favorite word of his daughter\u2019s. He didn\u2019t bother to respond.</p><p>\u201cWill you talk to Mom?\u201d</p><p>Not if he could avoid it, Zach mused. They no longer argued, and for that he was grateful. If anything, Rosie went out of her way to be polite. It was almost as though they were strangers. His wife, however, had plenty to say to her attorney. His sins were outlined in legal documents that went on for pages. Knowing it would anger him to read anything more than the title page, Zach left everything to his attorney. He\u2019d known Otto Benson for years and had frequently worked with him, and he trusted Otto to represent him fairly.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready to help me load everything into the car?\u201d he asked his son.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Eddie didn\u2019t reveal a lot of enthusiasm. He slid off the edge of the bed and paraded behind Zach with an armload of clothes. Zach arranged the starched dress shirts on the back seat of his car and took the stack Eddie had brought out with him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see my apartment?\u201d he asked Allison when he returned to the kitchen.</p><p>His daughter removed her earphones and turned off the portable CD player. She stared at him a moment as though she hadn\u2019t heard. Finally she muttered, \u201cAre you really going to leave, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you vowed to always love Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and this is hard, but you can see that your mother and I do nothing but argue. That\u2019s not good. We\u2019re going through this divorce for you kids, to save you from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing this for me and Eddie? I don\u2019t think so, Dad. It seems to me you and Mom are doing this for yourselves. Eddie and I just happen to be stuck in the middle, and I hate it. I really, really hate it.\u201d She was shouting by the time she finished. Before Zach could reply, Allison slipped the headphones back over her ears, blocking him out.</p><p>Zach saw the tears in his daughter\u2019s eyes and they twisted his gut. He wanted to tell her that the difficulties between him and Rosie had nothing to do with her or Eddie. This wasn\u2019t their fault.</p><p>Maybe he and Rosie had outgrown each other. That was something he\u2019d read in an article on marriage breakdown that Janice had given him. She\u2019d photocopied it from some women\u2019s magazine. Maybe he and Rosie had stopped having anything, other than the kids and the house, in common, as the article suggested. Perhaps because he made a good living and they were now financially comfortable they\u2019d lost that sense of being partners, facing the world together, creating dreams together. Lately their marriage had been filled with bitterness and resentment. All they did was make each other miserable, and that was no way to live and certainly not a healthy environment in which to raise their children.</p><p>Looking around the house one last time, Zach loaded up his remaining essentials. For obvious reasons, Rosie had been missing for most of the day. This was no surprise, seeing that she spent the greater part of every weekend with people other than her family, anyway. Nor did it upset him when he noticed the breakfast dishes still in the sink, unwashed. That was par for the course. He had his own list of sins that his wife had committed, but unless she made it impossible, he was taking the higher road and refused to drag her faults into a courtroom.</p> <p>\u201cYou coming to see my new apartment?\u201d he asked Eddie, striving for a bit of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have your own room there, you know.\u201d The second bedroom was necessary if he intended to have the children stay with him, and Zach did. He couldn\u2019t afford beds just yet, but he\u2019d buy them as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna sleep in the same room as Allison,\u201d Eddie complained.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep in my room if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>That appeared to appease Eddie for the moment.</p> <p>Before he left, Zach asked Allison a second time if she wanted to see his new place, but she sat with her earphones on, music blaring, and pretended not to hear him. She was angry and Zach understood how she felt. Eventually she\u2019d come around and they\u2019d be able to discuss this. Allison had always been closer to him than her mother.</p><p>The two-bedroom apartment was a little less than three miles from the house on Pelican Court</p><p>. It wasn\u2019t as large, but then he could barely afford to maintain two households. He\u2019d wanted a three-bedroom place, but couldn\u2019t find one within his limited budget. He\u2019d chosen this complex so the kids would still be in the same school district. Otto was hammering out a parenting plan with Rosie\u2019s attorney.</p><p>Once at his apartment, Zach opened the door for his son. Eddie walked into the living room and glanced around, frowning. \u201cWhere\u2019s the TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking the one in the master bedroom.\u201d Rosie and he were still in the process of dividing everything up, but most of the furniture had yet to be moved. So far, Rosie hadn\u2019t been difficult about the division of household assets, and Zach trusted that would continue. Considering that he was the one who\u2019d paid for everything in the family home, it was only right that he take what he needed for his new place.</p><p>Apparently it hadn\u2019t occurred to Rosie that she was going to have to find a job. Zach made a respectable income, but he couldn\u2019t afford to pay all the expenses for two households. For the first time since the children were born, Rosie would be forced to work outside the home.</p><p>\u201cCheck out the bedroom,\u201d Zach said as he hauled a load of clothes into the larger of the two rooms. The newly carpeted room was stark and empty without a bed, but all of that would be resolved shortly. Soon, Zach told himself, he\u2019d feel just as much at home here as he had in the family residence.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d A soft rapping was followed by a voice Zach recognized instantly.</p><p>\u201cJanice.\u201d Zach hadn\u2019t expected a visit from his assistant, especially on a weekend. \u201cHello,\u201d he said.</p><p>Shyly, she came into the apartment with a boy close to Eddie\u2019s age.</p><p>\u201cThis is my son, Chris,\u201d she said with her arm around her son\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThis is Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Eddie said, sounding tentative.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d stop by and ask if you have everything you need,\u201d Janice said. \u201cI know how much work moving can be and I wanted to see if there\u2019s anything I can do.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always been helpful, and Zach appreciated her efforts more than ever. She brought in a sack and placed it on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cEddie, why don\u2019t you show Chris the apartment?\u201d Zach suggested. Almost immediately the two boys disappeared into the back bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI brought you a housewarming gift,\u201d Janice said, then proceeded to unpack a coffeepot, plus grounds.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do that.\u201d Zach remained on the other side of the kitchen, a little uncomfortable with her generosity.</p><p>\u201cI know...You can tell me to get lost if you want, but I knew you were moving in today. I know from my own experience how difficult this is and I hope the transition goes smoothly for you and your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Zach preferred to keep his business and his personal life separate, but without Janice\u2019s help in this recent crisis, he didn\u2019t know what he would\u2019ve done.</p><p>An hour later when he drove back to the house with Eddie, the first thing he noticed was Rosie\u2019s car parked in the driveway. Eddie brightened as soon as he saw it. He threw open the car door and raced toward the house. Zach followed with far less enthusiasm. He\u2019d hoped to move all his personal stuff before Rosie returned. There were still books and CDs and...</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Rosie said, her face tense, but not unfriendly. \u201cI see you\u2019re packing up.\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded.</p><p>\u201cI made a new friend,\u201d Eddie said, hugging his mother about the waist.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice. You\u2019ll have friends both here and at your dad\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris doesn\u2019t live in the apartment building. His mother is Dad\u2019s assistant and they came over with a gift to warm the house.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, his wife\u2019s eyes narrowed to thin, angry slits. \u201cI\u2019ll just bet,\u201d she muttered under her breath, then stormed out of the kitchen.</p><p>Zach\u2019s shoulders sagged in defeat. This was something Rosie would try to use against him when they went to court. Janice\u2019s innocent gesture of friendship and support would be turned into \u201cevidence.\u201d</p><p>Cliff Harding had a good feeling about this Saturday afternoon date with Grace. It\u2019d been three weeks since their dinner and they\u2019d spoken intermittently on the phone. He could tell that Grace still had reservations regarding their relationship. Something had happened in the past three weeks. He wasn\u2019t sure what, but when they did speak she\u2019d sounded shaken and uneasy. When he asked her about it, she made excuses and quickly got off the phone.</p><p>Under normal conditions, he would\u2019ve questioned Charlotte, who was his best source when it came to Grace, but his friend had enough to deal with. She\u2019d soon undergo surgery, followed by chemo, which was hard on a person, physically and emotionally. He\u2019d seen his own father waste away, ravaged by lung cancer. Of course, back in those days they didn\u2019t have the effective cancer treatments they had now. Still...</p><p>So, no, he couldn\u2019t ask Charlotte what was going on with Grace. She had troubles enough of her own.</p><p>But Cliff was convinced it had to do with Dan. She wanted answers about what had happened to her ex-husband, and hadn\u2019t realized yet that the peace she sought had to come from within.</p><p>However, he was encouraged by her invitation to lunch. Perhaps now he\u2019d understand what had caused her to withdraw from such a promising beginning.</p><p>It was a blustery, windy day, the first weekend in February, when he drove into town. The sky was leaden, threatening rain.</p><p>Buttercup announced his arrival with a sharp bark, then ambled onto the porch where Cliff stood waiting. The golden retriever wagged her tail, and after Cliff rang the front doorbell, he leaned down and stroked the dog\u2019s silky fur. At least he\u2019d managed to win her over.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cliff,\u201d Grace said, sounding stiff and reserved. She unlocked the screen door to let him in. \u201cTypical February day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He agreed, thinking she looked wonderful in a red turtleneck sweater and tight jeans. The scent of chili simmering in a Crock-Pot on the kitchen counter wafted toward him and he breathed in appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cSmells good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my chili.\u201d Her eyes refused to meet his. \u201cWould you like to sit down?\u201d She motioned toward the living room.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She waited until he was seated, then sat across from him. \u201cI\u2019ve been rude lately and I thought I should explain what\u2019s been going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He waited patiently, settling back on the worn, comfortable chair. He noticed she didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with her hands. First she clasped them together as though praying, then she slid them between her knees. Buttercup lay down at Grace\u2019s feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace looked sheepish. \u201cHave I done it that often?\u201d</p><p>He merely shrugged, smiling a little.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, it\u2019s just that every time I\u2019m convinced that seeing you is the right thing, something happens that causes me to question myself.\u201d She stared at her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it this time?\u201d</p> <p>Grace gently petted Buttercup\u2019s head. \u201cDo you remember when you came that one Saturday last fall and fixed the garage door and cleaned the gutters for me? I was grateful in more ways than the obvious. For the first time since Dan left, I felt like I could go on\u2014that I could let go of my marriage.\u201d</p><p>Cliff had been encouraged that day, too. He\u2019d hoped it would be the first of many such visits....</p><p>\u201cThen shortly afterward\u2014on Thanksgiving Day\u2014I heard from Dan.\u201d</p><p>Now Cliff was completely confused. To the best of his knowledge, Dan had disappeared last April. No one, not Grace or either of her daughters, and from every indication no other friend or family member, had heard from him since then. There\u2019d apparently been a brief sighting in May, but that was it.</p><p>\u201cYou spoke to Dan?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she clarified. \u201cBut he phoned the house. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just...let me know he was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure it was him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t prove it,\u201d she said and straightened, clasping her hands again. \u201cIt\u2019s instinct. Early Thanksgiving morning, the phone rang and there was no one on the other end. It was Dan\u2014I know it was him.\u201d</p><p>Bad enough that Cliff had to deal with an ex-husband who\u2019d vanished into thin air; now he was stuck with ghosts as well.</p><p>\u201cThen after you and I went to dinner in Tacoma, I felt so good about seeing you. I really believed we could have a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Cliff insisted. \u201cWe\u2019re right together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought\u2014oh Cliff, that night was magical. I enjoyed everything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kisses?\u201d His ego demanded that she admit to enjoying their kisses as much as he had.</p><p>\u201cThose most of all,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Cliff\u2019s reaction had been the same. He\u2019d dropped her off at the house and he\u2019d felt ecstatic, full of anticipation, looking forward to seeing her again. Then silence, followed by various lame excuses. He hadn\u2019t known what to think.</p><p>\u201cA little more than a week ago, something else happened. This Dan issue refuses to go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he phone you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014this time I got a call from Joe Mitchell. He\u2019s the medical examiner. Recently a man died while staying at the Thyme and Tide bed-and-breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Cliff remembered reading about that in The Cedar Cove Chronicle. It was a strange story, one that didn\u2019t make much sense. Apparently the man hadn\u2019t been identified yet. \u201cHe was carrying false ID, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Joe said the dead man had gone through extensive cosmetic surgery, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d altered his appearance?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cJoe noticed he was about the same age as Dan and had a similar build. He was playing a hunch when he contacted me.\u201d</p><p>Understanding came in a flash. \u201cThe medical examiner thought it might be Dan?\u201d</p><p>She briefly closed her eyes and Cliff realized how traumatized and upset she must\u2019ve been to receive such a call. \u201cJoe thought I might be able to identify him.\u201d She gave a perceptible shudder. \u201cGoing to the morgue was awful. Just awful...\u201d</p><p>Cliff slipped closer to the edge of the chair cushion. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t Dan, was it?\u201d</p><p>Grace lowered her gaze and shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d She swallowed tightly. \u201cGod forgive me, I wish it had been\u2014not that I want him dead but I need answers. I need to know why he left and if he ever intends on coming back.\u201d</p><p>Her knuckles were white, and it was hard for Cliff to stay where he was. The urge to hold her grew stronger by the minute.</p><p>\u201cFirst the calls on Thanksgiving and now this. It\u2019s almost as if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalls?\u201d Cliff repeated. \u201cThere was more than one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually there were three, and every time we answered, all we heard was static. I felt the eeriest sensation, and I knew it had to be Dan. It had to be. Who else would phone not once but three times and then say absolutely nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a second.\u201d Cliff raised his hand, his thoughts swirling frantically. \u201cWho else?\u201d he echoed. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cliff cleared his throat. \u201cThat was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou phoned\u2014and didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d Her voice was raised in accusation.</p><p>\u201cRemember the blizzard I told you about? I tried to call you all day, and I did manage to get through on three different occasions. But the first two times, the only thing I could hear was static. The third time no one picked up and I didn\u2019t leave a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was you?\u201d Grace pressed her hands to her lips. \u201cBut I thought...I believed it was Dan.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes, and Cliff didn\u2019t care what she thought, he had to hold her. Moving onto the sofa beside Grace, he wrapped his arms around her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I would\u2019ve mentioned it earlier, but I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt as if Dan was reaching out to me\u2014as if he was saying how sorry he was. A year ago, we\u2019d had a wonderful Thanksgiving and this year...this year it was only Maryellen and me and...\u201d</p><p>Cliff brought her closer still and rested his chin gently on her head. She felt warm and soft in his embrace. More than that, it seemed so right to hold her. He savored these moments, treasured them. He yearned to tilt her face toward his, to lower his mouth to hers, but he didn\u2019t want Grace to turn to him in grief. When they kissed again, he wanted it to be in discovery. In mutual passion. In shared affection.</p><p>The front door opened suddenly, which shocked them both. Grace jerked away and inhaled sharply. \u201cKelly...\u201d</p><p>Her youngest daughter stood in the room, holding Tyler in a baby carrier, her eyes huge and angry. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cKelly, this is Cliff Harding, the man I told you I was seeing,\u201d Grace said, recovering quickly. She left the sofa and crouched down to look at her grandson. Little Tyler was sound asleep.</p><p>\u201cYour mother invited me to lunch,\u201d Cliff added, wanting it understood that he hadn\u2019t stopped by without a reason.</p><p>Kelly remained tense, standing there, glaring at them both.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sweetheart, sit down.\u201d Although her daughter was clearly furious, Grace remained courteous.</p><p>Kelly did as her mother asked, but reluctantly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about Maryellen?\u201d</p><p>Grace sighed and looked away. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my decision not to tell you. It was Maryellen\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own sister is pregnant, and I\u2019m kept entirely in the dark?\u201d</p><p>This was news to Cliff, too, but now didn\u2019t seem the time to mention it.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you take this up with Maryellen,\u201d Grace said. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is get between the two of you. I will say that I didn\u2019t agree with Maryellen, but the choice was hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you, though.\u201d Kelly\u2019s hurt was evident. \u201cShe didn\u2019t trust me? She left me to figure it out for myself, like...like I don\u2019t matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it was your sister\u2019s choice,\u201d Grace repeated.</p><p>\u201cHow many other people know? Am I the only one who doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guessed she was pregnant,\u201d Grace admitted. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me voluntarily.\u201d</p><p>Cliff could see that Grace and her daughter needed to talk, and his being there wasn\u2019t helping. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I leave for a while?\u201d he said, getting to his feet.</p><p>Grace reached for his hand and gazed up at him, her eyes appealing. \u201cYou will come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us an hour,\u201d she said.</p><p>Cliff nodded, and after bidding Kelly farewell, he headed for the front door. He wasn\u2019t halfway out when he heard Kelly tear into her mother.</p><p>\u201cHow could you date again?\u201d her daughter cried. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to Dad and already you\u2019ve got yourself a boyfriend. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do such a thing. First Maryellen keeps her pregnancy from me, and then I learn my mother has a few secrets of her own. What\u2019s happened to our family? Nothing\u2019s been right since Daddy left. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Then it sounded as though Kelly burst into tears.</p><p>Sunday afternoon, Olivia stood inside the main terminal of Sea-TacAirport, awaiting her brother\u2019s arrival. She glanced at her watch; Will\u2019s flight was due at three o\u2019clock and she had plenty of time. After several telephone conversations, it was agreed that he\u2019d fly in for their mother\u2019s surgery, which was scheduled first thing the following morning.</p><p>Olivia had a good relationship with her older brother. They\u2019d kept in frequent touch through the years, and he\u2019d lent a willing ear during that terrible summer back in 1986. Will had been as shocked as Olivia when Stan remarried so quickly following the divorce. Lately, though, it seemed that with their busy careers, brother and sister spoke less often. They\u2019d started e-mailing each other, but usually those e-mails were just a means of passing along jokes, news articles and statistics; they conveyed little that was personal.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s cancer had badly shaken Olivia. Her mother had always been healthy, vigorous, full of energy. In the last few months, she\u2019d watched Charlotte decline right before her eyes, but she\u2019d been so caught up in her own life that she hadn\u2019t realized the seriousness of what was happening. She\u2019d attributed her mother\u2019s growing frailty to old age.</p><p>At precisely the time he was expected, Will came through the secure section of the airport. He paused to look around. When he saw her, his eyes lit up and she walked into his warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as beautiful as ever,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you always were a liar,\u201d she returned. Already she felt better, knowing that Will would be with her on Monday. \u201cHow\u2019s Georgia?\u201d Her brother had been married for more than thirty years. Georgia was a career woman\u2014an advertising executive\u2014and hadn\u2019t wanted a family. Will had reluctantly agreed, but Olivia wondered if he regretted that decision. If so, he\u2019d never mentioned it to her.</p><p>\u201cLike me, my wife leads a busy life.\u201d</p><p>The oddly stilted words bothered Olivia, as did his detached tone. She suspected trouble in the offing, but this wasn\u2019t the time to ask him about it. She sensed that Will was not okay, or at least his marriage wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Once they\u2019d collected Will\u2019s luggage and paid for parking, they headed out of the airport and toward the freeway that led to Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cMy, my,\u201d Will commented when they turned out of the airport parking lot. \u201cWhere did you get that bracelet?\u201d</p><p>Olivia had hesitated before wearing the diamond tennis bracelet Jack had given her, fearing it might invite questions. \u201cIt was a birthday gift from Jack Griffin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe newspaper man? Mom told me you were seeing him.\u201d He glanced at her pointedly. \u201cFrom you, however, I\u2019ve heard almost nothing on the subject.\u201d</p><p>Olivia hadn\u2019t fully identified her feelings toward Jack and wasn\u2019t sure what to say about their relationship. \u201cActually I like him quite a bit.\u201d She felt her brother studying her and briefly let her eyes leave the road in order to meet his.</p><p>\u201cIf that bracelet is any indication, he feels the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he does.\u201d Feeling more comfortable about discussing Jack, she added, \u201cHis son\u2019s living with him just now and that\u2019s been a challenge.\u201d Eric seemed to be in constant turmoil, miserable one moment and elated the next.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Justine is happily married,\u201d Will said. \u201cNot so long ago, Justine laughed in my face when I mentioned the word marriage. She claimed she wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only is she married, she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking! As I recall, her laugh got a whole lot louder when I suggested she might want a family one day.\u201d</p><p>Olivia beamed at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her happier. I love Seth all the more because of that. Oh, Will, I want you to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd James\u2019s marriage is going well?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cStan and I were shocked at how quickly it all came about, but I\u2019ve met Selina and she\u2019s a good match for him. I\u2019ll bore you with the latest pictures of Isadora Delores the minute I get a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>They entered the freeway, and Will reached for his cell phone. He punched in a number, held the phone to his ear for a moment, and then clicked it off. \u201cI thought I\u2019d let Georgia know I\u2019ve arrived. She must be out.\u201d He said it as though he wasn\u2019t surprised, but Olivia wondered why he didn\u2019t leave a message. Later, when Charlotte\u2019s operation was over, she\u2019d talk to him about it.</p><p>\u201cIs Mom emotionally ready for this surgery?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t tell. Judging by outward appearances, Charlotte was calm and confident. A few days earlier, however, Olivia had gotten a glimpse behind the mask and for a few fleeting seconds witnessed raw fear.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Grandma Munson died of the same form of cancer?\u201d Olivia asked her brother. Charlotte had brought up that fact the day she\u2019d been so worried, and Olivia knew she was terrified that history was about to repeat itself.</p> <p>\u201cI barely remember Grandma Munson,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s putting on a good face but she\u2019s frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s afraid colon cancer will kill her, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Olivia told him. \u201cShe wants to be strong. It\u2019s funny, but when she first told me about the cancer, I panicked. The crazy part is Mom\u2019s the one who comforted me. She gave me the information she\u2019d printed off the Internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom goes on the Internet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally. One of the knitting ladies she meets with at the SeniorCenter took a computer class. As soon as Bess heard Mom had cancer, she invited her over. The two of them went on a search to find all the information available on colon cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s certainly one of a kind,\u201d Will said. \u201cRemember all that business with the Yodeling Cowboy\u2014how she removed his effects and hid them in her underwear drawer?\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed, and it felt good to be with her brother.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Grace doing these days?\u201d he asked suddenly. \u201cAny news on Dan\u2019s disappearance? He\u2019s never come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of times Grace was convinced he\u2019d returned to the house, but that was early on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking in the forests all those years, Dan smelled like evergreen. Twice when she returned from work, the inside of the house had the scent of a Christmas tree. The only way that could\u2019ve happened was if Dan had shown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a peep. She thought he might\u2019ve phoned on Thanksgiving, but eventually found out it was Cliff. He\u2019s that friend of Mom\u2019s Grace has been seeing on and off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of Mom\u2019s,\u201d Will echoed. \u201cI\u2019d think he was too old for Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no\u2014Cliff\u2019s the grandson of Tom Harding, the cowboy actor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019d forgotten his name.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence and then Olivia said, \u201cYou know when we were growing up, I always thought you had a crush on Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never asked her out, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s because I was shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Olivia didn\u2019t believe it for a moment. \u201cI know she would\u2019ve loved it if you had asked her.\u201d And maybe things would have turned out differently for both of you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d Will sounded surprised. \u201cI think Grace is one of the most incredible women I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>His admiration was sincere and equaled Olivia\u2019s. \u201cI do, too. Even through all this craziness with Dan, she\u2019s been solid as a rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone know what happened to Dan? Any evidence at all?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cI wish there was, but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a calculated guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth?\u201d She glanced away from the road long enough to gauge his reaction. \u201cEveryone assumes there\u2019s another woman involved. He bought a ring just before he disappeared and then later he was seen in town with a woman. It was almost as if he was flaunting his affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Dan wasn\u2019t exactly Mr. Personality. He was never the same after Vietnam. Sometimes, for no obvious reason, he went into these depressions and closed out the world. He\u2019d be completely unresponsive\u2014sometimes even cruel. When he was like that, he made life miserable for Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she stay with him all those years?\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t entirely sure, but she had her own theory, based on her long friendship with Grace. \u201cShe\u2019s an honorable woman. When she said her vows, she meant them. For better or for worse. But Grace got the worse a lot more often than she got the better\u2014and a lot more often than either of us will ever know. Still, she loved Dan and in his own way, Dan loved her.\u201d</p><p>Olivia exited the freeway at the second Cedar Cove off-ramp and drove toward her mother\u2019s home. \u201cWhen we get to Mom\u2019s, beware of Harry. He\u2019s pretty protective of her.\u201d</p><p>Will chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me Mom\u2019s got a man living with her.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Olivia\u2019s turn to smile. \u201cWait and see.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>While reading the February 7th issue of the Bremerton newspaper, Jack surreptitiously watched his son out of the corner of his eye. They\u2019d just finished a dinner of microwave lasagna and ice cream. Immediately afterward, Eric had begun to pace the small, compact living room of Jack\u2019s waterfront rental house as though he found it impossible to keep still. The boy had been getting on Jack\u2019s nerves for weeks. They\u2019d had more than one verbal confrontation during the months since Eric had moved in with him. Ironically, instead of driving them apart, their arguments seemed to have cemented their relationship as father and son.</p><p>When Eric had first arrived, they\u2019d both been careful, each afraid of saying or doing something to upset the other. That awkwardness soon dissipated when what was supposed to be only a few days had stretched into nearly five months. There was definitely a degree of irritation, but at least it was honest and they\u2019d finally moved beyond the superficial.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop pacing!\u201d Jack shouted when he could tolerate it no longer. He closed the newspaper and tossed it on the footstool as Eric glared at him from across the room.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d Eric muttered. \u201cI think better on my feet.\u201d</p><p>Jack expelled his breath in a rush, his patience in short supply these days. Briefly he wondered how Eric\u2019s co-workers handled his bursts of nervous energy. He wished he had Olivia to distract him, but she was busy with her mother. If she wasn\u2019t at the hospital, then she was entertaining her big brother. Jack hadn\u2019t seen her in almost a week and damn it all, he missed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem now?\u201d Jack barked.</p><p>Eric looked mulishly back at him and said nothing.</p><p>It went without saying that it had to do with Shelly and the twins. Jack had never seen anyone agonize over a woman more than his son.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting her anything for Valentine\u2019s next week?\u201d Jack ventured.</p><p>Eric whirled around. \u201cYou think I should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you talked to her?\u201d</p><p>Eric glanced away. \u201cA week ago. I called to see how she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d decided to walk away.\u201d Jack didn\u2019t agree with that decision, but this was his son\u2019s life, not his. He wanted to support Eric in whatever he decided about Shelly and these two babies. But as far as Jack was concerned, it didn\u2019t matter if Eric was the biological father or not; these twins were going to need a daddy. After meeting Shelly and getting to know her, he was convinced the children were Eric\u2019s, despite medical evidence to the contrary. Shelly simply wasn\u2019t the kind of woman who\u2019d fool around and it was clear she still loved Eric, regardless of everything that had happened.</p><p>\u201cI tried to forget about her,\u201d Eric snapped. \u201cBut I can\u2019t stop thinking about her.\u201d</p><p>Jack felt he had to help his son. \u201cYou know, Eric,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cthose babies could be your own flesh and blood.\u201d He\u2019d pointed it out before; after all, the doctor at the fertility clinic had acknowledged there was a slight\u2014make that minuscule\u2014chance. But it was still a chance.</p><p>Eric flopped down on the sofa and buried his face in his hands. \u201cYou think I haven\u2019t prayed for that? I wish to hell I\u2019d never gone and had my sperm checked.\u201d He hesitated, shoulders hunched forward, and when he spoke again his voice was so low Jack had to strain to hear him. \u201cLast week when I talked to Shelly, I suggested we get married and raise the babies together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrific,\u201d Jack said before he realized Shelly had obviously turned him down. Otherwise his son wouldn\u2019t be moping around, as miserable as he\u2019d ever been.</p><p>\u201cIt would be terrific if she\u2019d agreed.\u201d Eric\u2019s voice throbbed with pain.</p><p>Jack wanted to kick himself for being so insensitive. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. \u201cWomen can be unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>Jack chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou and Olivia seem to be getting along okay, though. I like her, Dad. She\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her, too.\u201d They got along exceptionally well\u2014or had until recently. In the last few months, it seemed that life kept getting in the way of their developing relationship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen, Dad,\u201d Eric said, straightening. \u201cIt\u2019s time I got on with my life. Shelly\u2019s made it obvious that we\u2019re through. I figured she\u2019d come to her senses and we could settle this, but it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for lack of trying on your part.\u201d Although Jack liked Shelly a lot, he thought she was being more than a little stubborn. He understood her feeling of betrayal about the fact that Eric had accused her of sleeping with another man, but his son had turned himself inside out in an effort to appease her. Apparently nothing he said or did could satisfy Shelly.</p><p>\u201cNone of that matters anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jack studied his son. His voice rang with a determination and strength Jack hadn\u2019t heard in a long time. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve applied within the company for a transfer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReno, Nevada.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly tense, Jack clenched his fists. \u201cAnd you got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but I\u2019m first on the list. I should know in the next couple of months. Once I hear, you can have your house back.\u201d He said this with a flippant air. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be a big relief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue\u2014and not true.\u201d Jack didn\u2019t want any misunderstanding; he craved his privacy but was grateful for this opportunity to know his son better. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed having you around, even though you drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe drive each other crazy, but it\u2019s been good. I owe you a great deal, Dad.\u201d</p><p>They hugged quickly, and Eric walked toward his room. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t going to make any difference, but I think I\u2019ll send Shelly flowers for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers,\u201d Jack repeated. He\u2019d make sure Olivia received a big bouquet, too. It was the traditional gift.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the card blank,\u201d Eric added. \u201cShe\u2019ll know they\u2019re from me.\u201d With that, he disappeared into the bedroom.</p><p>So Eric would be moving out and from the sound of it, the transfer would come soon. Jack sank down on the sofa, closing his eyes. He decidedly had mixed feelings about this, but there was one major benefit. He could get his own love life back on track.</p> <p>He liked everything about Olivia\u2014her looks, her smarts, her class. He loved the way she laughed at his stupid jokes and how she made him feel when he was with her. Okay, okay, he\u2019d admit he often thought about making love to her. It hadn\u2019t happened yet, but...</p><p>Excitement flooded him at the prospect of resuming their relationship, picking up where they\u2019d left off. He\u2019d learned a long time ago that Olivia prized honesty above all else. Knowing that, he planned on being completely straightforward; he\u2019d confess his feelings and ask where she felt the relationship was going\u2014and where she wanted it to go.</p><p>Standing he reached for his coat. \u201cI\u2019m heading out for a while,\u201d he called to Eric.</p><p>Thinking about Olivia made him miss her even more. They\u2019d only talked once that week, very briefly. When he\u2019d gone to visit Charlotte at the hospital, Olivia hadn\u2019t been there. Jack didn\u2019t feel he could press Charlotte about her daughter\u2019s whereabouts, but he was curious. Then, as he was leaving, he\u2019d run into her in the hospital lobby; she\u2019d been with her brother and had made somewhat perfunctory introductions, her mind clearly on something else.</p><p>It probably wasn\u2019t proper form to show up unannounced, especially at a stressful time like this, but he did have a good excuse. Charlotte wrote the Seniors\u2019 Page each week and did a fabulous job of it. Her friend Laura had willingly stepped in, but Jack needed to know Charlotte\u2019s prognosis and when he could expect her back. It wasn\u2019t a question he felt comfortable asking the older woman, so he\u2019d use that as an excuse to drop in on Olivia.</p><p>As he drove down Lighthouse Road</p><p>, Jack whistled, his mood light. The situation with Eric and Shelly wasn\u2019t ideal, but his son had done everything possible to salvage the relationship. He didn\u2019t blame the boy for wanting to get on with his life.</p><p>Jack loved Olivia\u2019s big old-fashioned house with the dormers, the square-paned windows and the wraparound porch. Light blazed from the front windows, spilling warmth onto the porch. His heart swelled as he anticipated her opening the door, imagining her smile, her kiss....</p> <p>Jack parked and hurried up the steps to her door. He leaned against the doorjamb, struck what he hoped was a sexy pose and rang the bell.</p><p>Only a few seconds passed before the door opened\u2014and Jack came eye to eye with Stan Lockhart, Olivia\u2019s ex-husband. Jack immediately straightened. He\u2019d met Stan last May and had disliked him on sight. From the look the other man gave him now, the feeling was mutual.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Olivia called from some distance away. She was probably in the kitchen. Music from Credence Clearwater Revival played in the background.</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend\u2019s here,\u201d Stan shouted over his shoulder.</p><p>Jack noticed that he was left to wait on the porch until Olivia arrived. The instant she got there, she threw open the door and greeted him effusively. Grabbing his hands, she pulled him into the house.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your party,\u201d he said, feeling like an intruder. He noticed she wore the bracelet he\u2019d given her and that helped ease his mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d she insisted, wrapping her arm around his. \u201cYou\u2019ve met my brother, Will.\u201d</p><p>Jack awkwardly nodded in Will\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cAnd of course you know Stan.\u201d</p><p>Again the brief nod.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re celebrating Mom\u2019s release from the hospital. She\u2019s doing really well, better than anyone expected. She\u2019ll be coming home in the morning! The doctors assured us they got all the cancer, which is a huge relief. She\u2019s still going to have some precautionary chemotherapy, but everything looks very hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is good news,\u201d Jack said. His eyes narrowed slightly as he focused his attention on Stan.</p><p>\u201cStan and I are old friends,\u201d Will explained. \u201cThis was the only time we could all get together before I fly back to Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>Jack appreciated the explanation. \u201cI won\u2019t keep you,\u201d he said. \u201cI just stopped by on the spur of the moment to see how Charlotte\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stay,\u201d Olivia urged.</p><p>He shook his head, invented an excuse and left as soon as he could. Olivia walked him out to his car but not before he saw Stan watching her. A chill went through Jack, leaving him as cold as ice. In that split second, Jack had read the other man\u2019s look.</p><p>Stan Lockhart was in love with Olivia and he wanted her back.</p><p>Grace grabbed her workout clothes and headed for the YWCA for her regular Wednesday-night class. Because of Charlotte\u2019s surgery, Olivia had skipped the last two weeks, but she\u2019d promised to show up tonight. Charlotte had been out of the hospital for a couple of days but she\u2019d been staying at Olivia\u2019s; she\u2019d be moving home on Friday. Grace was anxious to see her friend. They\u2019d spoken earlier in the day and Olivia had sounded short-tempered, which was unlike her. Obviously something upsetting had happened, but Olivia hadn\u2019t had time to explain. Grace just hoped it wasn\u2019t anything affecting Charlotte.</p><p>She waited in the parking lot, leaning against her car, until Olivia parked in the space next to hers. Her friend climbed out of her own car and jerked her gym bag off the front seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cJack and I got into it earlier today,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou and Jack? But I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to reason with him, but it was impossible.\u201d Her face reddened.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened? What was the argument about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called me first thing this morning, and you wouldn\u2019t believe what he said to me.\u201d</p><p>Grace practically had to run in order to keep up with her as they started toward the gym. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s jealous of Stan. Good grief, Stan and I have been divorced for sixteen years! He\u2019s been married to Marge almost that long. But that\u2019s not the half of it.\u201d Venting her frustration, she shoved open the gym door. Stopping abruptly, she crossed her arms. \u201cEnough! I can\u2019t talk about it anymore. Every time I do, I get more upset.\u201d</p><p>As always, the gym was bustling with all kinds of activities. Weaving through the crowded entry, Grace followed Olivia into the locker room, where they began to change into their workout clothes. Grace sat on the bench and put on her tennis shoes.</p><p>Olivia yanked off her sweater and slacks; she wore her leotard and tights underneath. She adjusted the tights, snapping the waistband viciously. Grace cringed. Then Olivia pulled on her sweatband, disarranging her hair.</p><p>\u201cHow are Justine and Seth doing?\u201d Grace asked, broaching a new subject. She didn\u2019t know what else Jack had said, but it must\u2019ve been a hell of a fight.</p><p>Olivia sagged onto the bench. \u201cPoor Justine is worrying herself sick about this restaurant. She\u2019s working too hard, and the only person she\u2019ll listen to is Seth. I\u2019m absolutely delighted that she\u2019s pregnant, but I do think they might have waited a few months.\u201d</p><p>Grace understood Olivia\u2019s concern. They hadn\u2019t been married long but they\u2019d already started on their family and a new business. To complicate their lives, Justine continued to work at the bank and as far as Grace knew, Seth was still employed at the marina. In addition, they were having extensive remodeling done at the restaurant. Between getting bids and working with contractors, the young couple was run ragged.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s doing okay?\u201d Grace asked next.</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cMom\u2019s weak and she sleeps quite a bit, but she\u2019s doing remarkably well.\u201d</p><p>Grace was relieved to hear that.</p><p>Olivia glanced at her and then said, \u201cCliff sent the most beautiful floral arrangement. He really is very thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t want to talk about Cliff Harding. She hadn\u2019t seen him since the Saturday they were interrupted by Kelly. Her daughter had been rude and unfriendly and Grace was embarrassed by the way Kelly had treated him. Cliff had returned later that afternoon, but the mood was broken. She\u2019d wanted to apologize, tell him how much she regretted Kelly\u2019s intrusion. She\u2019d let it slide, just as she\u2019d allowed so many things to slide during her marriage. Cliff hadn\u2019t brought up the subject, either, and now it hung between them like an argument they hadn\u2019t resolved.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s Will flying out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left this afternoon. I\u2019m going to miss him.\u201d Olivia gave a deep sigh. \u201cDespite the circumstances, this was a good trip. It\u2019s been a long time since the two of us had a chance to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll consider vacationing here more often,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cI hope he does. Will\u2019s a wonderful man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stood for a moment, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She shook her head as though to dispel her thoughts. \u201cLet\u2019s get this show on the road,\u201d she said, urging Grace toward the room where the aerobics class was held. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most Wednesdays, Grace enjoyed this class. She\u2019d reluctantly agreed to it when Olivia had asked her a year earlier; she wasn\u2019t athletically inclined and had never enjoyed exercising. What made it tolerable was knowing she could count on seeing her best friend at least once a week. But because the class was demanding, the only opportunities they had to talk were before and after the workout. Sometimes they found themselves standing in the parking lot, chatting for an hour or more.</p><p>That night, by the time class was over, Grace had worked up a sweat. Thank goodness for the cool-down exercises, she thought; her heart was pounding furiously. Olivia\u2019s face was red and her hair drenched. She\u2019d driven herself harder than ever, working out her frustrations over Jack, Grace suspected.</p><p>\u201cI needed that,\u201d Olivia said as they made their way back to the ladies\u2019 locker room. \u201cI\u2019m still so mad at Jack I could spit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just Jack,\u201d Grace told her. \u201cIt\u2019s everything. You\u2019re worried about Justine and the baby. Your mother just had major surgery, and there\u2019s all the emotional turmoil around that. Now Jack\u2019s acting like a hurt little boy because he found you and Will and Stan having dinner one night and he wasn\u2019t invited.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia wiped her face with a towel and reached for her shampoo.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being pulled from every side,\u201d Grace went on. \u201cYour mother, your daughter and Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I am,\u201d Olivia admitted. She looped the towel around her neck. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the way I feel.\u201d She sat down on the bench and sighed. \u201cI really am worried about Justine, but she won\u2019t listen to me. She thinks I\u2019m an old fuddy-duddy because I\u2019m concerned that she\u2019s doing too much while she\u2019s in the early stages of her pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, Jack.\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice softened somewhat. \u201cI feel bad about our fight. I lost my temper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall him,\u201d Grace said. \u201cMy guess is he\u2019ll be thrilled to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia considered the suggestion a moment, then shook her head. \u201cNot yet. Give me time to calm down and I might reconsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to go out for dinner?\u201d She wouldn\u2019t have offered, since her budget was tight these days, but she knew Olivia still needed to talk.</p><p>\u201cCome to my place. I\u2019ve got plenty of leftovers. Mom\u2019s friends made her enough meals to last a month. There\u2019s a huge dish of broccoli lasagna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d Grace so seldom cooked meals anymore that anything homemade sounded heavenly.</p><p>Two hours later, lulled by a tasty meal, a glass of red wine and the sweet alto voice of Anne Murray, they sat in Olivia\u2019s living room. Charlotte was sound asleep in the back bedroom.</p> <p>Relaxed, Grace accepted a second glass of wine and closed her eyes. \u201cWhat would you think if I called Jack?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe used to do that in high school, remember? If I had an argument with my boyfriend, you\u2019d call and smooth the way for me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia giggled softly, sitting beside Grace on the sofa. \u201cOf course I remember, but it sounds a bit juvenile, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cGo ahead. See what he says.\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t need to be told twice. This was silly, but fun, too. Olivia gave her the portable phone and Grace found Jack\u2019s number on speed dial, then waited for the phone to ring.</p><p>Just before Jack answered, she changed her mind and passed the phone to Olivia. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d She was afraid Olivia was going to cut the connection. Instead her friend held the phone to her ear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to apologize for blowing up at you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t say anything for several moments, then she slowly smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven, too.\u201d She laughed at whatever he said. \u201cYou can thank Grace. She was the one who insisted I had to patch this up. As usual, my friend was right.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after, Olivia disconnected and looked over at Grace. \u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Grace felt good. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call Cliff for you now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but Olivia ignored her. \u201cHis number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me look it up,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know what it is, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise Olivia didn\u2019t immediately hand her the receiver. She waited until Cliff had answered, then said. \u201cHi, Cliff, this is Olivia Lockhart. I wanted to thank you for the flowers you sent Mom. They\u2019re absolutely lovely.\u201d After a brief discussion of Charlotte\u2019s prognosis, she said, \u201cI have someone here who wants to say hello.\u201d She handed Grace the receiver.</p><p>Grace drew in a deep breath and tried to relax as she brought the phone to her ear. \u201cHello, Cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d He sounded both surprised and pleased. \u201cI thought Olivia was staying with her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly\u2014Charlotte\u2019s staying here. But once she\u2019s back in her own house, her friends want to take turns spending the night with her. I\u2019m here because Olivia and I went to our aerobics class and then had dinner and a couple of glasses of wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that explains it. You\u2019re feeling brave enough to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never did finish our conversation that Saturday, did we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grace admitted.</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to try again?\u201d</p><p>It was as if she really had reverted to being a teenager. \u201cI\u2019d like that very much,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>\u201cSo would I,\u201d Cliff said, and then repeated. \u201cSo would I.\u201d</p><p>Sharon Castor, Rosie Cox\u2019s attorney in the matter of her divorce from Zach, had explained that the next step was a settlement hearing. Both parties would meet with their attorneys at a mutually agreed-upon location to go over the final details of the case, including child custody.</p><p>They were scheduled to meet at the library in the courthouse. The main problem had to do with the children. If they couldn\u2019t agree on custody and division of property, they\u2019d go before the judge in an informal hearing. Sharon had said the judge\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t binding, but it was most likely what would be decided if the suit went to trial. Meeting with the judge informally would save everyone time and expense, which suited Rosie. She wanted this over as quickly as possible. Now that the process had been set in motion, she was eager to get out of this disastrous marriage.</p><p>For the first time since Zach had become a partner in the accounting firm, lack of money was an issue. While they were married, they\u2019d lived on a budget and Rosie had been good about keeping their expenses within the confines of that\u2014admittedly generous\u2014monthly allotment. All of a sudden, she had less than half the money she\u2019d had before, and it was difficult to meet expenses. The financial difficulties she\u2019d experienced since Zach moved out of the house were bad enough. But he\u2019d taken half the furniture and half the linens and half of just about everything else. A dozen times a day she\u2019d reach for something to find it wasn\u2019t there. It was a harsh reminder of her husband\u2019s absence from the family.</p><p>Sharon Castor and Rosie were seated in the library when Zach and his attorney arrived. Rosie had found Sharon\u2019s number in the phone book. She\u2019d chosen her without references or anyone\u2019s recommendation because she was too embarrassed to admit to her friends that she needed an attorney. She wanted a female lawyer and she liked the name Castor. Rosie wasn\u2019t a spiteful woman, but she wanted Zach to feel like he\u2019d swallowed a dose of castor oil by the time she finished with him. He deserved no less after what he\u2019d done to their family.</p><p>Rosie and Sharon waited in silence while Zach and Otto sat across from them.</p><p>Rosie set her clenched hands on the table and so did Zach. She avoided eye contact with either Zach or his attorney. A sick feeling invaded the pit of her stomach. It\u2019d started earlier that morning and grown progressively worse all day.</p><p>\u201cDid you fill out your portion of the parenting plan?\u201d Otto Benson asked Sharon.</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d Sharon shoved the paperwork across the table for Zach and his lawyer to review.</p><p>What amazed Rosie was how civilized they were all acting. Her life was being ripped apart and for pride\u2019s sake she had to sit like a fifty-pound sack of flour and pretend everything was fine.</p><p>Zach and Otto put their heads close together and started whispering.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Otto said without emotion. \u201cMy client loves his children and he doesn\u2019t feel they\u2019ll receive adequate attention if they remain in their mother\u2019s sole custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly believe that!\u201d Rosie exploded. Zach was as much as saying she was an unfit mother.</p><p>Sharon Castor placed her hand on Rosie\u2019s forearm. \u201cDo you mean your client believes the children would be better off living with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Otto answered for Zach.</p><p>\u201cIn a two-bedroom apartment?\u201d Rosie burst out. This was a joke; it had to be. She was astonished that Zach would even suggest such a thing. Then it dawned on her. Zach wanted the house. He wanted to kick her out of her own home. Move her out and within short order he\u2019d probably install Janice Lamond. The thought infuriated her.</p><p>\u201cI could afford a larger apartment if I wasn\u2019t forced to pay all your expenses. It would help if you got a job.\u201d Zach\u2019s voice was close to a snarl.</p><p>Rosie glared at him, hardly able to believe that she\u2019d once loved this man. Loved him enough to abandon her career and bear his children. Now just looking at him made her sick.</p><p>\u201cThat brings up a point I wanted to address,\u201d Sharon Castor said, as emotionless as Benson had been. Rosie marveled at the other woman\u2019s calm, but presumably she was accustomed to this kind of situation. \u201cRosie\u2019s going to need classes for retraining and updating her teaching skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell she does,\u201d Zach said and pounded the table so hard the papers nearly slid onto the floor. \u201cRosie has a college degree. What more does she need?\u201d</p><p>Rosie started at the violence she saw in him. It shocked her, but she supposed it shouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d never believed her husband of sixteen years would cheat on her, either. While she didn\u2019t have proof Janice Lamond was sleeping with Zach, she certainly had her suspicions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true my client has a degree in education, but it\u2019s been a number of years since she was in the classroom. It would be impossible for her to get a position with the school district without some refresher courses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you want me to pay for,\u201d Zach snapped. His attorney whispered something to him. Zach seemed to want to argue, but after a moment, he gave a resigned nod.</p><p>Rosie could tell he wasn\u2019t pleased. Petty though it was, she was glad. She\u2019d never thought herself capable of this kind of emotion, but she hurt so badly that she wanted him to feel just a small part of the agony she\u2019d suffered in the last six weeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Otto straightened. \u201cMr. Cox will agree to pay for the refresher courses, but they must be completed within a predetermined time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy main concern is supporting my children and making a new life for myself,\u201d Rosie said.</p><p>\u201cYou have meetings and volunteer commitments every night of the week,\u201d Zach taunted. \u201cIf the kids live with me, they won\u2019t be eating packaged dinners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to do all this cooking and caring by yourself or will you be hiring your assistant to do it for you?\u201d Rosie was half out of her chair, so outraged she felt like screaming.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Sharon Castor said, again placing her hand on Rosie\u2019s arm. \u201cYelling isn\u2019t going to solve a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my children with me,\u201d Zach insisted.</p><p>\u201cAllison and Edward belong with me,\u201d Rosie countered.</p><p>Sharon Castor and Otto Benson exchanged looks.</p><p>\u201cIn instances such as this, when both parents have strong feelings about the custody of their children, it\u2019s best to work out a joint custody plan.\u201d Otto spoke first, laying the suggestion on the table for Rosie and Zach to examine.</p> <p>\u201cHow would that work?\u201d Zach asked, his temper cooling.</p><p>Rosie\u2019s own sense of outrage was partially mollified, although she hated the idea of her children being exposed to Zach\u2019s girlfriend. Joint custody wasn\u2019t a new concept by any means, but it wasn\u2019t something she wanted to consider. Frankly, she\u2019d assumed that Zach would rather not have the kids getting in the way of his new relationship. She\u2019d also assumed that his arguments to the contrary had been intended as leverage against her.</p><p>\u201cI recommend that the children spend four days with Rosie,\u201d Sharon Castor said, \u201cthen three with Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the following week,\u201d Otto Benson added, \u201cthey\u2019d be four days with Zach and three with Rosie.\u201d</p><p>Sharon nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat about child support?\u201d Zach asked.</p> <p>Leave it to him to ask about money.</p><p>Otto explained that in situations like the one described, there would be no child support paid. However, all expenses for the children, such as braces, summer camp and clothing, would be shared.</p><p>At first Rosie fumed that Zach would dare to bring up the subject of support at all, but the more she thought about it, the better she felt. This was an opportunity to prove to Zach that she didn\u2019t need him. He\u2019d figure out soon enough that he needed her, though; he\u2019d never appreciated everything she did for him. She\u2019d be free to make a new life without having to depend on him for anything and that was the way she wanted it. Perhaps joint custody was worth considering.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t afford a single night in a luxury hotel in downtown Seattle, much less two, but she booked the weekend anyway, using a discount coupon. Next she went to see Maryellen at the gallery. Her oldest daughter had been avoiding her since Christmas. Grace wasn\u2019t putting up with any more of that.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d she said, grateful that Maryellen was alone in the gallery.</p><p>Maryellen looked slightly apprehensive, and Grace knew she was searching for an excuse to cut this visit short. \u201cHi, Mother.\u201d She acknowledged her with a brief nod. \u201cTo what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come with an olive branch.\u201d</p> <p>Her daughter regarded her warily. \u201cWhy is that? Have we argued?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, but lately whenever we\u2019ve been together, I\u2019ve tried to ferret out information about the baby\u2019s father and your plans. That was a mistake.\u201d Maryellen had refused to answer any of her questions, and Grace suspected that whoever had fathered her daughter\u2019s child wasn\u2019t yet aware of the fact. Her biggest fear was that he was a married man. Maryellen\u2019s reaction to her probing led her to suppose exactly that.</p><p>Maryellen smiled. She wasn\u2019t as pale as she\u2019d been a month ago and anyone looking at her likely wouldn\u2019t guess that she was pregnant. But Grace saw it in a hundred different ways and was amazed that she\u2019d somehow missed her daughter\u2019s first pregnancy. Other than that one brief reference, Maryellen hadn\u2019t mentioned it again. At times Grace wondered if she\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>\u201cI got us a hotel room in Seattle,\u201d Grace said, explaining the reason for her visit.</p><p>\u201cA hotel room? What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur first and\u2014hopefully annual\u2014mother-daughter getaway weekend.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen raised her eyebrows. \u201cAnd Kelly\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Grace knew her daughters weren\u2019t exactly on the best of terms. Kelly felt hurt and angry that Maryellen hadn\u2019t told her about the baby. Grace made it a practice not to get caught in the middle of their disagreements, but right now that was difficult because Kelly was angry with her, too.</p><p>Kelly had always championed Dan. She felt betrayed by her father\u2014and now Grace was dating Cliff Harding, which she viewed as yet another betrayal. Maryellen\u2019s decision to keep her pregnancy a secret had been the final offense in Kelly\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf Kelly agrees to this, then I will, too,\u201d Maryellen told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping you\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>That evening she called her younger daughter. It was no easy task convincing Kelly to escape to Seattle for a weekend, but Paul encouraged her. Her husband, knowing Kelly was miserable, insisted this would be a bonding time for him and their son.</p><p>In the end, much to Grace\u2019s delight, Kelly agreed.</p><p>Friday evening, the three of them took the Bremerton ferry into Seattle and got a taxi at the waterfront. The young driver, clearly a recent immigrant, leaped out of the cab and opened the door for them, then hurried around to the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>This was an adventure for Grace, and she was determined to spend a memorable weekend with her two beautiful daughters. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have such a gentlemanly driver,\u201d Grace told him, her spirits high.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs.,\u201d he returned as he drove away from the dock. His English was broken but they all made an effort to understand his comments and questions about the city. He headed to the hotel on Fourth Avenue</p><p>and pulled alongside the curb, where the doorman stepped forward to open the car door.</p><p>Grace paid the driver and added a healthy tip. \u201cWelcome to America,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said and bowed his head. \u201cGod bless America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod bless America,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>The hotel lobby was plush and expansive, with a huge marble pedestal in the center boasting the biggest floral arrangement Grace had ever seen. They walked leisurely to the registration desk and checked in; Grace managed not to wince when she handed over her VISA card. A few minutes later they were escorted to their room by the bellman.</p><p>After Kelly had phoned to check on Tyler, she relaxed. This was the first time she\u2019d been away from her son for more than a few hours and she missed her baby.</p><p>Sitting on one of the queen-size beds, her youngest daughter wrapped her arms around her knees. \u201cDo you have names picked out yet?\u201d she asked her sister.</p><p>There was a tense moment before Maryellen answered. \u201cNot really...Actually, I\u2019m hoping for a girl and if the baby does happen to be one, I was thinking of naming her Catherine Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful name.\u201d</p><p>Grace felt tears prick her eyes, but she quickly blinked them away, not wanting to subdue the evening\u2019s mood by getting sentimental and weepy. She so longed for this weekend to be perfect. She wanted to laugh with her daughters, to talk and reclaim the closeness they\u2019d once shared.</p><p>When Dan disappeared, the three women had lost more than a husband and father; their sense of family and security had been damaged. For herself, Grace needed answers but at this point it didn\u2019t matter what those answers were.</p><p>In the meantime, it was as if they were holding their collective breath. They\u2019d been left suspended between what they knew and what they didn\u2019t. There were no answers to account for Dan\u2019s disappearance\u2014just doubts and questions. Because of this, a rift had slowly developed between them. It was that rift Grace was trying to heal.</p><p>They woke early the next morning, eager to explore and play tourist. They started with the Pike Place Market, eating hot rolls and drinking exotic blends of coffee on the street. They walked between long stalls, laden with every kind of fruit and vegetable. Grace liked the seafood stands the best. Fish, crab, shrimp, clams and scallops were displayed on beds of crushed ice. They cheered with the rest of the crowd as the fishmongers tossed large salmon to one another.</p><p>They ate lunch on the waterfront under gray, overcast skies. Next they toured the Seattle Aquarium and saw the Imax film of the eruption of Mt.Saint Helens, a tourist favorite. By the end of the day, they were giddy with exhaustion. No one was eager to go out again, so they ordered pizza, which was delivered to their hotel room. They sat on the beds, ate with their hands and laughed over paying an outrageous three dollars for a single can of soda out of the room\u2019s minibar.</p><p>Despite being tired, they stayed up, dressed in their pajamas and robes, and talked away the night. Each avoided the subject of Dan and all the conjecture that surrounded his disappearance. Nor did they discuss Maryellen\u2019s pregnancy, other than to come up with possible boys\u2019 names. Yet both subjects were very much on their minds. Like Grace, neither of her daughters was willing to risk the fragile peace they\u2019d discovered.</p><p>Sunday when they checked out of the hotel, Grace was tired, and more than a little regretful that their time had come to an end. Yet she was exhilarated to have shared this special weekend with her daughters. It was everything she\u2019d hoped it would be.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this again,\u201d she said as they sat in the ferry terminal and waited to walk onto the boat.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be as easy next year,\u201d Maryellen said. \u201cNot for me, at any rate. I\u2019ll have the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her,\u201d Kelly insisted.</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d Maryellen joked. \u201cYou sound very sure that I\u2019m going to have a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl,\u201d Kelly said confidently.</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do.\u201d She crossed her arms and stretched out her legs, leaning back against the hard wooden bench. \u201cIn my heart, I knew Tyler was a boy long before he was born and I have the strongest feeling that you\u2019re going to get your little Catherine Grace.\u201d</p><p>Grace had no idea whether her daughter was guessing or if she did indeed \u201chave a feeling.\u201d In any event, she figured Kelly had a fifty percent chance of being right. Most importantly, she saw her daughters laughing and joking together when only a few days ago she\u2019d thought that might never happen again.</p><p>When she\u2019d booked the hotel, Grace\u2019s rational self had said she couldn\u2019t afford this; now she knew it had been worth every penny.</p><p>Roy McAfee looked away from the computer screen and glanced down at the Sherman file on his desk, a file that grew thicker by the week. Months earlier, Grace Sherman had hired him to discover what he could about her missing husband. So far he\u2019d struck out. He\u2019d come across a number of potential clues, but they\u2019d all gone nowhere. Roy took this case personally and felt decidedly frustrated by his lack of success. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After twenty years on the Seattle police force, Roy had reached the rank of detective. Following a back injury he\u2019d sustained from tackling a suspect, he accepted early retirement. Timing was good; both their sons had graduated from college and were on their own.</p><p>He and Corrie had moved to Cedar Cove, where the cost of living wasn\u2019t as prohibitive and property values remained reasonable. Roy had expected to settle happily into early retirement.</p><p>What Royhadn\u2019t expected was how quickly he\u2019d grow bored with sitting around the house. Within eighteen months of moving to Cedar Cove, he\u2019d started a new business\u2014as a private investigator. Corrie had been around police work her entire life, and she took on the task of being his assistant and secretary.</p><p>When he hung out his shingle, Roy had assumed he\u2019d be getting mainly employee background checks and insurance cases, but the surprising variety of business that came his way made life interesting. His most puzzling and difficult case was the disappearance of Dan Sherman. The man had vanished so completely that if Roy didn\u2019t know better, he might suspect Dan had become part of the Witness Protection Program.</p> <p>Corrie walked into the office and brought him a cup of freshly brewed coffee. She nodded at the computer screen. \u201cDan Sherman?\u201d</p><p>Roy shrugged. Corrie didn\u2019t say it, but they both knew he just couldn\u2019t leave that one alone. The hours he put in these days were without compensation. Grace had given him a budget and the money ran out before he\u2019d found answers.</p><p>\u201cTroy Davis phoned,\u201d Corrie told him. \u201cHe made an appointment for this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Now, this was interesting. The local sheriff was only a nodding acquaintance. Roy had spoken to him a few times and their paths had occasionally crossed. Roy liked Davis well enough, but the sheriff didn\u2019t seem quite as sure of him. Reserving his opinion, Roy supposed, pending more evidence.</p><p>\u201cDid he say what he wanted?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Corrie shook her head. \u201cNot really, just that he might have a bit of work for you.\u201d</p><p>At three o\u2019clock exactly, Troy arrived and Corrie ushered him into Roy\u2019s office. Roy stood up to greet the sheriff, who was an inch or two taller than his own six-foot height and had a bit of a paunch. Too many hours spent behind a desk, no doubt. They exchanged handshakes and then both sat down.</p><p>Troy crossed his leg over his knee, drew a toothpick out of his shirt pocket and poked it into the corner of his mouth. He waited a moment, then asked, \u201cDo you remember a while back there was a death out at the Thyme and Tide? The Beldons\u2019 bed-and-breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Roy did recall reading about it. The story was almost a classic. A stranger who\u2019d appeared in the middle of a stormy night and booked a room, was found dead in the morning. No apparent cause. After the initial front-page article in The Cedar Cove Chronicle Roy hadn\u2019t heard any more about the mysterious stranger, although he recalled one additional detail. The article had stated that the man carried false identification\u2014a driver\u2019s license that said he was James Whitcomb from somewhere in Florida.</p><p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t have a name for that John Doe.\u201d Troy frowned. \u201cFor a while, Joe Mitchell thought we might\u2019ve stumbled across Dan Sherman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan? Surely someone would\u2019ve recognized him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur John Doe had undergone extensive cosmetic surgery. He\u2019s about the same build and coloring as Dan, which was why we brought Grace in to take a look at him. I felt bad about that. It was pretty traumatic for her, but she\u2019s a strong woman. I admire that in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t Dan.\u201d Roy figured he might as well state the obvious.</p><p>\u201cNaw.\u201d Troy\u2019s gruff response lacked humor. He shifted the toothpick to the other side of his mouth. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been too easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the John Doe\u2019s fingerprints tell you?\u201d</p><p>Troy dropped his leg and leaned forward. \u201cUnfortunately not a damn thing. He didn\u2019t have any. Apparently he lost them in the same accident that resulted in the plastic surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust bad luck? Or do you think he might\u2019ve had them removed on purpose?\u201d That was another possibility, although in the age of DNA, not as likely. But then, DNA technology was relatively new.</p><p>Troy raised his shoulders in a resigned shrug. \u201cYour guess is as good as mine. All I know is that his ID was false. He comes into town, stays at a bed-and-breakfast, and then turns up dead. Autopsy hasn\u2019t determined anything conclusive. It isn\u2019t your usual run-of-the-mill scenario.\u201d</p><p>Now Roy was the one frowning. \u201cDo you think he might be part of the Witness Protection Program?\u201d Funny how he\u2019d been entertaining that very notion regarding Dan Sherman a few hours earlier.</p> <p>\u201cI thought of that myself. There\u2019s only one way to find out, so I contacted the local FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were willing to help?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI gave them everything we had and they got back to me a week ago and said not.\u201d</p><p>So much for that possibility.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the vehicle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Mitchell got any ideas, at least, about the cause of death?\u201d</p><p>Troy bit down on the toothpick. \u201cLike I said, nothing in this case is coming easy. Frankly, we don\u2019t know. From everything Bob and Peggy told us, he looked perfectly healthy when he went to bed. Bob said he seemed anxious to get to his room, but Peggy attributed that to tiredness. It was late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does Mitchell think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t pinpoint anything out of the ordinary. He\u2019s ruled out just about everything. It wasn\u2019t his heart. Not all the toxicology reports are back, but it wasn\u2019t any of the common poisons. Basically, we just don\u2019t know what killed him. Seems he was healthy one minute and dead the next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime of death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Joe, it looks like he died in his sleep shortly after he arrived at the Beldons\u2019 place.\u201d</p><p>Roy had to admit to being more than curious now; this case was downright fascinating. \u201cI don\u2019t think you made this appointment just to discuss ideas with me. How can I help you?\u201d</p><p>Troy Davis removed the toothpick and discarded it in the garbage can next to Roy\u2019s desk. \u201cI can\u2019t classify this as homicide, but nothing\u2019s adding up here. He carried fake ID, but then a lot of people do.\u201d He sighed loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t have the manpower to invest in this case. I was hoping to hire you as an independent contractor to help us identify our John Doe. And if you happen to come across any other information, so much the better. We\u2019d be grateful to find out anything we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else can you tell me?\u201d Roy asked. He\u2019d already made his decision\u2014this was the kind of assignment he savored\u2014but thought he should know exactly what he was up against before he said yes.</p><p>\u201cJust that our John Doe was meticulous in everything he did. His stuff was neatly packed inside his bag. It looked like something out of a military school. His clothes are the highest quality, top-of-the-line. Expensive. His raincoat was some Italian brand I can\u2019t even pronounce. Cost more than I make in a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of car did he rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny thing\u2014you\u2019d expect a Lexus or something, considering the expensive clothes, but it was a Ford Taurus. Interesting, eh? You\u2019d assume he could afford to rent whatever he wanted, but he chose about as inconspicuous a vehicle as you can get.\u201d</p><p>That brought up another question. \u201cWhat kind of cash did he have on him?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple hundred dollars. Nothing out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Roy said firmly. \u201cCount me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Troy stood and offered Roy his hand. \u201cIf you\u2019ll stop at the office, I\u2019ll give you copies of our files, and you can go from there.\u201d</p><p>Roy could hardly wait. As Troy left, Corrie hurried into the room, her eyes questioning. \u201cHe has a case for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just any case,\u201d Roy said. He stood at the window, watching the sheriff step out of the building and head toward the parked patrol car. This John Doe was as intriguing as any case he\u2019d ever handled.</p><p>Olivia had bran muffins baking in the oven\u2014her mother\u2019s recipe\u2014and was singing along with a tape of the Broadway musical South Pacific while she washed dishes. The doorbell rang, and she shook soapsuds off her hands as she went to answer it. She didn\u2019t bother to turn down the volume.</p><p>Still humming, she opened the door to find Jack Griffin on the other side. He was hours early.</p><p>\u201cHello, young lovers, wherever you are,\u201d she sang, pulling the door wider and motioning him in.</p><p>\u201cLovers? Did I hear someone mention the word lovers?\u201d He wagged his eyebrows playfully and stepped into the house. The music swirled around them and taking Olivia by the waist he bent her dramatically over his arm, then brought her upright.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she said, playing along. \u201cYou do make my heart beat fast.\u201d</p><p>Taking her by the shoulders, Jack faced her and his smile slowly faded. \u201cI want you to go back to the word lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s young lovers, as in coral sands and banyan trees in the South Pacific during World War II.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, taking her fully into his arms now. \u201cForget young. The word is simply lovers, as in you and me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew darker and more intense. Olivia realized this wasn\u2019t a joke anymore but a question that Jack\u2014her fun-loving, anything-for-a-laugh companion\u2014was presenting to her. \u201cI...\u201d All of a sudden life seemed very complicated. Jack had phoned earlier in the day and suggested they get together; he wanted to talk. He\u2019d sounded lighthearted for the first time in months. Olivia guessed that it had something to do with Eric. A few weeks ago, Jack had mentioned that his son had requested a job transfer and would be moving out shortly. He said he\u2019d miss the boy, but he\u2019d sounded pleased about Eric\u2019s resolve and renewed energy\u2014and no less pleased about having his house to himself again.</p><p>Before she was forced to reply, the timer on her oven rang, offering Olivia the perfect excuse to escape Jack and his question.</p><p>\u201cThe muffins,\u201d she said, and hurried into the kitchen. She grabbed two crocheted potholders and pulled out the tin. She set the muffins on the counter to cool.</p><p>When she turned around, Jack stood in the entryway. His eyes met hers. \u201cEric\u2019s moving out this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that must be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to start off with that question about us, but you presented the perfect opening when you waltzed up to the door singing about lovers.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been caught up in the song and hadn\u2019t meant to suggest they fall into bed together.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, listen,\u201d Jack said, slowly advancing toward her. \u201cI adore you.\u201d</p><p>She felt the same way about him, but she also felt afraid. She hadn\u2019t been with a man since her divorce, sixteen years before, and she trembled at the thought of sexual intimacy. Her hesitation frightened her, too; if she wasn\u2019t ready after all these years, then she might never be. And yet she wanted passion and that kind of closeness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Feeling as though it was now or never, she threw open her arms. \u201cKiss me, you fool,\u201d she intoned dramatically. All at once, her life had become the lyrics to a Broadway musical\u2014and she loved it.</p><p>Jack reached for her and their lips met in a wild and thoroughly passionate kiss. Her legs were shaky and her head was swimming. It\u2019d been a long time since they\u2019d kissed with such abandon, almost as if they both understood that true intimacy was irrevocable. Making love meant everything between them would change....</p><p>Jack shuddered as he wrapped her completely in his arms. The music had ended, so when his cell phone rang, it startled them both. He ignored it. Instead, he kissed her again, with the same frantic need as earlier. \u201cCome to my house,\u201d he whispered, his voice husky. \u201cI changed the sheets this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d This was supposed to be seductive?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about us there, overlooking the Cove, making love.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang five more times before it finally stopped.</p><p>The silence seemed louder than the ringing phone. Olivia took his face between her hands and gazed deeply into his eyes. \u201cDoes this have anything to do with Stan?\u201d she asked, needing to know.</p><p>They\u2019d argued over Stan, and in her opinion, Jack was being utterly unreasonable. He seemed to think Stan wanted her back\u2014which would be news to Marge, who\u2019d been married to him for more than fifteen years.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, kissing her. \u201cIt has to do with you and me. Leave Stan out of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d he countered.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how to reply. As she tried to think clearly, to emerge from the fog of kisses and music, the doorbell rang. Saved by the bell\u2014again.</p><p>When she hurried to open the door she found Jack\u2019s son, looking flustered, still leaning on the doorbell. \u201cDad?\u201d he shouted urgently.</p><p>\u201cEric, what is it?\u201d Jack asked, appearing behind Olivia.</p><p>\u201cShelly. She\u2019s in labor. She doesn\u2019t have anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe phoned you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a friend did. Her water broke last night and she\u2019s about to deliver. Could be anytime now. Her friend couldn\u2019t stay.\u201d He paused. \u201cI should be there, don\u2019t you think? She might need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Jack agreed.</p><p>\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t want me around, at least that\u2019s what she said the last time we spoke.\u201d He splayed his fingers through his hair. \u201cI should be there. I feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m packed up, ready to leave for Reno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>Eric seemed to be asking something and Olivia knew what it was, even if Jack didn\u2019t. \u201cDo you want your father to go with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Olivia loved Jack even more for the way he responded. He hugged his son, cast Olivia an apologetic look and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He turned back to her and stretched out his hand. \u201cWant to tag along?\u201d</p><p>She considered it for a moment, then decided against it. \u201cYou two go on. Call me when the babies are born.\u201d Pleased that Jack had placed his son\u2019s needs above his own, she took his hand in hers and gave him an encouraging squeeze.</p><p>Three hours later, her phone rang and it was Jack, calling from the hospital. \u201cIdentical twin boys,\u201d he said triumphantly. \u201cEric stayed with Shelly, and she was happy he came to be with her. Both boys are strong and healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am their grandfather,\u201d he said. \u201cThose babies are the spitting image of Eric. No one\u2019s going to doubt who their father is again. Especially my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do about his job?\u201d Eric had accepted the transfer and was expected to start at his new job in Reno in a week or so.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s up to him. Fortunately he\u2019s got a few days before he has to decide.\u201d</p><p>Seth and Justine had decided to call their restaurant The Lighthouse. Justine liked the name because it reminded her of the home where she\u2019d grown up, on Lighthouse Road</p><p>. The lighthouse at the far end of the cove was one of the community\u2019s most distinctive landmarks. Seth seconded the name because it underlined the fact that this was a seafood restaurant.</p><p>The idea of opening a restaurant had been in the back of his mind for years, but he loved fishing and the money was too good to turn down. Living aboard the sailboat, his expenses had been minimal and he\u2019d invested wisely. After he\u2019d married Justine, he realized that the long separations fishing demanded no longer appealed to him. Now, with a baby on the way, the time was right to start his new business.</p><p>His father agreed and offered to invest in the restaurant as a silent partner. It was a bold move on both their parts. Seth had done his research and was well aware that almost half of new restaurants failed in their first year. He was determined to minimize the risks, to do everything right. Menu, staff, prices, d\u00e9cor, promotion\u2014he and Justine had thought everything through. Seth was a decent cook, but he didn\u2019t have the expertise and knowledge that running a full kitchen would require. He advertised for kitchen staff and asked other restaurant owners for advice. He soon learned that Jon Bowman had an excellent reputation. When Jon applied for the position, of chef, Seth studied his resum\u00e9, then called and asked for an interview.</p><p>On the second Friday of March, Jon Bowman arrived, walking into the ongoing construction mess.</p><p>The renovations were only partially finished. A crew of carpenters were constructing new booths while electricians hung the light fixtures. The floors had been sanded and refinished, the walls had their first coat of paint and the windows had been replaced. Seth and Justine had decided to keep the original mahogany bar, which was a classic.</p><p>Seth led Jon into the room that would be his office and gestured toward the chair. \u201cI like what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Jon said as he sat down. \u201cWhen are you planning to open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping for the first week in May.\u201d</p><p>Jon glanced over his shoulder as though to estimate how much still needed to be done. \u201cEverything should be finished by then,\u201d he said confidently.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, we\u2019re looking for a chef. One who\u2019ll oversee the menu and work with us closely as we grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve been cooking at Andr\u00e9\u2019s for the last three years. I created their menu, which has an emphasis on seafood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd before then?\u201d Seth had already reviewed the resum\u00e9, but he wanted to hear the details from Jon. He and Justine had made a point of visiting Andr\u00e9\u2019s twice to sample Jon\u2019s signature dishes.</p><p>\u201cI was at the VFW in Olympia. I have references if you want.\u201d He handed Jon a single sheet of paper with a list of names and telephone numbers.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get your training?\u201d The resum\u00e9 had been decidedly light on that kind of information.</p><p>He tensed a little, but that might have been Seth\u2019s imagination. \u201cPicked it up here and there. I don\u2019t have a lot of formal education. I started out as a short-order cook for a breakfast place in Tacoma and worked my way up. It isn\u2019t like I\u2019m going to have my own TV show soon, if that\u2019s the kind of chef you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Seth assured him. He couldn\u2019t afford a celebrity chef, anyway. He remained curious about Jon\u2019s background, but didn\u2019t press the issue. \u201cI understand you\u2019re also a photographer.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cI\u2019m a damn good chef, but my passion is my camera.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hide his love for his work and that suited Seth.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to give me a chance, you won\u2019t be sorry,\u201d Jon said fervently.</p><p>Every instinct Seth possessed told him to hire the man. \u201cI\u2019m going to start stocking the kitchen in a month\u2019s time. Can you be ready by then?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. They discussed wages, benefits, recipes and other details. When they\u2019d finished, Seth took him around the restaurant and was pleased when Jon offered him design and decorating tips. He liked his ideas and shared them with Justine that evening.</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling Jon Bowman was going to be the one,\u201d she told him as Seth worked in the kitchen, preparing dinner.</p><p>\u201cI did, too.\u201d</p><p>Justine sat in their living room with her legs propped up to keep down the swelling in her ankles. At six months, the swelling was only slight, but still a concern. Seth had taken over the cooking and been inventive with eliminating salt.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a walrus,\u201d she complained, planting her hands on the small round bulge of her abdomen.</p><p>Seth leaned over the back of the sofa and kissed her neck. \u201cYou look so beautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNot like a walrus at all\u2014although they do have their charms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet serious, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am serious.\u201d</p><p>She turned her face to him and they kissed, and he realized\u2014as he did every day\u2014how much he loved his wife.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you know about Jon Bowman,\u201d he said, a few minutes later as he dished up seafood fettuccine.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis background. Do you know anything about it?\u201d</p><p>Justine needed to think. \u201cNot much. He used to sell his pictures through the gallery on Harbor Street</p><p>. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seemed a bit...edgy when I asked about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he go to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, but I talked to two of his references. Both were managers at restaurants where he\u2019s been employed and they sang his praises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen his photographs?\u201d</p><p>Justine moved toward the table, where Seth held out her chair. \u201cMaryellen showed me a few of them before Christmas. They\u2019re absolutely fabulous. You can feel the emotion and the beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Maybe we should buy a few. Hang them in the entrance. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my brilliant husband has just had another wonderful idea.\u201d</p><p>They smiled at each other, fully satisfied with their lives.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Rosie had the house completely to herself. A hundred times over the years she\u2019d yearned for a few hours alone, especially before a major holiday. Zach never understood how much work went into these family celebrations. For Easter, there was a dinner to prepare, to which they usually invited friends and other family\u2014although things would be different this year. Then there was dyeing eggs and making up Easter baskets for the children. Although Allison and Eddie were older, Rosie felt obliged to maintain tradition.</p><p>Now that she had the time to do all this without interruption, she found herself fighting off a sense of melancholy. The children were spending the day with their father, and it went without saying that Janice Lamond would find some reason to join them.</p><p>Curious though she was, Rosie refused to drill the children about the other woman. Naturally she was dying to know if Janice and her son were at the apartment at the same time as her kids. But she refused to drag them into this divorce, no matter how tempting it was to learn what she could about the other woman\u2019s activities. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Working in the kitchen, Rosie mixed up Eddie\u2019s favorite gelatin salad and placed it in the refrigerator to set. For Easter she always served ham but only because that was what Zach preferred. Since she no longer had to accommodate her husband\u2019s likes and dislikes, she\u2019d bought a prime rib roast. It was a small act of defiance, one that made her feel\u2014just a bit\u2014like an independent woman who made her own choices.</p><p>She began baking her usual Easter cake.</p><p>Her heart wasn\u2019t in it, but she persevered for the sake of her children. With the divorce in progress, they had enough upheaval in their lives without her subjecting them to more changes. The roast was enough of a deviation from tradition for this year, but next Easter they might do something completely different, such as take a trip.</p><p>The white bunny-shaped cake was Allison\u2019s favorite. Using two eight-inch round cakes, she artfully cut one layer to form ears with the center section serving as a bow tie. After frosting it, she used thin threads of licorice for the whiskers and brown M&amp;M\u2019s for the eyes. In past years the children had helped her with the decorating.</p> <p>She missed them, despite finally having the private time she\u2019d always craved, which confused her. She was also worried about Allison and Eddie being influenced by their father\u2019s girlfriend. That wasn\u2019t jealousy, she told herself; it was a reasonable reaction.</p><p>By the time Zach dropped the children off at the house, Rosie had worked herself into a nasty temper thinking about her husband and his perfect-in-everyway office assistant. He must\u2019ve been in a hurry to get rid of the kids, because he didn\u2019t stay in the driveway a moment longer than necessary, she noted resentfully, peering through the living-room window. The instant the children were out of the car, he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home,\u201d Eddie called as he came in the front door. He shucked off his backpack and dropped it in the entryway.</p><p>Allison followed him, her ears covered by a headset as she listened to her CD player. She seemed to be doing that constantly, and Rosie disapproved. She wanted to know exactly what kind of music Allison was listening to, but she wasn\u2019t up to the challenge of confronting her. She\u2019d finally decided that if Allison needed her CDs, she could have them, at least for the moment.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d Rosie asked, injecting some enthusiasm into her voice.</p> <p>Eddie shrugged. \u201cWe stayed at Dad\u2019s most of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Easter Egg Hunt the Rotary Club held?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for juveniles,\u201d Allison informed her, removing the headphones long enough to snarl a reply. She flopped down on the sofa in the family room, and Eddie headed for his Game Boy, sprawling on the carpet in front of the television.</p><p>Okay, Rosie thought. Apparently they didn\u2019t want to talk to her. Well, that was fine, because she wasn\u2019t in a talkative mood herself.</p><p>Allison\u2019s eyes were closed and her head bobbed to the beat of her music, whatever it was. After a minute or so, she lifted the headset again and looked at her mother. \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father didn\u2019t feed you?\u201d</p> <p>Her daughter looked at her as if that was the stupidest question she\u2019d ever heard. \u201cDad doesn\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spent the night with him. Do you mean to say he didn\u2019t provide you with a single meal?\u201d And this was the man who\u2019d criticized her for not making cooked-from-scratch dinners!</p><p>\u201cWe ate breakfast at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he take you out for every meal?\u201d Rosie muttered.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Eddie told her.</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t bother to answer.</p><p>\u201cDad said we should eat lots of ham for him tomorrow,\u201d Eddie said, keeping his gaze on the television screen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not having ham.\u201d</p> <p>Allison\u2019s eyes widened and she tore the headset off. \u201cDid you say we aren\u2019t having ham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I bought a roast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate roast,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cAllison...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have ham every Easter!\u201d</p><p>Rosie\u2019s heart sank. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have roast this year, instead.\u201d</p><p>Allison leaped to her feet and scowled at Rosie. \u201cYou did that on purpose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d Rosie asked, barely hanging on to her own temper.</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly what you did,\u201d Allison said and ran into her bedroom. The house reverberated with the sound of her door slamming.</p><p>Rosie looked to her son for an explanation. Eddie rolled onto his side and stared up at her. \u201cDad likes ham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your father won\u2019t be eating with us. I thought we\u2019d have dinner a little differently this year. I didn\u2019t think Allison cared one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Eddie told her, rolling back onto his stomach. Without a pause, he returned to his invader game. \u201cShe\u2019s just upset with you and Dad about the divorce.\u201d</p><p>Rosie sank onto the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWe had a big lunch,\u201d Eddie continued. \u201cSo we aren\u2019t really hungry for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Rosie\u2019s suspicions were aroused. \u201cLunch?\u201d she asked, nearly biting her tongue in an effort to keep from asking about Janice Lamond.</p><p>\u201cDad took Allison, Chris and me to an all-you-can-eat pizza place.\u201d</p><p>Rosie smiled benignly through her outrage. Chris was Janice Lamond\u2019s son and if he was over at the apartment, it went without saying that his mother had accompanied him.</p><p>\u201cI need to go out for a while,\u201d Rosie said, struggling to keep her voice even.</p><p>Eddie glanced away from the television screen and asked, \u201cAre you going to buy a ham for Allie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, although the idea hadn\u2019t occurred to her until Eddie mentioned it. Her destination was Zach\u2019s apartment\u2014so she could give him a piece of her mind. On the way home, she\u2019d stop at the Albertson\u2019s store to pick up a small canned ham in order to appease Allison.</p><p>Rosie felt as if she might explode before she reached Zach\u2019s building. Normally she left this sort of unpleasantness in her attorney\u2019s capable hands, but this couldn\u2019t wait for Sharon Castor.</p><p>No soldier marched with stronger purpose than Rosie did as she made her way from the parking lot to Zach\u2019s apartment. She braced herself, thinking Janice Lamond might be with him that very moment. She certainly wouldn\u2019t put it past him. The two of them might even be in bed together. The thought sickened her, but she didn\u2019t stop to analyze why.</p><p>When Zach opened the door to her fierce pounding, he looked stunned to see her. \u201cRosie! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Zach, do you have company?\u201d</p><p>He moved aside, letting her into the apartment. Rosie stepped in and her stomach twisted with an expected knot of pain. His new place was sparsely furnished, but what there was had come from their home. Her husband had brought this other woman into his apartment to sit on furniture Rosie had shopped for, to use the very dishes she\u2019d purchased and cherished and been forced to release.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Zach asked, his voice guarded.</p><p>\u201cAs a personal favor to me,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t entertain your girlfriend while the children are here\u2014at least until the divorce is final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Zach glared at her with such ferocity that she barely recognized his face.</p><p>\u201cJanice was with you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, drill the children about my activities?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not. Eddie said he didn\u2019t want dinner because of all the pizza he ate at lunch with Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ve made that abundantly clear. If I need to bring up this matter with Sharon, then I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it,\u201d Zach said, a smirk on his face. \u201cMake an even bigger fool of yourself than you already have. Personally, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d</p><p>Rosie refused to stand there and exchange insults with him, but it wasn\u2019t beneath her to get in one last parting shot as she turned and started for the door. \u201cI\u2019d have to go a long way to top you.\u201d</p><p>Zach slammed the door after her and she went back to the parking lot. Climbing into the car, Rosie found that her hands shook so badly she had to calm herself before driving.</p><p>Holding the steering wheel tightly, she squeezed her eyes shut in a desperate effort to keep from dissolving into tears.</p><p>Maryellen stepped into the A-line skirt and raised it over her hips only to discover she could no longer fasten the button at the waistline. She wasn\u2019t even six months pregnant, and her normal clothes had already stopped fitting. It was all too clear that she needed to buy a few maternity outfits.</p><p>\u201cYou want the whole town to know, don\u2019t you?\u201d she said to her baby, placing a hand over the slight mound. Her doctor was paying special attention to this pregnancy because of Maryellen\u2019s age. At thirty-five she was older than most of Dr. Abner\u2019s first-time patients.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t only her wardrobe that was about to change, but her entire life. She glanced around her home and envisioned what it would be like in a year\u2019s time. Where her bookcase stood now there\u2019d soon be a baby swing or a playpen; she didn\u2019t know which. She\u2019d need to find room in her compact kitchen for a high chair. Her second bedroom, which she now used as an office and craft room, would become the baby\u2019s.</p><p>A sense of excitement filled her, unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced. This was her baby, her very own child. This time she\u2019d do everything right. This time there wasn\u2019t a man standing in the way.</p><p>High on enthusiasm, she reached for the phone and dialed her sister\u2019s number. She felt closer to Kelly than she had in years. The weekend getaway had brought them together again, all three of them. How wise her mother had been to arrange it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get you up, did I?\u201d she asked when her sister answered.</p><p>Tyler bellowed in the background. \u201cThat\u2019s a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen smiled. \u201cYou doing anything special for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in particular. What do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me at the Potbelly Deli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Kelly had the luxury of being a stay-at-home mother. Paul and Kelly had waited years for this baby and were determined to make whatever sacrifices were necessary. That option\u2014staying with her baby\u2014wasn\u2019t available to Maryellen. She\u2019d have to find quality day care and wasn\u2019t sure where to even start.</p><p>Just before noon, Kelly arrived at the gallery, pushing Tyler in his stroller. At nine months, the little boy sat upright, waving his chubby hands, cooing happily and directing the world from his seat.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s grab some soup from the deli and eat down by the waterfront,\u201d Kelly suggested. It was a lovely spring day after a week of rain, and the fresh air would do them all good.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a great idea,\u201d Maryellen told her. Practical, too, since it would be easier to amuse Tyler at the park than in a crowded restaurant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maryellen phoned in their order and her sister trekked down to grab a picnic table. Several other people had the same idea, but she\u2019d secured a table for them by the time Maryellen got there.</p><p>Sitting across from her sister, Maryellen opened her container of chicken rice soup and stirred it with a plastic spoon. Cantankerous seagulls circled overhead, squawking for a handout, but Maryellen and Kelly ignored them.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to ask you a few things about being pregnant,\u201d she told her sister. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire away.\u201d Kelly licked the back of her spoon, looking childlike and mature at the same time. She removed the plastic wrap from her oyster crackers and gave them one by one to her eager son, who instantly stuffed them in his mouth.</p> <p>Maryellen didn\u2019t know what to ask first. For years she\u2019d watched her friends marry and raise children. They all seemed so relaxed about it. So natural. She felt none of that. While excited and exhilarated about the prospect of motherhood, she shared none of their confidence. Kelly had waited years for a baby; surely she understood.</p><p>\u201cWere you...afraid?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>\u201cTerrified,\u201d Kelly admitted. \u201cI read every book I could get my hands on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Her mother had raided the library shelves and given Maryellen a constant supply of the most recent books regarding pregnancy and birth.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you brought Tyler home from the hospital?\u201d</p> <p>Kelly laughed and shook her head. \u201cGo on to the next question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Paul and I couldn\u2019t agree on anything.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen reached for a small cracker and chewed it. \u201cI won\u2019t have that problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. How are you doing for clothes? I have the cutest maternity tops. Would you like to borrow some?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring them over this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great.\u201d Maryellen\u2019s heart warmed toward her sister.</p><p>\u201cWhat about day care? You need to start thinking about that, especially with being single and all.\u201d</p><p>That was, of course, another pressing concern. She had to think seriously about interviewing prospects and checking out centers.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Kelly said, leaning her elbow on the picnic table. \u201cI could do it for the first couple of years.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen was speechless. When she could talk again, she whispered, \u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to check with Paul first, of course, but I don\u2019t see why not. Another baby couldn\u2019t possibly be that much extra work and I\u2019m home, anyway. I\u2019d like to help you, Maryellen. What are sisters for?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s eyes filled with tears. This offer was completely unexpected. She looked away, not wanting her sister to know that she was fighting back emotion.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I realized the other day?\u201d Maryellen asked when she was certain she could keep the tears out of her voice. \u201cI was sitting in my kitchen, reading a magazine Mom recommended, and it dawned on me that...I was happy.\u201d</p><p>Kelly reached for her hand. \u201cI see it in you, too. I feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this baby so much.\u201d She pressed her palm against her midriff and closed her eyes. Lowering her head, she whispered, \u201cI wanted my first baby, too.\u201d</p><p>Her words were met with stunned silence.</p><p>\u201cYour first baby?\u201d Kelly asked, also in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI...I was pregnant when Clint and I got married. Oh, Kelly, I was young and incredibly stupid. It was an accident, but we should have known it would happen because we were so careless. Still\u2014it was a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with the pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen looked out over the choppy blue waters of the Cove. \u201cClint wanted me to have an abortion. He swore he loved me, but he wasn\u2019t ready to be a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he even suggest such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s throat grew thick, making speech almost impossible. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d want to get rid of our baby, but at that time in our lives, he felt a baby was...a nuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still married him.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded, feeling sick with guilt and with regret for what she\u2019d done. \u201cI...I loved Clint, or I thought I did. I told him I couldn\u2019t have an abortion and that it didn\u2019t matter if we got married or not. I was going to have my baby. In retrospect, I think he was terrified of having to pay child support and so he...he suggested we get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d marry me if I agreed to terminate the pregnancy. That was his way of proving his love, of showing me he was serious about our relationship. He insisted there\u2019d be other pregnancies, other children.\u201d She didn\u2019t add that Clint had forced her to decide between him and the pregnancy. Either she married him right then and had the abortion, or he\u2019d break off the relationship completely. Even now, all these years later, Maryellen couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell anyone how she\u2019d allowed herself to be manipulated.</p><p>\u201cSo you agreed?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded, her long hair falling forward over her shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it, but I loved Clint and I believed he loved me. So we ran off and immediately after a justice of the peace performed the ceremony, we drove to an abortion clinic. The whole time, Clint kept telling me this was for the best and that we were making the right decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Maryellen, you must\u2019ve been so torn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right decision for me, and even while I was at the clinic, I knew that, but I went through with it, anyway. I kept telling myself I wouldn\u2019t have the baby, but I\u2019d have Clint.\u201d Not much later she\u2019d realized what a poor choice she\u2019d made. Clint was controlling and manipulative, and before her marriage was a year old, Maryellen knew she had to get out.</p><p>\u201cI never liked Clint and now I know why,\u201d Kelly said, still holding tight to Maryellen\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve avoided being around children. That\u2019s why I was the first one in any group to make disparaging remarks about kids. I pretended I was too sophisticated and mature to want anything to do with them when my heart ached the whole time for what I\u2019d done. What I\u2019d missed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve carried this guilt and shame all these years.\u201d No one else knew, not her mother, not anyone. Maryellen had successfully hidden her ugly secret.</p><p>The child she carried now was as unplanned as her first, but this time she wasn\u2019t going to repeat her mistakes. She wasn\u2019t going to involve the baby\u2019s father. Jon didn\u2019t want the child. He\u2019d made that plain before Christmas, when he\u2019d asked her about the possibility of a pregnancy. She\u2019d seen the relief in his eyes when she assured him everything was all right. This time she was protecting her unborn child.</p><p>Jack sat at his desk late Thursday afternoon, reviewing an article submitted by Charlotte Jefferson for the Seniors\u2019 Page. It seemed to him that her opinions were becoming more and more political. Ever since her surgery, Charlotte had been on a mission to get a free health clinic in Cedar Cove. He had to hand it to her; she found a way to mention the need for such a clinic in every issue.</p><p>With his pencil in hand he started making the changes, cutting words, rearranging phrases for clarity and adding polish to the piece. Charlotte wasn\u2019t a natural writer but her skills had improved dramatically in the last year.</p><p>His phone buzzed and Jack absently reached for it. \u201cGriffin,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDad, I want you to sing into the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to what?\u201d His son had made some unusual requests over the past few months, but this was one of the strangest.</p><p>\u201cSing. Remember how you used to sing to me when I was a kid?\u201d</p><p>As though Jack could forget. He\u2019d sung to Eric when the boy was strapped to a hospital bed, incredibly weak from the devastation of his disease. The drugs had been experimental at the time, but they were Eric\u2019s only chance to beat leukemia.</p><p>\u201cJust sing! We\u2019re desperate.\u201d</p><p>Jack could hear the two baby boys wailing in the background and grinned. Glancing around to make sure no one was listening, he started humming a little ditty he\u2019d learned as a boy. \u201cTwo Irishmen, two Irishmen...\u201d</p><p>The cries increased and Eric got back on the line. \u201cYou\u2019re no help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in town?\u201d Jack demanded.</p><p>\u201cShelly needed me.\u201d Tedd and Todd, too, from the sound of it. \u201cYou have no idea how much work two babies can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in Reno?\u201d His son had agonized over the decision about following through with the transfer to Nevada. As soon as his twin sons were born, Eric wanted to be with them and Shelly. He used some of his vacation time, and for two weeks he\u2019d stayed at the apartment with Shelly and the babies, but he couldn\u2019t delay starting work any longer. Now he flew back each weekend for two days. At Shelly\u2019s insistence, the twins had gone through DNA testing, and what had been obvious to Jack the minute they were born was now official. Eric was the father.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d He shouted to be heard above the crying twins. \u201cAre you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Jack assured him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you could get Olivia to marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, son. If anyone\u2019s marrying Olivia, it\u2019ll be me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at Eric\u2019s laughter. \u201cSo, you and Shelly have decided to get married?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eric replied. \u201cIt\u2019s about time, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout ten months later than it should\u2019ve been, but you didn\u2019t ask my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelly\u2019s getting ready to move to Reno with me.\u201d</p><p>Jack hated the thought of being separated from his son yet again, hated the thought of missing out on his grandchildren, but he very much approved of Shelly. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to take my grandsons away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can visit anytime you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it,\u201d Jack told him.</p><p>They ended the conversation a few minutes later, after Jack agreed to ask Olivia about performing the ceremony for Eric and Shelly. Actually, he was grateful for such a good reason to see his favorite judge. They\u2019d been spending a lot of time together lately, and that was a trend he wanted to continue.</p><p>As soon as he could leave the office, he headed for Olivia\u2019s house. He found her working in her rose garden in the backyard. She\u2019d recently planted a row of bushes, which she pampered to a ludicrous degree\u2014in his opinion, anyway. But then, he believed in plants that looked after themselves. \u201cLike weeds?\u201d she\u2019d asked scornfully when he\u2019d shared his gardening philosophy. Today she wore a large straw hat that shaded her eyes, a pair of faded jeans and a worn man\u2019s shirt. Jack stopped to admire the view of her bent over the rose bushes.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d spoil me as much as you do those roses of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d she chastised. \u201cI\u2019ve just planted these and they need my attention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Jack complained.</p><p>\u201cStick around and I\u2019ll feed you dinner.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, glad of the invitation. His relationship with Olivia was complicated. If the twins hadn\u2019t decided to make their entrance into the world when they did, he might have coaxed her into bed with him. But when he\u2019d returned from the hospital, she\u2019d had time to think, time to assess whether this was the right step for them. Her decision was that, yes, eventually it should and would happen\u2014but unlike Jack, she wasn\u2019t in a hurry.</p><p>In the weeks since, he\u2019d done his best to shower her with love, much as she did those fancy roses she\u2019d planted.</p> <p>\u201cI heard from Eric this afternoon,\u201d he told her. \u201cHe asked if you\u2019d be willing to marry him and Shelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Olivia reached for a large watering can and sprinkled the freshly fertilized earth. \u201cDid he tell you when they\u2019d like to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that\u2019s a minor detail, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing how long it\u2019s taken him to get to this point, I can\u2019t help agreeing.\u201d She raised her hand to her face to brush away a stray hair and in the process smeared dirt across her cheek. Jack looked down to hide a smile.</p><p>\u201cThere must be something in the air, because I heard from my son today, as well,\u201d she said casually. \u201cJames and Selina are coming for a visit next month.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. I look forward to meeting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hardly wait to hold Isadora. Do you realize she\u2019s going to be a year old this month? I swear I don\u2019t know where the past year went. She barely knows me and Stan.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of her ex, Jack tensed. \u201cI suppose Stan will want to see James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d She straightened, hands on her hips, and glared at him in a way that made him want to squirm. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re having another jealous fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, me?\u201d he asked, but the fact was that he didn\u2019t like the idea of Stan being anywhere near Olivia. He could read her ex-husband more easily than a first-grade primer, and he didn\u2019t like what he saw. Stan Lockhart might be married to another woman, but he definitely had interests outside the house. Stan didn\u2019t like Jack hanging around Olivia, either. Naturally she didn\u2019t see it. Although he\u2019d never asked, Jack had the feeling Stan had done everything he could to discourage the relationship.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d he asked, deciding to avoid the one subject that remained a sore spot.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking of making an Oriental chicken salad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one with the grapes and Chinese noodles I liked the last time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re easy to please,\u201d she told him, smiling.</p><p>How true that was. After years of scrounging on his own and eating far too many fast-food meals, Olivia\u2019s cooking was a treat. Still, much as he enjoyed the food, it was Olivia he came to see, Olivia he longed to be with and Olivia he loved. He hadn\u2019t actually told her how he felt. For a man who worked with words, Jack knew he was strangely inadequate at expressing his emotions. When it was a matter of political argument or moral persuasion, he could express his thoughts clearly and directly. But feelings...</p><p>\u201cYou look preoccupied,\u201d Olivia murmured pulling off her gardening gloves.</p><p>He shrugged as he followed her up the steps to the back porch, where she kept her gardening supplies, and then into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAnything special on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said and realized he\u2019d spoken too quickly.</p> <p>Olivia studied him a moment as she washed her hands. When she\u2019d dried them, she opened the refrigerator and took out a large head of lettuce.</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do?\u201d Jack asked, feeling like an unneeded accessory. He wanted to tell her how he felt, but he was afraid that making an announcement would be embarrassing or inappropriate; so he let it drop.</p><p>\u201cNothing just now, thanks,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He walked into the living room, but for the life of him couldn\u2019t stand still. He started pacing, his mind churning and his hands itching to do something, hold something. The need for a drink clawed at him. It happened like that occasionally, although such times were rare after almost eleven years\u2019 sobriety. He needed a meeting and he needed to talk to his sponsor.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he said, sounding more anxious than he meant to. \u201cI can\u2019t stay after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d She stood in the doorway that led from the kitchen to the formal living room, looking perplexed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to be somewhere else\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I forgot. Well actually, it isn\u2019t that I forgot, it\u2019s just that I need a meeting. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA meeting? Oh, you mean AA.\u201d She stepped into the living room. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think so. I apologize, but the meetings help me clear my head and get rid of \u2018stinkin\u2019 thinkin\u2019.\u201d\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having negative thoughts now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m thinking how good a cold beer would taste. That\u2019s \u2018stinkin\u2019 thinkin\u201d and a meeting is the best place for me to be. There\u2019s one downtown I sometimes attend. It starts in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go,\u201d she urged.</p><p>He was already halfway to the door. \u201cThanks for understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>He heard her call him and stopped, his hand on the knob.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll phone later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Despite Maryellen\u2019s determination to keep Jon out of her life, she was curious about him. It was an unhealthy curiosity, but one that persisted. She supposed this was due mainly to his talent. Thankfully, she hadn\u2019t run into him since that unfortunate incident right before Christmas. Nor had she heard anything from him since, and she was grateful, but she also felt disappointed, which confused her completely.</p><p>The BernardGallery, located in Pioneer Square</p><p>in downtown Seattle, sold his work now. She was sure he\u2019d do well, and he deserved a wider audience, but the truth was, she missed his infrequent visits. She missed talking shop with him, but most of all she missed seeing his photographs. His talent was no small thing. When a notice came about a showing of his work in Seattle, Maryellen decided to attend the launch. She had no fear that Jon would be there. Experience had taught her that he avoided these events; he claimed the pretentiousness was not only unbearable but brought out the worst in him. He\u2019d told Maryellen that comments about his \u201cdeconstruction of natural phenomena\u201d or his \u201cgrasp of non-being\u201d made him want to leap up and down making ape-like sounds.</p><p>The Sunday afternoon of the show was Mother\u2019s Day and it seemed fitting that Maryellen should allow herself this one indulgence. She spent the morning with her own mother and treated Grace to brunch at D.D.\u2019s on the Cove. In a rare moment of sentimentality, Maryellen told her that she hoped to be as good a mother to her baby as Grace had been to her. Then, before heading to the ferry terminal, Maryellen dropped off a gift for Kelly.</p><p>When she arrived at the BernardGallery, the show was in full swing. Wearing a loose-fitting black dress with black hose and a string of white pearls she looked, in her own estimation, rather elegant. Before long, she held a wineglass filled with apple juice and made her way over to the display of Jon\u2019s work.</p><p>She found Mr. Bernard himself standing in front of Jon\u2019s photographs. He spoke to a middle-aged couple apparently enthralled with one of Jon\u2019s pictures.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bowman is something of a recluse,\u201d the gallery owner was saying. \u201cI did try to persuade him to attend today\u2019s function, but unfortunately he refused.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen smiled to herself; she\u2019d guessed right. If there\u2019d been any chance of Jon\u2019s attending, she wouldn\u2019t have risked it. She could not allow him to learn about her pregnancy.</p><p>The BernardGallery had displayed his photographs by suspending them from the ceiling. The pictures were beautifully framed and matted, each one signed and numbered.</p><p>Moving from one piece to the next, she paused to admire his photographs of nature. A field of blue wildflowers blooming against the backdrop of Mt.Rainier was so intensely vivid that her breath caught in her throat. Several scenes of the snowcapped Olympics behind the pristine waters of Puget Sound revealed the thrusting strength of the mountains.</p><p>The next series of photographs showed a new side of Jon. These pictures, in black and white, were all taken in and around the marina. In one of them, an early-morning fog obliterated the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on the other side of the Cove. Sailboats, with thinly veiled masts, rose toward an unseen sky. It was lovely and serene and mysterious.</p><p>The second photo she looked at was completely unlike anything she\u2019d seen from Jon before. A notice taped to the corner stated this photograph was not for sale. Maryellen stopped and stared at the picture of a woman at the end of the pier, overlooking the Cove. The snowy peaks of the Olympics could be discerned in the far distance. The day was sunny and her back was to the camera. She stood on tiptoe, leaning over the railing, tossing popcorn into the air for seagulls to catch. They swarmed toward her, their wings flapping.</p><p>So Jon was taking photographs of people now. For one unchecked second, she wondered about the woman who\u2019d captured his attention so completely and felt an unexpected and unwelcome surge of jealousy.</p><p>Wonder at his skill quickly overcame her ambivalent feelings as she studied the photograph. It wasn\u2019t necessary to see the woman\u2019s face to experience the simple joy she found in feeding the birds. Maryellen had thrown popcorn to the seagulls herself and knew how exhilarating it could be. She\u2019d stood at the end of that very pier and\u2014</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>That wasn\u2019t just any woman\u2014that was her. Jon had taken a picture of her on the pier. Hurrying on to the next picture, she realized, much to her relief, that there was only one photograph in which she was the subject.</p><p>Instead of feeling uplifted, Maryellen found that her spirits were low as she boarded the ferry for the fifty-minute sailing into Bremerton. That single photograph told her more than she wanted to know. He\u2019d seen her at the pier without her being aware of him. When? It\u2019d obviously been after their meeting at Christmas\u2014probably during March, judging by the coat she was wearing. She\u2019d gone to feed the seagulls during her lunch hour a few times, and he\u2019d obviously caught sight of her. The fact that he\u2019d taken this picture\u2014his one and only photograph of a person\u2014suggested he\u2019d had genuine feelings for her. Maybe still did. And yet, she couldn\u2019t allow herself to respond to those feelings, nor could she act on her own deep attraction to him. She just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead of driving directly home, Maryellen surprised herself and drove to her mother\u2019s, instead. Grace was in the kitchen, doing her weekly cooking. She\u2019d recently gotten into the habit of preparing, freezing and storing everything she\u2019d need for the next six days\u2014until the following Sunday, when she\u2019d start the whole cycle again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying a few new recipes,\u201d she told Maryellen, busily arranging vegetables, cans and other ingredients on the counter. \u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019m still full from brunch.\u201d Her appetite was gone, but it had more to do with her churning thoughts than an empty stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think anything\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day, and I\u2019d like to spend some extra time with my mother. That doesn\u2019t mean anything\u2019s wrong, does it?\u201d</p> <p>Grace tore a strip of aluminum foil from the box and covered a small casserole dish she\u2019d just withdrawn from the oven. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my saying so, you sound defensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should just go home.\u201d Perhaps this wasn\u2019t such a good idea, after all. Her mother could read her far too well.</p><p>\u201cDid you see him?\u201d Grace shocked her by asking.</p><p>Maryellen didn\u2019t bother to ask who she meant. That was obvious. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo.\u201d For emphasis, she shook her head.</p><p>Setting the teakettle on the burner, Grace heated water. It seemed that every time they had something important to discuss, her mother made tea. It signaled that her mother considered whatever was to follow significant, something that required her daughter\u2019s close attention.</p> <p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down and don\u2019t argue with me,\u201d her mother said briskly. She pulled out the kitchen chair and gave Maryellen a slight shove in its direction.</p><p>All too soon, the tea was steeping, and the pot rested in the center of the table. \u201cYou already know I was pregnant with you when your father and I got married.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen knew this and wasn\u2019t interested in learning whether her parents would have married had her mother not been pregnant.</p><p>\u201cGetting married was the thing to do in those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimes have changed,\u201d Maryellen felt obliged to remind her. Statistics said that a third of all children were now born outside wedlock. Other women had raised their children alone and so would she.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s an artist, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d The questions exasperated her. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you I\u2019m not answering any questions to do with the baby\u2019s father, so please don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d Grace tapped the table, as though angry with herself for meddling. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do that.... Actually, I\u2019d planned to talk about your father and me. We spent more than thirty-five years together and...well, I don\u2019t know if I was the best wife for him. I think he might\u2019ve been happier with another woman. For all we know, that could be the reason he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Maryellen said, grateful for the chance to speak honestly about her father. She couldn\u2019t do that with Kelly, who viewed him as virtually a saint, without fault. Kelly refused to recognize the truth about their father; for some reason, she was incapable of seeing him in any other way. \u201cYou know, I can hardly remember a time when Dad was happy. He went into those dark moods, and both Kelly and I knew to avoid him.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed to get so self-involved.\u201d Maryellen\u2019s memories of her father weren\u2019t all bad, but in the months since his disappearance, those were the ones that drifted to the surface. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Grace said, looking flustered. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say, and doing a poor job of, is this.\u201d She released a deep breath. \u201cWhen it comes to the father of your baby, my advice is to follow your instincts. Don\u2019t do what everyone else thinks is best, do what your own heart tells you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, Mom, I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen that\u2019s all I can ask.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen smiled and leaned over to clasp her mother\u2019s hand. \u201cThanks, Mom\u2014I needed to hear that. Now, how about some of that pasta casserole over there? I suddenly feel hungry.\u201d</p><p>Almost a week later, on Friday afternoon, Grace was still thinking about her conversation with Maryellen. She prayed she\u2019d said the right things. If Maryellen had decided to keep the father out of her life, there had to be a reason. At times she sensed an uncertainty in her daughter\u2014as if she doubted her own decision\u2014but if so, Maryellen didn\u2019t discuss it with her. After the baby was born, Maryellen might well have a change of heart.</p><p>Her assistant, Loretta Bailey, got to the library early so Grace could leave for what she\u2019d vaguely termed an \u201cappointment.\u201d As soon as Loretta showed up, Grace grabbed her sweater, eager to depart before she was barraged with unnecessary questions.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Loretta,\u201d she called back as she headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, no problem. Are you seeing that nice man friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>She must have something taped to her forehead, Grace thought with a sigh, because Maryellen had asked her the same thing earlier, when they\u2019d met for lunch.</p><p>\u201cCliff asked me to drive him to the airport.\u201d After everything he\u2019d done for her over the past months, it was a small thing to request. \u201cHe\u2019s taking some of the memorabilia from his grandfather\u2019s estate to a museum in Arizona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, his grandfather was a famous Hollywood cowboy, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Yodeling Cowboy, Tom Houston himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too young to remember his television show, but I certainly remember hearing about the Yodeling Cowboy,\u201d Loretta said. \u201cMy brothers used to try yodeling, and all it did was frighten the neighborhood cats.\u201d</p><p>Grace laughed and went out to the parking lot reserved for library employees.</p><p>By the time she arrived at Cliff\u2019s place, he was packed and ready. The neighbors would be taking care of his horses and Cliff returned the favor for them when they were away.</p><p>She was a few minutes early, so Grace walked out to the paddock where several of his quarter horses grazed. As she stood by the fence, a lovely tan-colored mare trotted toward her. \u201cHello, Brownie,\u201d she said, stroking the mare\u2019s long sleek neck.</p><p>\u201cYou could have her eating out of your hand if you wanted,\u201d Cliff said from behind Grace. \u201cJust the same as you have me.\u201d</p><p>He said things like that just to make her blush; Grace was convinced of it. \u201cReady to go?\u201d she asked, turning away from Brownie. It was easier to ignore the comment than respond to it.</p><p>\u201cAnytime you are.\u201d</p><p>He loaded his suitcase into the back of her car, then got in on the passenger side. Grace pulled out of the yard, a trail of dust behind her. Two geldings raced along the fence line with her, and she admired their speed and beauty. Grace understood why Cliff chose to live this far outside town. She felt a serenity whenever she visited his small ranch. She suddenly realized that after all the years she\u2019d spent living in town, she wouldn\u2019t mind life in the country. She\u2019d never expected to even consider such a thing.</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing this,\u201d Cliff said as she turned onto the road.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do. You\u2019ve done so much for me.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Cliff said, \u201cIf you feel obligated, then I suggest you think seriously about our relationship\u2014about where we could go.\u201d</p><p>He said it in a joking way and she replied in a similar fashion. \u201cWhere we\u2019re going is the airport. Now, would you cut it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. Would you like it if I did?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and kept her gaze focused on the road ahead. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>Cliff chuckled. \u201cHow\u2019s Maryellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWearing maternity clothes now. I wouldn\u2019t have wished this on her, but I\u2019m amazed by how happy she is. She\u2019s very excited about the baby.\u201d She paused, then thinking aloud, said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the father is one of the artists she knows.\u201d Initially she hadn\u2019t intended to, but Grace told him about the conversation she\u2019d had with Maryellen on Sunday.</p><p>Cliff listened intently. \u201cI admire the way you can be open and honest with your daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t with Lisa?\u201d</p><p>Cliff didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cNot really. We avoid the subject of her mother. It\u2019s as if Susan\u2019s a phantom woman. I think Lisa\u2019s afraid of saying something that\u2019ll hurt me, although I doubt my ex-wife has that power anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Although Grace didn\u2019t want to pry, she was curious about his marriage. He\u2019d made occasional remarks, but nothing that gave her a real picture of what his life had been like before the divorce. In a way, information about the marriages\u2014and divorces\u2014of others helped put her own marriage in perspective.</p><p>\u201cI think one of the reasons you attracted me is because of Susan.\u201d</p><p>This instantly alarmed Grace. \u201cYou mean I resemble her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. You couldn\u2019t be more different. Physically, for instance. She\u2019s tall and thin, whereas you\u2019re short and...pleasingly round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d Grace muttered under her breath. He hadn\u2019t intended to be insulting, but then a man didn\u2019t understand the effort it took to keep her weight down to \u201cpleasingly round.\u201d Glancing over, she found him studying her with an amused look. \u201cIt\u2019s my thighs, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cToo bad you\u2019re driving, otherwise I\u2019d find an excuse to kiss you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly will not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for lack of interest.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you know how attractive I find you?\u201d</p><p>Her hands gripped the steering wheel a bit more firmly. \u201cJust explain that comment about Susan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I meant is that you and I have a great deal in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, I know what it is to have the person you love get involved with someone else. It\u2019s an emotionally damaging experience\u2014as if every inadequacy, every doubt, I\u2019d ever had about myself was true. If Susan had an affair, it was because there was something lacking in me.\u201d</p><p>She merged with the traffic, heading over the NarrowsBridge. She lowered her speed as she drove onto the mile-long expansion bridge. \u201cYou mean a man thinks like that, too?\u201d she asked, surprised by the revelation.</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014but then we do what we can to compensate in other areas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cFor me, I got involved with horses. I ignored what was going on behind my back, because that was the only way I could deal with it. A man isn\u2019t supposed to feel pain, you know?\u201d he added wryly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I learned that pain comes out one way or another. I think if Susan and I had gone on as we were, it would\u2019ve eventually killed me. She was braver than I was and decided to end our marriage. The funny part is, I was actually grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does any of this have to do with me?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah\u2014that was the point of this conversation, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhen we met that first time\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou mean when you absconded with my credit card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve thought about the significance of that a hundred times since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish your original sentence,\u201d she said with mock sternness.</p><p>\u201cThat day I came by the library to exchange credit cards, I was strongly attracted to you. I\u2019ll admit it shook me up because I\u2019d been divorced for five years and I wasn\u2019t interested in another relationship. And then, all at once, it was like a bomb went off and I saw the future in a totally new way.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t hurt Grace\u2019s ego any to hear this, although his interest had unsettled her in the beginning. She found herself growing more and more comfortable with it, however. For a long time she\u2019d needed answers regarding Dan, but as the months passed, a resolution seemed increasingly unlikely and she was growing accustomed to that reality.</p><p>\u201cI realize now what attracted me. Or, at least, part of it.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cYou believe Dan\u2019s with another woman.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, swallowing down the hurt the words still evoked.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dealt with the emotions felt by someone who\u2019s been betrayed in his or her marriage\u2014what I felt about Susan\u2019s affair.\u201d</p><p>He could be right. In her heart of hearts, Grace was indeed convinced that Dan was with someone else. A woman he\u2019d loved so much that he was willing to walk away from his entire life. So many things about his disappearance didn\u2019t add up, and she had no other answers.</p><p>Grace exited the freeway in Tacoma and took the back road into the airport. The route Dan had taught her.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell you my theory about the mix-up with our credit cards?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed out loud. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to my way of thinking, it was fate. Destiny. Call it what you will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe waitress at the PancakePalace wasn\u2019t responsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was merely the instrument of fate.\u201d</p><p>Grace was both amused and intrigued by his theory. \u201cSo, we were destined to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d He sounded convinced of it. \u201cI\u2019ve come to think of our meeting as a gift. A sort of compensation for all the pain that came with the divorce.\u201d</p><p>Grace felt her throat constrict. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet, Cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. Someday, when you\u2019re ready, I hope we can be more than sweethearts.\u201d</p><p>What an old-fashioned and rather endearing term, Grace mused. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He grew quiet and looked out the window as they neared the terminal. \u201cI know it\u2019s important that you find Dan. Or at least find out what happened to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like closure, but I might never have it. I accept that now. I have to get on with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that?\u201d The expression in his eyes revealed a vulnerability that touched her deeply. \u201cBecause if you do, then I want you to consider us being together, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about\u2014\u201d She swallowed tightly and pulled to the curb to let Cliff out. \u201cAre you talking about us getting...serious?\u201d</p><p>His hand was on the door handle. \u201cYes,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Without another word he opened the car door; she stopped him by placing her hand on his arm. \u201cHave a safe flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Still, her hand lingered. She leaned toward him and he moved closer for a kiss that lasted long enough for the car behind them to honk impatiently. Cliff glanced quickly over his shoulder, then turned back to her. \u201cIs that your answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, but she smiled warmly. \u201cI\u2019ll think on it while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that,\u201d he said, his eyes smiling into hers.</p><p>Olivia was too excited to sit still. Stan was due any minute and with him would be James, Selina and their granddaughter, Isadora Delores Lockhart.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Charlotte asked. Her mother was as excited about this visit as she was. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you agreed to let Stan pick them up from the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it made sense. Stan lives in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but it seems to be taking him forever,\u201d she murmured fretfully.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d Justine cried from her perch near the front window. Stan opened the screen door, and both Olivia and Charlotte flew out to the porch. Olivia ran down the steps, her arms open to hug her son the instant he climbed out of the car. Within minutes, Olivia held a sleepy Isadora in her arms. The baby pressed her head against Olivia\u2019s shoulder, and her heart melted with love for this first grandchild.</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d James said, hugging Charlotte. \u201cYou look terrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not dead yet,\u201d Charlotte assured him and stepped forward, waiting for an introduction to Selina. \u201cGuess my number didn\u2019t come up.\u201d</p><p>James slid his arm around his wife\u2019s waist and introduced her. Selina\u2019s dark eyes gleamed with happiness as she hugged Charlotte and then each family member in turn.</p><p>Seth and Justine appeared as the excited greetings wound down.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, big sister,\u201d James said, patting Justine\u2019s stomach. \u201cAlmost a mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got months to go,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cOh, then you\u2019re just fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful what you say,\u201d Seth advised under his breath. The two men exchanged a brief hug.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the family,\u201d James said to Seth.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>By the time Olivia shepherded everyone into the house, she felt weak with joy. It was so rare to have the entire family together. \u201cWhere\u2019s Marge?\u201d she asked her ex-husband. When they\u2019d made plans for this reunion, Olivia had included his second wife.</p><p>\u201cMarge couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d Stan said, sounding genuinely regretful. \u201cShe sends her apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell her she\u2019s welcome anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Stan promised. Olivia noticed, however, that he hadn\u2019t asked about Jack. She put the observation away, to be examined later.</p><p>While Olivia and Charlotte started setting the table for dinner, Stan held Isadora. The baby nestled in his embrace and almost immediately went back to sleep. Olivia smiled to find her ex-husband sitting in her rocking chair with their granddaughter in his arms, He looked so natural and relaxed. The last time she\u2019d seen him like that had been when James was an infant and the twins were five.... Olivia blinked away the nostalgic tears those memories brought. She hurried back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything,\u201d she instructed her son as Selina and Justine took over the task of getting food onto the dining-room table. \u201cIs the Navy bringing you home? I\u2019d love it if you were stationed here in Bremerton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom, but it looks like I\u2019ve got another two-year stint in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to disguise her disappointment, but Olivia tried. \u201cI\u2019m grateful Selina\u2019s family is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents love James,\u201d her daughter-in-law told her.</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t that way in the beginning,\u201d James said, patting his wife on the behind as she walked past with a large green salad.</p><p>\u201cWith good reason,\u201d Olivia chastised. \u201cYou got their daughter pregnant.\u201d Only a month before Isadora was born had Olivia learned that James and Selina were married. She was disappointed that both her children had decided to marry without either parent present. First James, and then a few months later, Justine had eloped to Reno with Seth. Still, she believed the children had chosen their mates well, which was a source of great pleasure to her and Stan. Pleasure and relief.</p><p>Soon the family gathered around the table. Olivia and Charlotte had been cooking and baking for days, making certain that James had the opportunity to enjoy all his favorite dishes. There were stuffed green peppers and Caesar salad with homemade croutons, plus seafood spaghetti. James took two helpings of each.</p><p>\u201cSave room for dessert,\u201d Charlotte warned.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, did you bake me a coconut cake?\u201d James looked like a little boy again, excited about his favorite dessert.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Charlotte assured him. \u201cJust for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the cake James talks about?\u201d Selina asked. \u201cThe one he told me takes three days to make? Would you be willing to share the recipe?\u201d The shy question was directed at Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cFirst you start with a fresh coconut.\u201d</p><p>At Selina\u2019s astonished eyes, Olivia leaned close to her daughter-in-law and whispered, \u201cThere are shortcuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t take them,\u201d Charlotte told her. \u201cNot for James, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s spoiled,\u201d his wife insisted, her eyes dancing with laughter. \u201cI can\u2019t help spoiling him, too. He\u2019s just so cute.\u201d</p><p>That remark evoked a round of good-natured teasing about how cute James was.</p><p>After dinner, they sat around the table, drinking coffee, reminiscing about the old days, laughing, sharing stories. A little while later, Selina left to put the baby to bed.</p><p>Olivia showed her up to James\u2019s old room and Stan followed with the luggage.</p><p>Starting down the stairs, Stan put his hand on her shoulder and stopped Olivia. She found him studying the pictures that lined the staircase wall. Although they\u2019d divorced many years ago, she kept their wedding photo there. Not for sentimental reasons, but because she felt it was important for their children.</p><p>Stan\u2019s gaze rested on Jordan\u2019s school photograph, taken the year he drowned. \u201cI sometimes wonder...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t finish, but it wasn\u2019t necessary; Olivia had often entertained these same thoughts herself. She wondered what their lives would\u2019ve been like if it had rained that day or if Jordan had decided to ride his bicycle instead of going to the lake with his friends.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d James called from the living room. \u201cGrandma\u2019s doing the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see her try,\u201d Stan muttered, leaping down the remaining stairs. \u201cCharlotte, sit down this instant! I\u2019m washing the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Apparently Marge had him better-trained than Olivia ever did.</p><p>Stan paused when he saw the dining-room table, piled high with plates, cups, glasses and serving bowls. \u201cI, uh, might need some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll volunteer,\u201d Seth offered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia insisted. \u201cJustine\u2019s exhausted. Take her home so she won\u2019t be too worn-out for tomorrow.\u201d The grand opening of The Lighthouse was scheduled that week, and tomorrow was an Open House for the Chamber of Commerce. After spending ten hours today preparing for the Open House, the couple needed some rest. Thankfully, Justine had left her job at the bank, and Seth no longer worked at the marina.</p><p>Olivia hugged them both, and shuffled her daughter and son-in-law toward the door. James joined the little group to say goodbye. \u201cHey, I think it\u2019s great that you two are opening a restaurant,\u201d he said, walking out with them.</p><p>Olivia hurried to the kitchen, rolling up her long silk sleeves as she went. She saw that Stan had cleared the table, while Charlotte had picked up her knitting and begun watching \u201cJeopardy,\u201d her favorite television game show. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the kitchen, Olivia discovered the sink filled with sudsy water for the pots and pans.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do this,\u201d she told Stan.</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d He stacked plates and cutlery in the dishwasher and she put the leftovers in containers, storing them in the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten how good your stuffed green peppers are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed them.\u201d</p><p>He grew quiet then. She found his somberness a little unexpected after all the happy chatter during dinner and afterward.</p><p>\u201cI guess I might as well tell you,\u201d he suddenly said, his back to her as he rinsed off dishes.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d She laughed. \u201cMarge is leaving you?\u201d She smiled at her own joke.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014sort of.\u201d The laughter had drained from his eyes. \u201cMarge and I are separating.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia couldn\u2019t hide her shock. Her silly, flippant remark had been correct. \u201cOh, Stan, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you\u2014\u201d She raised her hand. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t necessary for me to know. I just didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d He returned his attention to the dishes. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty rough year for us, and we decided last week that it would be best all the way around if we took a break from each other.\u201d</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t think of anything to say.</p><p>Reaching for a towel, Stan wiped his hands, keeping his eyes lowered. \u201cThis evening with James and Justine here, seeing both our children so happy and so much in love\u2014I don\u2019t know, something happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHappened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to explain it. We\u2019re grandparents, Olivia, and we\u2019re about to become grandparents a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSitting at the table with our children made me realize how badly I wish I could undo the past. I wish you and I were a couple again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Stan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, I shouldn\u2019t have said that, but it\u2019s true. It hit me between the eyes at dinner. You and I always belonged together. I made a terrible mistake when I left you, and I can\u2019t help regretting it.\u201d</p><p>A hundred times over the years, Olivia too had regretted the divorce. Had she been stronger, better able to deal with Jordan\u2019s death, she would have fought to keep the marriage, the family, together. But it was too late to recover something that now belonged to the past. Olivia recognized this, and in his heart, so did Stan. She was sure of it.</p><p>Seventeen</p> <p>Maryellen was impressed with The Lighthouse. Justine and Seth had done a first-class job with the renovations to The Captain\u2019s Galley. Her mother had attended the function with her and was sipping wine, talking to Olivia in a corner of the restaurant. Apparently they had a lot to talk about, because their heads had been together from the moment Grace arrived.</p><p>The hors d\u2019oeuvres on their silver platters were laid out on long tables draped in white linen. Anticipating a feast, Maryellen had eaten sparingly all day and was famished. Taking a salad-sized china plate, she stood in the buffet line and chatted with other members of the Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>The expression might be clich\u00e9d, but Justine truly looked radiant, Maryellen thought as she watched the husband-and-wife team greet their guests. She and Justine had talked about their pregnancies and learned they were due to deliver a few weeks apart. They\u2019d known each other their entire lives, but other than the fact that their mothers were best friends, they didn\u2019t have a lot in common. For one thing, Maryellen was seven years older and in childhood that was significant. Justine had been in fifth grade when Maryellen graduated from high school.</p><p>In the years since, life had taken them in opposite directions. Only now that they were both pregnant and having their babies close together had they spent any significant time together. They regularly compared notes about their pregnancies and had recently taken a day to shop for baby furniture.</p><p>Maryellen sat at one of the newly upholstered booths and made small talk with Virginia Logan, who owned the bookstore two doors down from the Harbor Street Gallery. As they discussed the town council\u2019s motion to arrange stone planters along the main streets, Justine approached.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen,\u201d she said, holding out her hand. \u201cAnd Virginia. I\u2019m so glad you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Virginia added.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Justine asked them both. \u201cAny changes you\u2019d suggest?\u201d Maryellen understood how important this venture was to the young couple. Still, Justine wanted their sincere opinions, not just flattery and compliments. That was the very reason they\u2019d decided to hold this open house.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fabulous,\u201d Virginia said, reaching for a second crab puff. She popped it into her mouth and then closed her eyes to savor it. \u201cThe food is incredible.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded agreement.</p><p>\u201cWe have our chef to thank for that. He\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find him?\u201d Virginia asked.</p><p>\u201cWord of mouth. He applied for the job, and Seth interviewed and hired him. I don\u2019t think we realized how good he really is until now. Would either of you like a tour of the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Virginia shook her head. \u201cNot me, but thanks, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d Maryellen said, more to be polite than from any desire to study the internal workings of the restaurant.</p><p>With Maryellen following, Justine wove her way around the people sipping wine and sampling the wide assortment of offerings. As they passed the buffet table, Maryellen grabbed a napkin and a pickled asparagus spear. She\u2019d never been fond of asparagus until this pregnancy. These days she couldn\u2019t get enough of it. She supposed there were worse cravings.</p><p>Justine held open the swinging door to the kitchen and they stepped aside as a waitress carried out a platter displaying an artichoke cheesecake, complete with a paper-thin phyllo crust. Maryellen had tried it earlier and marveled at the unexpected blend of flavors and textures.</p><p>The kitchen sparkled with polished steel, a bevy of pans suspended from a rack above the workspace. Two men in white with tall chef\u2019s caps were working efficiently, moving about the room in an almost synchronized fashion.</p><p>\u201cLet me introduce you to our chef,\u201d Justine said. \u201cJon, this is a good friend of mine, Maryellen Sherman. Maryellen, this is the chef I mentioned, Jon Bowman.\u201d She paused, frowning. \u201cOh, wait. You two know each other from the gallery.\u201d</p><p>If there\u2019d been time, Maryellen would have turned tail and run. Instead she was forced to put a smile on her face and hold out her hand, praying Jon wouldn\u2019t say or do anything to embarrass her.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again,\u201d Jon said but his gaze rested directly on her midsection.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen and I are both due in the same month,\u201d Justine said as if to cover for Jon\u2019s all too-obvious attention to her pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He met Maryellen\u2019s eyes now, his own narrowed.</p><p>She was tempted to grab onto the counter because her legs felt as though they were about to give out. \u201cYou\u2019re a very good chef,\u201d she murmured. \u201cUm, the hors d\u2019oeuvres are excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said grimly. Obviously he was no better at small talk than when she\u2019d known him.</p><p>\u201cOver here is Ross Porter, the pastry chef,\u201d Justine said, leading her away from Jon. \u201cWe captured him from Andr\u00e9\u2019s too,\u201d she said with a gloating smile. \u201cCome and check out our walk-in refrigerator. Who\u2019d have guessed a year ago that I could get so excited about something like that?\u201d Justine laughed.</p><p>The rest of the tour was a blur as Maryellen obediently trailed Justine around the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAbout the staff...\u201d Too late Maryellen realized it was impossible to form a coherent question.</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean the staff from the old Captain\u2019s Galley?\u201d Justine asked. \u201cWe kept a number of the waitresses and one of the hostesses. You might know her, Cecilia Randall. Her father used to work as a bartender. He moved to California shortly before we bought the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen was only slightly acquainted with the staff from The Captain\u2019s Galley, but was pleased to hear that some of them had been retained. Her head was whirling. She\u2019d be astonished if she managed to ask anything intelligible.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done a marvelous job,\u201d she said when they returned to the main part of the restaurant. That was the simple truth.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Justine said as Seth joined her. He placed his arm around his wife\u2019s waist and smiled down at her.</p><p>Maryellen was impressed with the way they\u2019d become a real couple, a partnership in every sense. Impressed and a little envious. Investing in a restaurant was a bold move, but they seemed determined to make a go of it.</p><p>As soon as she could, Maryellen made an excuse to leave. Her heart was pounding so loudly she could barely think as she drove home. She knew without his saying anything that Jon would want to talk to her, and soon. She wanted to reassure him that she wasn\u2019t going to ask for any kind of monetary support. He obviously had no interest in the baby, and as far as she was concerned, Jon Bowman was free and clear on all counts. Once he understood that, she was sure he\u2019d rest easier.</p><p>Maryellen hadn\u2019t been home an hour when her doorbell rang. Already? It looked as though their confrontation would occur that very evening. She certainly wasn\u2019t expecting anyone else.</p><p>He stood like an avenging angel in the doorway of her small rental home, his face dark, staring down on her when she opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, thought you might want to talk,\u201d she said, letting him in.</p><p>He strode into the hallway. \u201cYou said there weren\u2019t any consequences from our night together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d Her honesty seemed to unnerve him further.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was obvious that you were worried I might be pregnant. You wanted an easy out and I gave it to you, so you have no reason to be angry now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She gestured for him to sit down. \u201cYelling isn\u2019t going to help. I\u2019m sorry this came as such a shock, I really am, but there\u2019s no need to be upset.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her suggestion to take a seat. \u201cNo need to be upset?\u201d he bellowed. \u201cThe hell there isn\u2019t. You\u2019re pregnant\u2014I\u2019m going to be a father.\u201d His scowl challenged her to deny it.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d Her voice trailed off. She had no intention of pretending he wasn\u2019t the father of her child.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d He started to pace.</p><p>\u201cWould you kindly stand still?\u201d Even if he wasn\u2019t going to sit down, she had a sudden need to do so. Sinking onto the sofa, she placed her hands over her stomach. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what? Please leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...It\u2019s probably best that you know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably?\u201d The word exploded out of his mouth.</p><p>Maryellen held up her hand. \u201cListen\u2014you\u2019re upset and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUpset?\u201d he repeated. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even begin to cover what I\u2019m feeling.

It doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat matters is my baby,\u201d Jon insisted.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop pacing? You\u2019re making me dizzy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, because if I stop I might do something I regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a threat, Jon?\u201d She hadn\u2019t thought of him as violent, but she\u2019d never seen him this out of control.</p><p>\u201cA threat?\u201d He stared at her as though he\u2019d taken as many shocks from her as he could stand. \u201cNo, Maryellen, that isn\u2019t a threat.\u201d Then, as if he\u2019d exhausted every ounce of energy he possessed, he collapsed into a chair.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for this. I guess you have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I do.\u201d</p> <p>She was prepared to deal with his anger. It was what she\u2019d expected and frankly what she deserved. If he\u2019d give her a moment, she\u2019d reassure him, tell him she didn\u2019t need his support, and then they could both continue with their lives.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about anything,\u201d Maryellen told him. \u201cThis is my baby.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYour baby? Yeah\u2014and mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon, I don\u2019t require a thing from you. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re not part of this child\u2019s life. I intend to raise the baby on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she cried. She thought this was what he\u2019d come to hear. She was relieving him of all obligations.</p> <p>\u201cI want to be part of my child\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is.\u201d He was back on his feet, fists clenched.</p><p>Maryellen got to her feet, too. \u201cI think you should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d he said and stormed out the door, leaving Maryellen shaken and unsure.</p><p>Why, oh, why did everything have to be so complicated? It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like this. Yes, learning about the pregnancy must have been distressing to Jon, but once he knew, she assumed he\u2019d feel grateful to be released from any responsibility.</p><p>Instead he was making demands\u2014demands she wasn\u2019t prepared to consider.</p><p>This had to be one of the proudest moments of Jack Griffin\u2019s life. He stood with his son and Shelly at ColchesterPark, which overlooked Puget Sound. The panoramic view of the Seattle skyline was breathing. The promise of summer was in the air; tulips lined the flowerbeds and fifty-foot-tall fir trees stood like sentries, keeping watch over all who entered the park.</p> <p>Standing close to the water with her back to Puget Sound, Olivia faced the young couple, while Jack held Tedd and Todd in his arms, as proud as any grandfather had a right to be. Fortunately, the babies were fast asleep. At three months, they\u2019d both filled out nicely and although they were identical, Jack could detect differences between them. Tedd was more active than his brother and always fell asleep last. Todd seemed content with his thumb, while Tedd preferred his pacifier. Both boys strongly reminded him of Eric as an infant, and Jack saw his son over and over again in his two grandchildren.</p><p>Jack\u2019s ex-wife hadn\u2019t been able to make the wedding. He assumed Vicki had stayed away to avoid seeing him. Bob Beldon, his AA sponsor, suggested Jack held too high an opinion of his importance to Vicki, but Jack was fairly confident he\u2019d read his ex correctly. They hadn\u2019t parted on the best of terms, and what little relationship they\u2019d had at the time of the divorce quickly disintegrated when he continued drinking. Alcohol had consumed his life for the next several years.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he forced himself to concentrate on the marriage vows as Eric repeated them. Love and honor. Jack\u2019s heart swelled with love for his son, his grandsons, his daughter-in-law\u2014and for Judge Olivia Lockhart. Getting to know her, spending time with her, had changed his life and all for the better.</p><p>Shelly repeated her vows and then Eric\u2019s best man, a friend from work named Bill Jamison, handed him the diamond ring, which Eric slipped on Shelly\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI now pronounce you husband and wife,\u201d Olivia said and her voice echoed through the park.</p><p>In the next moment Eric and Shelly were kissing while Olivia and the friends who\u2019d stood up with them looked on, applauding. Several people, including Shelly\u2019s maid of honor, Karen Morrison, took photographs.</p><p>With his arm around Shelly, Eric turned to Jack. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you wondered if you\u2019d ever see this day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you and Shelly married, or holding my grandchildren in my arms?\u201d It seemed to Jack he was about as blessed as any man could be, despite his faults and his past.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d his son answered. Eric took Tedd out of Jack\u2019s arms and Shelly reached for Todd. Soon both infants were strapped into their carriers, and everyone was ready to depart.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Olivia,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you so much.\u201d Shelly impulsively hugged her and then added, \u201cFor everything. You too, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better head for the airport if you\u2019re going to make your flight,\u201d Bill said. He was the most responsible of the group, Jack noted, the one who kept them all on schedule.</p><p>\u201cI hate to get married and rush away like this,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>Jack and Olivia walked them to the parking lot. \u201cGo,\u201d Jack told his son and they hugged one last time. \u201cBut call me tomorrow, you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, I promise.\u201d Eric strapped the two boys into the back seat of his friend\u2019s car.</p><p>Before Jack could think of a reason to detain them, the young people were off, and he was left alone with Olivia. His gaze followed Bill\u2019s car as it pulled out of the ColchesterPark lot.</p><p>\u201cI hope they\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he murmured, more to himself than Olivia.</p><p>\u201cThey will be,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Jack brought her close, placing his arm around her shoulders. These last two weeks hadn\u2019t been good ones for them. James had come home for a visit and Olivia\u2019s time\u2014rightly so\u2014had been taken up with her son and his family. That was fine and good, but Jack thought her ex-husband was at her house far too often. Still, he couldn\u2019t really blame Stan for that, even if he didn\u2019t like it. James was his son, too.</p><p>\u201cSeeing Eric and Shelly with the twins brings back a lot of memories,\u201d she told him with a wistful look.</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t once considered that this might be difficult for Olivia. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered in a stricken voice. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, there\u2019s nothing to apologize for. I see twins all the time\u2014right now, it\u2019s just, oh, I don\u2019t know...difficult, I guess. Having James home, and then seeing so much of Stan these last two weeks. Watching you hold the babies reminded me.\u201d She wrapped her arm around his waist, and Jack took reassurance from her closeness.</p><p>Arms still around each other, they walked back toward the waterfront. Jack wasn\u2019t ready to leave. The day was glorious and his heart was full. His son\u2019s life was on the right path now. He valued the months they\u2019d had together, despite the irritations, which in retrospect seemed very minor.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t talked to you in ages,\u201d Olivia complained.</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d Jack enjoyed teasing her. With the mood between them so good, now might be the time to declare his feelings, but again he hesitated. He\u2019d put it off for so long that whenever he thought about it, he experienced a feeling of panic.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I loved having James and everyone at the house,\u201d she was saying, \u201cI\u2019m grateful to have my own life back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful to have you back,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound selfish, but I missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d She turned her head and her lips grazed his cheek.</p><p>Jack\u2019s heart accelerated. \u201cYou mean that?\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed, the sound light and sweet. \u201cOf course.\u201d They continued to stroll arm in arm, oblivious to others around them. He loved having Olivia all to himself, and despite what he\u2019d said, he didn\u2019t feel the least bit selfish.</p><p>\u201cStan\u2019s confided something in me,\u201d she suddenly told him.</p><p>Jack frowned; the last person he wanted to discuss was her ex-husband. \u201cOh?\u201d he said, doing his best to appear interested.</p><p>\u201cApparently he and Marge are having problems.\u201d</p><p>Jack could understand that. The man was cagy. Okay, so Jack was prejudiced but he disliked Stan Lockhart, and with good reason. \u201cHe\u2019s not getting a divorce, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Alarm bells rang in Jack\u2019s head. Bob had suggested Jack was making more of this ex-husband situation than warranted. His gut told him otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about him,\u201d Olivia went on to say.</p><p>\u201cWorried about Stan?\u201d Jack made that sound like a waste of time. \u201cHe\u2019s a big boy\u2014he can take care of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know he can, but this has really thrown him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarital problems are never easy.\u201d Jack strove to seem wise and mature, generous too, in his assessment of the other man\u2019s troubles. He didn\u2019t wish Stan ill, but he wanted one thing made clear: Olivia was off-limits.</p><p>\u201cPoor Stan,\u201d she murmured, shaking her head.</p><p>Jack turned her into his arms. \u201cIf you want to feel sympathy for anyone, let it be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need my sympathy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI twisted my ankle this morning and the pain is so bad.\u201d He started to walk with an exaggerated limp.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d She broke away and slugged his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a fake if ever I saw one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d He rubbed his upper arm. \u201cThat hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019s what you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you give Stan sympathy, then you have to give me some, too.\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m serious. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Stan wanted you to help him through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, you\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d The playfulness left him and he shoved his hands deep inside his pockets. \u201cWhat would you say if I confessed that I\u2019ve fallen in love with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t answer for a long while. Jack stopped walking and turned to study her. She looked at him steadily. \u201cI\u2019d say you sound like an insecure little boy and that you\u2019re trying to score points in some imaginary contest with my ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>Jack clenched his jaw. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Then, because he didn\u2019t feel it would do any good to continue this conversation, he asked, \u201cAre you ready to leave now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said. In fact, he was more than ready.</p><p>Grace dug the pitchfork into the soft earth and turned the sod. She hadn\u2019t planted a garden in years. Where she\u2019d once tended zucchini and tomatoes had long since been transformed into lawn. Cliff had offered to rototill the patch, and now she was digging up the turf so he could prepare the soil. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Buttercup, who was busily chasing butterflies behind her, barked when Troy Davis\u2019s patrol car turned into the driveway. Grace stood, removing her garden gloves before she walked over to the gate to greet him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Troy,\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d He touched the rim of his patrol cap. \u201cYou got a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Come inside.\u201d Her stomach churned with anticipation. She wanted to ask if this visit had anything to do with Dan, but she\u2019d already been through that earlier in the year. \u201cDo you have another body you want me to look at?\u201d she said, trying to make light of the incident.</p> <p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Troy shook his head and took a seat in the living room. \u201cSit down, Grace.\u201d</p><p>The seriousness of his tone told her something was terribly wrong. She sat nervously on the edge of the sofa cushion. \u201cIs it Dan?\u201d</p><p>Troy nodded. \u201cWe got a report from a couple of hikers about a trailer up high in the woods.</p> <p>\u201cDan\u2019s trailer? Is he there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan\u2019s body is. He committed suicide.\u201d</p><p>Grace gasped and her breath froze in her lungs. For a long moment she couldn\u2019t breathe. She should\u2019ve been prepared for news such as this, but nothing could have diminished the shock of learning that her husband was dead.</p><p>\u201cHe left a letter addressed to you.\u201d Troy reached inside his shirt pocket and brought out an envelope, which he handed to her.</p><p>\u201cSuicide\u2014but when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest we can figure, he\u2019s been dead more than a year. He shot himself last April.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not possible!\u201d she argued. \u201cJohn Malcom spotted him in May, don\u2019t you remember? So it can\u2019t be Dan\u2019s body. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d She was desperate to prove the body was that of someone else. This had to be an elaborate hoax. It simply wasn\u2019t possible that the dead man could be her husband.</p><p>\u201cGrace, the letter is dated....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be April,\u201d she continued to argue. \u201cHe was back in the house last spring\u2014I knew it the moment I came home from work. I sensed it. Don\u2019t you remember me telling you how the house smelled of evergreen? When Dan worked in the woods, he always smelled like a Christmas tree...I recognized the scent. He was in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably was back. Before April thirtieth...I\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no doubt. It\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking now, so badly that she didn\u2019t trust herself to stand.</p><p>\u201cIs there someone you want me to call?\u201d</p><p>Grace stared up at him, unable to respond.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p> <p>Grace nodded, then covered her face with her hands as she struggled to hold back the tears. All these months she\u2019d assumed Dan had run off with another woman. How could John Malcom have been mistaken? He worked with Dan; surely he\u2019d recognize him.</p><p>Troy went into the kitchen and used the phone there. He was gone several minutes and when he returned he pushed the ottoman over and sat down in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grace. Real sorry.\u201d</p><p>She had withdrawn and barely heard him. She saw his lips move but no words registered.</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2019s on her way.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although she didn\u2019t understand what he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call the girls?\u201d</p><p>She just stared at him.</p><p>Troy patted her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about any of that yet. I\u2019ll talk to Olivia and see what she thinks is best, all right?\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded, without knowing what she\u2019d agreed to.</p><p>Buttercup wanted inside the house, and Troy stood and opened the door for the golden retriever. The dog ran immediately to Grace and nudged her hands. Grace wrapped her arms around Buttercup\u2019s neck.</p><p>While Troy went outside to meet Olivia, Grace picked up the letter. Where she found the courage to open it, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>April 30th</p><p>My dearest Grace,</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. Sorrier than you\u2019ll ever know. If there\u2019d been a way to spare you the horror of this, I would have done it. I swear I would\u2019ve done anything. I did try, but there\u2019s no escape from the hell my life has become. I can\u2019t carry the burden of my guilt another day. I tried to forget, tried to put the war behind me, but the memories have pressed in on all sides and there\u2019s no longer any hope of escape.</p><p>Years ago while I was on patrol in Nam, we took enemy fire. In the aftermath, a few of us got separated from the unit. Desperate to find our way back to base, we stumbled into a small village. What happened afterward has haunted me all these years. A young woman and her baby stepped out of the shadows. Her infant daughter was clutched in her arms but I thought she was hiding a grenade. Only there wasn\u2019t a weapon. All she had was her child. Instinct took over and I fired. I murdered a mother and her baby in my desperation to survive the war\u2014my desperation to get home alive. I watched her fall, watched the horror come over her face and heard the screams of her family. Then there was more gunfire and more mothers and children and the shooting just never seemed to stop. Almost forty years now, and it\u2019s never gone away. I hear their screams in the night. I hear those screams in my sleep, cursing me, hating me. The irony is that they could never hate me more than I hate myself</p><p>There\u2019s no forgiveness for me, Grace. Nothing can absolve me from my sins. Not you, not our daughters and sure as hell not God.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s better for everyone involved if it ends here and now. I didn\u2019t write Maryellen and Kelly. I couldn\u2019t. I was never the husband you deserved and I wasn\u2019t any kind of father. I love you. I always have.</p><p>Dan</p><p>Grace read the letter a second time, letting her eyes rest on each word, one by one, as she tried to assimilate what he was saying. By the time she\u2019d finished, the knot in her throat made it impossible to speak and tears slid down her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dan,\u201d she told Olivia who knelt in front of her. Then, her cries surging from deep inside her, she started to wail. Huge sobs racked her shoulders, sobs that shook the very core of her being.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted answers, sought resolution, but not this. Never this. Dan\u2019s death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound wasn\u2019t even close to what she\u2019d expected. He\u2019d been alone, trapped in a private hell. He\u2019d been caught in a time warp, tangled in guilt and shame created by a war he\u2019d never wanted to fight.</p><p>The tears flowed until there were none left inside her. \u201cThe girls...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy\u2019s gone to get them for you,\u201d Olivia told her. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he was with another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Olivia stroked her hair as Grace leaned into her friend\u2019s comforting arms.</p><p>\u201cAll this time he\u2019s been dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost from the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left that one night and then he came back, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently he changed his mind.\u201d</p><p>Grace sobbed. \u201cHe came back because he couldn\u2019t make himself do it.\u201d She recalled how angry he\u2019d been, how Dan had lashed out at her and claimed he\u2019d been in hell for the last thirty-five years. She\u2019d assumed he was talking about their marriage when all along it had been the war.</p><p>So many things began to fall into place.</p><p>\u201cTroy found his wallet and his wedding ring in the trailer.\u201d</p><p>Grace lifted her head. \u201cHe left his wedding band at home.\u201d She\u2019d found it the night she\u2019d thrown all his clothes out of the house. Finding the ring was what had triggered her tantrum. She\u2019d believed at the time that he\u2019d wanted her to discover it. She\u2019d believed Dan had wanted to flaunt his new love. How wrong she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cThat was the ring he charged on the VISA card,\u201d Grace whispered.</p><p>When Dan disappeared a second time, Grace had returned home and found the bedroom a shambles. He was gone and he hadn\u2019t taken anything with him, but he\u2019d emptied the drawers, torn the room apart. What she didn\u2019t understand then was that he\u2019d been on a search. What he sought, she realized now, had been his wedding band. When he couldn\u2019t find it, he\u2019d gone into Berghoff\u2019s and purchased another. For some confused reason\u2014loyalty? guilt? both?\u2014he\u2019d wanted his wedding ring on his finger when he blew out his brains.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Kelly rushed into the room with Paul and the baby. Her daughter\u2019s sobs tore at her heart, and Grace held out her arms. Maryellen was only a few moments behind. Together they formed a circle, arms around one another, weeping, sobbing, hugging. Then Grace kissed each one in turn and whispered, \u201cWe need to make burial arrangements. It\u2019s time we laid your father to rest.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Daniel Sherman was buried three days later in a private service with only family and a few friends in attendance. Bob Beldon, a childhood friend of Dan\u2019s, gave the eulogy. The two men had been on the high school football team together and then following graduation they\u2019d enlisted in the Army on the buddy program. Maryellen hadn\u2019t realized how close Dan and Bob had once been. After Vietnam her father had let that friendship and all the others slide as he became immersed in his own hell.</p><p>Maryellen returned from the memorial, physically and emotionally exhausted. Needing time to think through the events of the past year, she parked near the gallery, then walked down to the waterfront.</p><p>The gazebo area, where the Concerts on the Cove were held each Thursday night during summer, was deserted. Sitting halfway up in the stands, Maryellen stared straight ahead as she considered the complex relationship she\u2019d had with her father. He\u2019d loved her, she knew now, as much as he was capable of loving anyone. Kelly, too\u2014perhaps more. And he\u2019d loved their mother.</p><p>Grace had taken his death hard. Maryellen attributed her mother\u2019s intense grief to the fact that she hadn\u2019t been prepared for the shock of it. For her, it\u2019d been easier to believe that Dan was with another woman\u2014easier to accept, in some ways, than the knowledge that he\u2019d taken his own life.</p><p>As to her own feelings, Maryellen was confused. This was her father, and she loved him, but she\u2019d learned early in life to avoid Dan whenever the darkness came over him. As a five-year-old, she\u2019d come up with that term. \u201cThe darkness.\u201d It all made sense now. Her father had been haunted by guilt since the war, guilt he couldn\u2019t drive off and couldn\u2019t share.</p><p>Maryellen understood that, since she, too, lived with regret and pain. She, too, struggled with the past. All this time, she\u2019d believed she had nothing in common with her father and without knowing it, they\u2019d been more alike than she could possibly have guessed.</p><p>A tear fell onto her cheek, and then another, catching her unawares. Maryellen wasn\u2019t emotional; she refused to be. Couldn\u2019t afford to be. She\u2019d locked away her emotions when she walked away from her marriage. Emotions were too costly.</p><p>The sound of someone approaching made her straighten and wipe the tears from her face. Somehow, she wasn\u2019t surprised to see that the intruder was Jon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI read about your father. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He stood some distance from her, down by the gazebo, and looked out over the water. The sky was an azure cloudless blue, and the wind was still.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The foot ferry that traveled between Bremerton and Cedar Cove lumbered toward the pier. Maryellen concentrated on that instead of Jon. He didn\u2019t leave and she wanted to be alone. If she didn\u2019t pick up the conversation, maybe he\u2019d get the hint and go away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to talk to you about this now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d she pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taken that choice away from me.\u201d To his credit, he did sound apologetic. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me about the baby we could\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could\u2019ve what?\u201d she shouted. \u201cGotten rid of it?\u201d</p><p>Her anger appeared to shock him. He stiffened and then dashed up the aisle so that he stood directly in front of her. \u201cNo, Maryellen, we could\u2019ve talked this out like civilized human beings. Instead, you deceived me. You let me think everything was perfectly fine and it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and stared at her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Everything is fine. I\u2019m going to have my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. This isn\u2019t your baby, it\u2019s our baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d A chill ran down her spine, a niggling fear.</p><p>\u201cA father has rights, too.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen went cold inside. \u201cHow much is this going to cost me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He frowned, obviously confused.</p><p>\u201cHow much money will it take for you to leave me and my\u2014me and the baby alone?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He stared at her for a long, heart-stopping moment. \u201cYou want to pay me to stay out of my child\u2019s life? Is that what you\u2019re suggesting?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d He sounded angry and disgusted. Then he completely bewildered her by asking, \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold me what?\u201d There seemed to be something she could use against him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know, then I\u2019ll be damned before I hand you another weapon.\u201d</p><p>Her mind raced with what she knew about him, which was little. He worked as a chef, was a talented photographer and had inherited an incredible piece of land from his grandfather. That was the sum total of everything she\u2019d learned about him\u2014with one small sidebar. He was a fabulous lover. This last thought made her stomach tense.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you take the photo of me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but stood his ground.</p><p>\u201cI saw it in Seattle. That is me, Jon. Did you think I wouldn\u2019t recognize myself?\u201d She wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d been deceptive.</p> <p>When she glanced up, she saw that he looked chagrined, as though embarrassed that she\u2019d seen something he\u2019d never intended her to know about. Well, she did know and she didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever see that,\u201d he admitted, his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. Did you follow me around, Jon? When did you take that photograph?\u201d</p><p>He lowered himself onto the bench several feet away from her. He kept his eyes focused on the waterfront and the jagged peaks of Olympic Mountains in the background. \u201cWe\u2019re both adults. We should be able to come to an agreement regarding the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want money, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son,\u201d he told her. \u201cOr my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why does my baby matter to you? Is it some sort of male pride? Or vengeance? Or what?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cA child is a child, and that\u2019s a hell of a lot more than I ever expected out of life.\u201d His voice was rigid with anger. \u201cI\u2019ve given up a lot over the years, but I\u2019m not walking away from my own flesh and blood.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen was beginning to feel truly frightened. His interest in the child wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d anticipated. She\u2019d completely misread him that time before Christmas. Based on his reaction and on her own past experience, she\u2019d believed he wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with their child.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said reluctantly, \u201clet\u2019s talk about this. How involved do you expect to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want joint custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life!\u201d Her reaction was strong and immediate. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about taking care of an infant?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAbout as much as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work nights,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cYou work days. It\u2019s a perfect set-up. Our child will be with one of his or her parents at all times.\u201d</p><p>By now Maryellen\u2019s stomach was twisted in tight knots. \u201cThat\u2019s too difficult\u2014we\u2019d constantly be shuffling the baby from one house to the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked what I want, so I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Jon continued. \u201cJoint custody is number one on the list, but I also want to be at the hospital when the baby\u2019s born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be there? For what possible reason?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her question. \u201cHave you chosen a birthing partner yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, have your mother go in with you. But after the baby\u2019s born, I want to be the first one to hold him or her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This was getting far too complicated, far too unreasonable. She longed for him to simply leave her alone. She\u2019d already been through one traumatic experience today and she wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with another. \u201cAnything else you want?\u201d she asked with weary sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, there are several more items on my list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your response is likely to be the same, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>In retrospect she\u2019d been naive to think he\u2019d be like Clint and demand she get rid of the baby. She\u2019d been even more naive not to consider that Jon might actually wish to be involved in the baby\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you be like other men?\u201d she muttered irritably. Like Clint, for example.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he challenged. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be like other women who use a child as a meal ticket and a way to manipulate men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a rather jaded view of the female population.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more jaded than your view of men.\u201d</p><p>He had her there. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>He let the conversation drop a moment, and then turned to her. \u201cCan we compromise, Maryellen? Will you voluntarily allow me to be a part of my baby\u2019s life? To be a father to my child?\u201d</p><p>That he would ask her this on the very day she\u2019d buried her own father was an irony she\u2019d never forget. \u201cDo I have to make that decision right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been to see an attorney. If we can\u2019t work this out between the two of us, then I\u2019m going to take you to court.\u201d</p><p>The day Grace laid her husband to rest, she\u2019d stood with her daughters at the gravesite and gathered them close so the three of them could bid Dan farewell. The nightmare was over. She had the answers she needed. What she hadn\u2019t anticipated was the aching regret that accompanied them. For three days, she\u2019d suffered from nightmares. The questions and doubts that had plagued her constantly since his disappearance had been dispelled by his letter; she knew now that she wasn\u2019t to blame for his misery or for his final choice. But she\u2019d discovered that the answers were as haunting as the questions.</p><p>Dan had chosen to take his own life. He\u2019d chosen to die rather than confront the past, rather than deal with the future, rather than seek professional help. What Dan wrote in his letter explained his dark moods, but it didn\u2019t offer the expiation she sought. It didn\u2019t explain why her husband hadn\u2019t been able to turn to her. She\u2019d failed him, failed their marriage. Dan was never the same person after Vietnam; she\u2019d known that and she should\u2019ve gotten him help.</p><p>With friends and family at her side these last few days, it had been easy to push the nagging questions out of her mind, but she was alone now. The girls were both in their own homes. They had made peace with their father and gone back to their lives. But Grace wasn\u2019t sure she could ever do that. Dan\u2019s last act had changed the way she saw her whole marriage\u2014her whole life.</p><p>She boiled water and then left a pot of tea to steep while she changed out of her suit and into slacks and a sleeveless top. Her eyes stung from the tears she\u2019d shed, but they were dry now. No sooner had she poured her tea than the doorbell rang. Grace half expected Olivia and would have welcomed her dearest friend. Her feelings were contradictory; she didn\u2019t want to be alone, but she didn\u2019t want company, either. Olivia would understand that.</p><p>But it was Cliff Harding who stood at her door, a bouquet of perfect yellow rosebuds in his hand.</p><p>She blinked, stunned to see him, and instantly, to her utter embarrassment, dissolved into tears. Covering her face with both hands, she wept aloud. Cliff opened the screen door and stepped inside, and immediately took her into his arms.</p><p>Grace clung to him. She felt the roses press against her back, the tiny thorns tearing the material of her blouse, and still she clung to him weeping and sobbing, her cries echoing in the empty house.</p><p>Cliff led her to the sofa. His arms encompassed her as her body shook with sobs.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how much time had passed, but when the tears were spent, she lifted her head and between deep breaths apologized. \u201cI didn\u2019t...mean to...do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Not understanding the comment, she raised questioning eyes to him.</p><p>\u201cIt feels good to be needed. No one\u2019s needed me in a very long time.\u201d</p><p>Grace pressed her head to Cliff\u2019s shoulder and exhaled a wobbly breath. She gloried in his warmth, his solid strength. \u201cI never expected it to end like this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d He wrapped his arm around her shoulder and kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grace, sorrier than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wrote me a letter.... It helped explain. All the years I believed...I thought there was someone else, some other woman who could make him happy.\u201d</p><p>His hand stroked her hair. \u201cWhat about the friend who spotted him in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the sheriff, it couldn\u2019t have been Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA case of mistaken identity?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cIt must be.\u201d She blew her nose in a tissue, thinking she must look dreadful. \u201cIt explains the mangled Christmas gifts I found, too.\u201d That was a sign of the depths his depression had reached. He felt unworthy of anything good in his life, to the point that he\u2019d destroyed anything he loved, including the gifts his family gave him. His world was a bleak, black void. He felt trapped in the darkness and couldn\u2019t find his way out.</p><p>\u201cDid you learn where he got the cash to buy the trailer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t know. We never had thirteen thousand dollars in all the time we were married. With Dan only working part of the year, we often went for months living on one paycheck, scrimping, going from payday to payday. We had to take out loans to pay for the girls\u2019 schooling. I don\u2019t understand how he managed to put that kind of money aside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe must have planned this for years.\u201d</p><p>Grace had thought that, too. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he intended to kill himself right away.... I think he just wanted to escape. Dan loved the forest. He felt more at peace there than anywhere else. His moods got much worse after he lost his job as a logger. I just assumed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou assumed the depression was caused by the loss of his job, which is only natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cI realize now that he lost whatever sense of peace he had when he left the forest. That\u2019s why he bought the trailer. He intended to live there for a while, I think, mull over his life...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that, but how true it is I have no way of knowing. He returned to the house once. I\u2019m positive of that.\u201d Still, Grace didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d come home so briefly. She felt a wave of pity for him and wished again that she\u2019d been more perceptive.</p> <p>\u201cCan I do anything for you?\u201d Cliff asked.</p><p>Grace shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m so tired. I haven\u2019t slept more than two or three hours at a stretch since Dan was found.\u201d</p><p>He grazed her temple with his lips. \u201cSleep now,\u201d he urged.</p><p>She reached for his hand and held it. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll be here when you wake up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise.\u201d That was important to her for reasons she didn\u2019t want to analyze.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He led her into the bedroom, and when she lay down on the bed, he covered her with a blanket, leaned over and kissed her cheek. Then he crept from the bedroom and turned off the light.</p><p>Grace closed her eyes and heard the door to her room close with a soft click. While sleep was tempting, all she really needed was to rest her eyes for a moment. But she instantly drifted off. Three hours later, when she woke, night had settled in and darkness surrounded her.</p><p>As she took a moment to orient herself, she heard someone in her kitchen. Tossing aside the afghan Cliff had spread over her, she climbed off the bed and came into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cCliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d He appeared, wearing her apron along with an enticing grin. \u201cI\u2019ve made us dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou cook?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t expect anything fancy.\u201d</p><p>The table was set, with everything neatly in place. A tantalizing scent wafted from the oven. He\u2019d put the roses in a vase on the table and had used her best china and linen. His care sent a feeling of warmth surging through her.</p><p>\u201cOlivia phoned,\u201d Cliff told her. \u201cWe spoke for a while. Maryellen checked in, too. You might want to give her a call later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Olivia? Should I return her call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want. She was more concerned that you not be by yourself, but I assured her I was here for you. I\u2019m not going anywhere, Grace.\u201d</p><p>His words comforted her. She\u2019d felt so desperately alone since the discovery of Dan\u2019s body. Even after he\u2019d disappeared, she hadn\u2019t experienced this cold loneliness in quite the same way.</p><p>Reaching for the pot holders, Cliff withdrew a casserole dish from the oven. \u201cI hope you like shepherd\u2019s pie?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t feel like eating, but nodded. Since he\u2019d gone to so much trouble, the least she could do was make an effort to show her appreciation. Only when she actually sat down to eat did she realize how hungry she was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an excellent cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He smiled, apparently pleased by her praise. \u201cMy repertoire is pretty basic, though.\u201d</p><p>When they\u2019d finished with the meal, they lingered over coffee and then, because she needed to do something with her hands, she started clearing away dishes. Cliff insisted on helping and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I told Olivia,\u201d Cliff said as he set a dinner plate inside the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to set up camp in your living room, but I want you to know I\u2019m here for the long haul.\u201d He leaned against the counter and sighed. \u201cToday, the day you\u2019ve buried your husband, probably isn\u2019t the right time to tell you this, but I care deeply about you, Grace.\u201d</p><p>His words hung in the air between them.</p><p>\u201cI care about you, too,\u201d she said quietly. She knew that Cliff was meant to be in her life as surely as the sun shone in the sky.</p><p>\u201cYou feel the same way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014damn, you can\u2019t say that to a man when he has a dishtowel in his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can,\u201d she teased, \u201cand do you know why? Because I don\u2019t plan on leaving you anytime soon, either.\u201d</p><p>Then they were in each other\u2019s arms again. They didn\u2019t kiss; the day of Dan\u2019s funeral was too soon for that. But the time would come again and they\u2019d both know when it did.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure your boyfriend won\u2019t mind me stealing you on a Friday night?\u201d Stan asked Olivia as they stood in line at the six-plex theater.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s busy.\u201d He\u2019d phoned and invited her to come with him to the school board meeting, but she\u2019d declined. Because Jack was so paranoid about Stan, she didn\u2019t mention that she was going to an early movie with her ex-husband. She would tell him, though; she just didn\u2019t want a big discussion about it.</p><p>\u201cThis is almost like old times,\u201d Stan said.</p><p>\u201cNot quite. Are you buying the popcorn or am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, in that way, I guess, it is like old times.\u201d With three young children, a night out for them had been infrequent. Going to a movie every six months was a big deal. In order to save time, Stan generally bought the tickets while she stood in line at the snack bar.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Clark Kent, anyway?\u201d Stan asked as they walked into the theater.</p><p>He certainly was curious. \u201cHe had a meeting to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him about this? Because I don\u2019t want to be a source of trouble between you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d She wasn\u2019t one who kept secrets, and Stan should know that. His questions irritated her.</p><p>They sat in the back of the theater, and as soon as they were settled in, Olivia took a handful of popcorn.</p><p>\u201cYou actually like this guy, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>With her mouth full, she simply nodded. The truth of it was, she did. Jack was intelligent and argumentative and he had a sense of humor; he challenged her and he made her laugh. He was a bit insecure, too, but she was willing to look past that.</p><p>Stan seemed about to ask her another question when the previews started, for which Olivia was grateful. She didn\u2019t want to spend the evening discussing her personal relationships.</p><p>After the movie, they stopped for coffee and dessert at the PancakePalace. That had also been part of their date-night routine. But as they sat in the booth across from each other, Olivia was determined not to let Stan sidetrack her, either with nostalgic references or with questions about Jack. He\u2019d contacted her, wanting advice about his marriage. So that was going to be the subject of their conversation.</p><p>\u201cAre you and Jack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Olivia raised her hand. \u201cIs tonight about you or me?\u201d</p><p>Stan lowered his eyes. \u201cDefeat has never come easy to me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had to bite her tongue to keep from reminding him that he\u2019d been the one to pack up and move out of their home. He\u2019d been the one to file for divorce and the one who insisted their marriage was over.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMarge wants out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says she doesn\u2019t love me anymore\u2014that we had something special once but we don\u2019t now. She\u2019s already filed for divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>Stan refused to meet her eyes. \u201cIt hurts like hell.\u201d</p><p>Then, because her own experience had given her some insight into Marge, Olivia asked, \u201cDo you think she\u2019s met someone else?\u201d</p><p>Stan\u2019s gaze shot to hers as he slowly nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve thought that for some time.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t feel any sense of vindication at being right. She felt sadness for both her ex-husband and his second wife. Stan and Marge had once had a solid marriage, but apparently old patterns had reasserted themselves. She recalled that Marge, too, had been married when she\u2019d met Stan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He tried to make light of it, but Olivia knew him well enough to recognize the pain in his eyes. For the first time, she looked at him and didn\u2019t see the strikingly attractive man he\u2019d once been. Stan seemed old and somehow, worn-out, his skin sallow and lined.</p><p>They talked for nearly an hour and she was astonished to see that it was almost nine by the time they paid for their coffee and pie.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping well,\u201d he confessed as they drove back to the house on Lighthouse Road</p><p>. \u201cI have to tell you, Olivia, this divorce business has really got me down.\u201d</p><p>She patted his hand. \u201cLife has a way of working everything out. Don\u2019t give up on Marge yet.\u201d</p><p>Stan pulled over to the side of the road. The sun was just setting, and the last threads of light cast a golden glow across the shimmering waters of the Cove. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved the view of the house from here,\u201d he said, leaving the engine to idle.</p><p>Olivia did, too. She remembered when she\u2019d first seen that old house with the For Sale sign in the front yard. She\u2019d felt chills go down her spine. She didn\u2019t even need to tour the inside to know this was the home she wanted for her family. Although the price had been a stretch for them, together they\u2019d managed to come up with the down payment and get a loan. The twins had been four then, and it was the first time they\u2019d had their own rooms. Unfortunately the house hadn\u2019t been enough to hold their family together after the loss of Jordan. Yet in many ways Olivia viewed it as a symbol of everything that was best about their marriage.</p><p>\u201cMarge moved out last weekend,\u201d Stan admitted.</p><p>Olivia hadn\u2019t known that. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Stan.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and looked away. \u201cThank you for not gloating. This is what I deserve, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been divorced a lot of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but you\u2019ve been decent about it, Liv, really decent.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure that was entirely true.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can face going home. Not tonight,\u201d he said, sounding broken and tired.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just get a hotel room.\u201d</p><p>Olivia knew this could just be a ploy, but she did feel bad for him, and she understood his not wanting to go back to an empty house. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to do that. You can sleep in James\u2019s old room and drive to Seattle in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Some of the stress left his face. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I do have an appointment tomorrow. I should leave by nine.\u201d She and Jack were going to Sol Duc Hot Springs so he could do research for a travel article. Since she had the better car, she was picking him up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll be on the road by eight. Sooner if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time before nine will be okay.\u201d</p><p>Stan parked his BMW in the back by the garage and before he went upstairs, Olivia gave him a fresh set of towels.</p><p>This was the first time they\u2019d slept in the same house since their divorce. As she readied for bed, she wondered if she\u2019d done the right thing by inviting him to stay.</p> <p>In the morning, her doubts disappeared. She was awake at seven and while she brewed coffee she heard the shower running upstairs. Humming to herself, she was surprised to hear someone ringing her doorbell.</p><p>She ran to answer it.</p><p>\u201cJ-Jack?\u201d she stammered, instantly afraid he\u2019d hear Stan and assume the worst.</p><p>\u201cI come bearing gifts.\u201d He held two containers of coffee and a white bakery sack. \u201cMaple bars,\u201d he said enticingly. \u201cYour favorite. I thought we\u2019d have breakfast here before we head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d Stan called as he bounded down the stairs. He stopped cold when he saw Jack. He wore one of Justine\u2019s old housecoats and a pair of her fuzzy slippers.</p><p>\u201cYou remember Stan, don\u2019t you?\u201d she muttered, which was probably the most inane thing she could have said.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I remember Stan.\u201d Jack\u2019s eyes were cold and narrow.</p><p>Stan, doing his best to appear dignified, wrapped the silky housecoat more securely around him. \u201cObviously, my timing couldn\u2019t have been worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYour timing couldn\u2019t have been better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Stan cast an apologetic look at Olivia and hurried back up the stairs.</p> <p>Jack and Olivia faced each other. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe that Stan and I...slept together.\u201d Surely Jack had more faith in her than that!</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>This was such a juvenile response she didn\u2019t know how to react.</p><p>\u201cHe wants you back.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard that before. But Jack didn\u2019t know how badly Stan was hurting. This wasn\u2019t what it looked like!</p><p>\u201cYou can believe me or not,\u201d Jack continued. \u201cThat\u2019s completely up to you. But I\u2019ll tell you something. It\u2019s either him or me. You decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to tell my ex-husband that I won\u2019t see him again?\u201d</p><p>Surely even Jack must realize he had no right to make such a demand.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want, or we\u2019re through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deal well with ultimatums,\u201d Olivia told him.</p><p>Jack set the coffee and the maple bars on the dining room table. \u201cThat tells me everything I need to know.\u201d He turned and headed out the door.</p><p>Olivia was so shocked she didn\u2019t know what to do. Shocked and then angry. It took her a full ten seconds to decide to chase after him. By then Jack had reached his dilapidated old car.</p><p>\u201cYou say Stan wants me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s made that plain for months.\u201d Jack\u2019s hand was on his door.</p><p>How dare he just walk away like this! If what he said was true, then the least he could do was show some gumption.</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin, do you care about me at all?\u201d she cried.</p><p>He turned around and glared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s him or me. You have to decide.\u201d</p><p>So Mr. Hotshot was still playing that game. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m not the one making the decisions here, it\u2019s you. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s running away with your tail between your legs. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s tossing out ultimatums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Finally a question she could answer. \u201cWhat I want, Jack Griffin, is for you to fight for me. Prove to me that you\u2019re worthy of all the faith I have in you.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Maryellen felt about as pregnant as she could get. It was hard to believe that she had another six weeks to go before her baby was due. She hadn\u2019t heard from Jon since mid-June, the afternoon she\u2019d buried her father. She wasn\u2019t foolish enough to believe he\u2019d relented and wouldn\u2019t follow through with legal action. In the three weeks since, she\u2019d been constantly alert, waiting for him to make good on his threats.</p><p>With summer in full swing, Maryellen had been busy with the steady stream of tourists. The gallery was doing well, but several of her summer customers were disappointed to find she no longer carried Jon\u2019s work. She\u2019d heard, via the grapevine, that he was selling exceptionally well at the BernardGallery in Seattle. Word had it that his prints sold out almost as soon as he delivered them. The problem was the same as when she\u2019d carried his work; his deliveries were sporadic and demand far outweighed supply. She appreciated the reasons in a way she hadn\u2019t before. He used to cook at Andr\u00e9\u2019s and now worked five long days a week at The Lighthouse, which was quickly gaining a reputation as one of the area\u2019s finest restaurants. Seth and Justine\u2019s new venture appeared to be thriving with Jon at the helm.</p><p>Maryellen was pleased for the couple\u2019s success. What bothered her, what downright irritated her, was Jon\u2019s golden touch. He was too perfect, too good. Talent spilled out of him like water from an overfilled glass. He designed and built his own home, took brilliant photographs and was a talented chef. Other than his lack of minor social skills\u2014which could, in fact, be seen as evidence of his sincerity and therefore a plus\u2014the man had no flaws. If he did take her to court over shared custody of their child, there was every likelihood he\u2019d win. Unless she was able to dig up some dirt in his past...She\u2019d sensed secrets about him and he\u2019d as much as admitted there was something to use against him.</p><p>The thought unsettled her. Battling for custody in a courtroom wasn\u2019t the way she wanted it. The plan had been to raise her child alone. She\u2019d assumed that when and if Jon ever learned of the baby, he\u2019d be relieved she hadn\u2019t involved him. But\u2014as with so much else in her life\u2014she\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>By closing time, Maryellen was tired and out of sorts. Her feet hurt, she felt fat and ungainly, and the last thing she felt like doing was fixing dinner. Fish and chips appealed to her, so she stopped at a small caf\u00e9 near ColchesterPark that served some of the best.</p><p>She sat at an outside table, across the street from the water, with the Seattle skyline in the distance. Elevating her feet on the opposite bench, she set the cardboard container on the table and then licked her fingers, savoring the salty taste of hot chips. A pickup pulled into the lot, one she instantly recognized, and Maryellen froze. No, please, no. Jon should be at The Lighthouse, he should be taking photographs or working on his house. He should be anywhere except here.</p><p>Jon seemed equally surprised to see her. He climbed out and stood beside his truck for a moment, appearing uncertain as to whether he should acknowledge her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t follow you if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he said in an expressionless voice.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She refused to allow him to ruin her meal and reached for the saltshaker.</p><p>\u201cJustine\u2019s having all kinds of water retention problems because of salt,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cShould you be using it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m completely healthy.\u201d How like a man to try to tell her what to do. Her irritation flared up and just as quickly died.</p><p>\u201cAnd the baby?\u201d He focused on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s developing nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve had periodic ultrasounds because of my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I had them tell me just recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl.\u201d He said it as if in absolute awe. \u201cHave you picked out names yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of Catherine Grace.\u201d</p><p>His face softened. \u201cMy mother\u2019s name was Katie. She\u2019d be very pleased if she knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell her.\u201d She didn\u2019t think he intended to keep the baby a secret. Perhaps this small concession on her part would convince him of her good faith.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s been dead fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Maryellen instantly regretted saying anything.</p><p>\u201cI want my daughter in my life,\u201d Jon said, his voice firm.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we could reach a compromise.\u201d It hadn\u2019t been part of her plan, but she didn\u2019t want to drag this through the courts, either.</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeekends?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>His face as void of emotion as he considered her offer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to shuffle the baby back and forth\u2014days with you, nights with me,\u201d she explained nervously. \u201cI want her life to be stable and full of love. Please try to understand.\u201d</p><p>His reluctant nod followed. \u201cAll right. But my weekends sometimes aren\u2019t the same as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can work around that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re in agreement about the baby and me?\u201d he asked, as though he wanted to be sure there was no misunderstanding. \u201cShe\u2019ll be with me two nights a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He seemed relieved and perhaps even moved by her compromise. \u201cI plan on being a good father.\u201d He turned toward his truck, his reason for stopping at the caf\u00e9 apparently forgotten. \u201cGo easy on the salt, you hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Maryellen gave a mock salute and smiled, and to her astonishment, Jon smiled back. He got into his truck and drove off, but as his vehicle disappeared from view she realized that she\u2019d done Jon Bowman a disservice. He genuinely cared for their unborn child\u2014and for her. Throughout this ordeal he\u2019d been honorable and kind. She was the one who\u2019d mistreated him.</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s appetite vanished, and she pushed her meal away. The baby fidgeted inside her, stretching and kicking as if to remind her that every child deserved a mother and a father.</p><p>\u201cAll in due course, Catherine Grace,\u201d she murmured, rubbing her abdomen, \u201call in due course.\u201d</p><p>For five months Roy McAfee had searched for information on the John Doe who\u2019d died at the Beldons\u2019 bed-and-breakfast. So far, he\u2019d learned that the airline ticket had come from a small town in southern Florida. This same town was where \u201cJames Whitcomb\u201d had lived, according to his counterfeit ID. Roy had traveled there, showed the man\u2019s picture to authorities in the area and come back with nothing.</p><p>His next angle had been to contact plastic surgeons in Florida, but none recognized the work or knew of the case. One physician suggested it seemed to have been done twenty or thirty years ago, as techniques had changed over time. While that was interesting, it wasn\u2019t especially helpful.</p><p>Six months after his death, the John Doe had yet to be identified. And despite the days and nights he\u2019d logged on this case, Roy was no further ahead. The toxicology report had revealed nothing to unravel the mystery. Because of budget restraints, Troy Davis hadn\u2019t ordered more extensive tests.</p><p>Roy knew the county didn\u2019t have a lot of extra cash\u2014and curiosity was definitely not an item in their budget. With no clear evidence of foul play, there was nothing to investigate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrie came into the office carrying a cup of freshly brewed coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about the dead guy again.\u201d Because they still didn\u2019t have a name for him, his wife referred to him as \u201cthe dead guy.\u201d</p><p>Roy growled something unintelligible under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m not dropping it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy doesn\u2019t have the money to continue funding the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to remind me of that.\u201d After his last report, in which he had little information to add, Davis had said to let it go. Roy didn\u2019t like hearing that, but there were plenty of other cases that needed his attention. Still, this one nagged at him, much the same way Dan Sherman\u2019s disappearance had.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already put out more money than we\u2019ve taken in.\u201d</p><p>Roy had heard that before, as well. From the beginning, Corrie hadn\u2019t been keen on his delving into this investigation. He didn\u2019t think she could explain her reasoning any more than he could rationalize the time and expense he\u2019d poured into the case.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking the dead guy came to Cedar Cove for a specific reason,\u201d Roy murmured, turning the puzzle around in his mind. He didn\u2019t believe for a moment that this was a random visit. Something else that had bothered him was how the man knew about Thyme and Tide. The bed-and-breakfast wasn\u2019t on a main road. He had to go off the freeway and down several side roads in order to find it.</p><p>Either the John Doe had gotten completely lost in the storm, or he\u2019d specifically chosen the Beldons\u2019 place. If so, why?</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s a hit man,\u201d Corrie suggested, then shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading too many mysteries.\u201d</p> <p>Roy had thought of that possibility himself. \u201cIn which case, he would\u2019ve been carrying a weapon and he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless it was being planted for him.\u201d Corrie shrugged. \u201cIt happens that way in the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit men carry their own pieces.\u201d</p><p>Corrie leaned against the edge of his desk. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you spoke to Bob Beldon?\u201d</p><p>Roy had to think about that. \u201cA couple of months ago, I think.\u201d His wife had a gift for asking the right questions. \u201cHe swears he\u2019d never seen the man before that night,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I remember you telling me that something about his reaction was slightly off.\u201d</p> <p>That niggling feeling came every now and then. Roy didn\u2019t suspect Bob of anything underhanded, nor did he believe the other man was withholding information, but often people weren\u2019t even aware of what they knew. Bob most likely had some vague sense of recognition\u2014so vague he didn\u2019t consider it worth mentioning. Maybe he\u2019d met the dead guy in his previous job or on a vacation.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pay Bob and Peggy a visit,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>Corrie grinned knowingly. \u201cI figured you might think that was a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Peggy was working in her herb garden when he pulled into the driveway. He could see her with her straw hat and a large basket, snipping and gathering. Getting out of the car, he waved to her; she waved cheerfully back. Although the couple was around the same age as Corrie and him, they hadn\u2019t socialized. He wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>Roy saw another car parked in the driveway, one he didn\u2019t recognize. Probably belonged to a guest. The front door opened before he could ring the bell and Pastor Dave Flemming stepped onto the porch. Dave served as a Methodist minister and was a likeable guy; Roy had met him on a number of occasions. He knew that Pastor Dave had officiated at Dan Sherman\u2019s funeral, which had been small and private, and had met with Grace a couple of times since, helping her deal with the tragedy.</p><p>\u201cRoy, how are you?\u201d Pastor Dave said, extending his hand. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re popular today, Bob,\u201d Dave said on his way out the door.</p> <p>\u201cYou here to see me?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d He held the screen door open and invited Roy inside. \u201cPastor Dave asked me to coach a church basketball team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were interested in sports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t played in years,\u201d Bob said as he led Roy into the kitchen. He offered him a glass of iced tea, which Roy declined with a shake of his head.</p><p>They sat across the table from each other. \u201cApparently Grace mentioned to him that Dan and I were local sports heroes a hundred years ago,\u201d Bob murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou and Dan went to school together?\u201d</p><p>Bob nodded. \u201cWe were good friends at one time. In fact, we enrolled in the Army on the buddy plan and took our training together.\u201d</p><p>As long as Roy had lived in Cedar Cove, he couldn\u2019t remember the two men having more than a nodding acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you came by to ask me about Dan, now did you?\u201d Bob said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m still trying to find out who your visitor was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou learn anything?\u201d Bob leaned forward slightly.</p><p>Roy shook his head. \u201cI know you\u2019ve gone over the details of that night a number of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you and with Troy.\u201d Bob sounded bored.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>Bob nodded. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me your impressions again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think.\u201d Bob leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes. \u201cIt was late. The news was over and Leno was just coming on. I saw the car\u2019s headlights from the window and asked Peggy if we had any guests down on the books. She said we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your first reaction when you saw him?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>His eyes remained closed. \u201cHey\u2014you know what? I thought he seemed familiar, which is odd because I didn\u2019t get a good look at his face. I\u2019d kind of forgotten about that, with all the commotion the next morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamiliar?\u201d Roy pressed. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>Bob frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Nothing definite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis walk? The way he carried himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>Bob opened his eyes and shook his head. \u201cI had...an uneasy feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine uneasy,\u201d Roy probed.</p><p>Bob thought a moment and then shrugged. \u201cIt was like a gut reaction\u2014that this man meant trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble,\u201d Roy repeated.</p><p>\u201cI guess I was partially right, seeing that he turned up dead in the morning.\u201d Bob sighed loudly and shook his head. \u201cSorry I can\u2019t help you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d Roy said, which seemed to surprise Bob.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you did know this man. I want you to sleep on it. Let it work in your mind and get back to me if something else occurs to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he was here because of me?\u201d Bob sounded shocked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Bob, I do.\u201d</p><p>Finally Rosie was to have her day in court. She\u2019d waited almost six months for this. Sharon Castor, her attorney, walked next to her as they approached the front of the courtroom and sat down.</p><p>\u201cWe have Judge Lockhart,\u201d Sharon whispered.</p><p>Having a female judge reassured Rosie, since another woman would understand her position more clearly than a man. Although he continued to deny it, Zach was involved with Janice Lamond. If he\u2019d been honest about the affair, the divorce would have been over months ago. She blamed him for the delays, blamed him for everything. He, of course, blamed her. He accused Rosie of dragging things out and being unreasonable. She accused him of lying. On and on it went.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Rosie whispered, leaning her head close to Sharon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cLockhart\u2019s fair, if a bit unorthodox.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t what Rosie wanted to hear. She wanted this procedure to be quick and straighforward. After six months of haggling over every detail, she was ready for the divorce to be done. Ready to make a new life for herself and put the bitterness and ill will behind her.</p><p>Zach approached the table, his attorney at his side.</p><p>Rosie didn\u2019t look at Zach, but she felt his gaze burn through her. She stiffened her spine and refused to acknowledge him. Her eyes stung from lack of sleep. Her head throbbed with the worst headache in ten years and she felt she might be physically ill. Zach would never know any of this, however. She\u2019d keel over in a dead faint before she\u2019d let him know what his affair had done to her sense of worth, her dignity and her heart. This divorce had just about destroyed her emotionally.</p><p>The judge was announced and all the people in the courtroom briefly rose and then immediately reclaimed their seats.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Your Honor,\u201d Sharon Castor said, rising to her feet once more.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Judge Lockhart flipped through the pages of the brief, scanning the details. \u201cI see you\u2019ve reached a settlement in the matter of alimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read through the parenting plan.\u201d</p><p>Rosie caught her breath. She\u2019d held out as long as she could on the issue of joint custody. It wasn\u2019t what she wanted. She assumed, from the amount of time Janice and Chris spent with Zach, that he intended to make them part of his life and thus part of her children\u2019s lives. Knowing that, she fought him with everything she could. Their fights had grown ugly and vengeful. Rosie regretted the things they\u2019d said and done, but in the heat of her anger, the venom had flowed out of her. She hadn\u2019t known she was capable of behaving this way. Hadn\u2019t known Zach was capable of treating her with such contempt.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that you\u2019ve agreed to joint custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>Judge Lockhart gestured at the document. \u201cIt states here that the children, ages fifteen and nine, are to live with their father three days a week in the first and third week of each month and four days a week in the second and fourth week. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are to pack up their belongings and transfer from their house to his apartment\u2014and back\u2014every three or four days. Isn\u2019t that a lot of moving about for these children?\u201d the judge asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYour Honor.\u201d Zach\u2019s attorney stood. \u201cIt\u2019s important to my client that he share custody of his children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no squabbles with his motivation or the concept of shared custody,\u201d Judge Lockhart said, \u201cbut to my way of thinking, it isn\u2019t the parents who need a stable home life, it\u2019s the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy client couldn\u2019t agree with you more,\u201d Otto Benson said, and Zach nodded.</p><p>\u201cMs. Castor, is your client in agreement as well?\u201d</p><p>Sharon looked at Rosie, who stood. She spoke directly to the judge. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for my children.\u201d</p><p>Judge Lockhart studied both Zach and Rosie. \u201cThe family home is at 311 Pelican Court</p><p>. How long have you lived at this address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou intend to keep the home?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, Your Honor,\u201d Sharon answered on Rosie\u2019s behalf.</p><p>The judge set aside the paperwork and sighed heavily. \u201cThat being the case, I\u2019m going to put your word to the test. Both of you have stated that your main concern in this divorce is your two children. That\u2019s what I want to hear. Both of you seem determined to stay in their lives and I commend you for that. I hope you mean it. I agree to accept all conditions and terms as submitted to this court with one exception: joint custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Honor!\u201d Zach roared to his feet.</p><p>\u201cHear me out, Mr. Cox,\u201d the judge ordered and Zach sat back down.</p> <p>Smugly Rosie crossed her arms, pleased that this insightful judge had seen through her husband.</p><p>\u201cAs I stated earlier, it\u2019s important for the children to have a stable home. You two\u2014not the children\u2014are the ones who\u2019ve decided to end this marriage. Therefore, the children are to remain in the house and the parents are the ones who\u2019ll be moving in and out every few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Your Honor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are my terms. Either accept them now or delay the divorce.\u201d</p><p>Horrified, Rosie looked at Zach. How could they go along with this after they\u2019d struggled over every single detail?</p> <p>\u201cHave you made a decision?\u201d the judge asked.</p><p>Zach and his attorney were whispering. Soon afterward Otto stood. \u201cYour Honor, my client agrees.\u201d</p><p>Sharon glanced at Rosie and she too nodded. \u201cMy client agrees also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Judge Lockhart said, \u201cthe marriage is dissolved. I hope you can make this work, for the sake of your children.\u201d</p><p>Rosie hoped so, too.</p><p>\u201cCall him,\u201d Charlotte urged Olivia. \u201cHe\u2019s miserable and so are you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Mother.\u201d Olivia put her teacup down. \u201cNot this time.\u201d She was still furious with Jack, and she refused to approach him. If he could so easily give up on her, then she considered herself better off without him. But she asked, \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s miserable?\u201d</p><p>Her mother set aside her knitting and reached for the teapot in the middle of the kitchen table. She replenished her cup and then Olivia\u2019s. \u201cHe asks about you every week when I drop off my column.\u201d</p><p>That was encouraging. Still, Olivia had seen no actual evidence of his concern. If Jack cared for her as much as he said he did, then he should take her advice and fight for her.</p><p>The phone rang, and Olivia absently reached for it. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Seth.\u201d Her son-in-law didn\u2019t sound like himself. \u201cJustine\u2019s water just broke and her labor\u2019s started. We\u2019re leaving for the hospital now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s early,\u201d Olivia cried. Three and a half weeks early, and that couldn\u2019t be good for Justine or the baby.</p><p>\u201cNo one bothered to tell the baby that.\u201d</p><p>What she heard in Seth\u2019s voice was a sense of panic. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d she assured him. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine. Babies are born early every day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know. This just caught me off guard. Can you call Stan for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Take a deep breath and I\u2019ll meet you at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Seth was gone, Olivia punched out Stan\u2019s work number and was put through immediately. \u201cStan Lockhart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Grandpa,\u201d she said, bubbling over with mingled excitement and concern. \u201cJustine\u2019s in labor and on her way to the hospital. Do you want to meet us there?\u201d</p><p>Stan laughed, sounding delighted and equally thrilled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. Tell her I\u2019ll see her soon, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to rush,\u201d her mother said as Olivia set the portable phone in its base. \u201cThese things take time.\u201d</p><p>So spoke the wisdom of age, but Olivia knew she\u2019d be hopeless anyplace but at the hospital. A baby was about to be born into their family, and she felt too much joy to hold inside. She couldn\u2019t sit still, and began pacing compulsively through the house.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Charlotte advised a few minutes later. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of everything here. Call me later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d Olivia kissed her mother\u2019s cheek, grabbed her purse and car keys and was out the door.</p><p>For nearly an hour she sat alone in the waiting area. Seth came out to give her bits of information every now and then; so far, everything was going smoothly. Stan arrived, looking frazzled, two hours later. They sat and drank coffee and chatted.</p><p>\u201cRemember the night James was born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could forget that.\u201d She gave an exaggerated shudder. \u201cWe barely made it to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Soon they were laughing, caught up in memories of the early years of their marriage.</p><p>\u201cRemember the Christmas Eve you decided to assemble Jordan\u2019s bicycle?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Stan groaned. \u201cAs I recall, the instructions were in Japanese and you were the one who said assembling a bike couldn\u2019t possibly be that difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the time you decided to teach Justine how to bake bread?\u201d</p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes at the memory. In an effort to be helpful, Justine had picked up\u2014and dropped\u2014a ten-pound bag of flour that exploded on impact. For years afterward, Olivia found traces of the powdery substance all over the kitchen\u2014beneath the sink, behind the refrigerator, in the backs of drawers.</p><p>The hours passed with barely a notice as they immersed themselves in laughter and memories.</p><p>At close to nine, Seth appeared, wearing the biggest grin Olivia had ever seen. She\u2019d almost forgotten the reason they were at the hospital. She leaped to her feet, ready for the news.</p><p>\u201cWe have a son,\u201d Seth announced. \u201cLeif Jordan Gunderson. He\u2019s a big boy for arriving early. Six pounds, two ounces. The doctor said he\u2019s a mite premature, but his lungs sound like they\u2019re working just fine.\u201d</p><p>Olivia promptly burst into tears.</p><p>By the time Olivia got home, she was happy but exhausted. Her mother had left a note on the kitchen table.</p><p>Think about what I said.</p><p>Jack misses you.</p><p>Call him.</p><p>Mom</p><p>Jack. Olivia hadn\u2019t give him a thought since she\u2019d left for the hospital. In fact, she\u2019d had a perfectly wonderful time reminiscing with Stan. All of a sudden she wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted anymore. All of a sudden there was more to think about than she\u2019d realized. If her ex-husband wanted back in her life, then maybe she should let him. Maybe she should consider all her options. Maybe it wasn\u2019t too late for her and Stan....</p><p>Getting ready for bed, Olivia thought about her divorce, and the couple she\u2019d seen earlier that morning came to mind. Her decision to take them at their word and force them to put their children first had been a bold one. The kids were to stay in the home, and the parents would move in and out. Everyone who lived at 311 Pelican Court</p><p>would be going through a big adjustment and for the sake of their children, she sincerely hoped they could make it work.</p><p>As for her...well, Olivia would watch and wait. She\u2019d see how things went at 311 Pelican Court\u2014and she\u2019d be keeping an eye on events at 204 Rosewood Lane, too. Just making sure that Grace continued to regain her confidence, her emotional equilibrium.</p><p>And with two men in her own life, who could tell what might happen at 16 Lighthouse Road? </p> </body></html>"]
