It was far too easy to be overwhelmed by the sights, sounds, and smells of a masquerade. The dazzling array of vibrant fabrics and frothy lace . . . the multitude of voices attempting to be heard over an industrious orchestra . . . the mingling scents of various perfumes and burnt wax from the massive chandeliers . . .</p><p>But Amelia was not like other women. She had lived the first sixteen years of her life under guard, her every movement watched with precision. It was a unique sensation to be examined so closely. She could not mistake the feeling for anything else.</p><p>However, she could say with some certainty that she had never been so closely scrutinized by a man quite so . . . compelling.</p> <p>For he was compelling, despite the distance between them and the concealment of the upper half of his face. His form alone arrested her attention. He stood tall and well proportioned, his garments beautifully tailored to cling to muscular thighs and broad shoulders.</p><p>She reached a corner and turned, setting their respective positions at an angle. Amelia paused there, taking the opportunity to raise her mask to surround her eyes, the gaily colored ribbons that adorned the stick falling down her gloved arm. Pretending to watch the dancers, she was in truth watching him and cataloguing his person. It was only fair, in her opinion. If he could enjoy an unhindered view, so could she.</p><p>He was drenched in black, the only relief being his snowy white stockings, cravat, and shirt. And the mask. So plain. Unadorned by paint or feathers. Secured to his head with black satin ribbon. While the other gentlemen in attendance were dressed in an endless range of colors to attract attention, this man\u2019s stark severity seemed designed to blend into the shadows. To make him unremarkable, which he could never be. Beneath the light of hundreds of candles, his dark hair gleamed with vitality and begged a woman to run her fingers through it.</p><p>And then there was his mouth . . .</p><p>Amelia inhaled sharply at the sight of it. His mouth was sin incarnate. Sculpted by a master hand, the lips neither full nor thin, but firm. Shamelessly sensual. Framed by a strong chin, chiseled jaw, and swarthy skin. A foreigner, perhaps. She could only imagine how the face would look as a whole. Devastating to a woman\u2019s equanimity, she suspected.</p><p>But it was more than his physical attributes that intrigued her. It was the way he moved, like a predator, his gait purposeful and yet seductive, his attention sharply focused. He did not mince his steps or affect the veneer of boredom so esteemed by Society. This man knew what he wanted and lacked the patience to pretend otherwise.</p> <p>At present it appeared that what he wanted was to follow her. He watched Amelia with a gaze so intensely hot, she felt it move across her body, felt it run through the unpowdered strands of her hair and dance across her bared nape. Felt it glide across her bared shoulders and down the length of her spine. Coveting.</p><p>She could not begin to guess how she had attracted his attention. While she knew she was pretty enough, she was not any more attractive than most of the other women here. Her gown, while lovely with its elaborate silver lace underskirts and delicate flowers made of pink and green ribbon, was not the most riveting on display. And she was usually disregarded by those seeking a romantic connection, because her long-standing friendship with the popular Earl of Ware was widely assumed to be leading to the altar. Albeit very slowly.</p><p>So what did this man want with her? Why didn\u2019t he approach her?</p><p>Amelia canted her body to face him and lowered her mask, staring at him directly so he would not have to wonder if she was looking at him. She left him no doubt, hoping his long legs would resume their deliberate stride and bring him to her. She wanted to experience all the details of him\u2014the sound of his voice, the scent of his cologne, the impact of proximity to his powerful frame.</p><p>Then she wished to know what he wanted. Amelia had lived the entirety of her motherless childhood being secreted from place to place, her governesses changed often so that no emotional attachment could form, she was cut off from her sibling and anyone who might care for her. Because of this, she distrusted the unknown. This man\u2019s interest was an anomaly, and it needed to be explained.</p><p>Her silent challenge caused a sudden, visible tension to grip his body. He stared back, his eyes glittering from the shadows of the mask. Long moments passed, time she barely registered because she was so focused on his response to her. Guests walked past him, momentarily obstructing her view and then revealing him again. His fists clenched along with his jaw. She saw his chest expand with a deep breath\u2014</p><p>\u2014just as she was bumped roughly from behind.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Miss Benbridge.\u201d</p> <p>Startled, her gaze turned to identify the offending individual and found a wigged man wearing puce satin. She muttered a quick dismissal of his concern, managed a brief smile, and swiftly returned her attention to the masked man.</p><p>Who was gone.</p><p>She blinked rapidly. Gone. Lifting to her tiptoes, Amelia frantically searched the sea of people. He was tall and blessed with an impressive breadth of shoulder. His lack of a wig provided an additional means of identification, but she could not find him.</p><p>Where did he go?</p><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d</p><p>The low, cultured drawl at her shoulder was dearly familiar, and she shot a quick, distracted glance at the handsome man who drew abreast of her. \u201cYes, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d The Earl of Ware mimicked her pose, craning his neck in much the same fashion. Any other man would have looked ridiculous, but not Ware. It was impossible for him to appear anything less than perfect from the top of his wigged head down to his diamond-studded heels six feet below. \u201cWould it be too much to hope that you were looking for me?\u201d</p><p>Smiling sheepishly, Amelia abandoned her visual hunt and linked her arm with his. \u201cI was seeking a phantom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA phantom?\u201d Through the eyeholes of his painted mask, his blue eyes laughed at her. Ware had two expressions\u2014one of dangerous boredom and one of warm amusement. She was the only person in his life capable of inspiring the latter. \u201cWas this a frightening specter? Or something more interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not certain. He was following me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll men follow you, love,\u201d he said with a faint curve to his lips. \u201cAt the very least with their gazes, if not with their legs.\u201d</p><p>Amelia squeezed his arm in gentle admonishment. \u201cYou tease me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d He arched one arrogant brow. \u201cYou often appear lost in a world of your own making. It is supremely appealing to men to see a woman content with herself. We long to slip inside her and join her.\u201d</p><p>The intimate timbre of Ware\u2019s voice was not lost on Amelia. She glanced up at him from beneath her lashes. \u201cNaughty man.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and the guests around them stared. So did she. Merriment transformed the earl from the epitome of an ennui afflicted aristocrat to a vibrantly attractive man.</p><p>Ware began to stroll, expertly carrying her along with him. She had known him for six years now, having met him when he was ten and eight. She\u2019d watched him grow into the man he was today, watched him take his first steps into liaisons and the way relations with women had changed him, although none of his inamoratas held his attention long. They saw only his exterior and the marquessate he would rule upon his father\u2019s passing. Perhaps he could have lived with that depth of interest, if he had not met her first. But they had met, and become the closest of friends. Now lesser connections displeased him. He kept mistresses to relieve his physical needs, but he kept her close to see to his emotional ones.</p><p>They would marry, she knew. It was unspoken between them, yet understood. Ware simply waited for the day when she would finally be ready to step beyond the boundaries of friendship and into his bed. She loved him for that patience, even though she was not in love with him. Amelia wished she could be; she wished it every day. But she loved another, and while death had stolen him from her, her heart stayed true.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your thoughts now?\u201d Ware asked, his head tilting in acknowledgment of another guest\u2019s greeting.</p><p>\u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, lovely,\u201d he purred, his eyes lit with pleasure. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am thinking that I shall enjoy being married to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm . . . well, we are getting closer. I take some comfort in that.\u201d</p><p>She studied him carefully. \u201cAre you growing impatient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wait.\u201d</p><p>The answer was vague, and Amelia frowned.</p><p>\u201cNo fretting,\u201d Ware admonished gently, leading her out a pair of open French doors to a crowded terrace. \u201cI am content for now, so long as you are.\u201d</p><p>The cool evening breeze blew across her skin, and she inhaled deeply. \u201cYou are not being entirely truthful.\u201d</p><p>Amelia came to a halt at the wide marble railing and faced him. Several couples stood nearby, engaging in various conversations, but all were casting curious glances in their direction. Despite the shadows created by the cloud-covered moon, Ware\u2019s cream-colored jacket and breeches gleamed like ivory and enticed admiring perusals.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the place to discuss something as auspicious as our future,\u201d he said, reaching up to untie his mask. He removed it, revealing a profile so noble it should have graced a coin.</p><p>\u201cYou know that will not dissuade me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that is why I like you so well.\u201d His slow smile teased her. \u201cMy life is regimented and compartmentalized. Everything is orderly and firmly in its place. I know my role and I fulfill the expectations of Society exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for courting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for courting you,\u201d he agreed. His gloved hand found hers and held it. He adjusted his stance to hide the scandalous contact from the curious. \u201cYou are my fair princess, rescued from her turret tower by an infamous pirate. The daughter of a viscount hanged for treason and sister to a true femme fatale, a woman widely considered to have murdered two husbands before marrying one too dangerous to kill. You are my folly, my aberration, my peccadillo.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his thumb across her palm, making her shiver. \u201cBut I serve the opposite purpose in your life. I am your anchor. You cling to me because I am safe and comfortable.\u201d His gaze lifted to look over her head at the others who shared the terrace with them. He bent closer and murmured, \u201cBut on occasion, I remember the young girl who so boldly demanded a first kiss from me, and I wish I had responded differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>Ware nodded.</p><p>\u201cHave I changed so much since then?\u201d</p><p>With his mask dangling from one hand and her hand captured in the other, he turned abruptly and led her down the nearby flight of stairs to the garden. A gravel pathway bordered low yew hedges, which in turn bordered a lush center lawn and impressive fountain.</p><p>\u201cThe passing of time changes all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it was the passing of your dear Colin that changed you the most.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Colin\u2019s name affected Amelia deeply, provoking feelings of overwhelming sadness and regret. He had been her dearest friend, who later became the love of her heart. He was the nephew of her coachman and a Gypsy, but in her sheltered world they were equals. They had been playmates as children, then found their interest in each other changing. Deepening. Becoming less innocent.</p><p>Colin had matured into a young man whose exotic beauty and quiet strength of character had stirred her in ways she had not been prepared for. Thoughts of him had ruled her days, and dreams of stolen kisses had tormented her nights. He had been wiser than she, understanding that it was impossible for a peer\u2019s daughter and a stableboy to ever be together. He had pushed her away, pretended to feel nothing for her, and broken her adolescent heart.</p><p>But in the end he had died for her.</p><p>Her silent exhale was shaky. Sometimes, just before she drifted into sleep, she permitted herself to think of him. She opened her heart and let the memories out\u2014stolen kisses in the woods, passionate longing and budding desire. She had never felt that depth of emotion again and knew she never would. Some childish infatuations faded away. Her love for Colin had been built with firmer stuff, and it stayed with her. No longer a raging fire, but a softer warmth. Adoration enhanced by gratefulness for his sacrifice. Trapped between her father\u2019s men and agents of the Crown, she could have been killed had Colin not spirited her away. A reckless, love-fueled rescue that had delivered her to safety at the cost of his precious life.</p><p>\u201cYou are thinking of him again,\u201d Ware murmured.</p><p>\u201cAm I so transparent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs clear as glass.\u201d He squeezed her hand, and she smiled fondly.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you think my reticence stems from my lingering affection for Colin, but it is my affection for you that restrains me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Amelia could see that she had surprised him. They turned back toward the manse, following the subtle urging of the path. Brilliant light and the glorious strains of stringed instruments spilled out in abundance from the many open doorways, enticing strolling guests to linger close to the festivities. Others wended their way through the rear garden as they did, but all resisted straying too far.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. I worry that perhaps I will steal you from your great love.\u201d</p><p>Ware laughed softly. \u201cHow fanciful you are.\u201d He grinned and looked so handsome, she gazed a moment longer to admire him. \u201cI admit to curious musings when you wear that faraway look, but that is the extent of my interest in affairs of the heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have no notion of what you are missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me for being callous, but if what I am missing is the melancholy that clings to you, I want none of it. It is attractive on you and lends you an air of mystery that I find irresistible. Sadly, I fear I would not fare so well. I suspect I would appear wretched, and we cannot have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Earl of Ware wretched?\u201d</p><p>He gave a mock shudder. \u201cQuite impossible, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you see, you are perfect for me, Amelia. I enjoy your company. I enjoy your honesty and our ability to converse freely about nearly everything. There is no uncertainty or fear of reprisal for a careless act. You cannot hurt me, and I cannot hurt you, because we do not attribute actions to emotions that are not there. If I am thoughtless, it is not because I seek to injure you, and you know this. Our association is one I will appreciate and value until I take my last breath.\u201d</p><p>Ware paused when they reached the bottom step that would lead them back up to the terrace. Their brief spell of privacy was nearly at an end. Her desire to spend unhindered time with him was an added impetus to marriage. It was only the sexual congress that would end their evenings that she resisted.</p><p>The memory of feverishly exchanged kisses with Colin haunted her, and she could not bring herself to risk disappointment with Ware. She dreaded the possibility of awkwardness intruding on their closeness. The earl was comely and charming and perfect. How would he look when he was flushed and disheveled? What sounds would he make? How would he move? What would he expect of her?</p><p>It was apprehension that goaded these ponderings, not anticipation.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what of the sex?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His head swiveled toward her, and he froze with his foot poised above the step. The depth of his blue eyes sparkled with merriment. Ware backed down from the stair and faced her directly. \u201cWhat of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not worry that it will be . . . ?\u201d She struggled to find the correct word.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d There was a wealth of assurance in the negation.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I think about sex with you there is no worry involved. Eagerness, yes. Anxiety, no.\u201d He closed the small gap between them and bent over her. His voice came as an intimate whisper. \u201cDo not hesitate for that reason. We are young. We can wed and wait, or we can wait and then wed. Even with my ring on your finger, I will not ask you to do anything you do not wish to. Not yet.\u201d His mouth twitched. \u201cIn a few years, however, I may not be so accommodating. I must reproduce eventually, and I do find you supremely alluring.\u201d</p> <p>Amelia tilted her head, considering. Then she nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ware said with obvious satisfaction. \u201cProgress, however incremental, is always good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is time to post the banns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God, that is more than an incremental move forward!\u201d he cried with exaggerated verve. \u201cWe are actually getting somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and he winked mischievously.</p><p>\u201cWe will be happy together,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Ware took a moment to once again secure his mask, and her gaze wandered as she waited. Following the line of the marble railing, she found a profusion of ivy climbing the brick exterior. That visual trail led to another terrace farther down, this one unlit in an obvious gambit to deter guests from lingering away from the ballroom. It appeared, however, that the lack of welcome was too subtle for two attendees, or perhaps they simply did not care to heed it. Regardless, the reason why they were there was not what caught Amelia\u2019s attention. She was more interested in who was there.</p> <p>Despite the deep shadows that blanketed the second patio, she recognized her phantom follower by the pure white of his mask and the way his garments and hair blended into the night around him.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she murmured, reaching out blindly to clutch Ware\u2019s arm. \u201cDo you see those gentlemen over there?\u201d</p><p>She felt his attention turn as she directed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dark-clad gentleman is the one who held such interest in me earlier.\u201d</p><p>The earl looked at her in all seriousness. \u201cYou made light of the matter, but now I am concerned. Was this man an annoyance to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her gaze narrowed as the two men parted and set off in opposite directions\u2014the phantom away from her, the other man toward her.</p><p>\u201cYet something about him disturbs you.\u201d Ware rearranged her grasping hand to rest upon his forearm. \u201cAnd his assignation over there is curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite the years that have passed since you were freed from your father\u2019s care, I feel caution would be wise. When one has an infamous criminal for a relation, every unknown is suspect. We cannot have odd characters following you about.\u201d Ware led her quickly up the steps. \u201cPerhaps you should stay close to me for the remainder of the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no cause to fear him,\u201d she argued without heat. \u201cI think it is more my reaction to him that surprises me, as opposed to his interest in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a reaction to him?\u201d Ware paused just inside the door and drew her to the side, out of the way of those who entered and exited. \u201cWhat sort of reaction?\u201d</p><p>Amelia lifted her mask to her face. How could she explain that she had admired the man\u2019s powerful frame and presence without lending more weight to the sentiment than it deserved? \u201cI was intrigued. I wished he would approach me and reveal himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be concerned that another man so quickly captured your imagination?\u201d The earl\u2019s drawling voice was laced with amusement.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled. The comfort of their friendship was priceless to her. \u201cJust as I do not worry when you take interest in other females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Ware.\u201d</p><p>They both turned to face the gentleman who approached, a person whose distinctively short and portly frame made him recognizable despite his mask\u2014Sir Harold Bingham, a Bow Street magistrate.</p><p>\u201cSir Harold,\u201d Ware greeted in return.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Miss Benbridge,\u201d the magistrate said, smiling in his kindly way. He was known for his tough rulings, but was widely considered to be fair and wise.</p><p>Amelia quite liked him, and the warmth of her returning pleasantries reflected this.</p><p>Ware leaned toward her, lowering his voice for her ears only. \u201cWill you excuse me a moment? I should like to discuss your admirer with him. Perhaps we can learn an identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The two gentlemen moved a short distance away, and Amelia\u2019s gaze drifted over the ballroom, seeking out familiar faces. She spotted a small grouping of acquaintances nearby and set off in that direction.</p><p>After several steps she stopped, frowning.</p><p>She wanted to know who was behind the white mask. The curiosity was eating at her, niggling at the back of her mind and making her restless. There was such intensity in the way he had looked at her, and the moment when their eyes had met lingered in her thoughts.</p><p>Turning abruptly on her heel, she again walked outside and down the steps into the rear garden. There were many other guests about, all seeking relief from the crush. Rather than going straight along the path she had taken with Ware or to the right where the second terrace waited in the dark, she turned to the left. A few feet off to the side, a marble reproduction of Venus graced a semicircular space filled with a half-moon bench. It was bordered by the same low, perfectly shaped yew hedges that surrounded the lawn and fountain, and it was presently unoccupied.</p><p>Amelia paused near the statue and whistled a distinctive warble that would bring her brother-in-law\u2019s men out of hiding. She was guarded still, and suspected she would always be. It was an inevitable consequence of being the sister-in-law of a known pirate and smuggler such as Christopher St. John.</p><p>At times she resented the inherent lack of privacy that came with having one\u2019s every movement watched. She could not help but wish that her life was simple enough to make such precautions unnecessary. But at other times, such as tonight, she found relief in the unseen protection. She was never left exposed, which enabled her to view her phantom in a different light. Having St. John\u2019s men nearby also afforded her the opportunity to elicit help in relieving her curiosity.</p><p>Her foot tapped impatiently atop the gravel as she waited. That was why she did not hear the man\u2019s approach. She did, however, feel him. The hairs on her nape tingled with awareness, and she turned swiftly with a soft gasp of surprise.</p><p>He stood just barely within the entrance of the circle, a tall, dark form that vibrated with a potent energy that seemed barely restrained. Beneath the pale light of the moon, the man\u2019s inky locks gleamed like a raven\u2019s wing, and his eyes glittered with the very intensity that had goaded her to seek him out. He wore a full cape, the gray satin lining providing a striking backdrop to his black garments, enabling her to fully appreciate the size and power of his frame.</p><p>\u201cI was looking for you,\u201d she said softly, her chin lifting.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Her phantom\u2019s voice was deep, low, and distinctly accented. Foreign, which complemented his swarthy complexion.</p><p>\u201cDo not fear me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish only to apologize for my lack of manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not frightened,\u201d she replied, her gaze darting past his shoulder to where other guests were clearly visible.</p><p>He stepped aside and bowed, gesturing her out with a grand sweep of his arm.</p><p>\u201cThat is all you have to say to me?\u201d she asked, as she realized that he intended for them to part.</p><p>His beautiful mouth pursed slightly. \u201cShould there be more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Amelia frowned and glanced away a moment, trying to gather her thoughts into coherent words. It was difficult to think clearly when he stood in such close proximity. What had been compelling at a distance was nearly overwhelming now. He was so somber. . . . She had not expected that.</p><p>\u201cI do not mean to detain you,\u201d he murmured, his tone soothing.</p><p>\u201cLack of manners,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes. I was staring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. I am not upset.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to take some action. When he stepped out of the small circle and again gestured toward the main part of the rear garden, she shook her head in denial. Her mouth curved at his apparent haste to be rid of her.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Miss Amelia Benbridge.\u201d</p><p>The man stilled visibly, his only movement the lift and fall of his chest. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he showed a leg in a courtly bow and said, \u201cA pleasure, Miss Benbridge. I am Count Reynaldo Montoya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontoya,\u201d she breathed, testing the name on her tongue. \u201cSpanish, yet your accent is French.\u201d</p><p>His head lifted, and he studied her closely, his gaze caressing the length of her body from the top of her elaborate coiffure down to her kid slippers. \u201cYour surname is English, yet your features are enhanced by a foreign touch,\u201d he pointed out in rebuttal.</p><p>\u201cMy mother was Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are enchanting.\u201d</p><p>Amelia inhaled sharply, startled by how the simple compliment affected her. She heard such platitudes daily, and they held as much meaning as a comment on the weather. But Montoya\u2019s delivery altered the words, imbuing them with feeling and an underlying urgency.</p><p>\u201cIt appears I must apologize again,\u201d the count said, with a self-deprecating smile. \u201cAllow me to escort you back before I make a further fool of myself.\u201d</p><p>She reached out to him, then caught herself and clutched the stick of her mask with both hands instead. \u201cYour cloak . . . Are you departing?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and the tension in the air between them heightened. There was no reason for him to linger, and yet she sensed that they both wanted him to.</p><p>Something was holding him back.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cYou have not yet asked me to dance or flirted with me or made a casual remark about where you intend to be in the future so that we might find one another again.\u201d</p><p>Montoya reentered the small circle. \u201cYou are too bold, Miss Benbridge,\u201d he admonished gruffly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are a coward.\u201d</p><p>He drew up sharply just a few inches from her.</p><p>A cool evening breeze blew across the top of her shoulder, carrying with it one of the long, artful curls that hung down her back. The count\u2019s gaze focused on the glossy lock, then drifted over the swell of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou look at me as a man looks at his mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d His voice had lowered, grown softer, the accent more pronounced. It was a lover\u2019s tone, or a seducer\u2019s. She felt it move over her skin like a tactile caress, and she relished the experience. It was rather like exiting a warm house on a frosty day. The sudden impact of sensation was startling and stole one\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know that look, Miss Benbridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a great many things. However, since you have decided not to acquaint yourself with me, you will never know what they are.\u201d</p><p>His arms crossed his chest. It was a challenging pose, yet it made her smile, because it signaled his intent to stay. At least for a short while longer. \u201cAnd what of Lord Ware?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, for all intents and purposes, betrothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I am.\u201d She noted how his jaw tensed. \u201cDo you have a grievance with Lord Ware?\u201d</p><p>The count did not reply.</p><p>She began tapping her foot again. \u201cWe are having visceral reactions to one another, Count Montoya. As attractive as you are, I would venture to say that you are accustomed to snaring women\u2019s interest. For my part, I can say with absolute certainty that a similar situation has never happened to me before. Stunning men do not follow me about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of someone I used to know,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cA woman I cared for deeply.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Try as she might, Amelia could not hide her disappointment. He had thought she was someone else. His interest was not in her, but in a woman who looked like her.</p><p>Turning away, she sank onto the small bench, absently arranging her skirts for comfort. Her hands occupied themselves with twirling her mask between gloved fingertips.</p><p>\u201cIt is my turn to apologize to you.\u201d Her head tilted back so that their gazes met. \u201cI have put you in an awkward position, and goaded you to stay when you wanted to go.\u201d</p><p>The contemplative cant to his head made her wish she could see the features beneath the pearlescent mask. Despite the lack of a complete visual picture, she found him remarkably attractive\u2014the purring rumble of his voice . . . the luscious shape of his lips . . . the unshakable confidence of his bearing . . .</p> <p>But then he was not truly unshakable. She was affecting him in ways a stranger should not be able to. And he was affecting her equally.</p><p>\u201cThat was not what you wished to hear,\u201d he noted, stepping closer.</p><p>Her gaze strayed to his boots, watching as his cape fluttered around them. Dressed as he was, he was imposing, but she was unafraid.</p><p>Amelia waved one hand in a careless affectation of dismissal, unsure of what to say. He was correct; she was too bold. But she was not brazen enough to admit outright that she found the thought of his interest gratifying. \u201cI hope you find the woman you are looking for,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid that isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was lost to me many years ago.\u201d</p><p>Recognizing the yearning in his words, she sympathized. \u201cI am sorry for your loss. I, too, have lost someone dear to me and know how it feels.\u201d</p><p>Montoya took a seat beside her. The bench was small, and due to its curvature it forced them to sit near enough that her skirts touched his cape. It was improper for them to be seated so close to each other, yet she did not protest. Instead she breathed deeply and discovered he smelled like sandalwood and citrus. Crisp, earthy, and virile. Like the man himself.</p><p>\u201cYou are too young to suffer as I do,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate death. It has no scruples and disregards the age of those left behind.\u201d</p> <p>The ribbons that graced the stick of her mask fluttered gently in the soft breeze and came to rest atop his gloved hand. The sight of the lavender, pink, and pale blue satin against his stark black riveted her attention.</p><p>How would they look to passersby? Her voluminous silver lace and gay multicolored flowers next to his complete lack of any color at all.</p><p>\u201cYou should not be out here alone,\u201d he said, rubbing her ribbons between his thumb and index finger. He could not feel them through his gloves, which made the action sensual, as if the lure of fondling something that belonged to her was irresistible.</p><p>\u201cI am accustomed to solitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not an answer.\u201d</p><p>Amelia looked at him, noting the many details one can see only in extreme proximity to another. Montoya had long, thick lashes surrounding almond-shaped eyes. They were beautiful. Exotic. Knowing. Accented by shadows that came from within as well as from without.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was she like?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe woman you thought I was.\u201d</p><p>The barest hint of a smile betrayed the possibility of dimples. \u201cI asked you a question first,\u201d he said.</p><p>She heaved a dramatic sigh just to see more of that teasing curve of his lips. He never set his smile completely free. She wondered why, and she wondered how she might see it. \u201cVery well, Count Montoya. In answer to your query, yes, I enjoy being alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany people find being alone intolerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have no imagination. I, on the other hand, have too much imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He canted his body toward her. The pose caused his doeskin breeches to stretch tautly across the powerful muscles of his thighs. With the gray satin spread out beneath him in contrast, she could see every nuance and plane, every hard length of sinew. \u201cWhat do you imagine?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing hard, Amelia found she could not look away from the view. It was a lascivious glance she was giving him, her interest completely carnal.</p><p>\u201cUmm . . .\u201d She tore her gaze upward, dazed by the direction of her own thoughts. \u201cStories. Faery tales and such.\u201d</p><p>With the half mask hiding his features she couldn\u2019t be certain, but she thought he might have arched a brow at her. \u201cDo you write them down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have asked far too many questions without answering my one.\u201d</p><p>Montoya\u2019s dark eyes glittered with warm amusement. \u201cAre we keeping score?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI am simply following the rules you set.\u201d</p><p>There! A dimple. She saw it.</p><p>\u201cShe was audacious,\u201d he murmured, \u201clike you.\u201d</p><p>Amelia blushed and looked away, smitten with that tiny groove in his cheek. \u201cDid you like that about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved that about her.\u201d</p><p>The intimate pitch to his voice made her shiver.</p><p>He stood and held his hand out to her. \u201cYou are cold, Miss Benbridge. You should go inside.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cWill you go inside with me?\u201d</p><p>The count shook his head.</p><p>Extending her arm, she set her fingers within his palm and allowed him to assist her to her feet. His hand was large and warm, his grasp strong and sure. She was reluctant to release him and was pleased when he seemed to feel similarly. They stood there for a long moment, touching, the only sound their gentle inhalations and subsequent exhales . . . until the gentle, haunting strains of the minuet drifted out on the night zephyr.</p><p>Montoya\u2019s grip tightened and his breathing faltered. She knew his thoughts traveled along the same path as hers. Lifting her mask to her face, Amelia lowered into a deep curtsy.</p><p>\u201cOne dance,\u201d she urged softly when he did not move. \u201cDance with me as if I were the woman you miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d There was a heartbeat\u2019s hesitation, and then he bowed over her hand. \u201cI would rather dance with you.\u201d</p><p>Touched, her throat tightened, cutting off any reply she might have made. She could only rise and begin the steps, approaching him and then retreating. Spinning slowly and then circling him. The crunching of the gravel beneath her feet overpowered the music, but Amelia heard it in her mind and hummed the notes. He joined her, his deep voice creating a rich accompaniment, the combination of sound enchanting her.</p><p>The clouds drifted, allowing a brilliant shaft of moonlight to illuminate their small space. It turned the hedges silver and his mask into a brilliant pearl. The black satin ribbon that restrained his queue blended with the inky locks, the gloss and color so similar they were nearly one and the same. Her skirts brushed against his flowing cape, his cologne mingled with her perfume; together they were lost in a single moment. Amelia was arrested there, ensnared, and wished\u2014briefly\u2014never to be freed.</p><p>Then the unmistakable warble of a birdcall rent the cocoon.</p><p>A warning from St. John\u2019s men.</p><p>Amelia stumbled, and Montoya caught her close. Her arm lowered to her side, taking her mask with it. His breath, warm and scented of brandy, drifted across her lips. The difference in their statures put her breasts at level with his upper abdomen. He would have to bend to kiss her, and she found herself wishing he would, wanting to experience the feel of those beautifully sculpted lips pressed against her own.</p><p>\u201cLord Ware is looking for you,\u201d he whispered, without taking his eyes from her.</p><p>She nodded, but made no effort to free herself. Her gaze stayed locked to his. Watching. Waiting.</p><p>Just when she was certain he wouldn\u2019t, he accepted her silent invitation and brushed his mouth across hers. Their lips clung together and he groaned. The mask fell from her nerveless fingers to clatter atop the gravel.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>He steadied her, then fled in a billowing flare of black, leaping over a low hedge and blending into the shadows. He headed not toward the rear of the manse but to the front, and was gone in an instant. Dazed by his sudden departure, Amelia turned her head slowly toward the garden. She found Ware approaching with rapid strides, followed by several other gentlemen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing over here?\u201d he asked gruffly, scanning her surroundings with an agitated glance. \u201cI was going mad looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry.\u201d She was unable to say more than that. Her thoughts were with Montoya, a man who had clearly recognized the whistle of warning.</p><p>He had been real for a moment, but no longer. Like the phantom she\u2019d fancied him as, he was elusive.</p><p>And entirely suspect.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to explain what happened last night?\u201d</p><p>Amelia sighed inwardly, but on the exterior she offered a sunny smile. \u201cExplain what?\u201d</p><p>Christopher St. John\u2014pirate, murderer, smuggler extraordinaire\u2014returned her smile, but his sapphire eyes were sharp and assessing. \u201cYou know very well what I am referring to.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAt times you are so like your sister, it is somewhat alarming.\u201d</p><p>What was alarming was how divinely handsome St. John was, considering how devilishly his brain worked. Despite the years she\u2019d lived within his household, Amelia was still taken aback by his comeliness every time she saw him.</p><p>\u201cOh, what a lovely thing to say!\u201d she cried, meaning every word. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinx. Fess up now.\u201d</p><p>Any other man would have difficulty prying information out of her that she didn\u2019t wish to share. But when the raspy-voiced pirate became cajoling, he was impossible to resist. With his golden hair and skin, thin yet carnal lips, and jeweled irises, he reminded her of an angel, for certainly only a celestial being could be formed so perfectly from head to toe.</p><p>The only outward sign of his mortality were the lines that rimmed his mouth and eyes, signs of a life that was fraught with stresses. They\u2019d softened a great deal since his marriage to her sister, but they would never fully dissipate.</p><p>\u201cI noted a man\u2019s uncommon interest. He noted that I\u2019d noted, and approached me to explain.\u201d</p><p>Christopher leaned back in his black leather chair and pursed his lips. Behind him was a large window that overlooked the rear garden, or what would have been a rear garden if they\u2019d had one. Instead, they had a flat, brutally trimmed lawn that made stealthy approach of the manse impossible. When one had a great deal of enemies, as St. John did, one could never lower their guard, especially for frivolous aesthetic reasons. \u201cWhat explanation did he offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reminded him of a lost love.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound suspiciously like a snort. \u201cA clever, sentimental ruse that almost embarrassed Ware and caused a terrible scandal. I cannot believe you fell prey to it.\u201d</p><p>Flushing with renewed guilt, she nevertheless protested. \u201cHe was sincere!\u201d She did not believe anyone could pretend melancholy so well. That was not to say that she wasn\u2019t aware of something amiss, but she did believe his emotional response to her.</p><p>\u201cMy men followed him last evening.\u201d</p><p>Amelia nodded, expecting as much. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they lost him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>St. John smiled at her astonishment. \u201cIt\u2019s possible if one is aware that he is being followed and is trained in how to evade shadows.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cThe man is no lovelorn innocent, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>She rose, frowning, which forced St. John to rise as well. Her floral skirts settled around her legs, and she turned to face the rest of the room, lost in thought. Appearances could be deceiving. This room and the criminal who owned it were prime examples. Decorated in shades of red, cream, and gold, the study could belong to a peer of the realm, as could the manse it was a part of. There was nothing here to betray its primary purpose\u2014that of being the headquarters of a large and highly illegal smuggling ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat would he want with me?\u201d she asked, remembering the previous night\u2019s events in crystal clarity. She could still smell the exotic scent of his skin and hear the slight accent to his words that made her insides quiver. Her lips tingled from the press of his, as did her breasts with the memory of the hardness of his abdomen.</p><p>\u201cAnything from a simple warning to me, to something more sinister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d She faced him and found him watching her with knowing eyes.</p><p>\u201cSuch as seducing you and ruining you for Ware. Or seducing you and luring you away to use as leverage against me.\u201d</p><p>The word \u201cseducing\u201d used in conjunction with the mysterious, masked Montoya did odd things to her. It should, perhaps, frighten her, but it didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou know as well as I how fortuitous it is that you met Ware while in your father\u2019s captivity and that he is willing to disregard your scandalous past and familial connections.\u201d His fingers drummed almost silently upon the desktop. \u201cYour son will be a marquess and your children will have every advantage. Anything that jeopardizes your future is cause for concern.\u201d</p><p>Amelia nodded and looked away again, hoping to hide how the reduction of her relationship with Ware to the material benefits made her feel. She was well aware that she stood to gain the most from their union. As Ware\u2019s friend, she wanted only the best for him. Marriage to her was anything but. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not venture off by yourself. If the man approaches you again, do not allow him within a few feet of you.\u201d The severity of his features softened. He wore cerulean blue today, a color that complemented both his tawny coloring and the beautifully embroidered waistcoat that hugged his lean waist. \u201cI do not mean to chastise you. I want only to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But the entirety of her life had been spent in gilded cages. She found herself torn between loving the security of it and resenting the restrictions. She tried to behave, tried to follow the rules set for her, but at times it was difficult to conform. She suspected that was due to her father\u2019s blood in her veins. It was the one thing she most wished to change about herself. \u201cMay I be dismissed? Ware will be along shortly to take me for a ride in the park, and I must change.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course. Enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Christopher watched Amelia leave the room and then resumed his seat, only to stand a moment later when his wife entered in a profusion of pale pink skirts. As always, the sight of her made his heart race with a mixture of attraction and pure joy.</p><p>\u201cYou look a vision this afternoon,\u201d he said, rounding the desk to embrace her. As she had since the moment they had first met, Maria melted against him, a lush warm weight that he adored.</p><p>\u201cYou say that every day,\u201d she murmured, but her smile was filled with pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s true every day.\u201d He cupped her spine and molded her curves to his hardness. They fit together like two matching puzzle pieces, despite their disparity in height.</p><p>Maria shared the same glossy raven tresses as her younger sibling, but that was the extent of their physical similarities. Amelia took after her father, the late Viscount Welton, with his emerald green eyes and tall, slender build. Maria, who gratefully claimed a different pater, took after their Spanish-blooded mother with her sloe eyes, short stature, and full figure.</p><p>St. John and his wife made a striking couple; their contrasting appearances complemented each other in ways oft commented on. But they drew the most attention for their reputations. The former Lady Winter was still known as the \u201cWintry Widow,\u201d a woman who was widely rumored to have murdered her first two husbands. Christopher was her third and last husband, the husband of her heart, and he was frequently celebrated for remaining alive.</p><p>You have survived another night in your wife\u2019s bed, they jested.</p><p>Christopher would smile and say nothing. It wasn\u2019t true, but he would not refute the misconception. Few would understand how he died in her arms every night and was reborn.</p> <p>\u201cI overheard the end of your conversation with Amelia,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you are looking at the situation from the wrong perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d This was where their true similarities lay. As different as they were on the exterior, on the interior they were alarmingly alike, both criminally minded and quite wily. \u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are seeing only what interest the masked man had in Amelia. What of her interest in him? That is where my worry stems.\u201d</p><p>He frowned down at her, absently admiring the artfully arranged curls that tumbled about her ears and shoulders, and her full bosom which swelled enticingly above her low, ribbon-edged bodice. \u201cShe has always been curious. That is how she met Ware to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she allowed this man to kiss her. A stranger. Why? She has been pining for her Gypsy sweetheart all these years and keeps Ware at bay. What was the fascination with this man that goaded such a response in her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d Lowering his head, he took her mouth in a long, luxurious kiss. \u201cWould you mourn for me with such devotion, were I to pass on?\u201d he queried, his lips moving against hers.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maria smiled with the hint of mystery that kept him endlessly enthralled with her.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing or no one could ever take you from me, my darling.\u201d Her small hands brushed over his chest. \u201cI will die alongside you. It is the only way I will allow you to go.\u201d</p><p>Christopher\u2019s heart swelled with love so fierce, it sometimes overwhelmed him. \u201cSo our young Amelia was drawn to this man in ways she has not been to anyone else. What do you suggest we do about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch her more closely, and find that man. I want to know him and his intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He smiled. \u201cHave you any plans for the rest of this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m quite busy.\u201d</p><p>He hoped he hid his disappointment. While he had a great many items on his list of things to accomplish, he would not have minded an hour or two of his wife\u2019s company. There was something delicious about making love in the middle of the day with the drapes thrown wide and the sun shining in. Especially when she took the top and writhed above him in the daylight.</p> <p>Sighing dramatically, Christopher released her. \u201cEnjoy yourself, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on you.\u201d Her dark eyes shined wickedly. \u201cYou see, my schedule says \u2018lovemaking\u2019 from two to four. I will need your help to accomplish that task.\u201d</p><p>Christopher was instantly aroused. \u201cI am at your service, madam.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back and glanced down at the front of his breeches. \u201cYes, I see that you are. Shall we retire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like that,\u201d he purred, his blood hot.</p><p>A knock intruded from the open doorway. They both looked over.</p><p>\u201cHello, Tim,\u201d Maria said, smiling at the giant whose great head was ducked to fit beneath the threshold.</p><p>He bowed in greeting, then rumbled, \u201cDid you still wish to speak with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tim was one of Christopher\u2019s most trusted lieutenants. He was also infinitely patient and had a way with women. His fondness for the fairer gender was obvious. They sensed it and were far more open with him than they were with other men. They listened to and trusted him, which would facilitate keeping Amelia in line.</p><p>Christopher looked down into Maria\u2019s uplifted face. \u201cDon\u2019t undress,\u201d he whispered for her ears only. \u201cI want to unwrap you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019m a gift,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cYou are. My most prized possession.\u201d Kissing the tip of her nose, he stepped back from her. \u201cI must discuss Tim\u2019s new assignment to watch Amelia.\u201d</p><p>Her answering smile was a sight to behold. \u201cYou are so clever to anticipate my concerns. You never require my input in matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d he refuted, \u201cand I value it.\u201d His voice lowered with promise. \u201cShortly, I shall show you how much.\u201d</p><p>Maria\u2019s fingertips brushed along his palm as she moved away and their hands separated. \u201cSee you at dinner, Tim,\u201d she said, sashaying past him as he entered the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Tim looked at Christopher with a wry smile. \u201cI know that look. This will be quick, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Very. I want you to shadow Miss Benbridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2019eard about last night. No worries. She\u2019s in good \u2019ands with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not ask you if I weren\u2019t confident in that.\u201d Christopher patted him on the shoulder as he headed out the door. \u201cSee you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky bastard,\u201d Tim said after him.</p><p>Christopher grinned and sprinted up the stairs.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>France, a month earlier</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Simon Quinn said, setting his fork down. \u201cThe time has come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has.\u201d And not a moment too soon in Colin Mitchell\u2019s estimation. He\u2019d waited years for this day. Now that it had arrived, he found that sitting decorously at the table for dinner was nigh impossible. In mere hours he would set sail for England and the love of his life. He wished he were already there. With her.</p><p>All around them, revelry was the order of the day. Although raised in a boisterous Gypsy camp, Colin preferred quiet evenings. It was Quinn who sought out these loud venues. He claimed they made eavesdropping impossible and solidified their carefully affected mien of ennui and nonchalance, but Colin suspected the predilection was goaded by another reason entirely. Quinn was not a happy man, and it was easier to feign contentment when surrounded by gaiety.</p><p>Still, this establishment was one Colin tolerated better than most. It was clean, well lit, and the food was delicious. Three massive chandeliers hung from the wooden-beamed ceiling above them, and the air was redolent of various appetizing dishes and the perfumes of the many buxom serving wenches. Raucous laughter and a multitude of conversations fought to be heard over the frenetically playing orchestra in the far corner, which left them in relative privacy among the din, just two finely attired gentlemen enjoying an evening meal out.</p><p>\u201cI had thought you might have grown beyond your feelings for the fair Amelia,\u201d Quinn said with a faint hint of his Irish brogue still evident. He lifted a glass of wine to his lips and studied Colin carefully above the rim. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed a great deal from the young man who came to me searching for her so many years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Colin knew Quinn did not want him to go. He was too valuable a player in Quinn\u2019s games. He could become anyone, anywhere. Men trusted him and women found him irresistible. Perceptive creatures, they sensed that his heart was locked away, and it made them try harder to win him. \u201cBut that is one part of me that has not changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she has changed. She was a girl when you left her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe changed while I knew her.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt only deepened my feelings.\u201d How could he explain all of the many facets he had seen in her over the years?</p><p>\u201cWhat allure does she possess that enslaves you so? The contessa adores you, and yet she is merely a diversion to you.\u201d</p><p>A vision of the lovely Francesca came to mind, and Colin smiled. \u201cAs I am a diversion to her. She enjoys the game, never knowing who will appear at her doorstep or which disguise I will be hidden beneath. I suit her reckless inclinations, but those extend only to the bedroom. She is too proud a woman to accept a man of my breeding in a capacity other than the one I fill presently.\u201d</p><p>Once, on assignment for Quinn, Colin had been chased into the first open door he\u2019d come to during a ball. The room had been occupied by Francesca, who was adjusting her appearance and enjoying a small respite from the crush. He had bowed, smiled, and proceeded to divest himself of wig and clothing, turning his specially tailored garments inside out. The contessa had found the act of changing from a white-haired, black-clad gentleman to a dark-haired, ivory-clad rogue quite diverting. She\u2019d eagerly assumed the ruse of his companion, exiting to the hallway with her hand firmly attached to his forearm, which effectively stumped the two scowling gentlemen who stumbled upon them in their search.</p><p>She\u2019d taken him to her bed that night and kept him there the last two years, unconcerned when his employment forced him to leave her for weeks or months at a time. Theirs was an affair of convenience and mutual understanding.</p><p>I sometimes envy the woman who has such a tenacious hold on your heart, she once said to him.</p><p>Colin had swiftly turned the direction of her thoughts elsewhere. He could not bear to think of Amelia while in the company of another woman. It felt like a betrayal, and he knew from experience that Amelia would be deeply wounded.</p><p>\u201cAmelia holds the same allure for me as her sibling holds for you,\u201d Colin said, meeting Quinn\u2019s widening eyes. \u201cPerhaps if you can explain to me why you still pine for Maria, it will help to answer your question regarding my feelings for Amelia.\u201d</p><p>A self-deprecating smile curved the Irishman\u2019s mouth. \u201cPoint taken. Will you return to her as Colin Mitchell or as one of your other aliases?\u201d</p><p>Heaving out his breath, Colin glanced around the dining parlor at the many guests and overtly friendly serving staff. To Amelia, he was a part of her past . . . a deceased part of her past. A childhood friend who had grown into a young man who loved her with every breath in his body. She had loved him similarly, with the same wild, saturating, unrestrained adolescent passion. He had tried to stay away, tried to push her away, tried to convince himself that they would both grow beyond such impossible aspirations. As he was a Gypsy and a stableboy in her father\u2019s employ, there was no possibility of a future between them.</p><p>In the end, he had been unable to keep his distance. Her father, the late Viscount Welton, had been the worst sort of monster. Welton had used Amelia as leverage against her sister, selling the stunningly beautiful Maria to marriage-minded peers, whom he then killed for the widow\u2019s settlements. When Welton\u2019s machinations put Amelia in danger, Colin had attempted a daring rescue during which he\u2019d been shot and left for dead.</p><p>How did one rise from the grave? And once he managed that task, would she accept him back into her life in the role he wished to fill\u2014that of lover and husband?</p><p>\u201cIf she will have me, she will be the Countess Montoya,\u201d he said, referring to the title he had invented expressly for her. Over the years he\u2019d built and strengthened the roots of that assumed nobility, purchasing properties and establishing wealth under that guise. He would not have her married to the common Colin Mitchell. She deserved better. \u201cBut perhaps it is her attachment to Colin that will win her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will miss you,\u201d Quinn said, his blue-eyed gaze pensive. \u201cIn fact, I am not certain how I will manage without you.\u201d</p><p>Quinn had been enlisted by agents of the Crown of England to manage tasks more cautious agents wouldn\u2019t. He was not \u201cofficially\u201d recognized, nor was Colin, which freed them both from the restrictions under which others labored. In return for their unacknowledged efforts, they kept most of the spoils, which made them exceptionally wealthy.</p><p>\u201cYou will find a way,\u201d Colin said, smiling. \u201cYou always do. You still have Cartland. In some respects, he is far more accomplished than I. He can track better than a canine. If something is lost, he is the best man to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my concerns about him.\u201d Quinn rested his elbows on the carved wooden arms of his chair and steepled his fingers together.</p><p>\u201cOh? You never said as much to me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were still in my employ then. Now I can speak to you as a friend who shares a joint past.\u201d</p><p>The logic to that was odd, but Colin played along. \u201cWhat worries you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many seem to die around Cartland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was by design.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally,\u201d Quinn admitted. \u201cHe lacks the remorse that most would feel upon taking a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say that I feel,\u201d Colin said wryly.</p><p>Quinn grinned and attracted the attention of a woman the next table over. His smile changed from one of amusement to one of sensual promise. Colin looked away to hide his chuckle. It amazed him that a man so widely lauded for his comeliness could hide such a covert livelihood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou never did enjoy that part of your employment,\u201d Quinn continued.</p><p>Colin lifted his glass in a mock salute and then swallowed the blood red contents in one uncouth swallow. \u201cI always feared that every life I ended would cling to me in some way, taint me, and that eventually they would make me unsuitable for Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Quinn jeered softly. \u201cOne of the qualities I most loved in Maria was her ability to survive in the gutter. I could not live my life with a lily-white female. The weight of the fa\u00e7ade would quickly fatigue me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou assume that the man you sit across from now is the real Colin and the one who longs for Amelia is the fa\u00e7ade. Perhaps the opposite is true.\u201d</p> <p>Quinn\u2019s gaze narrowed beneath boldly winged brows. \u201cThen maintain the ruse a little longer.\u201d</p><p>Tensing, Colin set his empty glass down and listened alertly. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>He would do anything for Quinn, but the sudden portent of danger set him on edge. His bags were packed and loaded aboard the ship. In a few hours he would set sail and begin his true life, the one he had interrupted six years ago to become a man of means. A man of title, prestige, wealth. A man worthy of Amelia Benbridge.</p><p>\u201cI have been told that Cartland is meeting often with confidants of Agent-General Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord.\u201d</p><p>Colin whistled. \u201cCartland is one of the most impious men I have ever met.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is why his association with the equally impious agent-general is concerning. I want to search his lodgings tonight,\u201d Quinn said, \u201cwhile you are still here to see to my safety. I simply need you to delay him if he attempts to retire early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince he is aware that I depart at dawn, he will find it odd if I approach him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe covert. Most likely he will cause you no grief. He is not known for being reclusive.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Colin ran the posed scenario through his mind and could find nothing that would interfere with his removal from France. A few hours of his time and he would alleviate his feelings of guilt for abandoning Quinn. Cartland spent more time awake in the night hours than he did during the day. Chances were more than good that Colin would sit in a carriage watching the door of one establishment or another and go directly from there to the wharf.</p><p>\u201cOf course I will help you,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Quinn gestured to an attendant for more wine. \u201cI am indebted to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Colin dismissed. \u201cI can never repay you for what you have done for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect to be invited to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever doubt it.\u201d</p><p>Quinn raised his refilled glass in a toast. \u201cTo the fair Miss Benbridge.\u201d</p><p>Filled with anticipation for the future, Colin drank eagerly to that.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you about?\u201d Colin muttered to himself just a few hours later as he clung to the shadows of an alleyway and followed Cartland at a discreet distance.</p><p>The man had left his mistress\u2019s home an hour past and had been strolling rather aimlessly ever since. Because he continued to move in the general direction of his lodgings, Colin followed. He could not have Cartland returning while Quinn might still be there.</p><p>The night was pleasant, the sky clear but for a few clouds. A full moon hung low, providing ample illumination when not blocked by a building. Still, Colin would much rather be in his cabin at the moment, sleeping away the hours until he could stand at the bow and breathe deeply of the crisp sea air.</p> <p>Cartland turned a corner, and Colin fell behind, counting silently until the appropriate lapse had passed and he could round the building as well and continue his leisurely pursuit.</p><p>He made his move and paused, startled to find a private courtyard ahead. Cartland stood there, engrossed in discussion with someone who appeared to have been waiting. Two brick posts held lanterns marking the entrance to the outdoor retreat. A small fountain and a neatly trimmed, tiny lawn were the only other items in the space.</p><p>Colin hung back, drawing his cloak around him to better disguise his frame in the darkness. He was not an easy man to hide, not at a few inches over six feet in height and sixteen stone, but he had learned the art of concealment and practiced it well.</p><p>Oddly enough, while he could attribute his size to his laborer parents, Cartland was also quite large, and his breeding was more refined. He worked for a living only because his father had bankrupted them, and he made certain that everyone knew he was above certain tasks. Killing was not one of them. That was a duty he enjoyed far too much for Colin\u2019s taste, which was why they associated with each other only when forced to by necessity.</p><p>Creeping along the damp stone wall, Colin moved closer to the two men, hoping to hear something that would help to explain this assignation.</p><p>\u201c. . . you may tell the agent-general . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . forget your place! You are not . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . I will see to it, Leroux, provided I am compensated. . .\u201d</p><p>The debate seemed to grow more heated with Cartland gesturing roughly with one hand, while the gentleman with whom he spoke began to pace. The sound of heels tapping restlessly along cobblestones helped to disguise Colin\u2019s stealthy approach. Cartland\u2019s evening garments were covered by a short cape secured with a jeweled brooch that gleamed in the lantern light. The other man was hatless, coatless, and much shorter. He was also highly agitated.</p><p>\u201cYou have not followed through with your end of our arrangement!\u201d Leroux snapped. \u201cHow dare you approach me for more money when you have yet to accomplish the task you were previously paid for!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was underpaid,\u201d Cartland scoffed, his features hidden beneath the rim of his tricorn.</p><p>\u201cI will inform the agent-general of your ridiculous demands, and advise him to seek someone more trustworthy to work on his behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d There was a smugness to Cartland\u2019s tone that alarmed Colin, but before he could act, it was too late. The light of the moon caught the edge of a blade and then it was gone, embedded deeply within Leroux\u2019s gut.</p><p>There was a pained gasp and then a thick gurgle.</p><p>\u201cYou can pass along something else for me as well,\u201d Cartland bit out, as he withdrew the dagger and thrust it home again. \u201cI am not a lackey to be set aside when I have outlived my usefulness.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly a dark form leaped from the shadows and tackled Cartland, knocking his hat aside. The blade slipped free and clattered to the cobblestone. Leroux sank to his knees, his hands clutching at the welling blood.</p><p>Rolling and writhing upon the ground, the would-be rescuer fought brutally, delivering blows that echoed off the buildings around them. Material ripped and venomous words were exchanged as Cartland gained the upper hand. Pinning his assailant to the ground, he reached for the knife lying just a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cCartland!\u201d Colin abandoned his attempt at stealth and rushed toward the fray, tossing his cloak over his shoulder to bare the hilt of his small sword.</p><p>Startled, Cartland pulled back, revealing a face etched with bloodlust and cold, dark eyes. The man beneath him took the opening and swung his fist hard and fast, clipping Cartland in the temple and sending him reeling to the side.</p><p>Colin ran through the posts that marked the entrance and pulled his blade free. \u201cYou have much to answer for!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be to you,\u201d Cartland cried, kicking out with his feet.</p><p>Sidestepping the assault, Colin lunged, piercing Cartland\u2019s shoulder. The man roared like a wounded animal and flailed in fury.</p><p>Circling, Colin turned his head to look at the unfortunate Leroux. His open, sightless eyes betrayed his demise.</p><p>It was too late. The man who had the ear of Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord was dead.</p><p>The dreaded feeling of portent once again hit Colin hard.</p><p>Distracted, he failed to anticipate the blow that came to the back of his knee, tumbling him to the ground. By instinct, he rolled to the side, avoiding another assault from Cartland, but coming up against the corpse and the pool of blood quickly spreading around it.</p><p>Cartland scrambled for his discarded knife, but the other man was there first, sending it skidding across the cobblestones with a well-placed kick. Colin was struggling to his feet when alarmed shouts sounded from the nearby street. All three of them turned their heads.</p><p>Discovery was near at hand.</p><p>\u201cA trap!\u201d Cartland hissed, leaping to his feet. He stumbled toward the low stone wall and threw himself over it.</p><p>Colin was already in motion, running.</p><p>\u201cHalt!\u201d came a cry from the alleyway.</p><p>\u201cFaster!\u201d urged Leroux\u2019s would-be rescuer, fleeing alongside him.</p><p>Together they took a different alley than the one Colin had arrived through . . . the one that was presently filling with authorities who pursued with lanterns raised high.</p><p>\u201cHalt!\u201d</p><p>When they reached the street, Colin ran to the left in the direction of his waiting coach; the other man fled to the right. After the explosion of activity in the small courtyard, the relative stillness of the night seemed unnatural, the rhythmic pounding of his footfalls sounding overly loud.</p><p>Colin weaved in and out among various buildings and streets, taking alleys whenever possible to lessen his chances of being apprehended.</p><p>Finally, he returned to Cartland\u2019s mistress\u2019s house and caught the eye of his coachman, who straightened and prepared to release the brake.</p><p>\u201cQuinn\u2019s,\u201d Colin ordered as he vaulted into the carriage. The equipage lurched into motion, and he hunched over, tearing off his blood-soaked cloak and tossing it to the floorboards. \u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>How the hell could such a simple task spin so far beyond his control?</p><p>Keep Cartland from returning home too early. A bloody simple task, that. One that should not have involved witnessing a murder and the drawing of his blade.</p><p>The moment his carriage drew to a halt before Quinn\u2019s door, Colin was leaping out. He pounded with his fist upon the portal, cursing at the lengthy delay before it opened.</p><p>A disheveled butler stood with taper in hand. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn. Now.\u201d</p><p>The urgency in his tone was clear and undeniable. Stepping back, the servant allowed him entry and showed him into the lower parlor. He was left alone. Then a few moments later Quinn entered wearing a multicolored silk robe and bearing flushed skin. \u201cI sent for you hours ago. When you did not reply, I assumed you had boarded your ship and gone to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve a woman upstairs,\u201d Colin gritted out, \u201cI think I might kill you.\u201d</p><p>Quinn took in his appearance from head to toe. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Colin paced back and forth before the banked fire in the grate and relayed the night\u2019s events.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Quinn ran a hand through his inky locks. \u201cHe will be desperate, running from both us and them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no \u2018us,\u2019\u201d Colin snapped. He pointed at the longcase clock in the corner. \u201cMy ship sets sail within a few hours. I\u2019ve come only to wish you good riddance! Had I been caught tonight, I might have been delayed for weeks or months while this mess was sorted out.\u201d</p><p>More pounding came to the door. They both paused, hardly daring to breathe.</p><p>The butler rushed in. \u201cA dozen armed men,\u201d he said. \u201cThey searched the carriage and took something from inside it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cloak,\u201d Colin said grimly, \u201csoaked with Leroux\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they would come for you here would suggest that Cartland has offered you up as the sacrificial lamb.\u201d Quinn growled as commands were shouted from outside. \u201cAnswer that,\u201d he said to the waiting servant. \u201cDelay them as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The butler departed, closing the parlor door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, my friend,\u201d Quinn muttered, moving to the clock and shoving it aside, revealing a swinging panel behind it. \u201cThis will lead you to the stables. You may find trouble at the wharf, but if you can board your ship, do so. I will manage things for you here and clear your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Colin rushed over to the hidden portal. \u201cCartland was working with the French in some capacity. There must be some level of trust in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will find a way, never doubt it.\u201d Quinn set a hand on his shoulder as voices were heard in the foyer. \u201cGodspeed.\u201d</p><p>With that, Colin rushed through the door, and it was immediately shut behind him. Scraping sounds accompanied the moving of the clock back to its original position. He heard no more than that, because he was moving blindly through the dark tunnel, his hands held out to either side to feel his way.</p><p>His heart racing, his breathing labored, he fought against a rising panic. Not because capture was at hand, but because he had never been so close to reclaiming Amelia. He felt as if she were within his grasp and that if he were unable to board his ship, he would be losing her all over again. He\u2019d barely survived the first time. He doubted his ability to survive another.</p><p>The tunnel became dank, the smell unpleasant. Colin reached what appeared to be a dead end and cursed viciously. Then the sounds of skittish horses caught his ear, and he glanced up, noting the faint outline of a trapdoor above him. He kicked around with his foot until he found the short stool; then he pulled it closer and stood upon it.</p><p>Quiet as a mouse, he lifted the door just enough to look through the strands of straw that covered it. The stable was still, though the perceptive beasts it housed shifted restlessly in response to his agitation. Throwing the hatch wide, he climbed out and sealed the door again. Colin grabbed the nearest bridle and horse, then opened the stable doors.</p><p>He walked his mount outside, eyes wide and ears open as he searched for those who might be hunting him.</p><p>\u201cYou, there! Halt!\u201d cried a voice coming from the left.</p><p>Grabbing two fistfuls of silky mane, Colin pulled himself up and onto the horse\u2019s bare back.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d he urged with a kick of his heels, and they burst out to the mew.</p><p>The early morning wind whipped the queue from his hair. He was hunched low over his mount\u2019s neck, as they raced through the streets, breathing heavily in unison. Colin\u2019s gut knotted with anxiety. If he made it to the ship without incident, it would be a miracle. He was so close to leaving this life behind, damn it. So close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colin galloped as near to the wharf as he dared, then dismounted. He freed his horse, then traversed the remaining distance on foot, moving in and out among the various crates and barrels. Sweat coated his skin despite the chill of the ocean breeze and his lack of outerwear.</p><p>So close.</p><p>Later, he would not remember the climb up the gangplank or the journey from the deck to his cabin. He would, however, never forget what he found inside.</p><p>The door swung open, and he entered, gasping at the sight that greeted him.</p> <p>\u201cAh, there you are,\u201d purred the unctuous voice of a stranger.</p><p>Pausing on the threshold, Colin stared at the tall, thin man who held a knife to his valet\u2019s throat. One of Cartland\u2019s lackeys or perhaps one working for the French.</p><p>Regardless, he was caught.</p><p>His valet stared at him with wide horrified eyes above a cravat tied around his mouth as a gag. Bound to a chair, the servant was visibly trembling, and the acrid smell of urine betrayed just how frightened he was.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Colin asked, holding both hands up to display his willingness to cooperate.</p> <p>\u201cYou are to come with me.\u201d</p><p>His heart sank. Amelia. In his mind, she was retreating. Fading.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Before he could blink, the man moved, shoving his valet\u2019s head back and slitting his throat.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Colin lunged forward, but it was too late. \u201cDear God, why?\u201d he cried, his eyes stung by frustrated, hopeless tears.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d the man retorted, shrugging. His eyes were small and pale blue, like ice. Swarthy skin and late-night bristle on his jaw made him look dirty, although his simple garments appeared to be clean. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>Colin stumbled back out the cabin door, inwardly certain that he would die this night. The deep sadness he felt was not due so much to the loss of his life, such as it was. It was mourning for the life he had dreamt of sharing with Amelia.</p><p>His hands were shaking as he gripped the railings that supported the stairs leading back up to the deck. A sickening thud and low groan behind him made him jump and turn too quickly. He tripped and landed on his arse on the second-to-bottom step.</p><p>There at his feet lay his captor, facedown with a rapidly swelling lump protruding from the back of his head.</p><p>Colin\u2019s gaze lifted from the prone body and found the man who had fought with Cartland in the courtyard earlier. He was short of stature and stocky, his body heavily muscled and clothed in nondescript attire of various shades of gray. The man\u2019s features were blunt, his dark eyes wizened and jaded.</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d the man said. \u201cI owed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>\u201cJacques.\u201d</p> <p>Just the one name, no more than that.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jacques. How did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed this man.\u201d He kicked at the fallen body with the tip of his boot. \u201cIt is not safe for you to remain in France, monsieur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The man bowed. \u201cIf you have something of value, I would suggest you offer it to the captain as enticement to set sail immediately. I will manage the bodies.\u201d</p><p>Colin heaved out a weary breath, fighting the flickering hope inside him. The chances of him actually making it to English soil were negligible.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Jacques urged.</p><p>\u201cI will help you.\u201d He pushed heavily to his feet. \u201cThen you should disembark before you are associated with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that,\u201d the Frenchman said, his gaze direct. \u201cI will remain with you until you are settled and this matter of my master\u2019s death is resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Colin asked simply, too weary to argue.</p><p>\u201cArrange our departure now,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cWe will have plenty of time to talk on the journey.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievably, within the hour they were out to sea. But the Colin Mitchell who stood at the mist-covered bow was not the same one who had shared a farewell dinner with Quinn.</p><p>This Colin had a price on his head, and the cost to pay it could be his life.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The fence was directly ahead. After making certain that the guard was still far enough away to miss seeing her, Amelia hurried toward it. She did not see the man hidden on the other side of a large tree. When a steely arm caught her and a large hand covered her mouth, she was terrified, her scream smothered by a warm palm.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Colin whispered, his hard body pinning hers to the trunk.</p><p>Her heart racing in her chest, Amelia beat at him with her fists, furious that he had given her such a fright.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he ordered, pulling her away from the tree to shake her, his dark eyes boring into hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you, but you left me no choice. You won\u2019t see me, won\u2019t talk to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>She ceased struggling when he pulled her into a tight embrace, the powerful length of his frame completely unfamiliar to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m removing my hand. Hold your tongue or you\u2019ll bring the guards over here. \u201d</p><p>He released her, backing away from her quickly as if she were malodorous or something else similarly unpleasant. As for her, she immediately missed the scent of horses and the hard-working male that clung to Colin.</p><p>Dappled sunlight kissed his black hair and handsome features. She hated that her stomach knotted at the sight and her heart hurt anew until it throbbed in her chest. Dressed in an oatmeal-colored sweater and brown breeches, he was all male. Dangerously so.</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you I\u2019m sorry. \u201d His voice was hoarse and gravelly.</p><p>She glared.</p><p>He exhaled harshly and ran both hands through his hair. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t mean anything. \u201d</p><p>Amelia realized then that he was not apologizing for scaring the wits from her. \u201cHow lovely, \u201d she said, unable to hide her bitterness. \u201cI am so relieved to hear that what broke my heart meant nothing to you. \u201d</p><p>He winced and held out his work-roughened hands. \u201cAmelia. You don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re too young, too sheltered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, you found someone older and less sheltered to understand you. \u201d She walked past him. \u201cI found someone older who understands me. We are all happy, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His low, ominous tone startled her, and she cried out when he caught her roughly. \u201cWho?\u201d His face was so tight, she was frightened again. \u201cThat boy by the stream? Benny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d she threw at him. \u201cYou have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re dressed this way?\u201d His heated gaze swept up and down her body. \u201cIs that why you wear your hair up now? For him?\u201d</p><p>Considering the occasion worthy of it, she had worn one of her prettiest dresses, a deep blue confection sprinkled with tiny embroidered red flowers. \u201cYes! He doesn\u2019t see me as a child. \u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he is one! Have you kissed him? Has he touched you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is only a year younger than you. \u201d Her chin lifted. \u201cAnd he is an earl. A gentleman. He would not be caught behind a store making love to a girl. \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t making love,\u201d Colin said furiously, holding her by the upper arms.</p><p>\u201cIt appeared that way to me. \u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t know any better.\u201d His fingers kneaded into her skin restlessly, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to touch her, but couldn\u2019t bear not to either.</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose you do?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched in answer to her scorn.</p><p>Oh, that hurt! To know there was someone out there whom he loved. Her Colin.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we talking about this?\u201d She attempted to wrench free, but to no avail. He held fast. She needed distance from him. She could not breathe when he touched her, could barely think. Only pain and deep sorrow penetrated her overwhelmed senses. \u201cI forgot about you, Colin. I stayed out of your way. Why must you bother me again?\u201d</p><p>He thrust one hand into the hair at her nape, pulling her closer. His chest labored against hers, doing odd things to her breasts, making them swell and ache. She ceased struggling, worried about how her body would react if she continued.</p><p>\u201cI saw your face, \u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI hurt you. I never meant to hurt you. \u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes and she blinked rapidly, determined to keep them from falling.</p><p>\u201cAmelia. \u201d He pressed his cheek to hers, his voice carrying an aching note. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I can\u2019t bear it. \u201d</p><p>\u201cRelease me, then. And keep your distance.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cBetter yet, perhaps you could find a more prestigious position elsewhere. You are a hard worker\u2014\u201d</p><p>His other arm banded her waist. \u201cYou would send me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, her hands fisted in his sweater. \u201cYes, I would. \u201d Anything to avoid seeing him with another girl.</p><p>He nuzzled hard against her. \u201cAn earl . . . It must be Lord Ware. Damn him. \u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is nice to me. He talks to me, smiles when he sees me. Today, he is going to give me my first kiss. And I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Colin pulled back, his irises swallowed by dilated pupils leaving deep black pools of torment. \u201cHe may have all the things that I never will, including you. But by God, he won\u2019t take that from me. \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He took her mouth, stunning her so that she couldn\u2019t move. Amelia could not understand what was happening, why he was acting this way, why he would approach her now, on this day, and kiss her as if he were starved for the taste of her.</p><p>His head twisted, his lips fitting more fully over hers, his thumbs pressing gently into the hinges of her jaw and urging her mouth to open. She shivered violently, awash in heated longing, afraid she was dreaming or had otherwise lost her mind. Her mouth opened, and a whimper escaped as his tongue, soft like wet velvet, slipped inside.</p><p>Frightened, she stopped breathing. Then he murmured to her, her darling Colin, his fingertips brushing across her cheekbones in a soothing caress.</p><p>\u201cLet me, \u201d he whispered. \u201cTrust me. \u201d</p><p>Amelia lifted to her toes, surging into him, her hands sliding into his silken locks. Unschooled, she could only follow his lead, allowing him to eat at her mouth gently, her tongue tentatively touching his.</p><p>He moaned, a sound filled with hunger and need, his hands cupping the back of her head and angling her better. The connection became deeper, her response more fervent. Tingles swept across her skin in a wave of goose bumps. In the pit of her stomach a sense of urgency grew, of recklessness and flaring hope.</p><p>One of his hands slipped, caressing the length of her back before cupping her buttock and urging her up and into his body. As she felt the hard ridge of his arousal, a deep ache blossomed low inside her.</p><p>\u201cAmelia . . . sweet. \u201d His lips drifted across her damp face, kissing away her tears. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing this. \u201d</p><p>But he kept kissing her and kissing her and rolling his hips into her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you so long\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off with his lips over hers, his passion escalating, his hands roaming all over her back and arms. When she couldn\u2019t breathe, she tore her lips away.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me,\u201d she begged, her chest heaving. \u201cYou must. Oh, God, Colin . . .\u201d She rubbed her tear-streaked face into his. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so cruel, so mean. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have you. You shouldn\u2019t want me. We can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colin thrust away from her with a vicious curse. \u201cYou are too young for me to touch you like this. No. Don\u2019t say anything else, Amelia. I am a servant. I will always be a servant, and you will always be a viscount\u2019s daughter. \u201d</p><p>Her arms wrapped around her middle, her entire body quaking as if she were cold instead of blistering hot. Her skin felt too tight, her lips swollen and throbbing. \u201cBut you do love me, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, her small voice shaky despite her efforts to be strong.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me that. \u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you not grant me at least that much? If I cannot have you anyway, if you will never be mine, can\u2019t you at least tell me that your heart belongs to me?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI thought it was best if you hated me. \u201d His head tilted up to the sky with his eyes squeezed shut. \u201cI had hoped that if you did, I would stop dreaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreaming of what?\u201d She tossed aside caution and approached him, her fingers slipping beneath his sweater to touch the hard ridges of his abdomen.</p><p>He caught her wrist and glared down at her. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. \u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they like my dreams?\u201d she queried softly. \u201cWhere you kiss me as you did a moment ago and tell me you love me more than anything in the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled. \u201cThey are not sweet and romantic and girlish. They are a man\u2019s dreams, Amelia. \u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as what you were doing to that girl?\u201d Her lower lip quivered, and she bit down on it to hide the betraying movement. Her mind flooded with the painful memories, adding to the turmoil wrought by the unfamiliar cravings of her body and the pleading demands of her heart. \u201cDo you dream about her, too?\u201d</p><p>Colin caught her wrist again. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, lighter in pressure and urgency than before, but no less passionately. Soft as a butterfly\u2019s wings, his lips brushed back and forth across hers, his tongue dipping inside, then retreating. It was a reverent kiss, and her lonely heart soaked it up like the desert floor soaked rain.</p><p>Cupping her face in his hands, he breathed, \u201cThis is making love, Amelia. \u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you don\u2019t kiss her like this. \u201d She cried softly, her nails digging into his back through his sweater.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t kiss anyone. I never have. \u201d His forehead pressed against hers. \u201cOnly you. It\u2019s only ever been you. \u201d</p><p>Amelia jerked awake with a violent start, her heart racing with the remnants of adolescent passion and yearning. Tossing back the covers, she sat up, allowing the chilly night air to seep through her thin night rail to her perspiration-damp skin. She lifted shaking fingertips to her lips, pressing hard against the swollen curves in an effort to stem their tingling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dream had been so vivid. She imagined that she could still taste Colin, a heady exotic flavor that she craved to this day. It had been years since she\u2019d been plagued with such recollections. She\u2019d thought they were fading, that perhaps she might be healing. Finally.</p><p>Why now? Was it because she had agreed to proceed with the wedding? Was Colin\u2019s memory rearing up and demanding that the love of her life not be set aside?</p><p>Amelia closed her eyes and saw a white mask above shamelessly sensual lips.</p><p>Montoya.</p> <p>His kiss had made her tingle as well. From head to toe and everywhere in between.</p><p>She had to find him. She would find him.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he say?\u201d</p><p>Colin refolded the missive carefully and tucked it into a drawer of his desk. He looked at Jacques. \u201cHe believes Cartland is leading a group of men here in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will not want to bring you back alive.\u201d Jacques walked over to the window and brushed the sheer panel aside to look down at the front drive.</p> <p>The town house they occupied was a rental in fine shape. It was a short distance from the city, near enough to be convenient, but far enough away to ensure that no one would find them noteworthy. The distance also allowed them to ascertain if they were being followed or not, which Colin had been just a few nights past. The night he had danced with and kissed Amelia.</p><p>\u201cIt is good that you stay indoors during the day,\u201d Jacques said, turning back to face him again. \u201cYou are being hunted on all sides.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Colin closed his eyes and leaned into the back of his chair. \u201cIt was foolish of me to seek her out that way. Now I have attracted St. John\u2019s attention, and he will not rest until he knows why I displayed such interest in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a beautiful woman,\u201d Jacques said, his voice laced with a Frenchman\u2019s innate appreciation of such delights.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d</p><p>Beyond beautiful. Dear God, how was it possible for a woman to be so perfect? Stunning green eyes framed by sooty lashes. An imminently kissable mouth. Creamy skin, and the fully ripened curves of a woman grown. All carried with an air of latent sensuality that he had always found alluring.</p> <p>He could admit now that his attendance at the ball had been goaded by his hope that he would see her and find his attraction unfounded. Perhaps absence had made his heart too fond. Perhaps he had embellished her memory in his mind.</p><p>\u201cBut that is not why you love her,\u201d Jacques murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Colin agreed, \u201cit\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have rarely seen a woman with such yearning in her soul. Although I watched her as you did, she did not take note of my interest, only of yours.\u201d</p><p>That was his fault, he knew. Repeated glimpses of her profile had only whetted his appetite to see her directly. Look at me, he\u2019d urged silently. Look at me!</p><p>And she had, unable to resist when followed with such ravenous attention.</p><p>The eye contact had cut him to the quick, piercing across the distance between them and stabbing deep into his heart. He\u2019d felt it, the yearning Jacques spoke of. That longing elicited a primal response in him to deliver it, whatever it was that she wanted. Whatever she needed.</p><p>\u201cYou could take her from the other man,\u201d Jacques said.</p> <p>He knew that, too. Had felt the wavering in her as they had danced and then again when they had kissed.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d never followed Cartland that night!\u201d Colin growled, the frustration inside him a writhing, powerful thing. \u201cEverything would be different.\u201d</p><p>She would be in his bed now, writhing and arching beneath him as he rode her hard and deep, awakening the wanton he sensed was waiting just beneath the surface. In his mind, he could hear her voice hoarse from crying out his name, her satin skin covered in a fine sheen of sweat.</p><p>He would push her beyond reason, take her body places she never knew it could go . . .</p><p>\u201cThe twists in our lives happen for a reason,\u201d Jacques said, returning to the desk and sitting across from him. \u201cI could have lived the whole of my life without leaving France, yet I was destined to follow you here.\u201d</p><p>Colin pushed the lewd images from his thoughts and opened his eyes. \u201cYou are a good man, Jacques, to carry your debt beyond the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonsieur Leroux saved the life of my sister and with her, the life of my niece,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI cannot proceed knowing his murderer has not paid for the crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do we make him pay?\u201d</p><p>The Frenchman smiled, bringing warmth to his hard features. \u201cI would like to kill him, but that would put you at a marked disadvantage. With me as your only witness, you would find it extremely difficult to prove your innocence.\u201d</p><p>Colin said nothing to that. Jacques had already helped far beyond what he had any right to ask.</p><p>\u201cSo he must confess.\u201d Jacques shrugged. \u201cI will take what pleasure I can from doing whatever is necessary to garner that confession.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Colin looked toward the window. Night had fallen hours ago. Shortly, he could leave and make discreet inquiries in his efforts to find Cartland before the man found him. But first, he would need some rest. \u201cI will retire for a few hours, then set out and see what I can discover. Someone will have a loose tongue, to be sure. I just have to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should contact the man you worked for here,\u201d Jacques said carefully. \u201cThe one who directs Quinn.\u201d</p><p>Colin had never met Lord Eddington, never exchanged a word or correspondence. All communications passed through Quinn, and as far as Colin knew, Eddington was unaware of the identities of the men working under Quinn. There would be no way to prove that he was a confidant. \u201cNo. That is not possible,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cWe do not know one another.\u201d</p><p>The Frenchman blinked, apparently so taken aback by the news that he lapsed into his native language. \u201cVraiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then . . . that rules out that course of action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Unfortunately, it does.\u201d He pushed to his feet. \u201cWe will talk more when I awake.\u201d</p><p>Jacques inclined his head in agreement and waited until Colin had left the room. Then he moved to the desk, where he opened a drawer and pulled out the white half mask.</p><p>Colin would not be attending any balls or masquerades, so his continuing possession of the mask betrayed its sentimental value. Jacques had watched his new friend with Miss Benbridge and knew the woman meant a great deal.</p><p>So he would watch her when he could and keep her safe, if possible. If God was kind, Jacques would finish his task, Cartland would have his comeuppance, and Colin would have the woman he loved.</p><p>As a child, Amelia had learned how to socialize with giants.</p><p>Of course, at that time, they had been imaginary. The man standing before her was quite real, but she knew he was the same sort of giant as the one in her mind\u2014gentle and kind beneath a gruff, formidable exterior.</p><p>\u201cThis is extortion!\u201d Tim cried, looming over her.</p><p>Amelia set a hand at her neck to rub the ache caused by craning so far back. \u201cNo,\u201d she denied. \u201cNot really. Extortion gives you only one choice. I am offering you options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like yer options.\u201d He crossed his great arms over his barrel chest.</p><p>\u201cI do not blame you. I don\u2019t care for them very much either.\u201d</p><p>She moved toward the nearby padded window seat. The upper family parlor was packed with people, all employees of St. John. Some played cards, others talked and laughed boisterously, and still others napped where they sat, exhausted from running errands all day long.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been much easier for everyone if the man had simply stated his intentions directly.\u201d Amelia shook out her skirts of yellow shot silk taffeta and settled as comfortably as possible in her evening attire. \u201cBut he did not, and so we must guess. I am not very good at guessing, Tim. I haven\u2019t the patience for it.\u201d</p><p>Looking up at him from beneath her lashes, she smiled prettily.</p><p>Tim snorted and scowled. \u201cDon\u2019t you \u2019ave something else to worry your \u2019ead o\u2019er? Wedding gowns and such?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p><p>She should be consumed with the planning of her forthcoming nuptials. From waking to sleeping she should have no time for anything else. It was the most anticipated match of the Season and, if she maneuvered well, it could be a wonderful launch for her new position as a future marchioness.</p><p>Instead she was consumed by thoughts of her masked admirer. She was tenacious when intrigued and told herself that if she could only discern the man\u2019s motives, she would be free to concentrate on more pressing matters.</p><p>It was prewedding nervousness. The need for one last peccadillo. A farewell to childhood whimsy.</p><p>She shook her head. There were a hundred names she gave to why she was so distracted by the masked Montoya. But the reason\u2019s true identity eluded her.</p><p>\u201cWell, yer not doing any searching,\u201d Tim grumbled. \u201cNot on my watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said agreeably. \u201cJust inform me when you find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tim\u2019s jaw took on that obstinate cant that was more bark than bite. He wore green wool trousers this evening and a black waistcoat trimmed with green thread. It was the most colorful ensemble she had ever seen him wear. His coarse gray hair was restrained in a braided queue, and his Vandyke was neatly trimmed.</p><p>Amelia adored him for the effort, knowing the care he displayed was due entirely to affection for her. He wanted to make her proud while he was following her about at the Rothschild ball this evening. He would not be attending, of course, merely watching from the outside perimeter, yet he\u2019d taken pains with his appearance.</p><p>She was proud of him, regardless.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then.\u201d She heaved a dramatic sigh. \u201cI shall search for him myself and drag you along with me, since you are to be my nursemaid.\u201d</p><p>Tim growled and several heads turned in their direction. \u201cAll right,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when, but not where or \u2019ow. But you should be forgetting about that man. \u2019E won\u2019t be troubling you again, I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d She patted the space next to her and held her tongue regarding any further discussion on the matter. She would see Montoya again, alone. Whether that was within St. John\u2019s captivity, or outside his reach. She had to. Something within her wouldn\u2019t allow the matter to rest. \u201cCome and tell me about Sarah. Will you be making an honest woman out of her soon?\u201d</p><p>The floor vibrated with Tim\u2019s heavy footsteps, and when he sat, the seat creaked in protest. Amelia smiled. \u201cWas your mother a sturdy woman?\u201d</p><p>His returning grin was infectious. \u201cNo. She was tiny, but then, so was I.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and he flushed, so she changed the subject. \u201cAbout Sarah . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Sarah was Maria\u2019s longtime abigail, a soul of discretion and loyalty. Tim had been soft on the maid for years, yet neither appeared to be hastening toward the altar.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t \u2019ave me,\u201d he answered glumly.</p><p>Amelia blinked. \u201cWhyever not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says my work is too dangerous. She won\u2019t be widowed with children. Too \u2019ard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI do not understand that, to be honest. Love is too precious to waste. Waiting for the right time, the right place . . . Sometimes that never comes and you will have missed out on what little happiness was yours to claim.\u201d</p><p>Tim stared at her.</p><p>\u201cDo not discount me because I am young,\u201d she admonished.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve yet to \u2019ave life knock you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have had it hold me back, restrain me, keep me from the things I have wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis different to see something through glass than it is to \u2019old it in your \u2019and and \u2019ave it taken from you.\u201d His eyes were kind. \u201cCease pining for yer stableboy. The earl is a good man to turn a blind eye to this.\u201d Tim waved his arm in a sweeping gesture that encompassed the whole room.</p><p>Amelia sighed. \u201cI know. I do love him. But it is not the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the Gypsy \u2019ad lived, you would \u2019ave grown out of yer liking for \u2019im.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not believe so,\u201d she refuted, seeing Colin clearly in her mind, laughing, his dark eyes bright with joy and affection. Then later, flushed and intent with passion. They\u2019d done no more than kiss, but the ardor was there. The need. The sensation that the feeling would escalate into a blinding brilliance that might well be unbearable.</p><p>That sense of . . . anticipation . . . stayed with her. Unfulfilled. Untapped.</p><p>Until Montoya kissed her.</p><p>Then it had simmered inside her. Just for an instant, but long enough to reawaken what had long been dormant. That was what she could not explain. Not to anyone, not to herself. She had considered what, if anything, was similar about her two attractions. It was rather alarming to decide that she was attracted to the forbidden. To what she could not have. Should not have.</p><p>In the voluminous folds of her skirts, Amelia\u2019s hand clutched the secret bundle in her pocket that she carried with the mad hope that she might see Montoya again.</p><p>\u201cThe Earl of Ware has come to call,\u201d the butler intoned from the doorway.</p><p>Tim stood and held out his hand to her. \u201cA good man,\u201d he said again.</p><p>Nodding, she released the note in her pocket and set her fingers within his palm.</p><p>The man in the white mask was following her.</p><p>The mask was the same, but the man wearing it was not. This man was shorter, stockier. His garments, though of the same austerity as Montoya\u2019s, were of lesser quality.</p><p>Who was he? And why did he hold such interest in her?</p><p>Amelia was crestfallen, but prayed she hid it well. Although she had known it was a possibility that Montoya had approached her for a reason beyond attraction to her, she had chosen to believe that it was personal, in the best possible way. His mourning for his lost sweetheart had been so like her own. She had felt a connection to him that she had previously felt only with Ware and Colin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had it all been a lie?</p><p>She suddenly felt alone and very na\u00efve. The ballroom was a crush, the earl whose arm she held was charming and devoted, and someone was speaking to her, but she felt as if she were an island in a vast sea.</p><p>\u201cAre you unwell?\u201d Ware whispered.</p><p>Shaking her head, she tried to look away from the man in the white mask and was unable to. She damned herself for looking for Montoya. If she had not, she could have kept the fantasy of his interest alive within her. Now that it was gone, she felt its loss keenly.</p> <p>\u201cShould we stroll?\u201d Ware suggested. He bent over her in a highly intimate pose made acceptable by his smile and a wink at the gentleman speaking to them. \u201cLord Reginald\u2019s discourse is coaxing me to sleep, as well.\u201d</p><p>Amelia fought a smile, but felt it tugging at the corner of her lips. She turned her gaze from the masked man who watched her so closely and met Ware\u2019s concerned blue eyes. \u201cI should like that, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He made their excuses and began to lead her away. As often happened when he sheltered her, her heart swelled with gratitude. She prayed that the feeling would grow into love and thought perhaps after they consummated their marriage it might turn into that. He would have a care for her in that regard, too, she knew.</p><p>She glanced at him, and he caught her gaze and held it. \u201cEverything I do for you, sweet Amelia, is for the occasional moments when you look at me as you are doing now.\u201d</p><p>Blushing, she looked away and watched the man in the mask moving, circling the room at the same pace she was, keeping himself directly opposite her.</p> <p>\u201cWould you excuse me for a moment?\u201d she asked Ware, smiling.</p><p>\u201cOnly a moment.\u201d</p><p>A female guest walked past them, her appreciative gaze roving the length of Ware\u2019s tall frame.</p><p>\u201cYou provocative devil, you,\u201d Amelia teased.</p><p>He winked, stepped back, and kissed her gloved hand. \u201cOnly for you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at the blatant lie, then made her egress, heading toward the hallway that led to the retiring rooms. She took her time, making certain it would be easy to follow her, then slipped down the hall. There were plenty of guests mingling about. Music swelled from the open ballroom doors. Candlelight flickered in sconces along the wall. She felt safe.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, she pivoted on her heel and faced him.</p><p>He stood several feet back. Amelia arched a brow and gestured him closer. He smiled and approached, but stopped a discreet distance away.</p><p>\u201cY-your mask . . .\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cHis mask,\u201d he corrected with a definite French accent.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Does he want me, or St. John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know who St. John is.\u201d</p><p>Amelia hesitated a moment, inwardly debating the wisdom of her actions; then she reached into her pocket. She withdrew what she hid there and held it out to him.</p><p>The Frenchman\u2019s head tilted to the side as he considered her. He took what she offered and sketched a gallant bow. \u201cMademoiselle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive him that,\u201d she said. Then, lifting her chin, she walked past him and returned to Ware\u2019s side.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake! Why did you go?\u201d</p><p>Colin paced back and forth before the fire in his study and growled low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Jacques said easily.</p><p>\u201cBecause? Because!\u201d Colin glanced down at the object in his hand, a miniature of Amelia as only a lover should see her. En dishabille, one shoulder provocatively bare almost to the nipple, her hair loose and flowing, her lips red and slightly parted. As if she\u2019d been fucked long and well.</p><p>Who was this made for? Not for him certainly. It would have been commissioned many months ago.</p><p>\u201cShe looked beautiful, monsieur.\u201d</p><p>Pausing before the fire, Colin leaned heavily against it, wishing he could have seen her. \u201cWhat color was she wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe approached you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a fashion.\u201d Jacques sat on the settee and tossed one arm over the back, at ease. Which was completely opposite of Colin\u2019s own turmoil. \u201cI admire her.\u201d</p><p>Colin released his breath in a rush. \u201cDamn it. I wanted to keep my distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? To keep her safe? She is heavily guarded.\u201d The Frenchman\u2019s fingertips drummed silently against the wooden lip which framed the back of the settee. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer sister and her sister\u2019s husband are both notorious criminals. They fear she will be used against them, just as I do.\u201d Leaving the grate, Colin sank heavily into his seat behind his desk.</p><p>\u201cI thought her father was a man of some consequence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA viscount, yes.\u201d At Jacques\u2019s raised brows, he continued. \u201cHis avarice was exceeded only by his cruelty. He could see nothing beyond his own wants and desires. He married a lovely widow to gain access to her daughter, Amelia\u2019s sister. He sent Maria to the finest schools, then sold her into marriage to men he eventually killed to obtain their widow\u2019s settlements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMon Dieu!\u201d Jacques\u2019s fingers stilled. \u201cWhy did she not flee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Welton had Amelia and was using her to gain Maria\u2019s cooperation.\u201d</p><p>The Frenchman\u2019s face hardened. \u201cI hope he has met his reward. There are very few things in this life that I find more detestable than crimes against one\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis lordship was tried and hanged. In the course of her efforts to free her sister, Maria met Christopher St. John, a known pirate and smuggler. Together, they were able to manage a rescue and implicate Welton in the murders of Maria\u2019s two husbands.\u201d</p><p>Colin ran a hand through his hair. \u201cThe tale is far more complicated than that, but suffice it to say that St. John and his wife are two people with a multitude of enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering Miss Benbridge\u2019s past and present circumstances, it is even more curious that she would approach me as she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia was never one to do what was expected.\u201d His gaze returned to the miniature in his hand. It was an irresistible enticement that he must find a way to ignore.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she give you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn invitation.\u201d A private request to meet with her at the Fairchilds\u2019 musicale. Another chance to see her and speak with her.</p><p>\u201cWill you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be best if I leave Town,\u201d he said, considering alternative locations. He could travel to Bristol, where Cartland\u2019s brood originated, and see what might be of interest there. A man like Cartland would not have a sterling past. There could be something Colin could use to lure the man into the open. \u201cWe cannot risk remaining in one location too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was just beginning not to thoroughly detest London,\u201d Jacques said wryly.</p><p>Colin knew that although the Frenchman tried valiantly to hide it, he found England distasteful and obviously longed to go home.</p><p>\u201cYou do not have to come with me.\u201d Colin smiled to soften his words. \u201cFrankly, I do not know why you are here.\u201d</p><p>Jacques shrugged his sturdy shoulders. \u201cSome men are born to lead. I was born to serve.\u201d He stood. \u201cI will begin packing our belongings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Colin closed his fist around the precious image of Amelia, then put it away in his drawer next to the mask. \u201cI will join you.\u201d</p><p>Rising to his feet, he told himself distance from Amelia was the best thing he could do for her.</p><p>But the image of her portrait refused to leave his mind, gnawing at his soul in a way he wondered if he would survive.</p><p>Amelia had always been known for her wanderings. Her unusual childhood led her to detest solitude as much as she craved it. She was never one to sit still for long, and she often made excuses to be alone, even at the most intimate of dinner parties. Ware understood her restless wanderlust, which was why he was always quick to suggest a stroll and a breath of fresh air.</p><p>So when she begged a few moments\u2019 absence to use the retiring room, Ware paid her no mind, nor did Lady Montrose, who acted as her chaperone. They both smiled and nodded, freeing her to attend her assignation.</p><p>If Montoya came.</p><p>She moved through the downstairs as silently as possible, slipping once into a conveniently located alcove when the sound of approaching voices made discovery a very real hazard. With a racing heart, she waited for the guests to pass.</p><p>Would he appear? Would he have found a way? His attendance at the masquerade led her to believe that he was a man of some consequence. A casual introduction to Lady Fairchild would have sufficed to be extended an invitation to tonight\u2019s event. However, she had inquired about him and was answered with a blank stare.</p><p>He had not been invited.</p><p>That did not mean he would not be here.</p><p>If his interest in her was related to St. John, she imagined he would have the knowledge required to gain entry to the house and find the private sitting room. She could not decide if that meant it would be best for him not to come. With the household she lived in and the man she was promised to marry, she could not afford any more trouble. But her heart recklessly ignored the situation as a whole and concentrated solely on what it wanted. She wasn\u2019t certain what she would do if he responded to her invitation; she knew only that she wished he would.</p><p>Anticipation and heady expectation filled her at the thought. She had dressed with purpose this evening, choosing a gown made of dark, thick sapphire damask accented with delicate silver lace at the bodice, elbows, and underskirts. With sapphires in her hair, at her throat, and adorning her fingers, she looked older and worldlier.</p><p>If only she felt that way inside. Instead she felt as she had as a young girl\u2014breathless with the desire to see Colin and eager to feel the emotions that only he roused in her. She had thought she would never feel similarly again. It was both thrilling and frightening to feel that way about a masked stranger.</p><p>Finally, she reached the small sitting room she had specified in the note. Sarah had learned of the room from her cousin who worked in the Fairchild household. The abigail passed the information on to Amelia, wanting her to have a quiet place to retreat if necessary.</p><p>Pausing a moment with her hand on the knob, Amelia took a deep breath and attempted to calm her riotous nerves. It was hopeless, so she abandoned the effort. Opening the door, she slipped inside. The drapes were open, allowing a sliver of silver moonlight to slant in through the sash.</p><p>She waited just inside the door, giving her eyes the time necessary to adjust to the reduced lighting. She held her breath expectantly, her ears straining to listen above the rushing of blood, hoping that he would be there and call out to her.</p><p>But there was nothing more than the ticking of the clock on the mantel.</p><p>Amelia moved to the window and turned, taking in the contents of the room. Two settees, one chaise, two chairs, tables of various sizes scattered about . . . There was more, but no Montoya.</p><p>She sighed, and her hands moved restlessly over her voluminous skirts. Perhaps she had arrived too early, or he was having some difficulty gaining entry. She looked out the window, half frightened by the thought that he might be standing outside. But there was no Montoya there either.</p><p>A few minutes. She could spare that much.</p><p>As she began to pace, the clock ticked relentlessly. Her heart rate slowed and her breathing settled into a natural rhythm. Disappointment weighed on her shoulders and the corners of her mouth. After ten minutes passed, Amelia knew it was impossible to linger, though she thought she might wait all night if not for those who would seek her out in worry.</p><p>She walked toward the door. \u201cWell . . . Now there is nothing to distract from the wedding plans,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWho was the miniature created for?\u201d</p><p>Amelia paused with her hand on the knob, shivering as that dark, deep voice wrapped around her like a warm embrace. Gooseflesh covered her bared skin, and her lips parted on a silent gasp. Wide-eyed, she pivoted slowly to face the room. It was then that she saw the faint glow of the white half mask and cravat in the far corner. Montoya wore black again, enabling him to hide in the shadows of the unlit room.</p><p>\u201cLord Ware,\u201d she answered, slightly dazed by her phantom\u2019s sudden appearance and the realization that he had been there the whole time. Watching her. Why the mask? What was he hiding?</p><p>\u201cWhy was it created?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cIt is not a gift commonly given from a virginal bride to her fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him.</p><p>\u201cStay there and answer the question.\u201d</p><p>Amelia frowned at his curtness. \u201cI wanted him to see me in a different way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will see you in all ways, in the flesh.\u201d There was bitterness in his tone, and the sound of it softened her apprehension, which enabled her to say what she might not have said otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI wanted him to see that I was willing to share that side of myself with him,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>The sharp alertness that tensed his frame was palpable. \u201cWhy would he doubt it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust we talk about him?\u201d Her foot tapped impatiently. \u201cWe have so little time since you spent all of it hiding in that corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not talking about him,\u201d Montoya said silkily. \u201cWe are discussing why an intimate gift meant for your fianc\u00e9 found its way into my possession. Did you intend for me to see you in a different way as well?\u201d</p><p>Amelia caught herself fidgeting nervously and hid her hands behind her back. \u201cI think you see me differently,\u201d she murmured, \u201cregardless.\u201d</p><p>His smile flashed white in the darkness. \u201cSo if I, a stranger, can see you as a sexual creature, why would your future husband have difficulty doing the same?\u201d</p><p>She held her breath, considering his perceptive probing. \u201cWhat is it that you want me to say? It is inappropriate for me to discuss private matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSending me a provocative image of you is appropriate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it troubles you so, return it.\u201d She held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he growled. \u201cI will never give it back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She raised one brow in challenge. \u201cDo you seek to use it against me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I would ever allow anyone else to see it.\u201d</p><p>Possessiveness. Clear as day. He was possessive over her. Amelia was both startled and pleased.</p><p>\u201cWhy does Lord Ware not see you as you wish to be seen?\u201d he asked, finally approaching.</p> <p>His tall form stepped out of the shadows and into the moonlight, setting her heart racing. There was something so predatory, yet elegant in the way he moved, his tails swaying gently with his determined stride. Power leashed and clad in a civilized veneer. It made his allure even more seductive, made her want to see him unrestrained and free. His features were austere, his beautifully etched lips enticing her to kiss him.</p><p>That is what I want, she realized suddenly. That is why I needed to see him again.</p><p>She was willing to be honest with him in order to achieve that aim. \u201cWe are longtime companions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it not a love match?\u201d he asked, stopping a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cI should not answer that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I should not be here. You should not have lured me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had me followed.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Jacques took it upon himself. I am leaving Town. I need distance from you, before this matter progresses any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you leave? Are you not haunted by our dance in the garden?\u201d Her hand lifted to the sapphires at her throat. \u201cDon\u2019t you think about the kiss we shared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot cease thinking of it.\u201d He pounced and caught her hard against him, as if something in him had broken free of its bonds. \u201cWaking. Sleeping.\u201d</p><p>She felt his gaze heating her mouth. She licked the lower curve and breathed in the scent of his skin. He smelled exotic, spicy, purely male animal. Something instinctive inside her stirred in response.</p> <p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she goaded, her chest moving against his with rapid pants.</p><p>Montoya whispered a low curse. \u201cYou do not love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I did.\u201d Tentatively, her hands slipped beneath his coat and settled at his waist. His skin was hot, so feverish, she could feel the heat through his garments.</p><p>\u201cIs your heart already taken?\u201d</p><p>Her exhale was shaky. \u201cIn a fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the mask?\u201d she retorted, hating the feeling of being stripped bare by his questions.</p><p>He stared down into her upturned face. \u201cMy visage is not one you would wish to see.\u201d</p> <p>She was deeply disquieted by the finality in his tone. The feeling of incertitude disturbed her to the point that she released him and attempted to step back. He held fast.</p><p>\u201cLet us settle this now,\u201d he said, reaching up to brush callused fingertips along her cheekbones. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you approach me because of St. John?\u201d</p><p>Montoya shook his head. \u201cMy motives were simple. I saw a beautiful woman. I lost all sense of manners and stared, which made her ill at ease. I attempted to apologize. That is all.\u201d His hands cupped her spine and stroked downward, arching her into him.</p><p>He was so hard, so solid, Amelia wanted to cling to him and touch him without impediments. Only one man had ever held her this closely. Only a short time ago, she would have said her ability to enjoy such an embrace with every fiber of her being had passed with Colin. Now, she knew that wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>How extraordinary to have found Montoya.</p><p>Or more aptly, how extraordinary that he had found her.</p><p>\u201cThat night . . . You recognized that others were coming,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d The line of his lips hardened. \u201cI am a man encumbered by a tainted past. It is why you should not send for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not have to come.\u201d A tainted past, one that allowed him to recognize covert signals that most aristocrats would fail to notice. Who was he?</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched with amusement, and she touched it with her fingertip. She could not see any deformity through the eyeholes of the mask or around his mouth. What she could see were dark eyes of a slightly exotic slant and a mouth made for sin. The curvature, shape, and firmness were perfection. She could imagine hours of kissing him and never growing bored. Whatever else may be wrong with him, she thought she might be able to bear it.</p><p>She touched the edge of the mask. \u201cLet me see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He pushed her hand away roughly, then caught it again and kissed the back. The press of his lips left tingles, even through her glove. \u201cTrust me. It would be difficult to bear the truth of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you will not court me?\u201d</p><p>Montoya stilled. \u201cWould you wish me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel this way about many women?\u201d Her gaze dropped to his throat where she watched him swallow hard. \u201cI have felt this way about only one other man, and he is lost to me, as your love is to you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly his embrace tightened, and he pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cYou have mentioned a lost loved one before,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it feels as if a piece of me is missing. It is unbearable. I do not understand why I feel so vividly about him after all these years, as if he might return, as if some part of me expects him to.\u201d Her hands fisted in his coat. \u201cBut when I am with you, I think only of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I remind you of him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe was vital and unrestrained; you are more subdued, but in a . . . primitive way.\u201d Her smile was sheepish. \u201cThat sounds silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe primitiveness comes in response to you,\u201d he said, nuzzling his jaw against her temple. He was so close, the smell of him inundated her senses and made her giddy. Joy, hot and sweet, filled her. The sensation of being alive after years of numbness. She felt guilty for that, burdened by a sense of betraying Ware, but she could not fight the attraction to Montoya. It was too strong, too heady and intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cI would be willing to explore it . . .\u201d she offered shyly.</p><p>\u201cAre you propositioning me, Miss Benbridge?\u201d he asked with a low laugh that she adored from the moment she heard it. It was the kind of laugh one worked to hear again. Already her mind was sifting through anecdotes she could share that might make him merry.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He cupped her nape and held her cheek to his chest, wrapping his big body around her. It was safe in his embrace. Warm. Delightful. Could two people spend hours hugging? A derisive snort escaped her. Hours of kissing and hugging. She was deranged.</p><p>\u201cWas that a snort?\u201d he teased.</p><p>She flushed. \u201cDo not attempt to change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should part,\u201d he said, sighing with what sounded like regret. \u201cYou have already been absent from the festivities too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you not say something when I first arrived?\u201d</p><p>Montoya tried to retreat, but she held him to her. There was power in her proximity, she thought. The two halves warring within him\u2014the part that wanted to hold her and the part that wanted to push her away\u2014seemed stalemated when she was near.</p><p>Amelia smiled a woman\u2019s smile. \u201cYou could not allow me to walk away, could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that vanity I hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that evasion?\u201d</p><p>The flash of a rakish dimple made her stomach flutter. \u201cIf my circumstances were different, nothing could keep me from making you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She looked up at him from beneath her lashes. \u201cWould you come bearing honorable intentions, or would you seduce me as you are doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet . . .\u201d He laughed again. \u201cThe only seduction at work here is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Her breasts were full and heavy, pressing uncomfortably against her corset. Her mouth was dry, her palms damp. She felt seduced. Could it be that his body was responding to her as well? \u201cWhat am I doing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His smile was charming. \u201cSo you can do more of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might. Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you become so flirtatious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I have always been so,\u201d she rejoined, batting her lashes coyly.</p><p>Montoya turned pensive. \u201cCan Ware manage you?\u201d He caught her wrists and pulled her hands away from his waist.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Amelia frowned as he evaded her and moved toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYou are mischievous baggage.\u201d His gaze narrowed as his hand wrapped around the knob.</p><p>\u201cI am not baggage.\u201d She set her hands atop her pannier.</p><p>\u201cYou will forever land into trouble if not watched carefully.\u201d</p><p>She arched a haughty brow. \u201cI have been watched my entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet here you are, luring strangers with tantalizing miniatures and holding a highly inappropriate assignation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not have to come!\u201d She stomped one slippered foot, irritated by his condescending tone.</p><p>\u201cTrue. And I shan\u2019t come again.\u201d</p><p>His tone was too familiar. He had asked her if he reminded her of Colin. Up until this moment, he had not. They were built differently, their voices were inflected with dissimilar accents, and their strides boasted different kinds of confidence. Colin had a bit of a stomp, as if to forcibly establish his presence. Montoya had sultriness to his gait, a more understated way of defining his dominance.</p><p>But in their mulish determination to set her aside, they were the same. As a young girl, she\u2019d no choice but to tolerate it. That was not the case now.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d she said, moving toward him with a deliberate swaying of her hips. \u201cIf it is so easy for you to walk away and leave me behind, it would be best if you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not say it would be easy,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Amelia set her hand atop his where it gripped the knob. \u201cGood-bye, Count Montoya.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head, and she lunged, pressing her lips to his. He froze, and she took the advantage, tilting her head to deepen the contact. His breathing grew labored, his skin hot. Still, he did not move. She was unsure of how to proceed, and without his participation the kiss became awkward. Then she thought perhaps she was overthinking the thing.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Amelia allowed instinct to take over. Her hands settled lightly upon his tense shoulders, and he shuddered. She licked his lower lip, and he groaned. Her stomach churned madly with delight and fear. What if they were caught? How would she explain?</p><p>Then she did not care because it was too delicious taking him as she wanted. He did nothing to help her, but he did nothing to stop her either. Stretching her arms up, she reached behind him and tugged off her glove; then she curled her fingers around his nape. The moment their bare skin touched she was lost to him. His mouth opened on a gasp, and she pushed her tongue inside, licking the taste of him as she would a favorite treat. She tugged on his queue, and he growled.</p><p>His tongue stroked along hers, a practiced, smooth glide that made her moan into his mouth. The tiny sound broke him. He moved so quickly, she barely registered it. The next she knew, she was pinned to the door by over six feet of aroused male, and he was kissing her back, ardently and possessively.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he cursed in a harsh whisper. \u201cI can\u2019t have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not even try!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have done nothing but try. Nothing. That does not change the fact that my circumstances make me unsuitable and dangerous for you.\u201d</p><p>Montoya cupped her nape and slanted his mouth hungrily over hers. It was a dark kiss, rife with sensual intent. Delicious. She sagged into the door and took it, all of it. Every thrust of his tongue, every nibble of his teeth, every caress of his beautiful lips. She took it and begged for more with pleading whimpers that drove his fervency to greater heights.</p><p>There was a mask between them and endless secrets. There was the wall that existed between strangers who shared nothing of each other beyond a single moment in time, yet the connection she felt with him was there, threading through all of that.</p><p>Was it mere lust? How could it be when she could not see all of him? But this thrumming in her veins, the ache in her breasts, the dampness between her thighs . . . Lust was there, part of the greater whole.</p><p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d he breathed roughly, his warm breath gusting across her damp skin. His parted lips drifted across her face, from jaw to cheekbone. Then higher. \u201cI want to strip you bare, lay you on my bed, and kiss you all over.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, both at the serrated way he said her name and the images his words invoked in her mind. \u201cReynaldo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must leave Town or that will happen, and I cannot lay claim to you if we progress that far. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Tormented by yearning and a body that was wracked with unappeased desire, she would promise anything in this moment to see him again.</p><p>\u201cYou have Ware, a friend of long acquaintance who can give you things that I cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you and I can be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not know me well enough to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know you.\u201d Her voice was a throaty purr. Never in her life had she sounded like that, and it affected him. She could tell by the way he wrapped himself around her in an even tighter embrace. \u201cI would like you to know me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, and she realized she found the mask attractive. Arousing. How odd, but true, nevertheless. She did not find it alarming, but rather comforting. She felt too open, and the sight of the mask shielded her as well as him.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you need to know about me,\u201d he said in a rasp, \u201cis that there are those who want me dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a statement might frighten other women away,\u201d she retorted, tugging his mouth back down to hers, \u201cbut I live with people who have similar problems. Some would say I live a similar circumstance simply by association.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t change my mind,\u201d he grumbled, licking at her parted lips, his body acting in opposition to his words.</p><p>\u201cI was attempting to leave the room; you detained me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou kissed me!\u201d he accused.</p><p>Amelia shrugged. \u201cYour mouth was in the way. I could not avoid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are trouble.\u201d Bending his head, he kissed her one last time. Softer. Lingering. Her toes curled in her slippers. \u201cNow, we must part, before we are discovered.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, knowing it was true, understanding that she had been absent far too long. \u201cWhen will I see you again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI cannot say. After your wedding, perhaps. Maybe never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She\u2019d asked that question endlessly tonight and still couldn\u2019t collect the answer. Did he not understand how precious it was to feel this alive around another being? She had not realized that she was dormant until she\u2019d met him.</p><p>\u201cBecause Ware can give you things that I cannot.\u201d</p><p>She was about to retort, when the doorknob jiggled. Her breath caught and held. She froze. Montoya did not.</p><p>He moved quickly, pulling back from her and fading again into the shadowy corner. She stumbled away from the door when it pushed open behind her. Turning, Amelia faced the intruding party.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she breathed, curtsying.</p><p>Ware entered with a frown. \u201cWhat are you doing in here? I have been searching the house for you.\u201d He studied her carefully; then his jaw tautened. \u201cYou have something to tell me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and held a shaking hand out to him. He took it and drew her out of the room, pausing a moment to sweep the contents with his gaze. Finding nothing amiss, he led her away from Montoya and into a future that was far less orderly than it had been mere days ago.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cSo that is the whole of it,\u201d Amelia said, her fingers fidgeting with her teaspoon.</p><p>The Earl of Ware reached over and stilled his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s restless movement by covering her hand with his own. \u201cNo need to be nervous,\u201d he murmured, his mind sifting through everything she had related.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not angry?\u201d Her green eyes were wide with a mixture of surprise and apprehension.</p><p>\u201cI am not pleased, but I am not angry.\u201d He smiled ruefully and settled back more firmly in his chair.</p><p>They were seated on the terrace of the St. John house, enjoying tea before their customary ride through the park. It was with some trepidation that he had passed the hours waiting to speak with her. He knew what a woman looked like after a heated assignation, so while Amelia\u2019s revelation was in keeping with his own suspicions, he was sorry to have them confirmed.</p><p>\u201cI do not know what to do,\u201d she said, sounding forlorn. \u201cI fear I am out of my depth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I fear I am not going to be much help,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe are friends, love, but I am a man first and foremost. It does not sit well with me to hear that you feel things for this stranger that you do not feel for me.\u201d</p><p>As her hand twisted and gripped his tightly, a becoming blush spread across her cheeks. \u201cI do not like myself very much at this moment. You are dear to me, Ware. You always have been, and I have not acted as you deserve. I pray you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>He stared pensively over the rear \u201cgarden.\u201d The word barely applied to the outdoor space that surrounded the St. John manse. Only low-lying flowerbeds alleviated the stark severity of the spacious lawn.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I admire your honesty. I doubt I would have the fortitude to reveal so much were I in your stead. However, I cannot have a fianc\u00e9e who is engaging in such behavior, especially in public venues.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, looking like a chastened schoolgirl. While the scolding was required, he took no pleasure in it.</p><p>\u201cYou will have to decide, once and for all, whether you wish to wed me or not, Amelia. If you choose to proceed with our arrangement, you must act in good faith and deport yourself properly.\u201d Ware pushed to his feet and rolled his shoulders back to alleviate the tension there. \u201cDamnation, I do not like feeling as if you are being coerced to marry me!\u201d</p><p>Amelia stood as well, her floral muslin skirts falling to a graceful drape. \u201cYou are angry.\u201d She held up a delicate hand to stem his reply. \u201cNo. I understand. You have the right to be. Had you acted similarly, I would have been equally furious with you.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out her breath, she walked to the marble terrace railing and leaned her weight upon her hands. He joined her, the lawn to his back, she to his side.</p><p>She was lovely this afternoon, as she was every afternoon. Her dark hair was arranged in artless, powdered curls that swayed around her shoulders. Her skin was pale as cream, her eyes as green as jade, her lips red like dark wine. He had once jested that she was the only woman he thought of in poetic prose, and she\u2019d laughed with him, delighted at what she called his \u201cfancifulness.\u201d He was only fanciful with her.</p><p>\u201cIf we wed,\u201d she murmured, \u201cdo you intend to be faithful to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on you.\u201d He considered her carefully. \u201cIf you lie there and pray for a swift finale, I probably will not be. I enjoy sex, Amelia. I crave it. I would not give up the pleasure of sexual congress for anything, even a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked away with a sigh.</p><p>A stray breeze blew by, rolling a tight curl along the tender, bared skin where her neck met her shoulder. She shivered, not with cold, but from the sensation. Ware noted that reaction, as he noted everything about her. Cataloguing the finer details for future use. Amelia was a tactile, sensual creature. Something he appreciated and had been gentle not to exploit, biding his time for the day when she would be his and he could teach her how to embrace that side of herself. With him alone.</p><p>Now, he had much to consider.</p><p>\u201cI believe we could enjoy each other,\u201d he offered, teasing her fingers on the ledge with his own. \u201cI think sex between us could be much more than a chore, but only if you open yourself to me completely in that way. No shyness, no reserve. If our marital bed is welcoming, I will not go elsewhere. I am not a man given to the pursuit of conquests. I simply want to fuck and have a splendid time doing it. If I can do that with one woman, more the better in my estimation. Less work.\u201d</p><p>The coarse word shocked her, he could tell, but it was the right word for how he liked his bedsport, and it was best she know that now. There would be no brief groping and grunting in the darkness. There would be illumination, flushed and sweaty skin, and many hours.</p><p>\u201cIs that what passion in the bedroom is?\u201d she asked, with what appeared to be genuine curiosity. \u201cAnimal urges given free rein? Is there nothing more involved in the process?\u201d</p><p>It took him a moment to comprehend the question. \u201cAre you referring to the glances your sister shares with St. John? Or how the Westfields look at one another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They are . . . indecent, yet romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not the only one to see such affection and covet it.\u201d The inquisitiveness in her gaze made him smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Ware shrugged and crossed his arms over his chest, leaning his hip into the railing. \u201cOn occasion. But I do not pine for it or suffer from its lack. I think, however, that you do.\u201d</p><p>As honest as ever, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cI begin to see that my straightforward approach to wooing you was not the best,\u201d he mused aloud. \u201cI assumed that the miserable end to your first love affair would make you inclined to appreciate a more . . . grounded relationship. But you want the opposite, do you not?\u201d</p><p>She pushed away and began to pace, which was her wont when agitated. At times like this, she reminded him of a caged cat prowling in its boredom. \u201cI do not know what I want, that is the problem.\u201d The look she gave him pinned him in his place.</p><p>\u201cI am content. There is nothing more that I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you truly content?\u201d she challenged. \u201cOr do you simply accept that friendship is all that one can hope for in your position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the answer to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would you wed, if not for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no notion, nor do I care to think about it until absolutely necessary. Are you suggesting I consider alternatives to you?\u201d</p><p>Coming to a halt, Amelia released a sound that reminded him endearingly of a kitten\u2019s growl. \u201cI want to be mad for you! Why is the choice not mine to make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you suffer from bad taste?\u201d He laughed when she stuck her tongue out at him. Then he lowered his voice and stared at her with heavy-lidded eyes. \u201cIf it\u2019s the mask that arouses you, I can wear one to bed. Such games can be fun.\u201d</p><p>When her eyes went big as saucers, he winked.</p><p>Her hands went to her hips as she bristled; then her head tilted to the side. \u201cPerhaps it is the mystery that intrigues me so? Is that what you are suggesting, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a possibility.\u201d Ware\u2019s smile faded. \u201cI intend to make inquiries about your admirer. Let us see if we can unmask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he is not for you, Amelia. A foreign count? You have always longed for a family. You would not move away from your sister now that you are reunited, so what future do you have with this man? And let us not discount the fact that he may seek to wound me through you.\u201d</p><p>She began pacing again, and he watched, admiring the inherent grace in her movements and the way her skirts swirled enchantingly around her long legs. \u201cEveryone appears to believe that Montoya has no interest in me as an individual, only in the people connected to me. I admit I find it rather insulting to learn that those who claim to love me find it impossible to imagine a man desiring me for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can more than imagine it, Amelia. I feel it. Do not take my courtesy as a lack of desire for you. You would be wrong.\u201d</p><p>Heaving out her breath, she said, \u201cSt. John is also attempting to find him.\u201d</p><p>He expected as much. \u201cIf the man is hiding in the rookeries, St. John might succeed. But you said the count was finely dressed and cultured. He sounds as if he is a denizen of my social circles, rather than the pirate\u2019s. My search may prove more fruitful.\u201d</p><p>Amelia paused again. \u201cWhat will you do if you find him?\u201d There was more than a small measure of suspicion in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me if I will hurt him?\u201d The question was not frivolous, as he was a swordsman of some renown. \u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful features crumbled. \u201cI should not have said anything to you.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, Ware moved toward her. \u201cI am pleased you spoke the truth. Our relationship would have been irreparably damaged if you had presented a lie to hide your guilt.\u201d As he reached her, he breathed deeply, inhaling the innocent scent of honeysuckle. He had long suspected that her body resembled the flower she favored, fragrant and sweet as honey upon the lips.</p><p>He cupped her face in both hands and tilted her gaze upward to lock with his. Something new swirled in the emerald depths and he found himself falling into them. \u201cBut that does not change the fact that the man knew you were mine and took liberties regardless. A grave insult to me, love. I can forgive you, but I cannot forgive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWare . . .\u201d Her lips parted, the seam glistening in the soft afternoon light.</p><p>Leaning over her, he bent to take her mouth. Her breath caught as she recognized his intent.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, my lord. \u201d</p><p>They sprung apart as Amelia\u2019s sister and her husband joined them on the terrace, followed shortly by a maid bearing a new tea service.</p><p>\u201cIt is a lovely day,\u201d the pirate said in his distinctive raspy voice. \u201cWe thought we would join you in the sunshine.\u201d</p><p>Ware understood the warning. With a slight bow of his head, he stepped back farther. The former Lady Winter smiled at his perceptiveness. It was a bedroom smile, the one a woman shared with her lover after a bout of great sex. For Mrs. St. John, it was her only smile, and it was a lauded part of her appeal.</p><p>\u201cWe would enjoy the company,\u201d Ware said, leading Amelia back to their table.</p><p>He spent the rest of the afternoon trading inanities with the St. Johns and, later, with those he and Amelia passed during their drive through the park. But part of his mind was actively occupied with the logistics of his hunts\u2014the one for Amelia\u2019s favor and the other for the masked man who sought to steal it from him.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain the man\u2019s name is Simon Quinn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the tavern keep said, setting another pint on the bar.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Colin accepted the ale and moved to a table in the corner. The report of a man searching for him was disturbing, even more so because the one making the inquiries was using Quinn\u2019s name. It could be Cartland, or one of the men with him, though the owner of the tavern was fairly certain the man did not have a French accent.</p><p>There was nothing Colin could do aside from settling in to wait, using techniques of concealment in which he was well versed. A man of his size could never hide completely, but he could make himself less noticeable by sprawling low to disguise his height and breadth of shoulder. He also left his hair unrestrained, which roughened his overall appearance.</p><p>The establishment itself made it easy to lose oneself among the crowd. The lighting was kept low to hide a multitude of faults and dirt. The dark-stained walnut furnishings\u2014round tables and spindle-backed chairs\u2014only added to the dimness of the interior. The air was filled with the smells of old and new ale and crackling grease from the kitchen. Patrons wandered in and out. Several were regulars whom Colin had spoken to previously.</p><p>Long ago, in his past life, he had frequented such places with his uncle, Pietro. Those lazy afternoons off had been spent listening to the imparted wisdom of a good and decent man. Colin missed him, thought of him often, and wondered how he was faring. Pietro had instilled strength of character in him and a belief in honor that had stood him in good stead these many years.</p><p>Colin\u2019s hand fisted on the table.</p><p>One day, they would be reunited, and he would show his uncle how he had heeded those early teachings. He would free Pietro from his life of servitude and establish him in comfort. Life was too short, and he wanted his beloved uncle to enjoy as much of it as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEvenin\u2019,\u201d greeted a voice to his side, drawing Colin from his introspection.</p><p>Beside him stood an elderly gentleman who spent most of his life in the taverns on this street, offering companionship to those who would buy him a drink or something to eat. Occasionally, the man overheard something worth selling, and Colin was willing to pay for it, as he was well aware.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Colin replied, gesturing to the chair opposite his own.</p><p>Hours passed. He used the time to question those who found him familiar from his previous sojourns there. Many hoped to earn a coin or two by passing along information of note. Sadly, there was nothing of interest about Cartland, but Colin bought a pint for anyone who talked with him and used their company to deepen his disguise.</p> <p>Then, quite miraculously, the man he most hoped to see appeared in a swirl of heavy black cape. Simon Quinn paused at the bar and exchanged words with the keep, then turned with wide eyes to find Colin waving from the corner.</p><p>\u201cBy God,\u201d Quinn said as he approached, unclasping the jeweled frog that secured his cloak to his neck. \u201cI have been searching all over London for you, half-starved, and you have been here in my lodgings the entire time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u201d\u2014Colin grinned\u2014\u201cthe last few hours, at least.\u201d</p><p>Quinn muttered a curse under his breath and sank wearily into the seat across from him. A pint was brought over, then a plate of food. Once he was fully settled, he said, \u201cI come bearing both good and bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d Colin said dryly.</p> <p>\u201cI have been betrayed in France.\u201d</p><p>Colin winced. \u201cDid Cartland forfeit the names of everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would appear so. I believe that is how he was able to prove his loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man has loyalty to no one but himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true.\u201d Quinn stabbed a piece of meat, brought it to his mouth, and chewed angrily.</p><p>\u201cSo that is the bad news, then. What is the good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have been able to secure a promise of a pardon for all of us, including you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible if they hunt you as well?\u201d</p><p>Quinn\u2019s smile was grim. \u201cLeroux was valuable to the agent-general, enough so that the capture of his killer is of greater concern than the routing of English spies. I was allowed to leave on the promise that I would return with the murderer\u2014whoever that may be. To guarantee my return, they hold the others Cartland betrayed.\u201d</p><p>Colin straightened. \u201cBy God . . . we must work swiftly, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Quinn finished off his pint. \u201cAnd there are conditions to complicate matters. First, I must persuade Lord Eddington to release a French spy whom he has in captivity. Then, we must convince a member of Cartland\u2019s group\u2014a man named Depardue\u2014to vouch that Cartland has confessed to the crime.\u201d</p><p>The first seemed unlikely, and the second seemed highly difficult, but Colin would take what opportunities were given to him and gladly.</p><p>I want to know you, Amelia had said. If only he had the chance to make that happen.</p><p>\u201cYou seem unduly pleased by this,\u201d Quinn said around a bite. \u201cIt is not much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw Amelia,\u201d Colin confessed. Held her, touched her, tasted her.</p><p>Quinn stilled with a forkful of food lifted halfway to his mouth. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is complicated, but hopeful.\u201d</p><p>Setting his utensils down, Quinn gestured for more ale. \u201cHow did she take your emergence from the grave?\u201d</p><p>Colin smiled ruefully and explained.</p><p>\u201cA mask?\u201d Quinn asked when he finished. \u201cOut of all the guises you are capable of donning, you chose a mask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginally, it suited the masquerade. Later, she saw it on Jacques and it drew her to him. It seemed appropriate to wear it a third time under those circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is more like her sister than I thought.\u201d Quinn\u2019s lips curved into the slight smile he always wore when referring to Maria. \u201cHowever, I fail to see how the situation is hopeful. Amelia has no idea who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a bit of a problem,\u201d Colin agreed.</p><p>\u201cA bit? My friend, you are the master of understatement. Trust me, she will not take the news well. She will take it as lack of affection. When she discovers that you were not chaste and pining for her the entire time, she will have her proof that you do not love her.\u201d</p><p>Colin heaved out a sigh and sank back into his chair. \u201cThis was your plan! You said that I should become a man of means in order to make her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso to make you happy. You would always doubt your worth if you came to her as an underling.\u201d Quinn smiled at the serving girl who brought over the fresh pint, then sat back and studied Colin for a long moment. \u201cI hear she is betrothed to the Earl of Ware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be a marchioness, despite her father\u2019s scandal and her sibling\u2019s reputation. Quite an accomplishment.\u201d</p><p>Glancing around the room, Colin\u2019s gaze paused a moment on every patron, taking stock of each one. \u201cYes, but she does not love him. She still loves me. Or rather, the boy I used to be.\u201d</p><p>A lovely blonde entered the room from the staircase that led to the bedchambers above. Dressed in deep purple and wearing a black ribbon and cameo at her throat, she reminded Colin of a doll. Her delicate features and slender build roused protective instincts, her heavy-lidded eyes and full, red lips inspired carnal musings.</p><p>His brows lifted as she turned her head and locked eyes with him. Her smile made him frown in confusion, and he watched her approach with much curiosity, pushing to his feet when she came to a halt behind Quinn.</p><p>She set her hands on the Irishman\u2019s broad shoulders. \u201cYou should have told me you were back, mon amour,\u201d she said, her voice inflected with an unmistakable French accent.</p><p>The look Quinn shot Colin was intriguing, bearing more than a trace of irritation. He did not stand, merely caught the blonde\u2019s hand and tugged her around, directing her to a chair he pulled closer with his foot. Considering Quinn\u2019s love of females, his apparent disinterest in such a beautiful woman was beyond surprising. In close proximity, she was a delight. Pale blue eyes were framed by long, thick chocolate lashes and accented by finely arched brows.</p><p>\u201cIs this him?\u201d she asked, studying Colin with an appreciative eye.</p><p>Quinn growled.</p><p>She smiled wide, revealing straight white teeth. She offered her hand and said, \u201cI am Lysette Rousseau. You are Monsieur Mitchell, oui?\u201d</p><p>Colin glanced at Quinn, who cursed under his breath and resumed his meal. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he replied with caution.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Should it become necessary to kill you, it will be much easier now that I have catalogued your appearance.\u201d</p><p>Blinking, he asked, \u201cWhat the devil did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProvoking wench,\u201d Quinn muttered. \u201cHe is innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all say that,\u201d she replied sweetly.</p><p>\u201cIt is true in this case,\u201d Quinn argued.</p><p>\u201cThey all say that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me.\u201d Colin glanced between them. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Quinn gestured toward Lysette with an off-hand jerking of his fork. \u201cShe is an additional part of my guarantee. She is to return to France with either Cartland, you or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a confession,\u201d she purred. \u201cA confession from any of you would suffice. See? I am not so difficult to please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Resuming his seat, Colin examined the Frenchwoman. It was then that he noted a hardness to her eyes and mouth that he had missed before. \u201cHow do you find these femmes fatales, Quinn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey find me,\u201d Quinn grumbled, biting into a potato with gusto born of frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou see only the negatives,\u201d Lysette said, gesturing for service. \u201cThere are three of us at this table, all searching for the same thing. I am here to assist you.\u201d</p><p>Quinn glared. \u201cIf you think holding a sword over my head is endearing, you are sadly mistaken.\u201d</p><p>Colin was not so quick to dismiss her. \u201cHow can you help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn many ways.\u201d The blonde took a brief moment to order wine from the attending serving girl. \u201cThink of the places I can go where you cannot. All the people who might speak to me but not to you. All the wiles I employ as a woman that you cannot employ as a man. Why, the possibilities are endless!\u201d She lifted a delicate hand to the cameo at her throat, and he found it nearly impossible to imagine her killing anyone.</p><p>\u201cHow does your participation relate to Depardue?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>Something dark passed over her features. \u201cIf he resolves this, it will save me the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe agent-general is determined to leave nothing to chance,\u201d Quinn explained. \u201cDepardue watches Cartland. Lysette watches me. They perform the same service. She is an added . . . warranty.\u201d</p><p>Colin winced. \u201cI cannot imagine Depardue appreciates the intimation that he might not be successful.\u201d He looked at Lysette, wondering what the lure of such a position would be. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy reasons are my own. A word of advice\u201d\u2014she stared at him intently\u2014\u201cyou can trust nothing about me except this: I want Leroux\u2019s killer brought to justice.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling harshly, Colin drummed his fingertips atop the table. \u201cI do not like this. While Cartland hunts me, we have a serpent in our midst.\u201d</p><p>Quinn nodded his agreement.</p><p>Lysette pouted as she accepted the goblet she had ordered previously. \u201cI would rather be Eve than the snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve was alluring,\u201d Quinn retorted.</p><p>Colin choked, never having heard the Irishman say an unkind word to a female before.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you accomplished up to this point?\u201d she asked, dismissing Quinn\u2019s rudeness and directing her attention to Colin.</p><p>\u201cMy days are spent evading Cartland and anyone who sounds French, and my nights are spent searching for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the most ridiculous plan I have ever heard,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest I do, then?\u201d he challenged. \u201cI know nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you must learn.\u201d Lysette took a dainty sip of the blood red wine and licked her lips. She sat with a ramrod straight spine and uplifted chin, the hallmarks of good breeding and proper schooling. \u201cYou cannot do that while hiding, which is exactly what Cartland will expect you to be doing. Why do you not contact the man you both work for? Surely, he has the resources to help you bring this to a swift end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not his purpose,\u201d Quinn argued. \u201cWe are responsible for the managing of our assignments. If we are caught, the cost is ours to pay. I expect your arrangement is similar.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, it seemed frustration marred the Frenchwoman\u2019s lovely features, and then it was gone, replaced by a honeyed, careless smile.</p><p>Colin could not help but wonder at her, and contemplate how much of a risk she presented. She was so slender and feminine, yet he knew from tales of Amelia\u2019s sister that appearances could be very deceiving. \u201cDo you have other suggestions, mademoiselle? Perhaps you think I should search in the bright light of day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you wear a mask?\u201d Quinn asked, finally pushing his plate aside.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he?\u201d She raked Colin with an assessing glance from the top of his head, down the length of his outstretched legs, to his booted feet. \u201cIt would be a shame to conceal such comeliness.\u201d Her mouth curved seductively. \u201cI should like to view all of it.\u201d</p><p>Quinn snorted. \u201cNow, you see, love. That is why you are not Eve. You lack the sense required to see the man is taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may wear a blindfold,\u201d she offered Colin with a wink, \u201cand call me by whatever name you prefer.\u201d</p><p>Colin laughed for the first time in days.</p><p>\u201cWatch out for her,\u201d Quinn warned.</p><p>\u201cI will leave that task to you. I leave for Bristol in the morning. Cartland\u2019s past may be affecting his present. I hope that something can be discovered that might give me some advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thinking.\u201d Quinn\u2019s lips pursed with thought. \u201cLysette and I will stay behind and make inquiries here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not comfortable allowing him to go off alone,\u201d she said, with an underlying note of steel to her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou will grow accustomed.\u201d Quinn lounged in his chair with his usual insolent grace\u2014his body canted to the side, his arm slung across the spindle back, his legs spread wide.</p><p>\u201cAs handsome as you are,\u201d she sniffed, \u201cI sometimes find it difficult to like you.\u201d</p><p>Quinn grinned. \u201cSo we are in accord. Mitchell will search elsewhere. You and I will work together in Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I wish to go with him instead.\u201d Lysette\u2019s smile did not reach her lovely eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, would you?!\u201d Quinn\u2019s exaggerated pleasure made Colin laugh again. \u201cHow delightful. At least for me, if not for Mitchell. Sorry, chap.\u201d He shrugged one shoulder and set his hand on the table.</p><p>Before either of them could anticipate the action, Lysette was on her feet and Quinn\u2019s discarded knife was piercing the table with precision . . . directly between his casually splayed fingers.</p><p>He froze and stared at how close he had come to losing a finger or two. \u201cDamnation.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over him. \u201cDo not mock or underestimate me, mon amour. It is not wise to prick my temper.\u201d</p><p>Colin stood. \u201cThank you for the kind offer of your companion\u2019s company,\u201d he said hastily, \u201cbut I must respectfully decline.\u201d</p><p>Lysette looked at him with a narrowed glance.</p><p>\u201cYou trust me not at all,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I promise you this: I have every reason to clear my name and no reason to flee.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she did not move. Then her mouth lifted slightly at the corner. \u201cYour woman is here.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, but an acknowledgment wasn\u2019t necessary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She waved him off with a graceful toss of her wrist. \u201cYou will not stray far. Good luck to you.\u201d</p><p>After a quick bow, Colin reached into his pocket and tossed coins on the table. \u201cI will pray for you,\u201d he said to Quinn, squeezing his friend\u2019s shoulder as he passed.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s reply was a blistering curse.</p><p>Chapter 7</p> <p>It was a small but fine house in a respectable neighborhood. The Earl of Ware had owned it for three years now, and during that time, it had rarely been unoccupied.</p><p>Tonight the lower windows were dark, but candlelight flickered from one upper sash. He pushed his key into the front door lock and allowed himself entry. The home was maintained by two servants, a husband and wife pair who were trustworthy and discreet. They were abed now, and since he did not require their services, Ware did not disturb them.</p><p>He set his hat on the hook, followed by his cloak. Beneath that he wore the evening garments he had donned for another night in an endless string of nights spent at balls and routs. Except this evening had been slightly different. Amelia was different. He was different. The awareness between them had changed. She saw him in a new light, as he saw her in altered fashion as well.</p><p>Climbing the steps to the upper floor, he paused a moment outside the one door where light peeked out from the gap at the bottom. Ware exhaled, taking a moment to relish the thrumming of blood in his veins and the quickening of his arousal. Then he turned the knob and entered, finding his dark-haired, sloe-eyed mistress reading quietly in bed.</p><p>Her gaze lifted to meet his. He watched her breathing quicken and her lips part. The book was shut with a decisive snap, and he kicked the portal closed behind him.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Jane breathed, tossing back the covers, revealing a shapely figure. \u201cI was hoping you would come tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ware\u2019s mouth curved. She was hot for it, which meant the first fuck could be hard and swift. Later, they would take their time, but now such dalliance would not be necessary. A circumstance that suited his mood.</p><p>From the moment he had first seen the stunning widow, he\u2019d wanted her. When her last arrangement with Lord Riley ended, Ware approached her with haste before anyone else could lure her away. She was flattered and, later, enthusiastic. They suited each other well, and the sex was pleasurable for both.</p><p>He shrugged out of his coat; she untied the belt of her robe. Within moments he was deep inside her\u2014her hips on the edge of the mattress, his feet on the floor as he drove powerfully into her writhing body. His frustration and unease were forgotten in the maelstrom of carnal sensation, much to his relief.</p><p>But the surcease did not last long.</p><p>An hour later he rested on his back with his hand tucked behind his head, his sweat-drenched skin cooling in the evening air.</p> <p>\u201cThat was delicious,\u201d Jane murmured, her voice throaty from passionate cries. \u201cYou are always so primitive when aggravated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAggravated?\u201d He laughed and tucked her closer to his side.</p><p>\u201cYes. I can tell when something is troubling you.\u201d Her hand stroked down the center of his chest.</p><p>Ware stared up at the ornate ceiling moldings and thought again of how well the room suited her, with its rose and cream colors and gilded furnishings. He had encouraged her to spare no expense and to think only of her own comfort, having found over the course of several mistresses that a woman\u2019s taste in d\u00e9cor spoke a great deal about her. \u201cMust we talk of things unpleasant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could work your frustrations into exhaustion,\u201d she teased, lifting her head to reveal laughing dark eyes. \u201cYou know I will not complain.\u201d</p><p>He brushed back the damp strands of hair that clung to her temple. \u201cI prefer that solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it would be only a temporary measure. As a woman, I might be able to assist you with your problem, which I suspect is feminine in nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are helping me,\u201d he purred.</p> <p>Her raised brows spoke of her skepticism, but she did not press him.</p><p>Exhaling harshly, he shared his thoughts aloud, trusting Jane as a friend and confidante. She was a sweet woman, one of the sweetest he knew. She was not the kind of soul who sought to hurt others or advance herself at another\u2019s detriment.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize that a man of my station is rarely seen as a man?\u201d he asked. \u201cI am lands, money, and prestige, but rarely more than that.\u201d</p><p>She listened quietly but alert.</p><p>\u201cI spent my youth in Lincolnshire, raised to think of myself only as Ware and never as an individual. I had no interests outside of my duties, no goals beyond that of my title. I was trained so well that it never occurred to me to want something of my own, something that had nothing to do with the marquessate and everything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a very lonely way to live.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and shoved another pillow under his head. \u201cI had no notion of any other way.\u201d</p><p>When he held his silence, she prompted, \u201cUntil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil one day I traversed the perimeter of our property and chanced upon an urchin preparing to fish in my stream.\u201d</p><p>Jane smiled and slid from his arms and the bed, donning her discarded robe before moving to the console and pouring a libation. \u201cWho was this urchin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA servant from the neighboring property. He was waiting for the young lady whose father he worked for. They had struck up a friendship of sorts, which intrigued me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs did the young lady.\u201d She warmed the brandy expertly by rolling the glass over the flame of a taper.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe was young, wild, and free. Miss Benbridge showed me how different the world looked through the eyes of one who suffered under no one\u2019s expectations. She also completely disregarded my title and treated me just as she treated the urchin, with playful affection.\u201d</p><p>Jane sat on the edge of the bed and drank lightly, then passed the goblet over to him. \u201cI think I would like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI believe she would like you, as well.\u201d</p><p>They would never meet, of course, but that was not the point.</p><p>\u201cI admire you for marrying her,\u201d she said, \u201cdespite the sins of her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not marry her? She is the person who taught me that I had value in and of myself. My aristocratic arrogance is now tempered with personal arrogance.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Jane curled over his legs. \u201cHow fortunate for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Ware ran a hand through his unbound hair. \u201cI will never forget the afternoon when she said, quite innocently, that I was devilishly handsome, which was why she sometimes halted her speech midsentence. No one had ever said such a thing to me. I doubt anyone had ever felt it. When they stuttered it was because of intimidation, not admiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you that you are comely, my lord,\u201d she said, the sparkle in her eyes giving proof to her words. \u201cThere are few men as handsome as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be true. I do not compare myself to other men, so I would not know.\u201d He drank in large swallows. \u201cBut I suspect my attractiveness has more weight when I believe in it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfidence is a potent lure,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cBecause she had no expectations of me, I was able to be myself with her. It was the first time in my life that I spoke without considering the confines of my station. I practiced wooing with her and said things aloud that I had never allowed myself to even consider.\u201d He looked down the foot of the bed and into the fire in the grate. \u201cI suppose I grew into my own by knowing her.\u201d</p><p>Running her fingertips down his bare thigh, she asked, \u201cDo you feel as if you owe a debt to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly, but our relationship has never been one-sided. We practiced deportment together and conversation. I had experience with such things; she was so sheltered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave her polish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We both gained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now she belongs to you,\u201d Jane pronounced, \u201cbecause you helped to create her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Ware frowned. Was that where this disgruntlement came from? Did he simply feel proprietary? \u201cI am not sure that is it. She was in love once\u2014or so she says\u2014and she still pines for him. I do not resent that. I accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps \u2018appreciate\u2019 would be a more apt word?\u201d Her lips lifted in a kind smile. \u201cAfter all, she cannot burden you with elevated feelings if they are engaged elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>He tossed back the rest of his brandy, filling his belly with fire, then thrust the goblet at her in a silent demand for more. \u201cIf that were true, why am I so annoyed by her fascination with another man?\u201d</p><p>As she accepted the glass, her brows rose. \u201cAnnoyed? Or jealous?\u201d</p><p>Ware laughed. \u201cA little of both?\u201d He waved one hand carelessly. \u201cPerhaps my masculine sensibilities are piqued because she never felt such interest in me? I cannot say for certain. I only know that I doubt myself again. I am wondering if my decision to give her the space and time to heal was an error in judgment.\u201d</p><p>Jane paused halfway to the console. \u201cWho is this other man?\u201d</p><p>He explained.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She refilled his glass and warmed the liquor, then returned to him. \u201cYou know I cared deeply for my late husband.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Ware patted the spot next to him. She crawled up beside him, baring her lithe legs to his view. \u201cBut I was tempted to marry another, whom I did not love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou jest,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cWomen want nothing so much as they want devotion and pronouncements of undying affection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we are also pragmatic. If you offer Miss Benbridge all the practical things she covets that this other man cannot provide, she will be more tempted to select you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pointed out that his foreign title would require her to leave her sister behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerbally, you did, yes. Now make it even more difficult by proving it in fact. Take her to see your properties, purchase a home near her sibling . . . things of that nature. Then, consider her love of romance and mystery. Put that into play, as well. You can seduce her easily. You have the skill and she is susceptible. Flowers, gifts, stolen kisses. Your competition is working in the shadows. You have no such limitations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be fun for you both. A chance to learn more about each other than you now know.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and linked his fingers with hers. \u201cYou are so clever.\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s mouth curved in her winsome smile. \u201cI am a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am ever aware of that fact.\u201d Reaching to the side, Ware set his goblet atop the bedside table and pulled her beneath him. He kissed her, then moved lower, nudging the edge of the robe aside to take a nipple in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s nice,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>Lifting his head, he grinned. \u201cThank you for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy motives are not entirely altruistic, you know. Perhaps you will become aggravated during your attempts to woo Miss Benbridge. I do so love it when you are less than controlled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinx.\u201d He gave a mock growl and she shivered.</p><p>Which prompted Ware to spend the rest of the hours until morning playing the primitive lover to both their delights.</p><p>Amelia peeked around the corner of the house, her lower lip worried between her teeth. She searched for Colin in the stable yard, then heaved a sigh of relief when she found the area empty. Male voices drifted on the wind, laughter and singing spilling out from the stables. From this she knew Colin was hard at work with his uncle, which meant that she could safely leave the manse and head into the woods.</p><p>She was becoming quite good at subterfuge, she thought as she moved deftly through the trees, hiding from the occasional guard in her journey toward the fence. A fortnight had passed since that fateful afternoon when she had caught Colin behind the shop with that girl. Amelia had avoided him since, refusing to speak with him when he asked the cook to fetch her.</p><p>Perhaps it was foolish to hope that she would never see him again, given how closely their lives were entwined. If so, she was a fool. There was not an hour of the day that passed without her thinking of him, but she managed the pain of her grief as long as he stayed away from her. She saw no reason for them to meet, to talk, to acknowledge each other. She traveled by carriage only when moving to a new home, and even then, she could deal exclusively with Pietro, the coachman.</p><p>Espying the waited-for opening, Amelia hopped deftly over the fence and ran to the stream, where she found Ware coatless and wigless, with his shirtsleeves pushed up. The young earl had caught some color to his skin these last weeks, setting aside his life of book work in favor of hard outdoor play. With his dark brown locks tied in a queue and his cornflower-colored eyes smiling, he was quite handsome, his aquiline features boasting centuries of pure blue blood.</p><p>He did not set her heart to racing or make her ache in unfamiliar places as Colin did, but Ware was charming and polite and attractive. She supposed that was a sufficient enough combination of qualities to make him the recipient of her first kiss. Miss Pool told her to wait until the right young man came along, but Colin already had, and had turned to another instead.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Miss Benbridge, \u201d the earl greeted with a perfect bow.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, \u201d she replied, lifting the sides of her rose-hued gown before curtsying.</p><p>\u201cI have a treat for you today. \u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Her eyes widened in anticipation. She loved gifts and surprises because she rarely received them. Her father simply could not be bothered to consider such things as birthdays or other gift-giving occasions.</p><p>Ware\u2019s smile was indulgent. \u201cYes, princess.\u201d He offered his arm to her. \u201cCome with me. \u201d</p><p>Amelia set her fingers lightly atop his forearm, enjoying the opportunity to practice her social graces with someone. The earl was kind and patient, pointing out any errors and correcting her. It gave her a higher polish and a deeper confidence. She no longer felt like a girl pretending to be a lady. Instead she felt like a lady who chose to enjoy her youth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Together they left their meeting place by the stream and wended their way along the shore until they reached a larger clearing. There Amelia was delighted to find a blanket stretched out on the ground, the corner of which was held down by a basket filled with delicious smelling tarts and various cuts of meat and cheeses.</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage this?\u201d she breathed, filled with pleasure by his thoughtfulness.</p><p>\u201cDear Amelia,\u201d he drawled, his eyes twinkling. \u201cYou know who I am now, and who I will be. I can manage anything.\u201d</p><p>She knew the rudiments of the peerage, and saw the power wielded by her father, a viscount. How many more times the magnitude was the power wielded by Ware, whose future held a marquessate?</p> <p>Her eyes widened at the thought.</p><p>\u201cCome now,\u201d he urged. \u201cHave a seat, enjoy a peach tart, and tell me about your day. \u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is dreadfully boring, \u201d she said, dropping to the ground with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me a tale. Surely you daydream about something.\u201d</p><p>She dreamt about kisses given passionately by a dark-eyed Gypsy lover, but she would never say such a thing aloud. She rose to her knees and dug into the basket to hide her blush. \u201cI lack imagination,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Ware situated himself on his back with his hands clasped at his neck and stared up at the sky. He looked as at ease as she had ever seen him. Despite the rather formal attire he wore\u2014including pristine white stockings and polished heels\u2014he was still a far more relaxed person than the one she met weeks ago. Amelia found that she rather liked the new earl and felt a touch of pleasure that she had wrought what she considered to be a positive change in him.</p><p>\u201cIt appears I must regale you with a story,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d She settled back to a seated position and took a bite of her treat.</p><p>\u201cOnce upon a time . . .\u201d</p><p>Amelia watched Ware\u2019s lips move as he spoke, and imagined kissing them. A now-familiar sense of sadness shivered through her, an effect of leaving her beloved romantic notions behind and embracing unfamiliar new ones, but the sensation lessened as she thought of Colin and what he had done. He certainly did not feel any sadness about leaving her behind.</p><p>\u201cWould you kiss me?\u201d she blurted out, her fingertips brushing tart crumbs from the corners of her lips.</p> <p>The earl paused midsentence and turned his head to look at her. His eyes were wide with surprise, but he appeared more intrigued than dismayed. \u201cBeg your pardon. Did I hear you correctly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you kissed a girl before?\u201d she asked, curious. He was two years older than she was, only one year younger than Colin. It was quite possible that he had experience.</p><p>Colin had an edgy, dark restlessness about him that was seductive even to her na\u00efve senses. Ware, on the other hand, was far more leisurely, his attractiveness stemming from innate command and the comfort of knowing the world was his for the taking. Still, despite her high regard for Colin, she could see how Ware\u2019s lazy charm appealed.</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cA gentleman does not speak of such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful! Somehow, I knew you would be discreet. \u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cRepeat the request again,\u201d he murmured, watching her carefully.</p><p>\u201cWould you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a hypothetical question, or a call to action?\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly shy and unsure, Amelia looked away.</p><p>\u201cAmelia, \u201d he said softly, bringing her gaze back to his. There was deep kindness there on his handsome patrician features, and she was grateful for it. He rolled to his side and then pushed up to a seated position.</p><p>\u201cNot hypothetical, \u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you wish to be kissed?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d His lips pursed a moment. \u201cWould Benny suffice? Or a footman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved in a slow smile that made something flutter in her belly. It was not an outright flip, as was caused by Colin\u2019s dimples, but it was certainly a herald of her new awareness of her friend.</p><p>\u201cI will not kiss you today,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to think upon it further. If you feel the same when next we meet, I will kiss you then.\u201d</p><p>Amelia wrinkled her nose. \u201cIf you have no taste for me, simply say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my hotheaded princess,\u201d he soothed, his hand catching hers, his thumb stroking the back. \u201cYou jump to conclusions just as you jump into trouble\u2014with both feet. I will catch you, fair Amelia. I look forward to catching you. \u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed, blinking at the suggestive undertone to his words.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Amelia was awakened by the knock that came to her bedchamber door. She lay curled in a ball, her eyes closed, her sleep-foggy mind praying that she could drift back into sleep and rejoin her vivid dreams. Dreams that reminded her of the rare connection she had with Ware and how precious that bond was to her.</p><p>But the knocking came again, more insistent. Harsh reality intruded, and she mourned the loss of her nocturnal reminiscences.</p><p>\u201cAmelia?\u201d</p><p>Maria. The one person in the household that she could not ignore.</p><p>Calling out in a sleep-husky voice, Amelia struggled to a seated position and watched as the portal swung open and her sister stepped into view.</p><p>\u201cHello, poppet,\u201d Maria said, gliding toward her with an elegance she had long envied. \u201cSorry to wake you. It is late morning, however, so I did wait. Sadly, the length of my patience is probably not as long as you would like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do so love that gown on you,\u201d Amelia replied, admiring the cream-colored muslin and its appeal next to Maria\u2019s olive skin.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Maria took a seat on the slipper chair near the window. \u201cDid you have a good evening?\u201d</p><p>Visions of Ware, dashing in evening attire, filled Amelia\u2019s mind. Last night had been one in an endless string of nights spent at balls and routs. Except last evening had been marginally different. She was different. Ware was different. The awareness between them had changed, and she knew instinctively that it would never be the same.</p><p>He was pressing forward, maneuvering expertly, forcing her to see their situation in cold, hard facts. After an entire childhood filled with falsehoods and evasions, she was normally grateful for his candor. In this instance, however, it served only to increase her feelings of guilt and confusion.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lovely evening,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d The sound was clearly skeptical. \u201cYou have been melancholy of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are here to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Ware almost kissed you on the terrace yesterday afternoon, and yet last night you did not appear any more eager to see him than usual. How could I not ask you about it?\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, Amelia\u2019s head dropped back onto the pillow.</p><p>\u201cIf you would share your burdens with me,\u201d Maria coaxed, \u201cperhaps I could help. I should like to.\u201d</p><p>Opening her eyes, Amelia looked up at the satin lining of her canopy and remembered an earlier time. Her room was decorated in various shades of blue, from pale to dark, just as her childhood bedchamber had been. She\u2019d made the choice consciously, an external declaration of her decision to pick up where her relationship with her sister had been cruelly severed. Her father had stolen years from them, but in this room she felt as if she reclaimed them.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to help me with, Maria. There is nothing to mend or alter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of your masked admirer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not be seeing him again.\u201d</p><p>There was a pregnant pause, then, \u201cThe last you spoke of him was not with such finality in your tone. You saw him a second time, did you not? He sought you out.\u201d</p><p>Amelia turned her head to meet her sister\u2019s gaze. \u201cI lured him to me, and he was angry at me for doing so. He intends to leave Town now, to keep his distance and to prevent me from reaching out to him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shows a care for your reputation by this action, but you are upset by it.\u201d Confusion filled Maria\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Tossing up her hands, Amelia said, \u201cBecause I do not want him to go! I want to know him, and it pains me greatly that I will not be given that chance. I am distressing Ware and you, yet I cannot seem to set aside my fascination nor can I ignore how weary I am of being left behind. I had enough of such treatment with my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia . . .\u201d Maria held out a hand to her. \u201cWhat is it about this man that has captured you so? Is he comely? No . . . don\u2019t become angry. I simply wish to understand.\u201d</p><p>Amelia sighed. Lack of sleep and inability to eat were taking their toll. She could not fight the feeling that Montoya was slipping away, that every moment when she did nothing took him farther from her. It frustrated her and made her snappish.</p><p>\u201cHe wore the mask again,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI\u2019ve no notion of what he looks like beneath it, but I do not care. I am moved by the way he talks to me, the way he touches me, the way he kisses me. There is reverence in his handling of me, Maria. Longing. Desire. I do not believe such depth of affection can be feigned. Not the way he expresses it.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Maria looked away, lost in thought. Dark ringlets swung around her bared shoulders and betrayed how unsettled she felt. \u201cHow can he feel such things for you after only a few moments\u2019 acquaintance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says I remind him of a lover lost to him, but in truth I sense he wants me for myself in addition to that.\u201d Amelia\u2019s fingertips plucked at the edge of her bed linens. \u201cHe originally approached me because of her, but when he came again it was for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am certain of nothing, and now I suppose I never will be.\u201d She looked toward the open door to her boudoir, afraid her features would reveal too much.</p><p>\u201cBecause he is departing.\u201d Maria\u2019s voice softened. \u201cDid he say why or where he intends to travel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he is in danger of some sort. Deadly danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom St. John? Or someone else?\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s hands fisted into the counterpane. \u201cHe has nothing to do with your husband. He said as much and I believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Maria soothed, standing again. \u201cI know you are distraught, but do not vent your frustration on me. I want to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Amelia challenged. \u201cWill you help me find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Frozen with disbelief, Amelia stared at her sibling. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Maria\u2019s shoulders went back, a sure sign of her determination. \u201cSt. John\u2019s men look for him, but we have an advantage. You are the only person to manage close proximity to this man.\u201d</p><p>Amelia was speechless for a moment. She had not expected anyone to champion her desire to pursue Montoya, and she could not have selected a better person to help her than Maria, who was afraid of nothing and well versed in finding things that did not wish to be found. \u201cWare searches for him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Count Montoya,\u201d Maria said, sitting on the edge of the bed beside her and collecting her hands. \u201cI pity him. He espies a pretty woman and because of it, becomes hunted from all sides. St. John will seek him in a criminal\u2019s fashion. Ware will seek him in a peer\u2019s fashion. So you and I must seek Montoya in a woman\u2019s fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would that be?\u201d Amelia asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cBy shopping, of course.\u201d Maria smiled, and the entire room brightened. \u201cWe will visit all the purveyors of masks that we can find and see if any recall the count. If he always covers his face, he must procure a great many of the things. If not, perhaps it was a recent purchase and he left an indelible impression. It is not much, but it\u2019s a start. We will have to take care, of course. If he is in danger, finding him will bring that danger to us. You must trust me and listen to me implicitly. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Amelia\u2019s lower lip quivered, and she bit it to hide the betraying movement. Her hands tightened on her sister\u2019s. \u201cThank you, Maria. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>Maria caught her close and kissed her forehead. \u201cI will always be here to help you, poppet. Always.\u201d</p><p>The quiet declaration gave Amelia strength, and she clung to it as she slipped from the bed and began to prepare for the day ahead.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>There was a leisurely pace to the pedestrians, carts, and carriages that traveled down the street. The day was sunny and comfortably warm, the air cleansed from a brief spate of early morning rain. Colin, however, was far from relaxed. Something about the day did not sit well with him.</p><p>\u201cYou should not worry so much,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cShe will be fine. No one has connected you to your past or to Miss Benbridge.\u201d</p><p>Colin smiled ruefully. \u201cAm I so transparent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui. In your unguarded moments.\u201d</p><p>Staring out the carriage window, Colin noted the many people going about their daily business. For his part, his business this afternoon was leaving Town. His carriage was presently wending its way toward the road that would lead them to Bristol. Their trunks were loaded and their account with the rental property was settled.</p><p>He remained unsettled.</p><p>The feeling that he was leaving his heart behind was worse than before. His mortality was something he began to feel more keenly each day. Life was finite, and the thought that the entirety of his would be spent without Amelia in it was too painful to bear.</p><p>\u201cI have never shared a carriage with her,\u201d he said, his gloved fingers wrapping around the window ledge. \u201cI have never sat at a table with her and shared a meal. Everything I have done these last years was in pursuit of a higher station, one that would afford me the privilege to enjoy all the facets of her life.\u201d</p><p>Jacques\u2019s dark eyes watched him from beneath the rim of his hat. He sat on the opposite squab, his compact body as relaxed as Colin had ever seen it, but still thrumming with energy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSoon after my parents died,\u201d Colin murmured, staring out at the view of the street, \u201cmy uncle accepted the position of coachman to Lord Welton. The wages were dismal and we were forced to leave the Romany camp, but my uncle felt it was more stable than the Gypsy life. He had been a dedicated bachelor prior to my arrival, but he took the burden of my care very seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that is where your honor comes from,\u201d the Frenchman said.</p><p>Colin smiled slightly. \u201cI was wretched at the change. At ten years of age, I felt the loss of my friends keenly, especially following so soon after the loss of my father and mother. I was certain my life was over and I would be miserable forever. And then, I saw her.\u201d</p><p>In his mind\u2019s eye, he remembered the day as if it were yesterday. \u201cShe was only seven years old, but I was awed. With her dark curls, porcelain skin, and green eyes, she looked like a beautiful doll. Then she held out a dirty hand to me, smiled a smile that was missing teeth, and asked me to play.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnchant\u00e9,\u201d Jacques murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, she was. Amelia was a dozen playmates in one\u2014adventurous, challenging, and resourceful. I rushed through my chores just so I could be with her.\u201d Sighing, Colin leaned his head back against the squab and closed his eyes. \u201cI remember the day I first rode as rear footman on the carriage. I felt so mature and proud of my accomplishment. She was happy for me, too, her eyes bright and filled with joy. Then, I realized that while she sat inside, I stood outside, and I would never be allowed to sit with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have changed a great deal since then, mon ami. There is no such divide between you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there is a divide,\u201d Colin argued. \u201cIt just is not a monetary one any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you know that you loved her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI loved her from the first.\u201d His hand fisted where it rested atop his thigh. \u201cThe feeling just grew and changed, as we both did.\u201d</p><p>He would never forget the afternoon when they had played in the stream, as they often did. He in his breeches, she stripped to her chemise. She had just reached fifteen years, he ten and eight. He had stumbled across the pebbled shore, attempting to catch a fleeing frog, when he\u2019d fallen. Her delighted laughter turned his head, and the sight of her had changed his life forever. Bathed in sunlight, drenched in water, her beautiful features transformed by merriment, she had seemed a water nymph to him. Alluring. Innocently seductive.</p><p>His breath had caught in his throat; his body had hardened. Heated cravings burned in his blood and dried his mouth. His cock\u2014which had become an aching, demanding torment as he\u2019d matured\u2014throbbed with painful pressure. He was no innocent, but the physical urgings he\u2019d appeased before were merely annoying when compared to the need wrought by the sight of Amelia\u2019s seminude body.</p><p>Somehow . . . sometime, when he hadn\u2019t been looking, Amelia had grown into a young woman. And he wanted her. Wanted her as he\u2019d never wanted anything before. His heart clenched with his sudden longing; his arms ached to hold her. Deep inside him, he felt an emptiness and knew she would fill it. Make him whole. Complete him. She\u2019d been everything to him as a child. He knew she would be everything to him as a man.</p><p>\u201cColin?\u201d Her smile had faded as tension filled the air between them.</p><p>Later that evening, Pietro noted his somberness and questioned him. When he\u2019d spilled out his discovery, his uncle reacted with novel ferocity.</p> <p>\u201cStay away from her,\u201d Pietro growled, his dark eyes burning in their intensity. \u201cI should have ended your friendship long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Colin had been horrified at the thought. He couldn\u2019t imagine his life without her.</p><p>Pietro slammed his fist on the table and loomed over him. \u201cShe is far above you. Beyond your reach. You will cost us our livelihood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her!\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth, he knew they were true.</p><p>Grim-faced, his uncle had dragged him out of their quarters in the stables and taken him into the village. There, he\u2019d thrusted Colin into the arms of a pretty whore who delighted in exhausting him and wringing him dry. A mature woman, she was unlike the marginally experienced girls he\u2019d dallied with before. She made certain he was spent. He left her bed with muscles turned to jelly and a need for a long nap.</p><p>When he\u2019d staggered into the nearby tavern hours later, his uncle had met him with a jovial smile and fatherly pride. \u201cNow you have another woman to love,\u201d he\u2019d pronounced, slapping him affectionately on the back.</p><p>To which Colin had corrected, \u201cI\u2019m grateful to her, yes. But I love only Amelia.\u201d</p><p>Pietro\u2019s face had fallen. The next day, when Colin saw Amelia and felt the same lustful longing as he\u2019d experienced at the stream, he\u2019d known instinctively that the sexual act would be different with her. Just as she\u2019d made the days brighter and his heart lighter, he knew she would make sex deeper and richer, too. The hunger he felt for that connection was inescapable. It gnawed at him and gave him no rest.</p> <p>Over the next few months, Pietro told him daily to leave her be. If he loved her, his uncle said, he would want the best for her, and a Gypsy stableboy could never be that.</p><p>And so he eventually found the fortitude to push her away out of love for her. It had killed him then.</p><p>It was killing him anew now.</p><p>The carriage dipped, swayed, and rumbled over the streets beneath it, every movement a signal that he was moving farther and farther away from the only thing he\u2019d ever wanted in this world.</p><p>\u201cYou will return to her,\u201d Jacques said quietly. \u201cIt is not the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil we finish this matter with Cartland, I cannot even consider having her. There is a reason Quinn continued to use Cartland even though he was troublesome\u2014he is an excellent tracker. As long as he is searching for me, I have no future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe in destiny, mon ami. And yours is not to die at that man\u2019s hands. I can promise you that.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded, but in truth, he was not so optimistic.</p><p>The white-gloved fingers that were curled around the carriage windowsill belonged to Montoya. Amelia knew it with bone-deep surety.</p><p>As the nondescript equipage passed her, she chanced a stray glance through the open window and spotted Jacques. Frozen in surprise, a shiver of discovery moved through her and filled her with hope. Then she noted the many trunks strapped to the back of the coach.</p><p>Montoya was leaving Town, just as he\u2019d said he would.</p><p>Fortuitously for her but unfortunate for him, his driver had chosen to travel along the very street she and Maria traversed in their search for him.</p><p>\u201cMaria,\u201d she said urgently, afraid to tear her gaze away for fear she would lose sight of him.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d her sister hummed distractedly. \u201cI see masks in the display here.\u201d</p><p>Before Amelia could protest, Maria slipped into the nearest store, the merry chiming of bells heralding her departure.</p><p>A multitude of pedestrians milled around them, though many steered clear due to Tim, who towered over everyone and guarded his charges with an eagle eye.</p><p>\u201cTim.\u201d Amelia lifted her hand and pointed at the carriage, which continued to move farther away. \u201cMontoya is in that black travel coach. We must move swiftly or we shall lose him.\u201d</p><p>The sensation of something precious sifting through her fingers caused a sort of anxiety she had never felt before. She grabbed her skirts and followed at a near run.</p><p>A hackney discharged its passengers a few yards up the street. Amelia hurried toward it with one hand lifted in a frantic wave.</p><p>Realizing her intent, Tim cursed under his breath, grabbed her elbow, and dragged her along. \u201cHalt!\u201d he roared as the driver raised his whip.</p><p>The man turned his head and froze at the sight of Tim. Swallowing hard, he nodded. When they reached the coach, Tim yanked the door open and thrust her up into it. He looked at the two lackeys who followed them. \u201cGo back with the others and find Mrs. St. John. Tell her what happened.\u201d</p><p>Sam, a red-haired man who had been in St. John\u2019s employ for years, gave a jerky nod. \u201cAye. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>Tim lunged into the coach, forcing Amelia back into the interior. \u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d she urged. \u201cYou can chastise me on the way.\u201d He glowered and cursed again, then yelled instructions to the driver.</p><p>The hackney lurched into motion, pulling away from the milling pedestrians and into the traffic of the street.</p><p>The doorbells were still chiming when Maria came to an abrupt halt just inside the door of the shop.</p><p>A tall, elegantly attired gentleman blocked her way to the deeper interior. At his side, a lovely blonde was wearing the very latest in French fashion. Maria\u2019s gaze moved from one to the other, noting what a handsome couple they made.</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d Maria gaped in startled recognition.</p><p>\u201cMhuirn\u00edn.\u201d As he captured her hand and lifted it to his lips, the tender affection in the beloved voice was palpable. \u201cYou look ravishing, as always.\u201d</p><p>Simon Quinn stood before her looking more sinfully delicious than any man had a right to. Dressed in buff-colored breeches and a dark green coat, his powerful frame drew the eye of every woman within viewing distance. He bore the form of a laborer, while clad in superbly tailored garments fit for the king himself.</p><p>\u201cI was not aware that you had returned to London,\u201d she chastised gently. \u201cAnd I admit I am more than slightly piqued that you did not seek me out immediately.\u201d</p><p>The Frenchwoman smiled a smile that never reached her cold, blue eyes. \u201cQuinn . . .\u201d She shook her head, setting the festive ribbons that adorned it to swaying. \u201cIt appears your poor treatment of women is an unfortunate recurring trait in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Maria frowned, unaccustomed to Simon being curt to lovely females.</p><p>The bells chimed again, and she attempted to step out of the way when her arm was caught by a grasping hand. Taken aback, she pivoted in a swirl of deep rose-colored skirts and found Sam looking far too anxious beside her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Amelia saw \u2019is coach,\u201d the lackey blurted out, \u201cand ran after \u2019im. Tim\u2019s with \u2019er, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia?\u201d It was then that Maria realized her sister was not beside her. She rushed back out the door and onto the crowded street.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Sam said, pointing at a hackney moving down the street.</p><p>\u201cShe saw Montoya?\u201d Maria asked, her gut knotting with apprehension. Lifting her skirts, she pushed her way through the milling pedestrians. Simon and the blonde came fast on her heels, and more of St. John\u2019s men barreled through directly after them. They were causing somewhat of a melee, but she did not care. Reaching Amelia was her only concern.</p><p>When it became apparent that there was no hope of catching up to them on foot, she stopped. \u201cI need my carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent for it,\u201d Sam assured from his position at her side.</p><p>\u201cSeek out St. John and explain.\u201d Her mind rushed ahead, planning out the possibilities of the next few hours. \u201cI will take the rest of the men with me. Once we find Amelia, someone will be sent back with our direction.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded his agreement and departed to collect his mount.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is going on?\u201d Simon asked, a frown marring the space between his brilliant blue eyes. The blonde, for her part, looked only vaguely interested.</p><p>Maria sighed. \u201cMy sister has become enamored of a masked stranger she met at a ball several nights ago, and she is chasing him.\u201d</p><p>The sudden tension that gripped Simon\u2019s frame increased her anxiety. If he sensed some danger from the situation, she knew it must be more than worry for a sibling that drove her.</p><p>\u201cI have been fretting over it ever since,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut she cannot be swayed. I attempted to reason with her, but she is determined to find him. As is St. John. I offered to assist Amelia in her search as a way to control at least a part of the whole affair, but apparently she spotted him on the street a few moments ago and is now giving chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God!\u201d Simon cried, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is delightful!\u201d Miss Rousseau said, her eyes finally showing some signs of life.</p><p>\u201cI will come with you,\u201d Simon said briskly, gesturing to his footman who waited nearby. The boy rushed off to fetch Simon\u2019s carriage.</p><p>\u201cYou do not have to become involved,\u201d Maria said, heaving out her breath. \u201cYou are presently engaged. Enjoy your day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are upset, mhuirn\u00edn. And perhaps I can help. We were on our way out of Town for holiday, as it was. Miss Rousseau does not mind the alteration of our destination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no indeed,\u201d the Frenchwoman said, smiling. \u201cIn fact, I should like to come along. Foolish young lovers are always so diverting.\u201d</p><p>Simon growled, the sound so edgy that Maria reconsidered her continuing protests and held her silence instead. Simon had been her lieutenant for many years, and his assistance would be tremendously valuable. Whatever the situation was between him and Miss Rousseau, it was for them alone to work out. She had enough trouble of her own to manage.</p><p>It was a few moments longer before the gleam of highly polished black lacquer heralded the approach of the St. John town coach. Maria hoped that the distance to be traveled was not one that would need the sturdier travel carriage.</p><p>Simon\u2019s equipage drew up behind hers, and with laudable haste they were all in hot pursuit.</p><p>Colin vaulted down from his travel coach with relief, his long legs cramped from the many hours spent traveling from London to the small posting inn just past Reading. He stood in the courtyard a moment and surveyed his moonlit surroundings. Jacques alighted behind him, and together they entered the inn to secure their lodging for the night.</p><p>The dim interior was quiet. Only a few patrons remained in the main room; the rest had retired. The necessary arrangements were quickly dealt with, and shortly, Colin found himself in a small, sparsely furnished room that was clean and comfortable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as he was alone, melancholy descended in a cold, weighty mantle. He was a day\u2019s ride away from Amelia, with the morrow bringing even more distance between them. Frustrated by the progression of events, he prayed sleep would offer him a brief respite, but after years of dreaming of Amelia, he did not hold out much hope.</p><p>He was reaching to close the curtains when the door opened behind him. Gripping the hilt of the dagger hidden in his coat, he canted his torso to make himself a smaller target.</p><p>\u201cMontoya.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s sweetly feminine voice caused him to freeze in midturn. He had hoped to be followed, but not by her. Now the danger that stalked him shadowed her as well.</p> <p>\u201cI had to see you,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYour carriage passed me in the street, and I could not allow you to go.\u201d</p><p>Only years of training and living by his wits leashed his surprise, preventing him from ruining everything by facing her. Instead he closed the drapes, dimming the gentle light of the moon before turning toward her. If he was fortunate, the banked fire in the grate would keep his face mostly in shadow, lessening the possibility of recognition.</p><p>Mentally prepared only for her reaction to him, Colin was completely vulnerable to his own reaction to her. The sight of her by the door\u2014and near a bed\u2014hit him like a blow, freeing a possessive, primitive growl from his tightened throat. She shivered at the sound, her lips parting with quickened breaths.</p><p>His hands clenched into fists at his sides. Did she know what she did to him?</p><p>She stood proud and undaunted before the door, a beribboned hat tied at a jaunty angle, her slender body encased in a gown of shimmering satin and delicate white lace. The innocent cut of the dress made the years fall away, made him hard as a rock and hot to claim her. He loved her deeply and completely with lingering traces of his boyish adoration, but he also lusted for her with every drop of the wild Gypsy blood in his veins.</p> <p>\u201cTell me you did not travel alone,\u201d he bit out, hating to think of such beauty unattended. She was a treasure to be secured and valued. The thought of her on the journey without a guard, unwittingly in jeopardy, tied him in knots.</p><p>\u201cI am protected.\u201d Her eyes glittered in the muted light, and she queried in a whisper, \u201cAre you angry with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said hoarsely, his heart thudding with rhythmic violence in his chest.</p><p>\u201cThe mask . . .\u201d She inhaled audibly. \u201cMost men look especially dashing in evening attire. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014move me always. Whatever you wear, wherever we are.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes closed as her praise rippled through him. He took an involuntary step toward her, then jerked to a halt. The room was suddenly too small and airless; the need to divest them both of every stitch of cloth was nearly overwhelming. His craving for her grew more ferocious, clawing and biting in its desire to be appeased.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy to see me?\u201d she asked in a small voice.</p><p>Colin shook his head, his eyes opening because he couldn\u2019t bear not to see her. \u201cIt kills me.\u201d</p><p>Tenderness swept over her finely wrought features and called to something deep inside him.</p><p>\u201cIt is the yearning I sense in you that lures me.\u201d She stepped closer, and he lifted a hand to halt her progress before she came too near. \u201cAs long as you want me, I will want you in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have ceased wanting you long ago,\u201d he rasped, \u201cif such a thing were possible.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted to the side as she considered him. \u201cYou lie.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist, he smiled at that. She was audacious still.</p> <p>\u201cYou enjoy wanting me,\u201d she said, with purely female satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI would enjoy having you more,\u201d he purred.</p><p>When her gaze shot to the bed, his cock swelled to full arousal. Her tongue darted out to lick her lower lip, and a rough, edgy sound rumbled from his chest.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d she entreated, her gaze returning to his. \u201cMeet my family. My sister and her husband can assist you. Whatever plagues you, they can help to resolve.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s gut tightened. He should say no . . . He should avoid bringing any danger into her life . . .</p><p>But the possibility of having her now . . . No more waiting, no more hiding . . .</p><p>It was night, a bed was near, and they were alone. His deepest fantasy made reality.</p><p>He stepped toward her. \u201cThere is something I must tell you. Something you will find difficult to understand. Do you have time to hear me out?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gloved hand and extended it to him. \u201cAs much as you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of those who came with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is drinking below.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI lied, you see. I pointed out a different patron and said I suspected he was you. So Tim is occupied with watching him, while I inquired discreetly and found you. You have a unique form\u2014so tall and broad. The maids noticed you when you came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of your reputation, then? A young woman of obviously fine breeding making inquiries about a bachelor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I learned where you were, I described my relief at finding my brother who is wearing dark green.\u201d</p><p>Colin glanced down at his blue garments. Dear God, was it true? Could he have her?</p><p>She beamed with obvious pride in her cleverness.</p><p>\u201cYou have gone to a great deal of trouble to find me, Miss Benbridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAnd yes I have.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cTurn around, then, and face the door.\u201d</p><p>Amelia frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to approach you, and I am not certain how much of my face can be seen in this light.\u201d When she hesitated, he said, \u201cYou pursue me. You want me. I will be yours, in every sense, but in return you must listen to me without question. Does that frighten you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, her irises overtaken by dilated pupils. Then she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt excites you,\u201d he murmured. Hot, potent lust intoxicated him, easing the relentless drive that set him on edge. He had always led the way with her. It was highly arousing to lead the way in their bedsport, as well. \u201cTurn.\u201d</p><p>Complying, she faced away from him, and Colin approached with a rapid stride, freed from the fear of untimely recognition. He pressed up against her, breathing in the scent of honeysuckle, placing his palms flat to the panels on either side of her head.</p><p>The vein in her throat fluttered with her increasing heartbeat, arresting his attention.</p><p>The sound of the bolt sliding home stiffened his frame and drew his gaze away.</p><p>How simple the action was, that of locking the door, but it aroused him as nothing ever had. She wanted him to take her, to strip her bare, to fuck her sweet little body until he was spent and conquered.</p><p>Though he knew it, he still wanted her to say the words aloud.</p><p>\u201cThere is no chance that you will depart this room as virginal as you entered it,\u201d he murmured, his tongue stroking over her racing pulse.</p><p>In answer, she reached for the chair by the door and pushed back hard against him, creating a gap that allowed her to wedge the spindle back beneath the knob.</p><p>\u201cDo you anticipate interruptions?\u201d he asked, with laughter in his voice and heart. \u201cOr do you simply wish to keep the world at bay?\u201d</p><p>The thought of Amelia forsaking the world at large to be with him made his chest tight. She had promised to do so as a young girl. Would she recommit to that promise as a woman?</p><p>\u201cYou assume I wish to lock others out.\u201d Her mouth curved in a woman\u2019s smile. \u201cPerhaps I wish to lock you in.\u201d</p><p>Colin threw back his head and laughed at that, his arms banding her torso and squeezing her tightly. \u201cAh, love. How glad I am that you remain so spirited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe threat of lovemaking is not sufficient to repress me,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>No, but his identity might be. The thought was sobering. He inhaled sharply. \u201cAmelia, I must share my face and past with you before we can proceed.\u201d</p><p>The tension that gripped her was palpable. \u201cWill it change how I feel about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost definitely, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not reveal anything.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, in this moment, I feel as if I could not breathe without you near.\u201d Her voice was low and earnest. \u201cI\u2019ve no desire to be disillusioned. Not after these last years when nothing was vital to me. It seems almost as if I walked through life wearing a veil. Only when I am with you do I see the world in all its many colors.\u201d</p><p>Pressing his cheek to hers, he whispered, \u201cYou should place greater worth upon your virginity. I cannot take you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and pressed her lips to his. The sudden rush of sensation was dizzying. Then unbearably arousing. He felt her moving, but was unable to break the contact to discover why. His tongue stroked across her lips, licking the innocently sweet flavor that was innate to her. The taste was addicting, destroying him. He was helpless to resist it. When her bare fingertips wrapped around his wrist and lifted his hand to her breast, he knew there was no fighting her. He could not simply blurt out who he was. The revelation required more tact than that.</p><p>\u201cI can see you with my heart,\u201d she said breathlessly, her lips moving against his. \u201cI want to have you while I feel for you as I do at this moment\u2014wild and hot and free. Does that make me reckless and na\u00efve? Do you find me foolish and fast?\u201d</p><p>With every word that left her mouth he grew harder and less controlled. Wild. Hot. Free. The combination was a potent allure for a Gypsy male. Amelia had lived outside the boundaries of Society for so long, she found it easier than most to ignore its constrictions. He suspected that contributed to their affinity. At heart, they were both desperate to run laughing through the fields without any restraints.</p><p>Colin reached around her and unfastened the jeweled brooch that secured her lace fichu. \u201cCan I cover your eyes?\u201d he asked in a dark voice. \u201cWould that dampen your ardor?\u201d</p><p>She tried to turn her head to meet his gaze, and he stopped her with a kiss. \u201cI would not have the revelation occur during the act. I want nothing to mar our first time together. I have waited too long for it and desired it too deeply to see it ruined.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she held still as he twisted the expensive lace loosely, then tied it around her head in a makeshift blindfold.</p><p>\u201cHow does that feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not move.\u201d Colin backed up and shed his coat. He unwound his cravat, then began to work on the carved ivory buttons of his waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cAre you undressing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He watched a shiver move through her and smiled. How erotically beautiful she looked with her kiss-swollen lips and covered eyes. His to savor and enjoy. Pietro had attempted to dissuade him away from Amelia by insisting that Englishwomen lacked the fire a Gypsy man needed. Colin hadn\u2019t believed it then; he certainly did not believe it now.</p><p>Her lovely breasts lifted and fell with her rapid breathing; her hands clenched rhythmically at her sides. She was ripe and ready, an oasis in the desert of his barren life.</p><p>Shrugging out of his waistcoat, Colin tossed it over the back of a chair and returned to her. \u201cI want you to speak your thoughts to me. Tell me what feels good, what doesn\u2019t. I will know if you lie. Your body will betray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why should I speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your benefit.\u201d He caressed her shoulders, then reached for the tiny row of cloth buttons that followed the line of her spine. \u201cSpeaking aloud will force you to think in minute detail about what I am doing to you. It will anchor you to the pleasure and this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnchor me to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that, too.\u201d He kissed her throat. \u201cIt will empower you, be the telling of your desires. You may hesitate to touch me or wonder what is allowed or what is not allowed. But if you sense how the sounds of your pleasure in turn please me, you will know that this is a joining of two lovers playing equal parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds so intimate,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cFor us, my love, it will be.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Ware entered Christopher St. John\u2019s study shortly after ten in the evening. The infamous pirate was pacing between the back of his desk and the window beyond that with a sort of restlessness the earl had never seen in him before. Sans coat and bearing a skewed cravat, St. John looked rumpled and anxious, which set the hairs on Ware\u2019s nape to rising. After seeing the travel coach hitched in the front circular drive, it was apparent that a journey of some distance was planned.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d St. John greeted absently.</p><p>\u201cSt. John.\u201d He cut straight to the heart of the matter. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d</p><p>Rounding the desk, the pirate moved to the nearby console and held up a decanter in silent query. Ware shook his head in the negative and sank onto one of the matching settees that sat perpendicular to the grate. He was here to collect Amelia for the evening\u2019s social rounds. It was unlike her to leave him waiting. Her punctuality was one of the many traits he enjoyed in her.</p><p>\u201cThere is no way for me to relate the day\u2019s events without awkwardness,\u201d St. John began, pouring a hefty ration.</p><p>\u201cNever mind that. I prefer bluntness to anything else.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, St. John took the seat opposite and said, \u201cMrs. St. John and Miss Benbridge went into Town today. I was told they meant to spend the day shopping. I have since learned that they were hunting the masked man who has so captured Amelia\u2019s interest.\u201d</p><p>Ware\u2019s brows rose. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy some stray chance, Count Montoya\u2014if that truly is his name\u2014was seen departing London. Miss Benbridge hailed a hackney and set off in pursuit. My wife followed shortly after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you care for that drink now, my lord?\u201d</p><p>The earl seriously considered it, then shook his head. \u201cI have made some inquiries of my own regarding this matter. I had hoped Lady Langston would shed some light on the man\u2019s identity; however, no invitation was ever issued to a Count Montoya.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>St. John\u2019s lips pursed grimly. \u201cI am at a loss for how to view this situation. If the man meant to hurt her in some fashion or seduce her, why leave London?\u201d</p><p>There was jealousy and possessiveness laced with all the other emotions Ware was presently experiencing, but there was also resignation. Some part of him had known that Amelia held off on marriage to him because of a need for . . . more. He had no idea what she felt was missing, but in truth their relationship could not progress any further and still end happily without first resolving that lack.</p><p>\u201cI am surprised to find you still at home,\u201d the earl said. \u201cAmelia is not my wife, yet I feel a pressing need to go after her.\u201d</p><p>The glare the pirate shot at him was cutting. \u201cI am near maddened with the need to follow, but I have no notion of their direction. I am awaiting word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForgive me, I meant no offense. I was merely making an observation.\u201d He considered his options, then said, \u201cI should like to go with you, if you have no objection.\u201d</p><p>St. John seemed ready to argue; then his scowl cleared and he nodded. \u201cIf you wish to come along, do. But your formal attire will be a burden.\u201d</p><p>Ware stood, as did the pirate. \u201cI will change and pack lightly. If you depart before I return, please leave a note so that I may follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d St. John offered a commiserating smile. \u201cI must apologize to you, as well. Your courting of Amelia has done much for her. Mrs. St. John and I are both exceedingly grateful, as is Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. John.\u201d Ware laughed ruefully. \u201cAt this moment, the matter of my pride is secondary to Amelia\u2019s safety.\u201d</p> <p>They clasped hands in a gesture of mutual respect. Then the earl hastened to depart before he was left behind. As his carriage rolled away from the St. John residence, Ware began a mental list of what to bring with him.</p><p>His small sword and pistol were among the items he catalogued. If Amelia\u2019s honor was to be impugned, he considered it his right and duty to correct the slight.</p><p>As Colin spread open the back of Amelia\u2019s gown, his thoughts were already rushing ahead, considering how this one night would change their lives forever. \u201cDo you have an abigail with you?\u201d</p><p>The blindfold might make some women more timid and hesitant. Not so with Amelia. Her voice came sure and strong. \u201cNo. I saw your carriage and gave chase.\u201d</p><p>Warring with the primitive need to mark her as his, his heart still wanted to protect her even at great cost to himself. \u201cThere will be no way to hide that you have been ravished. In the heat of passion, our better sense deserts us. What you want now, you may regret in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my own mind,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p> <p>\u201cYou will give up Ware.\u201d He gently withdrew one of her arms from a sleeve, then repeated the movement on the other side. \u201cAnd you will belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it more likely that you will belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he bent at the knees and pulled her gown down with him. Amelia stepped out of the garment without urging, balancing her weight by leaning against the door. He deliberately delayed the joy of seeing her stripped from her outer garments. He took his time laying the dress over the back of a wing chair in an effort to spare it the most wrinkling.</p><p>\u201cYou are so calm,\u201d she murmured. \u201cSo controlled. You must have many affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not an affair.\u201d He turned his head, raking her lithe body with a heated glance. Still too many garments, but he knew that he was seeing her as no other man ever had.</p><p>She set her hand on her hip, and a finely arched brow lifted above the fichu. \u201cPerhaps I want an affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you are not having one with me,\u201d he growled, reaching her in two strides and lifting her feet from the floor. \u201cYou will not be having one ever, because no other man will come after me in your bed.\u201d</p><p>Amelia laughed and wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cMy . . . how delightful you are when you become possessive.\u201d</p> <p>He pressed his lips to her ear. \u201cWait until my cock is inside you. See how delightful my possession is then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTease,\u201d she said breathlessly, with a slight note of anxiety. \u201cAt this rate, the sun will be rising before I am naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not have to be naked to be fucked,\u201d he whispered, deliberately challenging her to revive her spirits. \u201cI could toss up your underskirts, undo my breeches, and pin you to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your intent is to frighten me, you should know that I am difficult to scare.\u201d The anxiousness was gone from her voice, banished by her impressive inner fortitude. \u201cI have lived in the most rustic of places. I have seen all sorts of animals doing all sorts of things to each other.\u201d</p><p>He buried his grin in her tender throat.</p><p>\u201cDo not find amusement at my expense,\u201d she said. \u201cYour threat is groundless. You would not take my virginity in so callous a manner. You worship me too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I do, Your Highness.\u201d Setting her back on her feet, Colin dropped to his knees and kissed her feet.</p><p>As she laughed, he moved upward, sliding beneath the masses of skirts, pressing open-mouthed kisses up the length of her stocking-clad legs. Her laughter turned into a gasp, then a soft whimper.</p><p>The intimate smell of her drove him insane, and with a tentative finger, Colin tested her, gritting his teeth at finding her slick and hot. Startled by his bold caress, Amelia stumbled and fell into the door with a soft thud.</p><p>\u201cNot while I am standing!\u201d she protested.</p><p>Pressing a final kiss to the back of her knee, Colin crawled free and stood before her. He gently turned her, then set to work on her tapes and stays, taking the brief respite to regain his control. He focused on his breathing and hers instead of the animal need that clawed inside him.</p><p>Finally, she was left with only her chemise, a garment made of material so fine he could almost see clear through it. It was enough to drive him to madness, the far-too-vague hints of her body beneath.</p><p>\u201cI want you to remove the rest,\u201d he said, stepping back.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it will please me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not as easy as you intimate. I have never been naked before a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, Amelia,\u201d he ordered, near desperate to see all of her.</p><p>With no further hesitation, she reached down and removed her shoes. The hem of her chemise lifted as she reached for the ribbons that secured her stockings. His mouth watered at the sight, every movement she made erasing similar memories from his past. No other woman could compete with the innocent, unaffected fashion in which Amelia undressed. Her movements were not practiced or planned with an eye for seduction, but they aroused him unbearably, nevertheless.</p><p>Aching with lust for her, he freed the placket of his breeches and took his cock in hand. He was thick and hard, slick at the tip with wanting her. Stroking leisurely down the length, he groaned in need.</p><p>Amelia froze at the sound, unsure of what she had done to distress him. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong,\u201d Montoya assured in a gruff voice that belied his words. \u201cEverything is perfect.\u201d</p><p>She listened carefully, regulating her breathing in order to take in every nuance of sound. \u201cWhat are you doing? I hear you moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am fondling my cock.\u201d</p><p>Images filled her mind, incomplete due to her inexperience, but arousing regardless. The flesh between her legs throbbed in response, making her squeeze her thighs together in a vain effort to ease the ache. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it pains me, love. I am hard and ready for you. Harder and thicker than I have ever been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I touch it?\u201d</p><p>He made a choked noise, and the sounds of his movements became more pronounced. \u201cBare yourself first.\u201d</p><p>Amelia finished undressing with haste, forcibly shoving aside thoughts of her imperfections. Unlike Maria, she was not lushly curved and built for a man\u2019s pleasure. She was taller, thinner, and smaller-breasted. She was too active, enjoying riding and fencing more than card games and teas.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d he gasped when she dropped her chemise to the floor.</p><p>Her hands moved to cover herself, but he moved swiftly, catching her wrists. \u201cNever hide from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am nervous,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cMy love . . .\u201d He wrapped her against him, and she felt his erection between them. Smooth as silk, but hard as a rock and hot to the touch. Despite the shock of it, her body delighted in the feel and grew slicker.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful, Amelia. Every inch of you. I dreamed of seeing you like this, naked and willing. How sorry those fantasies were compared to the reality.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her forehead to his chest and said, \u201cYou are being kind.\u201d</p><p>Montoya brought her hand to his cock and wrapped her fingers around it. \u201cThis is not how a man feels when he finds his lover inadequate.\u201d</p><p>Amelia moved, squeezing and caressing, exploring. His breath hissed out between his teeth. \u201cYou will make me spend,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cIf it would please you to do so, go ahead,\u201d she replied, wanting to give him pleasure. Wanting to satisfy him in a way that would brand him as hers.</p><p>\u201cMinx.\u201d</p><p>She stilled as a big, warm hand cupped her breast. Immediately, her nipple, already tight and hard from the chill of the open air, pebbled further.</p><p>\u201cSee how you fit so perfectly within my palm,\u201d he murmured, his hips beginning to thrust into her movements. \u201cYou were built for me, Amelia.\u201d She whimpered as his thumb and forefinger surrounded her nipple and tugged on it, sending pangs of intense pleasure straight to her womb. Everything tightened and coiled, making her move restlessly.</p><p>\u201cAnd how quickly you respond to me.\u201d He leaned back, and a moment later she cried out as hot, wet suction surrounded the tender peak of her breast. Her hands gripped his cock convulsively, and he growled against her skin, the vibration driving her wild.</p><p>His powerful arms banded her waist, supporting her as he pushed her backward and worshipped her breast, his tongue curling around her nipple as his cheeks hollowed with drawing pulls.</p><p>Just as he had said, every thought left her mind, leaving her a creature of lust and desire. The lack of reason bound her tighter to him. There was only one other man she had ever considered sharing herself with in this way. That Montoya was scarred and haunted had no bearing on the emotions he aroused in her.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love this,\u201d he said, as he moved to her other breast. \u201cLet it out, Amelia. Do not be silent.\u201d</p><p>His teeth nipped the hard peak and she cried out. He began licking her, his tongue stroking with maddening leisure. It was not enough, not nearly. She began to writhe, whimpering, arching her back in an attempt to push deeper into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked in a dark whisper. \u201cWhat do you want? Tell me, and I will give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Desperate, she begged, \u201cSuck it . . . please . . . I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gasped as he obliged, his lips closing around her. In her hands his cock throbbed, and a hot trickle of moisture tickled the backs of her fingers. She touched it, found its source at the tiny hole at the head. The pad of her thumb smoothed it around, and he shuddered and suckled her harder.</p><p>With her sight stolen from her, every other sense was heightened. As his skin heated, her nostrils filled with his unique scent, increasing her desire. Her sense of touch was painfully acute; even the slight rustle of the air prickled across her flesh.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she cried, wanting more.</p><p>With one last lingering suck, Montoya straightened and pulled her up with him. Then he lifted her into his arms and moved toward the waiting bed.</p><p>Simon was in a foul mood by the time Maria\u2019s coach pulled off the main road and into the courtyard of an inn just shy of Reading. Two of St. John\u2019s outriders traveled on ahead, freed of the burden of the slow-moving carriages. If they were fortunate, they would return with a more solid direction or perhaps even a sighting.</p><p>The entire day had been a study in frustration. The hackney carrying Amelia had discharged her and her guard shortly after collecting them, unwilling to travel beyond the city. They had then secured another carriage and continued on. That progression of events was to be expected. What most concerned Simon were the reports of an inordinate number of French-speaking riders moving in the same direction ahead of them.</p><p>It could be nothing, or it could be Cartland.</p><p>Simon had longed to disclose the whole of the matter to Maria over dinner, but he felt a similar level of loyalty to Colin, who had risked his life for Simon on more than a few occasions. So he said nothing, holding his tongue when they parted ways to retire for the night.</p><p>In the meantime, neither he nor Lysette had any of the items required for comfortable travel. They had no change of clothes and no servants. They did not even have the proper equipage, which led him to having an aching arse and a sore back.</p><p>At least Colin had mentioned traveling to Bristol, which gave Simon an advantage. He subtly urged Maria in that general direction, while quietly sending a lone footman back to his lodgings to inform his valet of their change of plans. The servant would manage the settling of the accounts, the packing of their things, and the rounding up of Lysette\u2019s maid and belongings.</p><p>Thinking of the Frenchwoman, his gaze moved to where she sat before the fire. By necessity, they shared a bedchamber, the size of their party enough to take up the last remaining rooms. Maria had complained mightily about the poor quality of the inn, arguing that St. John had various lackeys scattered around the area who would take them in and provide them comfortable lodging. Simon\u2019s insistence that they remain near the road was unreasonable to her, and he appreciated the validity of the argument. However, he had no desire for Maria to realize that he had lied about the planned holiday, a ruse that would be revealed if he donned the same garments.</p><p>A soft sigh drew his attention back to Lysette. She was curled up in a wing chair, stripped to her chemise with her legs tucked up close and a blanket across her lap. Pale blonde curls were loosened from a previously stylish arrangement and left to lie carelessly against pale, creamy skin. She was reading, as she often did, devouring historical volumes of text with a voracity he found intriguing. Why such interest in the past? They had merely intended to make discreet inquiries, and she had brought a book along with her anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frowning, Simon moved to the bed and stripped down to his smalls. Then he crawled between the sheets. With lowered lids, he studied her, admiring her delicate golden beauty while considering why it was that he found her so unappealing. It was, to his knowledge, the only time in his life that he had found external attractiveness incapable of distracting from the internal flaws. Considering that Lysette rivaled Maria in loveliness, it was a startling realization to come to.</p><p>The women were similar in many ways, and that only emphasized their differences. Maria had a solid core within her, a spine of steel that was created by her unwavering determination. Lysette seemed sometimes as if she was uncertain of her life\u2019s path. He could not understand why she appeared to relish her role one moment, and then despise it the next.</p><p>His instincts were clamoring, and he had come to rely on them implicitly. Something told him that all was not right in Lysette\u2019s world. She was a hired killer, and her icy disposition supported her chosen profession. Yet her apathy for others was sometimes belied by brief flashes of confusion and remorse. He suspected she was a bit touched, and it was difficult to feel both sympathy and dislike toward the same woman.</p><p>\u201cHow did you come to work for Talleyrand?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She jumped and glared at him. \u201cI thought you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not work for Talleyrand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is none of your business,\u201d she said smartly.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I think it is,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Her gaze narrowed as she looked at him. \u201cWhom do you work for?\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cI work for no one. I am a mercenary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d he prodded, when she said no more than that.</p><p>Lysette shook her head, once again looking a bit lost. Her clothes were finely crafted and expensive, her manners and deportment faultless. She had begun life in far better circumstances than these. He knew why Maria had turned to a life of crime, but why had Lysette?</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you find a rich husband and enjoy yourself draining his coffers?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cHow boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that would depend on the husband, would it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless, that does not sound appealing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps life as a mistress would suit you better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not like men very much,\u201d she pronounced, startling him. \u201cWhy are you asking me such questions?\u201d</p><p>Simon shrugged. \u201cWhy not? There is nothing else for me to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you prefer the company of women?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a moment. Then her eyes widened. \u201cNo! Mon Dieu. I prefer the company of books, but in lieu of that, men are my second choice. Most especially in the manner to which you are referring.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her horror.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you think about Cartland?\u201d she suggested, \u201cAnd leave me in peace.\u201d</p><p>His humor fled. \u201cYou think he will find Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be impossible for him not to with this large a number of pursuers. He was given a sizeable contingent of men. I would be surprised if he was not watching all the major roads in and out of London.\u201d Her beautiful features lost all traces of humanity. \u201cI would not have come with you if I thought of this as merely a family affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he murmured, the tiny flare of warmth he\u2019d felt for her fading as rapidly as it had come. Such was the way of their relations\u2014one minute he found her marginally attractive, the next he could not abide her. \u201cAnd what of this man who rides with Cartland? Depardue? Do you think about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs little as possible.\u201d</p><p>There was something more there; he could tell by the edge that had entered her voice. \u201cHe is your rival, is he not?\u201d</p><p>Her lips whitened, then, \u201cNo. He is not. If he succeeds, it does not reflect negatively on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why not allow him to proceed and spare yourself the blight on your soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do what I must,\u201d she said with a trace of defensiveness. \u201cYou do not like that I can set aside my emotions to accomplish the tasks set before me, but the ability keeps me alive.\u201d</p><p>Heaving out his breath, Simon slid down to lie on his back. \u201cSurviving in the manner that you and I do does not mean we have to be heartless. What would be the point of living if we have no heart?\u201d</p><p>He heard the book slam shut. \u201cDo not seek to lecture me!\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou have no notion of what my life has been like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me,\u201d he said easily.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, there is nothing else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to have sex?\u201d</p><p>His head shot up in surprise. She stared back with both brows raised.</p><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d he asked, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cWho else is here?\u201d she retorted.</p><p>To his chagrin, Simon realized that as much as he enjoyed a quick, meaningless tumble, he had no real desire to tumble Lysette. However, damned if he wouldn\u2019t rise to the occasion. \u201cI suppose we could . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at his obvious reluctance. Then she laughed, a sweet, lilting sound that he found enchanting. Who knew such a cold creature could have such a warm laugh? \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sleep with me?\u201d she asked, grinning.</p><p>Simon scowled. \u201cI can manage the task,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Lysette looked pointedly at the general area of his cock. \u201cIt does not look that way to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever cast aspersions on a man\u2019s virility. You force him to prove it by fucking you raw.\u201d</p><p>A shadow passed over her features. She swallowed hard and looked away.</p><p>His irritation fled. Sitting up, he said, \u201cI was jesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Scrubbing a hand over his jaw, Simon cursed inwardly. He did not understand the woman at all. She was too mutable. \u201cPerhaps we should restrain our conversations to safer subjects?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cYes, I think you are right.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to say something; then finally he took the lead. \u201cI intend to capture Cartland and bring him together with Mitchell. Then you can see for yourself the differences between the two. If I know Cartland at all, he hopes to eliminate Mitchell before his secret is revealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there is such a secret to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you not believe us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not take offense,\u201d she said easily. \u201cI do not believe Cartland either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you believe, then?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d Her chin lifted. \u201cTell me you would do differently in my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met Mitchell. He is an earnest young man with a good heart.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze hardened. \u201cI am certain there are those who would laud Monsieur Cartland as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCartland is a lying murderer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say. But did he not once work for you? Do you not have a grievance against him for revealing your traitorous activities in France? You have motive to want him dead, which leaves anything you say against him suspect.\u201d</p><p>Cursing under his breath, Simon plopped back onto the pillow and yanked up the counterpane.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to sleep now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonne nuit. \u201d</p><p>His response was a frustrated growl.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>A melia shivered as her bare back touched the cool counterpane and Montoya\u2019s warmth left her. If she kept her gaze trained downward, she could see a tiny sliver of the room and the glow of the fire in the grate. But she did not want to see, so she squeezed her lids shut.</p><p>In her mind\u2019s eye, she pictured Montoya as a rather exotic-looking man. Strong, handsome, and rather severe. The desire she felt to lighten his burdens and bring him some comfort was a goading force. She wanted to hear him laugh and press kisses to the dimples she saw far too rarely.</p><p>Suddenly, an image of Colin burst forth in all its glory, vivid and powerful. She stiffened in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Montoya murmured, the cessation of sound telling her that he had stopped undressing.</p><p>Inhaling sharply, Amelia brought her thoughts back to the present. Perhaps it was to be expected that she would think fondly of her first love at this moment, the one where she embarked on a similar journey with another. She lacked the experience to know.</p><p>\u201cI am cold without you,\u201d she lied, holding her arms out to him.</p><p>\u201cIn a moment, you will be hot and damp,\u201d he purred, the bed dipping as he joined her atop it.</p><p>She felt the warmth of him along her side and then the gentle press of his firm lips to her shoulder. His hand drifted along the length of her, following the slight curves and valleys of her figure.</p><p>\u201cI fear I am dreaming,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI am afraid to blink in case I open my eyes and find you gone.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s hand came to rest on the flat plane of her belly just below her navel. \u201cI feel flutters here,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>His hand covered hers and squeezed gently. \u201cI will be there soon. Deep inside you.\u201d His fingertips tiptoed across her skin and touched the curls between her legs.</p><p>It tickled, making her laugh. When he pressed his lips to hers, she felt his returning smile. \u201cI love you,\u201d he breathed before taking her mouth.</p><p>Her heart stopped, delaying her reaction to the deepening intrusion of his fingers. A callused fingertip parted her and her thighs squeezed together instinctively.</p><p>Gasping, Amelia turned her head away, the reaction to those whispered words hitting her with stunning force. She had never thought to hear those words again, not from the lips of a lover. Tears welled, burning her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOpen your legs,\u201d he urged, kissing her throat. \u201cAllow me to pleasure you.\u201d</p><p>She began to quiver, the assault to both her senses and her heart rattling her to the core. \u201cReynaldo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He came over her then, kissing her hard. \u201cCall me anything but that. Lover or darling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . sweetheart . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . .\u201d His tongue thrust deep, caressing hers, making her moan into his mouth. \u201cOpen,\u201d he said ardently. \u201cLet me see you . . . touch you . . .\u201d</p><p>Unable to deny him when he spoke with such passion, Amelia spread her legs and then arched upward as he stroked against the tender, throbbing point that begged for his attention.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Montoya\u2019s kisses became more luxurious as he continued to fondle her with devastating skill. His callused fingertips rubbed her slick, aching sex in time to the rhythmic plunges of his tongue.</p><p>Awash in pleasure, yet struggling against the building tension that strained her body, she writhed and clutched at him. Beneath her grip his forearm muscles flexed with his movements, increasing her erotic awareness of how intimately he touched her.</p><p>Then one finger dipped lower, circling the clenching opening to her sex.</p><p>\u201cHow slick you are,\u201d he breathed reverently. \u201cHow greedily you suck at my fingertip.\u201d To prove his point, he pushed in the tiniest bit. Amelia cried out as her body spasmed around the gentle invasion.</p><p>\u201cDear God, you are so tight and hot,\u201d he praised gruffly. \u201cYou will kill me when I push inside you.\u201d</p><p>Amelia reached for his cock, wondering how she would accommodate him. He was so thick and hard. Her untried body was burning from the press of one finger.</p><p>Montoya groaned when she wrapped her hand around him. He was slick, too. With need and desire for her.</p><p>\u201cYou are ready to come,\u201d he said. \u201cFeel how hard your clitoris is?\u201d The pad of his thumb pressed lightly against the swollen protrusion and circled. In response, her body tightened around the single finger slowly easing into it.</p><p>She whimpered as he stepped up the pace, his finger thrusting in and out, deeper and deeper. His expert manipulation of her clitoris caused her skin to dampen with sweat and her breasts to ache. Desperate mewling poured from her throat, and she clung to him, trying to bring him closer.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need,\u201d he whispered, his lips to her ear. \u201cTell me how to please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nipples . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are beautiful. Puckered so wantonly. Eager to be sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Amelia arched upward in blatant invitation.</p><p>\u201cSay it, my love.\u201d His finger pushed deeper and touched her maidenhead. \u201cSay what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He continued to rub inside her.</p><p>\u201cI want your mouth on my breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm . . . with pleasure,\u201d he purred.</p><p>She gasped when he obliged, the burning heat searing her tender flesh. Tension gripped her limbs, tightening with every tug of his lips, every thrust of his finger, every circle of his thumb.</p><p>The climax stole her breath when it hit. Her body went rigid, her heart slammed against her ribs, her blood rushed through her ears.</p><p>And deep inside her, at the extremity of her orgasm, Montoya broke through the barrier between them. Amidst the onslaught of sensation, the loss of her virginity was barely noticed, and the tear that leaked from the corner of her eye was not from pain, but pleasure so intense she could hardly bear it.</p><p>As awareness returned after the rush, she heard his hoarsely voiced endearments and praise. Her first thought was of how grateful she was to share the sexual act with a man who felt such passion for her and inspired a returning desire for him. What might have been an act of duty was instead a joy.</p><p>There were a hundred emotions warring for dominance within her, all struggling to be freed through words. But her throat was too tight to release them.</p><p>Instead, she wrapped her arms around him and held him to her breast.</p><p>Colin listened to the sound of Amelia\u2019s heart slowing and knew he had never loved her more. She was a goddess in her passion, a creature of lust and longing, her beautiful body flushed and glistening. Earthy. Wild and hot, as she had longed to be.

Eager to be touched.</p><p>\u201cThat was\u201d\u2014she gave a soft, breathy sigh\u2014\u201cwonderful.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face against her breast and laughed, his heart filled with joy. He, too, felt reawakened after being dormant too long. She had pursued him, needing his desire to set free her own.</p> <p>\u201cYour whiskers burn,\u201d she complained, pushing at his head.</p><p>The image in his mind of such an obvious sexual mark on her made his cock throb in frustrated protest at its deprivation.</p><p>But the fantasy he had nurtured over the years was not of his own gratification. He wanted hers, needed it. Before the night was over he would bind her to him with pleasure, enslave her with desire, teach her all the many facets of sexual culmination. Her love was the ultimate prize, but her lust was vital, too.</p><p>\u201cCan I burn you in other places?\u201d he asked, lifting his head.</p><p>Her tongue darted out to wet her lower lip. Colin took over the task, licking across the plump curve with the very tip of his tongue. It was an enticement, an intimation, a hint.</p> <p>From the way her breath caught, she comprehended his intent. \u201cYou jest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I want to taste you, Amelia. On the outside and on the inside.\u201d</p><p>He could almost hear her brain working. Considering.</p><p>\u201cI find it easier to conceive of my tasting you in that fashion,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cmore so than I can the reverse.\u201d</p><p>His arms shook at the thought, and he rolled to his back to avoid collapsing atop her.</p><p>\u201cYou would like that,\u201d she mused aloud, noting his reaction. \u201cDoes a woman\u2019s mouth feel so different from her quim?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love that you are inquisitive. I pray you will always be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day I should like to teach you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSiren. You already have me bewitched. Must you reduce me further?\u201d</p><p>Her hand brushed lightly across the ridges of his abdomen and circled his upthrust cock. He exhaled harshly as she sat up and turned to face him. Reaching out, he caught her shoulder and stayed her. Despite her inability to see, she turned her head toward him. Her free hand reached for the fichu.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am ready now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>She seemed prepared to protest, then changed her mind. Instead, she stroked gently up the length of his shaft. He grit his teeth and fisted the counterpane.</p> <p>\u201cI want to do to you,\u201d she murmured, \u201cwhat you did to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know men are less fastidious than women when we reach orgasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the sensation is the same, is it not?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI would imagine so.\u201d</p><p>Amelia sat up and tucked her legs beneath her. With two hands, she fondled him, squeezing and caressing. The sensation originated at his cock, burned up his spine, and seared his heart. There was reverence in her touch. Awe.</p><p>The edge of a nail traced the line of a vein, and he groaned, a low, pained sound.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you like,\u201d she breathed. \u201cTell me how to please you best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already please me best.\u201d Colin caressed the elegant curve of her spine.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me how to please you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you did that, I would spend in your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr my mouth?\u201d Her head tilted to one side in question.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d he choked out. His bollocks drew up, and he pulled them down with a quick tug.</p><p>She felt blindly until she comprehended what he had done. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Her cool fingers touched his balls, rolling them gently, then tugging them.</p><p>Unlike when he had performed the task himself, Amelia\u2019s ministrations had the opposite result. Colin felt as if his testicles were attempting to crawl up inside his body. He pushed her hand away. \u201cBloody hell, do not do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d she said, with that awed tone that drove him to madness.</p><p>Pushed to the edge of reason, Colin rolled over her and settled between her thighs. The makeshift blindfold twisted with his movements, but he caught it quickly and pulled it into place.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good.\u201d Amelia\u2019s small hands moved across his shoulders. \u201cYou are so big and hard . . . everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He heard anxiety in her voice and sought to alleviate it. \u201cI will please you,\u201d he promised, supporting his weight on one forearm and reaching low to massage the tender flesh of her cunt with the heel of his other palm. She moaned and rolled her hips into the pressure. \u201cWhat you felt before is nothing to how it will feel when I am inside you.\u201d</p><p>Her slender arms wrapped around his neck and pulled him near. \u201cI want that. I want that with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He licked along the shell of her ear, making her shiver. \u201cYou are a sensual woman. It\u2019s there in the way you move, the way you look at me, the way you are built.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am too slender,\u201d she said in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cYou are perfect. Some women are fashioned to suit all men. You were crafted for me alone. My blood runs hot, my passions high; therefore you were made for endurance. Your limbs graceful, but lithe. Your curves lush, but not limiting.\u201d</p><p>He pushed a finger inside her, testing her soreness. Her answering moan of welcome was all the encouragement he needed. Fisting his straining cock, he positioned the thick head at the tiny slitted entrance to her body. Cum was dribbling from the tip, the shaft too eager and determined to lubricate his way. It wasn\u2019t necessary. Amelia was so wet and hot. With the veriest roll of his hips, the fat crown slipped inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God . . . !\u201d she breathed, her mouth opening on gasping breaths.</p><p>Colin\u2019s entire body strained with the pleasure of her grip. The scalding heat inside her swept upward from his cock and over his skin. Sweat misted, then pooled in the small of his back as his back bowed with the effort he maintained to keep his entry slow. She would need time to adjust to his size and the novel intrusion of a man\u2019s body into hers.</p><p>Amelia\u2019s hands caught his hips, and her hips began a tiny rolling motion that nearly unmanned him.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell!\u201d he gasped, jolting as his seed spurted out in a desperate bid to relieve the torturous pressure in his bollocks.</p><p>\u201cI need you deeper,\u201d she begged, and he was so grateful for her that he took her mouth in a lush, frantic kiss. Her lips closed around his tongue, sucking it with such fervor his cock swelled in jealousy.</p><p>Using his weight, Colin pinned her to the bed, sinking another inch inside her, his hands cupping her face and gentling her ardor.</p><p>\u201cAmelia . . .\u201d He groaned and nuzzled his sweat-slick cheek against hers. \u201cYou are making it impossible for me to initiate you as you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ache inside,\u201d she cried, holding him so tightly. \u201cAnd you are not there yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are tiny and untried, and I am thick and hard. If I go too quickly, it will bring you pain now and soreness later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too big . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, damn it all!\u201d He did not want to be surly, but her hungry cunt was tugging on the head of his cock, goading his primitive instincts to take over and leave the gentlemanly ones behind.</p><p>\u201cThen let me watch. Perhaps if I can see, I would be less anxious. This moment is too intense without my sight. Every noise, every touch is magnified.\u201d</p><p>Colin went rigid. Now was not the time, and yet he could not bear for any part of this night to distress her. He was in heaven. He wanted nothing more than for her to be also. \u201cI am afraid of what will happen if you see me now. If you turned me away, I do not think I would survive it.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip quivered. Then she asked, \u201cDo you have one of your masks with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask me to withdraw?\u201d He stared down at her with wide eyes. \u201cAre you insane? I am inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the way,\u201d she argued. \u201cNot as I need you to be.\u201d Her voice took on the pleading, cajoling note that he had never been able to resist.</p><p>She would kill him, he realized with an odd mixture of pride and wryness. She would never be passive in the bedroom, just as she had never been passive out of it. He half feared the day when she\u2019d be fully awakened sexually. How would he survive the full assault of her feminine wiles? He wasn\u2019t yet buried to the hilt and he felt like he was dying.</p><p>\u201cIt excites me,\u201d she whispered, releasing the stunning statement with panting breaths. \u201cThe sight of you in the mask.\u201d Her fingers came up and traced the shape of his lips. \u201cYou have such a wicked mouth. I have dreamt of it. Longed for it to move across my skin and whisper hot words of wanting.\u201d</p><p>Shuddering with desire, Colin pushed restlessly into her streaming cunt. She was melting around his cock. Her nipples were hard against his chest, her stomach was quivering against his.</p><p>\u201cIt would please me to watch you. Do not deny me.\u201d Her hands cupped his buttocks and tugged, pulling him fractionally deeper.</p><p>She became tighter the deeper he went, her virgin tissues resisting the remolding of her body to fit his.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d she breathed with such heartrending yearning. \u201cDo not leave me in the darkness at this moment in my life.\u201d</p><p>Cursing, Colin wrenched himself free, his body shaking with its need. He rolled from the bed and stalked on nerveless legs to the armoire where his valise waited. Reaching inside it, he withdrew the mask, which he had kept as a tangible reminder of the stolen moments he had shared with Amelia.</p><p>He stared down at the gleaming white item in his hands with a building resentment for its purpose\u2014that of keeping Colin Mitchell away from the woman he loved.</p><p>How he wished he would have seen where this deception would lead when he first purchased the mask! One look at Amelia\u2014a sip of water for a man dying of thirst\u2014was all he had expected the ruse to provide.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she urged in the throaty voice of a consummate seductress. The feminine allure so practiced and studied in other women was simply innate to her.</p><p>Colin lifted the half mask to his face and tied the black satin ribbons that would hold it in place, then retied the ribbon that restrained his queue. Turning his head, he looked at her and knew he would not leave this room as the same man who had entered it.</p><p>She reclined against the piled pillows, her legs and arms crossed modestly, the blindfold gone. In her verdant gaze he saw lust, longing, and appreciation of such magnitude that he could scarcely breathe.</p><p>Pivoting on his heel, he faced her directly, affording her a clear view of his raging cock and taut musculature. He watched her swallow hard and understood how intimidating the sight of him must be. She was a tall woman, but he was still much taller. He was more than twice her size, his body hardened by both his common lineage and frequent physical activity.</p><p>And he was in full rut. Thick veins pulsed with his raging blood, and he fisted the shaft to ease the pain of it.</p><p>\u201cDoes the sight of me this way arouse you,\u201d he asked, \u201cor frighten you?\u201d</p><p>Amelia licked her lips. \u201cI am not frightened,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI am nervous and perhaps apprehensive, but I do not fear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a strong woman,\u201d he praised, striding swiftly toward her.</p><p>Without preliminaries, he kneeled on the bed and climbed over her, tugging her arm out of the way so he could claim a nipple with his mouth. He attended the stiff peak with hard, rhythmic suction, urging her silently to make some sound of her delight.</p><p>Her hands cupped the back of his head and held him to her breast. \u201cCome inside me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI hate this feeling of uncertainty and ignorance.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back on his heels, Colin pulled her legs over either side of his own, spreading her thighs wide to expose her cunt to his gaze. With the angle of the pillows and her semi-reclined position, she had a clear view. Before she could register the size of her tiny pink slit compared to the girth and length of his cock, he was in her, pushing the thick head into the tender opening.</p><p>She whimpered and dug her nails into his thighs.</p><p>Holding her hips, he took her, rocking gently but relentlessly deeper and deeper. His gaze moved between the place of their joining and her beautiful face.</p><p>With his back shadowing her from the rapidly dwindling glow of the fading fire, he could not discern color, but he saw the telltale shimmer of sweat on her brow, and her eyes glistened with a sheen of tears.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d he gasped, his fingers bruising her as she responded to his voice by rippling along the buried length of his cock. She was so damn tight and hot, it felt as if he were fucking into a tightly closed fist.</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d Her voice was thready and faraway sounding.</p><p>Colin lifted one of her hands from his skin and set it over her distended clitoris. \u201cStroke yourself,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>To his utter delight she obliged without embarrassment, her long, slender fingers circling the slick flesh with only slight hesitation.</p><p>Her lovely cunt responded as he had known it would, clenching and grasping at him with renewed fervor. With every suck, he pushed deeper, groaning with the ecstasy of it, gulping in desperate breaths of air filled with the scents of sex and honeysuckle.</p><p>She began to writhe and mewl in a show of such wanton craving, he would wonder later how he managed to work inside her completely without coming at the midway point. Finally, with a last desperate lunge, he hit the end of her, the sensation of being balls-deep inside her enough to make his eyes tear.</p><p>Amelia cried out as Montoya\u2019s hot, heavy length finally struck deep. A flare of torturous relief spread outward from the aching spot inside her that begged to be rubbed, and then coiled tight again.</p><p>When he held still, she struggled, circling her hips, grinding against the root of his shaft. The growl that left him was more animal than human, and her body shivered in response, spurred to greater lust by the sound.</p><p>He held her still with powerful hands, his gaze burning from within the eyeholes of the mask. His beautiful mouth was hard, his jaw taut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With him.</p><p>No other man could unlock her.

In her verdant gaze he saw lust, longing, and appreciation of such magnitude that he could scarcely breathe.</p><p>Pivoting on his heel, he faced her directly, affording her a clear view of his raging cock and taut musculature. He watched her swallow hard and understood how intimidating the sight of him must be. She was a tall woman, but he was still much taller. He was more than twice her size, his body hardened by both his common lineage and frequent physical activity.</p><p>And he was in full rut. Thick veins pulsed with his raging blood, and he fisted the shaft to ease the pain of it.</p><p>\u201cDoes the sight of me this way arouse you,\u201d he asked, \u201cor frighten you?\u201d</p><p>Amelia licked her lips. \u201cI am not frightened,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI am nervous and perhaps apprehensive, but I do not fear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a strong woman,\u201d he praised, striding swiftly toward her.</p><p>Without preliminaries, he kneeled on the bed and climbed over her, tugging her arm out of the way so he could claim a nipple with his mouth. He attended the stiff peak with hard, rhythmic suction, urging her silently to make some sound of her delight.</p><p>Her hands cupped the back of his head and held him to her breast. \u201cCome inside me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI hate this feeling of uncertainty and ignorance.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back on his heels, Colin pulled her legs over either side of his own, spreading her thighs wide to expose her cunt to his gaze. With the angle of the pillows and her semi-reclined position, she had a clear view. Before she could register the size of her tiny pink slit compared to the girth and length of his cock, he was in her, pushing the thick head into the tender opening.</p><p>She whimpered and dug her nails into his thighs.</p><p>Holding her hips, he took her, rocking gently but relentlessly deeper and deeper. His gaze moved between the place of their joining and her beautiful face.</p><p>With his back shadowing her from the rapidly dwindling glow of the fading fire, he could not discern color, but he saw the telltale shimmer of sweat on her brow, and her eyes glistened with a sheen of tears.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d he gasped, his fingers bruising her as she responded to his voice by rippling along the buried length of his cock. She was so damn tight and hot, it felt as if he were fucking into a tightly closed fist.</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d Her voice was thready and faraway sounding.</p><p>Colin lifted one of her hands from his skin and set it over her distended clitoris. \u201cStroke yourself,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>To his utter delight she obliged without embarrassment, her long, slender fingers circling the slick flesh with only slight hesitation.</p><p>Her lovely cunt responded as he had known it would, clenching and grasping at him with renewed fervor. With every suck, he pushed deeper, groaning with the ecstasy of it, gulping in desperate breaths of air filled with the scents of sex and honeysuckle.</p><p>She began to writhe and mewl in a show of such wanton craving, he would wonder later how he managed to work inside her completely without coming at the midway point. Finally, with a last desperate lunge, he hit the end of her, the sensation of being balls-deep inside her enough to make his eyes tear.</p><p>Amelia cried out as Montoya\u2019s hot, heavy length finally struck deep. A flare of torturous relief spread outward from the aching spot inside her that begged to be rubbed, and then coiled tight again.</p><p>When he held still, she struggled, circling her hips, grinding against the root of his shaft. The growl that left him was more animal than human, and her body shivered in response, spurred to greater lust by the sound.</p><p>He held her still with powerful hands, his gaze burning from within the eyeholes of the mask. His beautiful mouth was hard, his jaw taut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you move?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cBecause I am about to blow, and I refuse to go without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ready!\u201d Her voice was high with her distress, her womb clenching and tightening in a way that was nearly painful.</p><p>With effortless strength, he scooped her up and lifted to his knees, impaling her deeper on the rock-hard length of his cock. Amelia clung to his broad shoulders, her mouth suckling across the salty, whisker-roughened expanse of his throat. The room spun as he rearranged their positions, every movement sliding her over him until she bit him in retaliation for her sexual frustration.</p> <p>Montoya cursed and pushed her away from him.</p><p>\u201cRide,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed, her legs astride his, his erection buried deep. So deep. Canting his arms back, he supported his torso and gave her full access to use him as she willed. The display he made was searingly erotic, his abdomen laced tight with muscle, his furred chest damp with sweat.</p><p>And the mask. Dear God, the mask added a dark, alluring mystery that urged her to recklessness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow!\u201d he barked, making her jump.</p><p>Her shoulders went back and her chin lifted in answer to his challenge. She thought this must be difficult for him for reasons she had not considered before. He made love with the expertise of a man who had his choice of women, which suggested the marring of his face might have been a recent event. Perhaps she was the first woman to welcome him to her bed since the injury was inflicted. The thought added poignancy to an already remarkable event.</p><p>Amelia decided in that moment that she would love him well, with all that she had, better than any other woman ever could. She would reach for the turmoil she sensed inside him and soothe it with her passion, showing him with her body that it was his heart that lured her to him.</p><p>Setting her hands on his shoulders for balance, she pushed onto her knees and lifted, sliding her sex upward along the length of him. When she lowered, the feel of the broad head of his cock stroking over that quivering spot inside her made her gasp and shake violently.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he praised in a dark whisper, watching her through thick black lashes. \u201cSee how well I fit you? I was made for your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Biting her lower lip, she repeated the movement, venturing slowly as she found the way of it. Her thumb brushed across a scar that marred his shoulder, the wound so old, it had long since turned silver. She caressed it as she undulated, feeling the circular shape surrounded by ragged edges. In the back of her mind the injury bothered her, prodded at her . . .</p> <p>Then he spoke, and everything else scattered from her mind.</p><p>\u201cSweet Amelia. You are mine.\u201d</p><p>Amelia rose and wrapped her arms around his torso, tilting her head to fit her mouth over his, lifting and falling, moaning at the feel of her swollen nipples brushing across the light dusting of coarse hair on his chest.</p><p>Claiming him as he claimed her.</p><p>Montoya thrust one hand into her tresses, holding her close as he murmured encouragement into her mouth, his hips circling beneath her in breathtaking thrusts, stealing her wits.</p><p>Stealing her heart.</p><p>As she gained confidence, she moved faster, breathing hard from her exertions, drops of sweat trickling down between her bouncing breasts.</p><p>\u201cI want you this way daily.\u201d His words were heavy, slurred with pleasure. \u201cI want you to feel empty when I am not inside you. Hungry. Starved for me.\u201d</p> <p>Amelia knew it would be that way. She was mindless with lust, grinding, writhing, pumping onto his thick, straining erection as if she had done this before. As if she knew what she was doing.</p><p>His teeth nipped her throat and she cried out, everything clenching inside her until he cursed from the feel of it.</p><p>He was driving her to this madness\u2014with his big body reclined, his eyes heavy-lidded behind the mask, his lips glistening from her mouth. He looked like a pagan sex god. Exotically beautiful. Endlessly controlled. Content to lie back and be pleasured by a wanton whose sole focus was the pursuit of orgasm.</p><p>With her lips against his cheek, she whispered, \u201cFuck me,\u201d surprising herself with how easily the crude word rolled off her tongue.</p><p>A brutal shudder wracked Montoya\u2019s frame in response.</p><p>\u201cMake me come,\u201d she coaxed breathlessly, riding him still. \u201cI want it . . . I want you. Wild. Deep. I need you with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she could blink, he had twisted, pinning her to the bed. Feet on the floor and fists in the counterpane, he drove powerfully into her, every perfect downstroke wrenching a cry of rapture from her throat.</p><p>He loomed over her, watching her through the mask, his chest heaving, his abdomen lacing, his buttocks clenching beneath her calves as she lifted to meet his every plunge. His body was a study in sexual power. Built to fuck a woman into addiction.</p><p>The coiling tension in her womb tightened, forming a hard knot that made her head thrash against the brutal pleasure. And then it broke free in a riot of sensation, burning across her skin, seizing her lungs, spasming inside her in endless rapid ripples that worshipped his straining cock.</p><p>The guttural roar that ripped from his throat brought tears to her eyes and a name to her lips. He paused in midstroke, rigid, and she mewled a protest, undulating beneath him in delirious pleasure.</p><p>He resumed, increasing the strength and speed of his thrusts until he swelled inside her, groaning through gritted teeth. Embedded in her to the deepest point, his body jerked in time to the hot, thick wash of his ejaculations inside her.</p><p>It was savage and primitive and beautiful. He curled around her, his weight supported on his forearms beneath her back, his skin sticking to hers with their mingled sweat.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered ardently, his tongue licking the trails of her tears. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Amelia reached for the ribbons that secured the mask.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>It was dark in the room, the banked fire incapable of casting a shadow more than a foot away from the grate. Sight was difficult, and yet Simon\u2019s instincts urged him to heed their warning.</p><p>Moving cautiously, he turned his head and found the space in the bed beside him to be empty. He exhaled carefully, maintaining the deep, even rhythm of sleep.</p><p>Something had woken him, and since he was sleeping with a woman who would kill him if necessary, he knew ignoring the disturbance would not be wise.</p><p>He looked toward the window and saw the gleam of silver moonlight on strands of golden hair. Lysette had the drapes parted a scant inch or two and was presently staring out the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he whispered, sitting up.</p><p>Her head might have turned toward him, but he could not be sure.</p><p>\u201cI heard noises outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>The curtain closed. \u201cThree riders. One went inside briefly, I assume to wake the innkeeper. Then they continued on.\u201d</p><p>Shivering, Simon threw off the covers and moved to the grate. \u201cI doubt anyone would go to such trouble for directions at this time of night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you hear them? Were they French?\u201d</p><p>There was a brief flare of light as she lit a match; then the wick of a single taper took over the illumination. \u201cI think they were English.\u201d</p><p>He frowned into the flickering fire. \u201cPerhaps I should wake Maria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. They rode forward, not backward. Whatever they are looking for, it has yet to be found.\u201d</p><p>As heat began to radiate outward from the grate, Simon stood and faced Lysette. She looked tired, and a crease marred the side of her lovely face. She wore her cloak over her chemise and clutched it to her chest with white-knuckled fingers.</p><p>He gestured toward the bed. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go back to sleep. I am still sore from that blasted carriage and could use a bit more time on my back instead of my arse.\u201d</p><p>Lysette nodded wearily and sank into the chair she had been reading in earlier. \u201cBonne nuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Scowling, he asked, \u201cDid you fall asleep there?\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him. \u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>Simon ran a hand through his hair and prayed for patience. \u201cI do not bite or snore or drool. I mean no offense when I say that I have no interest in tumbling you. The bed is perfectly safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bed may be,\u201d she said, watching him impassively, \u201cbut I have some doubts as to whether you are.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to argue, then threw up his hands. \u201cBah! Rot in the chair, then.\u201d</p><p>Freezing, he hurried back to the bed and crawled between now-cooled linens. Curling into a ball, he prayed the warmth of the renewed fire would reach the bed soon.</p><p>\u201cCurse you,\u201d he grumbled, glaring down the length of the bed at her. \u201cIt would be much warmer if there were two of us in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more reason to want me dead than alive,\u201d she pointed out in a far too reasonable tone.</p><p>\u201cAt this moment, truer words were never spoken,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThe only reason I am not strangling you is because killing you would rob me of your body heat!\u201d</p><p>Her pretty lips thinned primly.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous, Lysette.\u201d He sat up, too frustrated to even attempt sleep. The impracticality of sleeping in the cramped wing chair after a long day of travel was so out of character for her. She was faultlessly practical, as was everyone who lived by their wits. \u201cWhy would I kill you now, when I have not before?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, but the way her gaze darted nervously belied the careless gesture.</p><p>Heaving out a long-suffering sigh, Simon once again tossed back the covers and stalked toward her. When she wielded a knife from between the edges of her cloak, he was not surprised.</p><p>\u201cPut that away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not attracted to you,\u201d he reiterated slowly. \u201cAnd even if I was, I have no need to force myself on an unwilling woman.\u201d</p><p>Lysette frowned suspiciously. \u201cI am fine in the chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. You look exhausted, and I cannot afford to drag you along while I attempt to clear Mitchell\u2019s name. You must carry your own weight.\u201d</p><p>She bristled at that. \u201cI will not be a burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if you won\u2019t after a night spent sleepless and frozen. You will become ill and useless.\u201d</p><p>Pushing to her feet, she said, \u201cI can take care of myself. Go back to bed and leave me in peace!\u201d</p><p>Simon opened his mouth to argue further, then shook his head instead. He once again climbed between the sheets and turned his back toward the other side of the bed. A few moments later, the taper was extinguished. Shortly afterward he heard delicate snoring.</p><p>Faced with a deepening puzzle, Simon lay awake for some time.</p><p>Amelia studied the masked man in repose beside her and wondered how deeply he slept.</p><p>\u201cWe will wait until the sunrise to remove it,\u201d Montoya had said earlier.</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d she countered, desperate to see beneath the now intrusive barrier. Her heart was smitten and her body no longer innocent. But what they shared could be no more than infatuation\u2014it could not be love\u2014if she did not see all sides of him.</p><p>\u201cI want nothing to mar this evening,\u201d he had explained, withdrawing from her body and moving to the washstand behind the screen in the corner. He\u2019d returned with a damp cloth and washed between her thighs, then cleansed himself before joining her in the bed. \u201cIn the morning, I will bare myself to you, strengthened by the memories of a blissful, perfect night in your arms.\u201d</p><p>In the end, she had reluctantly agreed, unwilling to be at odds with him over the matter of a few hours.</p><p>With his back to the headboard and her body curved to his side, he had asked her to share a beloved memory from her past. She had chosen a tale about Colin, relating how she had conquered her fear of heights by climbing a tree during a game of hide-and-seek.</p><p>\u201cHe passed below me several times,\u201d she said, her cheek resting over Montoya\u2019s heart. \u201cI half hoped he would find me quickly, because it was frightening clinging to that limb, but the desire to surprise him was too great to give myself away.\u201d</p><p>His hand caressed up and down the length of her back. \u201cYou wanted to win,\u201d he corrected, laughing that low, deep laugh she had adored from the moment she heard it.</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhen he finally forfeited, I was so pleased with myself. Colin spent his allowance on a new ribbon to mark the conquering of that fear.\u201d</p><p>Montoya sighed. \u201cHe must have loved you a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he did, although he never told me. I would have given anything to hear those words from him.\u201d Her fingers sifted through the hair on his chest.</p><p>\u201cActions speak louder than words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell myself that. I still have that ribbon. It is one of my greatest treasures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you imagine your life would have been like now, if you two had never been parted?\u201d</p><p>Lifting her head, she\u2019d met his questioning gaze. \u201cI have imagined it in hundreds of scenarios. The most likely one, I think, would be that St. John would have taken Colin under his wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have always hoped so. But that would depend upon him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would have asked you,\u201d Montoya said with conviction.</p><p>Amelia smiled. \u201cWhat leads you to be so certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved you deeply. I have no doubt. You were simply too young for him at the time, and he was not in a position to offer for you.\u201d He brushed the backs of his fingers along her cheekbone. \u201cDo you love him still?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, wondering at the wisdom of confessing a lingering affection for one man while warming the bed of another.</p><p>\u201cAlways tell me the truth,\u201d he urged softly, \u201cand you will never be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of me will love him forever. He helped to mold me into the person I am today. He is weaved into the very fabric of my life.\u201d</p><p>Montoya had kissed her then, sweetly and with deep reverence. Breathless and enamored, she asked him to share a part of his past with her, expecting that he might speak of his lost love. He did not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chose to speak of his livelihood and the dangerous work he had done for the Crown of England. He shared how he\u2019d traveled the length and breadth of the Continent, never having a true home or family, until the day he sought to resign and was instead embroiled in a life-threatening intrigue.</p><p>\u201cThat is why I attempted to maintain my distance from you,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not want to taint your life with my mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how your face was scarred?\u201d she asked, her fingertips lightly following the edge of the mask where it touched his skin.</p><p>He went rigid. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>Instantly contrite for having distressed him, Amelia rushed to say, \u201cI can understand your fear, but your disfigurement will not alter my affection for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia . . .\u201d He seemed at a loss for words.</p><p>The conversation had died then, and they had simply clung to each other as Montoya fell asleep. She remained awake, her mind shifting through a multitude of thoughts. She planned what to say to Ware and Maria and mentally rehearsed how she would ask St. John for his assistance. She catalogued the various aches and pains that heralded her new awareness as a woman and speculated on how her relationship with Montoya would proceed once they were freed from all the unknowns that plagued them. She also wondered at her outrageous behavior of the last week and what it meant.</p><p>Only Maria truly understood what a monster Lord Welton was. That his blood ran through Amelia\u2019s veins made her ill at times. Externally, she was clearly his issue. Was she also like her father in ways she could not see? It was terrifying to realize that everything she had done these last few days had been selfishly motivated. She had disregarded the feelings and concerns of those who cared for her\u2014Ware, Maria, and St. John\u2014in favor of her desire to be with Montoya. Was she truly her father\u2019s daughter?</p><p>Amelia gazed into the licking flames and thought of the mask, ruminating about the man beneath it. The urge to peek beneath the guise was pressing. She tried to excuse the action with the reasoning that it was the mystery of his identity that had goaded her to act so rashly, not a defect in her character.</p> <p>But what if Montoya was a light sleeper? What if he caught her and became angry? She dreaded the thought of exchanging furious words.</p><p>Perhaps she could test the depth of his slumber in some way . . . ?</p><p>Her hand lifted from the hard expanse of his abdomen, and her fingertips ran lightly along his thigh. The muscle twitched, but he made no other movement. Amelia tried again, caressing him with deeper pressure. This time, he moved not at all.</p><p>She became hopeful. He had loved her long and well, and extended journeys were known to make many a traveler weary.</p><p>Raising her head, her gaze roamed admiringly over the sculpted beauty of his chest. The scar on his shoulder was more visible now, the room lightened considerably by the fire Montoya had stoked into a hearty blaze to banish the pervasive chill. She studied the bullet hole with sympathy, guessing by the size and many radiating lines that it had been a nasty wound.</p><p>She kissed the evidence of injury, her lips brushing featherlight over the damaged flesh. The tempo of his breathing changed, and his nipples tightened while she watched in awe.</p> <p>How fascinating the human body was. Tonight she had learned so much about her own. Amelia felt the sudden urge to know everything about his.</p><p>With the memories of his lovemaking still fresh and burning in her mind, she extended her tongue and licked across the tiny bead of darkened flesh. His skin was salty, the texture firmer than hers. She loved it, as she was beginning to love all of him.</p><p>Mimicking his earlier ministrations to her breasts, Amelia wrapped her lips around his nipple and sucked gently. He stirred, but not in the way she had anticipated.</p><p>Her thigh was draped over his, her knee bent and leg raised. As his cock swelled, she felt it, and she turned her head to see the thickening outline of his erection beneath the bedclothes. Her blood heated and began to move sluggishly. More surprising yet, her mouth watered.</p><p>She glanced at his face beneath lowered lashes. In the shadows of the eyeholes he appeared to be sleeping, with no telltale shimmer from liquid eyes to betray his cognizance.</p><p>Did she dare to explore further?</p><p>Her curiosity raging, she did not debate the question long. She slid downward, pulling the counterpane with her, eventually exposing his glorious cock to her avid gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou play with fire, love.\u201d</p> <p>Montoya\u2019s voice startled her. She looked up at him and found him watching her with slumberous, burning eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been awake?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve yet to fall asleep.\u201d His wicked mouth curved, revealing his dimple.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you keep your silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see how far you would go.\u201d His hand lifted, his fingertips catching and caressing a stray curl of her hair. \u201cCurious kitten,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Your touch is vital to me.\u201d</p><p>Considering that permission to proceed, she returned her attention to his erection. Amelia ran one fingertip from tip to root and smiled when it jerked at her touch.</p><p>\u201cI find it astonishing that you fit in me,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>Remembering the rapturous feel of her cunt around his cock, Colin could not find the voice to reply. He was ferociously aroused and leashing himself by sheer will alone. When she\u2019d begun to touch him, he had thought it by chance. Then she\u2019d lifted her head and branded him forever with the feel of her lips upon the wound that had nearly killed him. It was the gunshot that had separated them so many years ago. The shot he\u2019d taken while trying to save her.</p><p>Amelia slid lower still, stopping at eye level with his groin and leaving a trail of moisture along his leg. The evidence that the mere sight of his body was enough to arouse her to slickness made his bollocks tighten, forcing a perfect bead of semen to grace the tip of his cock.</p><p>His lungs seized as she eyed it hungrily. Would she be so bold?</p><p>A heartbeat later the question was answered as her tongue darted out and licked the droplet away.</p><p>Colin exhaled harshly at the whiplash of pleasure.</p><p>She studied him with narrowed eyes, a look he had come to know well over the years. It was a calculated glance, one she gave when considering how to tackle a challenge he presented. He smiled, understanding that she never sought to best him, only to equal him and be his match.</p><p>\u201cYou never answered me before,\u201d she said, circling the base of his cock with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cDoes a woman\u2019s mouth feel so different from her quim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn many ways. A cunt hugs every inch of a cock. It expands and contracts in ripples, and it is as soft as the finest silk. In contrast, a woman\u2019s mouth hugs through suction, not design. The pad of the tongue is textured and the muscle is agile. It can stroke like a finger, which stimulates the sensitive spot\u201d\u2014he pointed to the place on the underside of his cockhead\u2014\u201chere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich do you prefer?\u201d Her grip slid upward, then down again, making his teeth clench.</p><p>\u201cBoth have unique pleasures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not an answer,\u201d she murmured, caressing him again.</p><p>\u201cIt is difficult to think when you are fondling me,\u201d he managed.</p><p>She ceased and waited impatiently for him to gather his wits.</p><p>\u201cMy preference changes with my mood. There will be occasions when I will want to lose myself in you. I will want to hold you close and feel your body moving beneath mine. I will want to suck on your nipples and feast at your mouth. I will want to watch your face as you orgasm and hold you in the aftermath.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke he felt her grow wetter, hotter against the flesh of his leg. His voice deepened in response. \u201cAt other times, I will want to be serviced. I will want to lose myself to the pleasure in a way I cannot when I must see to your needs as well. The sight of your supplication will satisfy the primitive male in me, while my surrender to your care will be complete. I will be helpless and open, completely at your mercy.\u201d</p><p>The smile she gave him was impish. \u201cI should like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might, or you might not. Many women do not. They fail to see the power in the act. They feel demeaned and used. Others simply do not like the taste of a man\u2019s seed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d</p><p>He knew that hum and its portent. She wanted to know which type of woman she would be. Sadly, they had run out of time.</p><p>\u201cWe must dress you and return you safely to your room before you are seen. When the hour is appropriate to protect your reputation, we will meet and I will bare myself to you\u2014my face and my secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not finished with you,\u201d she complained with a seductive pout that hardened him to full, raging arousal.</p><p>\u201cIt will be with exquisite pleasure that I offer myself to your sexual experimentation, love,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cBut such play requires time free of interruptions. We do not have the luxury tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak of our future liaisons with such surety,\u201d Amelia said, staring at his cock and resuming her ministrations.</p><p>Colin set his hand over hers and stilled her movements. \u201cI cannot think otherwise and advise you not to either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have not made your intentions known.\u201d</p><p>Fueled by heady lust and burning possessiveness, he promised, \u201cMy intention is to tear down everything that stands between us. Then I want to woo you properly, with great fanfare. I want to dazzle you with extravagance, and lay the world at your feet.\u201d His thumb caressed the back of her hand. \u201cThen, when every recessed corner of your heart is filled with love for me, I will wed you.\u201d</p><p>He loved her. He could not imagine never having her, not after this night. Yet he could make her no promises with a price on his head.</p><p>Despite this, at the pinnacle of the orgasm of his life, he had pressed against her womb and emptied his seed inside her. He no longer had any time. The clock was ticking.</p><p>Colin watched her lovely face and could not guess her thoughts. \u201cAmelia?\u201d</p><p>She laid her cheek upon his thigh. \u201cDo not wait until life meets some inner criteria to seize the day,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI have learned that sometimes tomorrow never comes.\u201d</p><p>Her melancholy cut him, and he held his arms out to her, groaning his pleasure when she draped her nude body over his. Sexual desire simmered into the more complicated need to cling to something precious, yet unsecured.</p><p>Dawn approached, but neither was capable of releasing the other.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>It was a knock that woke her. At first groggy with the remnants of sleep, Maria took a moment to recognize her surroundings. Then the memories of the day before and the long, sleepless night rushed back in a deluge. She sat up abruptly, tossed back the covers, and rushed to the door.</p><p>\u201cChristopher!\u201d With joy, she flung herself into her husband\u2019s arms, and he crushed her to him, lifting her feet from the floor and stepping into the room.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me so quickly?\u201d she asked, as he kicked the portal closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been quicker, damn you, if you had stayed in one of my inns and not this hovel! Why the devil are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon insisted.\u201d She had tried to suggest they use one of the many homes Christopher owned across the entire length and breadth of the country. They were not grand. They were small cottages, inhabited by those who lived off pensions provided by St. John. The homes were safe, comfortable, and usually located in quiet corners where few questions were asked and fewer visitors came by. Nicknamed \u201cinns\u201d for both the accurate description of the service provided and also for the anonymity afforded by so generic a name, they were responsible for saving many lives.</p><p>\u201cDamn him, too,\u201d Christopher said. Then he took her mouth, his head tilting to fit his lips to hers.</p><p>When she was limp and breathless, he muttered, \u201cVexing wench. Why must you torment me by being so troublesome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not my doing!\u201d she protested, tossing his hat aside.</p><p>\u201cDamned if it isn\u2019t.\u201d He carried her to the bed and tossed her upon it, his gaze heating at the sight of her clad in only a chemise. Shrugging out of his fawn-colored coat, he said, \u201cIf you had not indulged Amelia in her fancy, we would not be taxed with chasing her, and I would not have spent the frigid night in a carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would have gone alone, I know it.\u201d Maria crawled beneath the covers.</p><p>Christopher rebuilt the fire. Then he discarded his waistcoat, removed his boots, and climbed into bed with her, wearing his breeches and shirtsleeves.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you found me with such haste,\u201d she said, curling into his side.</p><p>\u201cWhen Sam returned with the news of where you had gone, he mentioned Quinn. I sent men to find his lodgings, and when they discovered where he was staying, they found his valet packing. I followed him and he led me here.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Maria lifted her head. \u201cHow is that possible? We had no notion that we would be staying at this establishment until we chanced upon it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn must have known. His valet and the abigail of his French companion came directly to this place. You did say he insisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe insisted we stay near the road.\u201d But, now that she thought of it, she remembered that it was Simon who\u2019d begged that they take shelter at the first inn they came to just before Reading. She had protested the sorry appearance of the lodging, but he had complained of a sore arse and growling stomach.</p><p>\u201cI do not understand.\u201d She sat up and faced her reclining spouse. \u201cOur meeting in the shop was unplanned, I am certain of it. Even if I were wrong about that, there was no way for Simon to know Amelia would run off as she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, if he knew who Amelia was chasing and where the man might be headed . . .\u201d Christopher\u2019s words faded, leaving her to draw her own conclusions.</p><p>\u201cHe told me they were already intent on a holiday, yet you say his valet and belongings were not yet ready. Why the ruse? Why pretend to help me, when he had his own motives for following?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe will have to ask him those questions in a few hours, when we rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hours?!\u201d</p><p>He yawned and tugged her back into his arms. \u201cHis room is guarded, and the hour is still relatively early. I sent riders ahead to follow the trail. There is nothing pressing that cannot wait the duration of a much-needed nap. I require some sleep this morn or I will be useless the rest of the day. Besides\u2014and you must forgive me for pointing this out\u2014you do not look rested either.\u201d</p><p>Maria settled into her husband\u2019s embrace with lingering reluctance. She was a woman who acted swiftly. Doing so had kept her alive. \u201cI cannot sleep well without you near,\u201d she confessed.</p> <p>He hugged her tighter and pressed a kiss to her forehead. \u201cIt pleases me to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have become accustomed to your snoring.\u201d</p><p>His head lifted. \u201cI do not snore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know? You are asleep when you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone would have mentioned it to me before now,\u201d he argued.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you exhausted them so that they slept right through it.\u201d</p><p>Growling, he rolled and pinned her beneath him. She blinked up at him with mock innocence. No one dared to tease the fearsome pirate, except for her. Goading his ire was a delicious temptation she could not resist, because the more she agitated him, the more sexually focused he became.</p><p>\u201cIf you need exhausting, madam,\u201d he bit out, reaching between them to unfasten his breeches, \u201cI am more than capable of managing that task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were useless and required a nap.\u201d</p><p>He shoved up the hem of her chemise and cupped her sex in his hand. Instantly, she was wet for him. Hot and creamy with desire. She moaned as he stroked her, and he smiled arrogantly, pulling away to position his cock.</p><p>\u201cDoes this feel useless to you?\u201d he purred, pushing the hard length into her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Christopher,\u201d she breathed, awash in heated delight. After nearly six years of marriage, her ardor for him had not lessened one bit. \u201cI love you so. Please don\u2019t fall asleep before I come . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will pay for that,\u201d he said in a voice slurred with pleasure.</p><p>He made certain she did. And it was wonderful.</p><p>Colin was rinsing off his razor when a stray noise caught his attention and arrested his movements. He listened carefully, his nerves already stretched by the upcoming confrontation.</p><p>Amelia had returned to her chamber some time ago, but he doubted she slept. She was too curious, too impatient by nature. Knowing her as well as he did, he imagined she paced her room and glanced repeatedly at the clock, counting down the minutes to the time when he would reveal his identity to her.</p><p>There. It came again. The perceptible sound of scratching at the door.</p><p>Setting his blade on the washstand, he grabbed a cloth and was drying his face when his valet opened the door. Jacques entered bearing a grim expression.</p><p>\u201cMiss Benbridge has been found, mon ami.\u201d</p> <p>Colin stilled. \u201cBy whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiders this morning. They spoke with the giant who came with her and then turned about.\u201d</p><p>Heaving out his breath, Colin nodded. \u201cDid you arrange the private dining room as I requested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMais oui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I will be down in a moment.\u201d</p><p>The door shut with a quiet click, and Colin hastened his toilette. He had promised Amelia an explanation, and he intended to give it to her without interruption.</p><p>Nodding to his valet, he presented his back and shrugged into the coat he had selected that morning. It was a striking garment, reminiscent of a male peacock\u2019s beautiful plumage. The cost of the intricately embroidered ensemble, which included breeches and silver-threaded waistcoat, was obvious. The Colin Mitchell who Amelia remembered so fondly would never have been able to purchase clothing so expensive. He wore it now as an outward display of his rise in the world. His dream of becoming a man capable of affording her was now a reality, and he wanted her to see that straightaway.</p><p>Suitably attired and inwardly certain, Colin left his bedchamber and took the stairs to the main room. It took only a moment to find the large man who had accompanied Amelia. The giant sat with his back to the wall and his eyes trained on his surroundings. As Colin approached him, the man\u2019s gaze sharpened with examining intensity.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Colin greeted, coming to a halt directly before the table.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d came the deep, rumbling reply. \u201cI am Count Montoya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is much I need to explain to her. Will you give me the time and opportunity to do so?\u201d</p><p>The man pursed his lips and leaned back his chair. \u201cWhat do you \u2019ave in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have reserved the private dining room. I will keep the door ajar, but I beg you to remain outside.\u201d</p><p>The man pushed to his feet, towering over Colin\u2019s not inconsiderable height. \u201cThat will suit both me and my blade.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded and stepped aside, but as the giant moved to pass him, he said, \u201cPlease give her this.\u201d</p><p>He handed over the items in his hand. After a brief pause, they were taken from him. Colin waited until Amelia\u2019s guard had ascended the stairs; then he moved to the private dining room and mentally prepared for the most difficult conversation of his life.</p><p>The moment Maria entered the main room of the inn, Simon knew he was in trouble. She bore the glow of a woman well fucked, but if that had not given away the end of his gambit, her change of clothes would have. Confirmation came when Christopher St. John entered the space a few steps behind his wife.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely way to begin the day,\u201d Lysette said with laughter in her voice. Much as he usually detested her enjoyment of drama, today it was a relief after her odd behavior the night before.</p><p>Simon heaved a resigned sigh and pushed to his feet.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he greeted, bowing to the striking couple. The combination of St. John\u2019s golden coloring and Maria\u2019s Spanish blood was an attractive one.</p><p>\u201cQuinn,\u201d St. John said.</p><p>\u201cSimon,\u201d Maria murmured. She lowered into the chair her husband held out for her and linked her hands primly atop the table. \u201cYou know the identity of the man behind the mask. Who is he?\u201d</p><p>Resuming his seat, Simon said, \u201cHe is Count Reynaldo Montoya. He was in my employ for several years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d the pirate asked. \u201cNo longer?\u201d</p><p>Simon related the events with Cartland.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Maria breathed, her dark eyes wide with horror. \u201cWhen Amelia said the man was in danger, I never imagined it would be to this degree. Why did you not tell me? Why the lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is complicated, Maria,\u201d he said, hating that he had betrayed the trust she bestowed so rarely. \u201cI am not at liberty to divulge Montoya\u2019s secrets. He has saved my life many times over. I owe him at least my silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of my sister?\u201d she cried. \u201cYou know how much she means to me. To know that she was at risk and not warn me . . .\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cI believed you and I were closer than that.\u201d</p><p>St. John reached over and clasped his wife\u2019s hand. The gesture of comfort pained Simon deeply. Out of all the women in the world, Maria was the dearest to him.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to help you find her and then send her to safety with you,\u201d Simon said, \u201cleaving Montoya and I to finish this business.\u201d</p><p>Maria\u2019s gaze narrowed in her fury. It radiated from her, belying the girlish image created by her delicate floral gown. \u201cYou should have told me, Simon. If I had known, I would have managed the situation far differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou would have tasked dozens of men with the search, which would have alerted Cartland and put her at greater risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not know that!\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cI know him. He worked for me. I know all his strengths. Finding lost people and items is his forte. Lackeys scouring the countryside would attract the attention of a simpleton, and Cartland is far from that!\u201d</p><p>It was the pirate\u2019s raspy drawl that cut through the building tension. \u201cHow do you signify, Mademoiselle Rousseau?\u201d</p><p>Lysette waved one delicate hand carelessly. \u201cI am the judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the executioner, if need be,\u201d Simon grumbled.</p><p>St. John\u2019s brows rose. \u201cFascinating.\u201d</p><p>Maria pushed back from the table and stood. Simon and St. John stood as well.</p><p>\u201cI have wasted enough time here,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI must find Amelia before anyone else does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me to come with you,\u201d Simon asked. \u201cI can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have helped quite enough, thank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysette witnessed three riders making inquiries in the dead of night.\u201d Simon\u2019s tone was grim. \u201cYou need all the assistance you can muster. Amelia\u2019s safety lies within your purview, but Cartland and Montoya lie within mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d Lysette interjected. \u201cI do not understand why we do not contact the man you work for here in England. He would seem to be an untapped, valuable resource.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. John likely has a larger, more reliable web of associates,\u201d Simon argued. \u201cOne more swiftly galvanized into action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaria.\u201d St. John set his hand at the small of her back. \u201cQuinn knows the appearances of both men. We do not. We would be blind without him.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Simon again. \u201cWhy does Montoya wear the mask?\u201d</p><p>Careful to keep his face impassive, Simon used the excuse that Colin gave him. \u201cHe wore the mask for the masquerade. Later, he wore it to make it more difficult for Miss Benbridge to pursue him. He did not want to jeopardize her. He cares for her.\u201d</p><p>Maria lifted her hand to stem anything else he might say.</p><p>\u201cWe have an added complication,\u201d the pirate said. All eyes turned to him. \u201cLord Ware may follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou jest!\u201d Maria cried.</p><p>\u201cWho is Lord Ware?\u201d Lysette asked.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Simon muttered. \u201cThe last thing we require is the injury of a peer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked to accompany me,\u201d St. John said grimly. \u201cBut the departure of Quinn\u2019s valet made waiting impossible. Still, he asked for direction, and while I was deliberately vague in hopes that he would reconsider, he may prove more tenacious than other men of his station.\u201d</p><p>Maria exhaled sharply. \u201cEven more reason to keep moving, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent the town carriage back to London,\u201d the pirate said. \u201cPietro is loading the travel coach as we speak. We should make better time.\u201d</p><p>Simon, unfortunately, did not have a change of equipage, but his bruised arse would have to make do.</p><p>With the sunrise lighting their way, they hastened toward Reading.</p><p>The moment the knock came to her bedroom door, Amelia ran to open it.</p><p>\u201cTim!\u201d she cried, startled at the sight of her visitor and not very pleased. Perhaps he intended for them to leave now, which would necessitate her explaining about Montoya and her deception of the night before.</p><p>He took one look at her wild hair and disarrayed clothing and cursed with a viciousness that made her wince. \u201cYou lied to me last night!\u201d he accused, pushing his way inside.</p><p>She blinked. How did he know?</p><p>Then she saw the items in his hand, and the answer to the question lost importance. \u201cLet me see,\u201d she said, her heart racing at the possibilities. Tim had the mask. How? Why?</p><p>Tim stared at her for a long, taut moment, then offered her the mask and the missive with it.</p><p>My love,</p><p>You have the mask. When next you see me, I will not be wearing it.</p><p>Your servant,</p><p>M</p><p>The sudden realization that Montoya could have fled after she departed made her feel ill.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d she gasped, clutching the mask to her chest. \u201cIs he gone?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201c\u2019E waits for you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must go to him.\u201d</p><p>Amelia hurried to the untouched bed where her corset and underskirts awaited donning. Montoya hadn\u2019t the time to dress her completely. His fear for her discovery in his room had driven him to haste. She had hoped to ask a chambermaid for help, but Tim would have to manage the task.</p><p>\u201cI think you should wait until St. John comes,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019E\u2019s on \u2019is way now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she breathed, pausing in midmovement. Her time with Montoya was too precious. The addition of her sister and brother-in-law would only add to the confusion she felt. \u201cI must speak with him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already been alone with \u2019im,\u201d he barked, shooting a pointed glance at the untouched bed. \u201cSt. John will \u2019ave my \u2019ead for that. I don\u2019t need to give \u2019im any more to be angry o\u2019er.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not understand. I have yet to see Montoya\u2019s face. You cannot expect me to face such a revelation with witnesses who are in foul temper.\u201d She held a shaking hand out to him.</p><p>He stared at it for a long moment with his jaw clenched tight and his fists clenched tighter. \u201cA moment ago, I admired \u2019im for seeking me out. Now I want to rip \u2019im to pieces. \u2019E should not have touched you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted him,\u201d she said with tears in her eyes. \u201cI pushed him. I was selfish and cared only about my own desires.\u201d</p><p>Just as her father would have done, curse him. And curse his blood which tainted her. Everything around her was in disarray because she could think only of herself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d Tim complained, looking miserable.</p><p>His discomfort was her fault. Somehow, she had to make everything right. The starting point was Montoya, as he was the pivotal figure who had begun this descent into madness.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to him before they arrive.\u201d She shrugged out of her unfastened gown, wiggled into her corset, and presented her back. \u201cI shall need your assistance to dress.\u201d</p><p>Tim muttered something as he stalked toward her, and by the glower he wore, she thought herself fortunate to have missed it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll wed Sarah after all,\u201d he growled, yanking on her stays so tightly, she lost her ability to breathe. \u201cI\u2019m too old fer this.\u201d</p><p>Gasping and lacking the air required to speak, she swatted at him to fix it. He scowled, then appeared to notice that she was about to faint, and why. He grumbled an apology and loosened the tapes.</p><p>\u201cI \u2019ope yer \u2019appy,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve driven me to the altar!\u201d</p><p>Amelia pulled on her underskirts. After Tim tied them to her, she caught up her dress from where it pooled on the floor and thrust her arms into the sleeves.</p> <p>Tim\u2019s thick fingers fumbled with the tiny buttons that secured the gown.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She looked over her shoulder. \u201cI do not know if I have ever told you that, but it\u2019s true. You are a good man.\u201d</p><p>The flush of his skin spoke volumes.</p><p>\u201c\u2019E\u2019d best marry you, if that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he said gruffly, his gaze on his task. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll string \u2019im up and gut \u2019im like a fish.\u201d</p><p>It was some sort of peace offering, and she accepted it gratefully. \u201cI would help you, if it came to that.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted, but a quick glance over her shoulder revealed a wry curve to his lips. \u201c\u2019E doesn\u2019t know what trouble \u2019e\u2019s got \u2019imself into with you.\u201d</p><p>Amelia shifted impatiently. \u201cI pray we can keep the man alive long enough to show him.\u201d</p><p>The moment Tim announced he was done, she pulled on stockings and shoes, and rushed toward the door. As she took the stairs with all the decorum she could muster, her breath shortened until she felt dizzy.</p><p>The next moments of her life would alter the future forever; she felt it in her bones. The feeling of portent was so strong, she was almost inclined to flee, but could not. She needed Montoya with a depth and strength she had thought she would never feel again. Part of her heart screamed silently at the betrayal of her first, dear love for Colin. The other half was older, wiser and understood that affection for one did not negate the affection she felt for the other.</p><p>Her hand shook as she reached for the doorknob of the private dining room. In the best of circumstances she would be nervous. She was about to face the man who had seen her and touched her in ways no one else ever had. The added tension brought on by the revealing of his face only deepened her disquiet and concern.</p><p>Taking a deep, shaky breath, Amelia knocked.</p> <p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Before she lost her courage, she entered with as confident a stride as she could affect. She paused just inside, taking in the lay of the room with its cheerily blazing fire, large circular table draped in cloth, and walls covered in paintings of the countryside. He faced away from her before a window, his hands clasped at the small of his back, his broad shoulders covered in exquisite colorful silk, his silky black locks restrained in a queue that ended just between his shoulder blades.</p><p>The sight of his richly clad form in the simple country room was glaring. Then he turned, and her body froze in shock.</p><p>It cannot be him, she thought with something akin to panic. It is impossible.</p><p>Her heart ceased beating, her breath seized in her lungs, and her thoughts stuttered as if she had taken a blow to the brain.</p><p>Colin.</p><p>How was it possible . . . ?</p><p>As her knees gave way, she grappled blindly for a nearby chair but missed. She crumpled to the rug, a loud gasp filling the highly charged air as her instincts rushed to the fore and forced her to breathe.</p> <p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d He lunged toward her, but she held up a hand to stop him.</p><p>\u201cStay away!\u201d she managed, through a throat clenched painfully tight.</p><p>The Colin Mitchell she knew and loved was dead.</p><p>Then, how is it, an insidious mental voice questioned, that he is here with you?</p><p>It can\u2019t be him . . . It can\u2019t be him . . .</p><p>She repeated that litany endlessly in her mind, unable to bear the thought of the years between them, the life he must have led, the days and nights, the smiles and laughter . . .</p><p>The betrayal was so complete, she could not credit that Colin was capable of it. Yet, as she stared at the dangerously handsome man who stood across from her, her heart whispered the agonizing truth.</p><p>I would know him anywhere, it said. My love.</p><p>How could she have missed the signs?</p><p>Because he was dead. Because I grieved long and deeply.</p><p>Freed from the confines of the mask, Colin\u2019s exotic Gypsy features left no doubt that it was he. He was older, the lines of his face more angular, but the traces of the boy she had loved were there. The eyes, however, were Montoya\u2019s\u2014loving, hungry, knowing eyes.</p><p>The lover who\u2019d shared her bed was Colin . . .</p><p>A wracking sob escaped her, and she covered her mouth with her hand.</p><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d</p><p>The aching tone in which her name was spoken made her cry harder. The foreign accent was gone, leaving behind the voice she heard in her dreams. It was deeper, more mature, but it was Colin\u2019s.</p><p>She looked away, unable to stand the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cHave you nothing to say?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cNo questions to ask? No insults to hurl?\u201d</p><p>A hundred words struggled to leave her mouth, and three very precious ones, but she leashed them tightly, unwilling to bare the depth of her pain. She stared at a small, square painting of a lake that adorned the wall. Her lower lip quivered, and she bit it to hide the telltale movement.</p><p>\u201cMy body has been inside yours,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cMy heart beats in your breast. Can you not at least look at me, if you will not speak to me?\u201d</p><p>Her silent reply was the tears that flowed in a steady, endless stream.</p><p>He cursed and came toward her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried, stilling him. \u201cDo not come near me.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s jaw clenched visibly, and she watched the muscle tic with an odd disconnection. How strange to see Montoya\u2019s maturity and polish within her childhood love. He looked the same and yet different. He was bigger, stronger, more vital. He was stunningly attractive, blessed with a novel masculine appeal few could rival. She used to dream of the day they would be wed and she could call him her own.</p><p>But that dream had died when he had.</p><p>\u201cI still dream of that,\u201d he murmured, answering the words she had not realized she\u2019d spoken aloud. \u201cI still want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou allowed me to believe you were dead,\u201d she whispered, unable to reconcile the Colin she remembered with the magnificently dressed man standing before her.</p><p>\u201cI had no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have come to me at any time; instead you have been absent for years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI returned as soon as I was able.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs another man!\u201d She shook her head violently, her mind filling with memories of the last weeks. \u201cIt was a cruel game you played with my affections, making me care for a man who does not exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI exist!\u201d He stood tall and proud, his shoulders back, his chin lifted. \u201cI played no role with you. Every word that left Montoya\u2019s mouth, every touch, was from my heart. The same heart beats in both men. We are one and the same. Both madly in love with you.\u201d</p><p>She dismissed his claim with a wave of her hand. \u201cYou affected an accent and allowed me to believe you were disfigured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe accent was a fa\u00e7ade, yes. A way to keep you from guessing the truth before I could tell you properly. The rest was a creation of your mind, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not blame this farce on me!\u201d Amelia struggled to her feet. \u201cYou allowed me to grieve for you. Have you any notion of what I have suffered these last years? How I have suffered these last weeks, feeling as if I was betraying Colin by falling in love with Montoya?\u201d</p><p>Torment shadowed his features, and she hated the vicious satisfaction she felt at the sight of it. \u201cYour heart was never fooled,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cIt always knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d His dark eyes burned with an inner fire. \u201cDo you recall whose name you cried at the height of orgasm? When I was deep inside you, clasped in the very heart of your body, do you remember which lover\u2019s name came to your lips?\u201d</p><p>Amelia swallowed hard, her mind shifting through the myriad of sensations that had assailed her untried body. She remembered the look of the bullet scar on his shoulder, the way the feel of it had plagued her in some fashion she could not pinpoint.</p><p>\u201cYou were driving me mad!\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you, Amelia. I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, you could have. I nearly begged you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have this discussion directly after we made love?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cNever! Last night was the culmination of my deepest, most cherished fantasies. Nothing could have induced me to ruin that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is ruined!\u201d she yelled, shaking. \u201cI feel as if I have lost two loves, for the Colin I knew is dead, and Montoya was a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not a lie!\u201d</p><p>Colin came toward her, and she hastily caught the back of a chair and pulled it between them. The sturdy wooden seat was no deterrent, however, and he shoved it aside.</p><p>She turned to flee, but he caught her, and the feel of his arms around her trembling body was too much.</p><p>Amelia hung in his embrace, devastated.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he murmured, his lips to her temple. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>For so long she\u2019d prayed to hear those words from his lips, but they were too little now and far too late.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>As her coach pulled into the courtyard of the inn specified by the outriders, Maria collected her hat and gloves in preparation for alighting.</p><p>\u201cIt is a rare sight to see you so anxious,\u201d Christopher murmured, his heavy-lidded gaze making him appear deceptively slumberous. She knew him too well to believe that.</p><p>\u201cI am relieved we have found her and that she was of sound mind enough to drag Tim along with her, but there are still the matters of Montoya and Ware to address.\u201d Maria sighed. \u201cAs miserable as my youth was, I am grateful to have been too busy to indulge in reckless love such as this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were waiting for me,\u201d Christopher purred, catching her hand before she gloved it and kissing the back.</p><p>She cupped his cheek and smiled. \u201cYou were worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>The coach rolled to a halt, and Christopher vaulted down. As she accepted his assistance, she said, \u201cI am surprised that Tim is not out here to greet us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I,\u201d he agreed. He glanced up at the coachman. \u201cPietro, make arrangements for the horses, then unload Miss Benbridge\u2019s valise.\u201d</p><p>Pietro nodded and pulled away, taking the carriage to the stables several yards away.</p><p>\u201cYou think of everything,\u201d Maria praised, wrapping her arm around his.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think of you,\u201d he corrected, looking down at her with the melting intensity that had shattered her defenses so many years ago.</p><p>They waited for Simon and Mademoiselle Rousseau to join them. Then they all entered the quiet inn.</p><p>\u201cI will inquire about Tim,\u201d Christopher said, striding to the counter. A moment later, he gestured for one of the lackeys at her side to join him. Together, the two men followed the innkeeper out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Mademoiselle Rousseau wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cLet us order food,\u201d Simon said. \u201cI am half-starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are always half-starved,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt requires a great deal of energy to tolerate you, mademoiselle,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>The bickering duo walked away, leaving Maria waiting with a lackey. She frowned as Christopher reappeared with Tim in tow.</p><p>Maria noted the grim look on Tim\u2019s face and moved forward to meet them. \u201cWhere is Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Christopher drawled, \u201cher phantom admirer has decided to step out from behind the mask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She glanced at Tim, who looked both pained and furious. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are speaking in the private dining room,\u201d Christopher explained, \u201cwith an open door for propriety\u2019s sake. From the sounds of it, it is not going well for the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen \u2019e approached me,\u201d Tim rumbled, \u201cI thought \u2019e looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t place \u2019is face. It came to me when I overheard them talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat came to you?\u201d she asked, looking between both men. \u201cWho is he? Do we know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the pictures I drew for you in Brighton?\u201d Tim asked, harkening back to the days of her \u201ccourtship\u201d with Christopher. After a failed attempt to retrieve Amelia, Tim had put both his excellent memory and talent for rendering to good use by drawing images of the servants who had spirited Amelia away.</p><p>Nodding, Maria recalled the stunningly beautiful drawings. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man she\u2019s speaking to is one of them.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she tried to recall them all. There had been a drawing of Amelia and Pietro, as well as of a governess and a young groomsman . . .</p><p>\u201cThat is not possible,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cThat young man was Colin, the boy who died trying to save Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPietro\u2019s nephew, was he not?\u201d Christopher asked with one brow raised. \u201cIf there are any doubts about the man\u2019s identity, I am certain Pietro can help us to dispel them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d she breathed. Pivoting on her heel, she looked for Simon and found him sinking into a chair. She marched toward him.</p><p>He glanced up and saw her coming, his blue eyes first sparkling with welcome, then narrowing warily. The smile that curved his sensual lips faded as resignation passed over his features. She knew then that it was true, and her heart ached for the torment her sister must be feeling.</p><p>\u201cOut with it,\u201d she snapped, as he stood before her.</p><p>Simon nodded and pulled out the empty seat that waited between him and Mademoiselle Rousseau. \u201cYou might want to take a seat,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cThis might take some time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRelease me, Colin.\u201d</p><p>Amelia held back a sob by dint of will alone. The feel of his big, powerful body pressed so passionately against her back was both a balm and a barb. Her nerves were raw; her emotions fluctuated between wild, heady joy and a feeling of abandonment too close to what she had felt in her father\u2019s negligent care.</p><p>\u201cI cannot,\u201d he said hoarsely, his hot cheek pressed ardently to hers. \u201cI am afraid if I let you go, you will leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to leave you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAs you left me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was the only choice that afforded me the opportunity to have you. Can you not see?\u201d The tone of his voice was a rough plea. \u201cIf I had not left and made my fortune elsewhere, you would never be mine, and I could not bear it, Amelia. I would do anything to have you, even give you up for a time.\u201d</p><p>She tugged at his arms. Every breath she took was filled with the scent of him, a scent that awakened her body to memories of the passionate night behind them. It was an unbearable torment. \u201cRelease me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise to stay and hear me out.\u201d</p><p>Amelia nodded, knowing she had no choice. Knowing they had to find some closure to this so they could both move on with their lives.</p><p>Facing him with an uplifted chin, she tried to keep her face impassive despite the tears she could not stop. For his part, Colin made no effort to hide his torment. His handsome features were wracked with painful emotions.</p> <p>\u201cI might have felt differently,\u201d she said flatly, \u201cif you had told me of your desire to build a different life for yourself, if you had made me a partner in your plans instead of cutting me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe honest, Amelia.\u201d He clasped his hands behind him as if to prevent reaching out for her. \u201cYou would never have allowed me to go, and if you had begged me to stay, I would not have had the strength to deny you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy could you not stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was I to afford you with a servant\u2019s meager pay? How was I to give you the world when I had nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have borne any livelihood if only you were there to share it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of the nights?\u201d he challenged. \u201cWould you feel the same while shivering because we must ration our meager stipend of coal? And what of the days? Where we must rise before the sun to work ourselves to exhaustion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could have kept me warm, as you did last night,\u201d she retorted. \u201cA lifetime of such nights . . . I would damn the coal to hell if my bed was warmed by you. And the days. The passing of each hour would bring me closer to you. I could have tolerated anything if it led me back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve better!\u201d</p><p>Amelia stomped her foot. \u201cIt was not for you to decide that I was incapable of living such a life! It was not for you to decide that I was not strong enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never doubted that you would make such an effort for me,\u201d he argued, his frame vibrating with an edgy intensity so reminiscent of the Colin of old. \u201cWhat I doubted was my strength, my capability to live in that manner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not even try!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d Colin\u2019s voice grew more impassioned. \u201cHow could I bear looking at your cracked and reddened hands? How could I bear the tears that would come in the unguarded minutes when you longed for a moment\u2019s comfort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove requires sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when the entirety of the sacrifice is made by you. I could not live with myself knowing that my selfishness brought you to an unhappy end.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Her hand lifted to cover her heart. \u201cI would have been happy as long as I had you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would have hated myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that now.\u201d Grieving anew, Amelia wondered how she could have been so wrong about their love for each other. \u201cIf we had never met, you would have been happy with the life you had, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour discontent stems from me and the expectations you imagined I had for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that is not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d The pain in her chest intensified until she could hardly breathe. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI wish we had never met. We might have been happy.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cDear God, do not say such a thing! Never. You are the only thing that has ever brought me happiness.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she felt so old and so tired. \u201cLeaving your country and your family, traversing the Continent risking your life to gather information for the Crown . . . That is what you call happiness? You are deluded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Colin growled, snatching her by the shoulders. \u201cYou are worth it, all of it. I would do it again a hundred times over to become worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought you were unworthy, and you did not harbor these feelings of inferiority until you met me. That is not love, Colin. I do not know what that is, but I know what it is not.\u201d</p><p>Made anxious by Amelia\u2019s sudden composure, Colin considered ways to keep her connected to him. Last night they had been as close as two lovers could ever hope to be, and now they were as distant as strangers. \u201cWhatever doubts my revelation may inspire, do not belittle my feelings for you. I love you. From the moment I first saw you, I loved you, and I have never stopped. Not for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Amelia wiped at her tears with hands so steady, he felt a prickling disquiet. \u201cWhat of the times when you gained the expertise at lovemaking you displayed so beautifully last night? Were you in love with me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, damn you.\u201d He pulled her closer, pressing the full length of his heated body to hers. \u201cEven then. Sex is sex to a man, nothing more. We require the spending of our seed to be healthy. It has nothing to do with elevated feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimply slaking your needs as you did behind the store when we were younger?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cLast night, with every touch . . . every caress . . . I wondered how many women you must have entertained in order to acquire such skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d he lashed, bleeding inside and frightened by her rapid retreat. She spoke with no inflection, no feeling, as if she cared not at all. \u201cDo you wish it had been you who served my baser needs with no emotion or caring? No affection or concern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am jealous, yes, but also sad.\u201d Her beautiful eyes were empty. \u201cYou lived a full life without me, Colin. At times, you were likely content with your lot. You should not have come back. Those women did not make you wish to be someone you are not, as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never think of them,\u201d he vowed, cupping her beloved face in his hands. \u201cNever. All the while I thought of you and how deeply I wanted you. I wished they were you. It was an ache that never faded. I learned, yes. I became skilled, yes. For you! So that I could be everything to you, so that I could satisfy you in every way. I wanted to be all you needed, all you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow miserable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt breaks my heart to know that I have prevented you from being happy.\u201d</p><p>Furious at his helplessness and confused by the turns the conversation was taking, Colin held her still and took her mouth, thrusting strong and sure into the hot, moist depths.</p><p>He tasted her pain and sorrow, her bitterness and anger. He drank it all, stroking across her tongue with his, before sucking fiercely.</p><p>Clutching his forearms with both hands, she moaned and trembled in his arms. Her body could not resist his, even now. It was a weakness he hated to exploit, but he would if necessary.</p><p>\u201cMy mouth is yours,\u201d he said hoarsely, brushing his wet lips back and forth across hers. \u201cI have shared kisses with no one but you. Never.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand and held it over his heart. \u201cSee how strongly it beats? How desperately? Because of you. Everything, everything I have ever done has been with you in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop . . .\u201d she panted, her breasts thrusting against his arm with her labored breathing.</p><p>\u201cAnd my dreams.\u201d He pressed his temple to hers. \u201cMy dreams have always been yours. I aspire to be a better man to be worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when will that day come, Colin?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, frowning.</p><p>\u201cAll these years, and yet you still found reasons to put me aside until last night when I forced your hand.\u201d Amelia sighed, and he heard a note of finality in the forlorn sound. \u201cI think we saw in each other only what we wanted to see, but in the end the gulf between us is too wide to cross with mere illusions.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s blood froze, a not inconsiderable feat with her body pressed so tightly to his. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am saying that I am tired of being left behind and forgotten until some preordained time arrives. I have lived the whole of my life under such a cloud and refuse to do so any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am saying that when we leave this room, Colin, it will be farewell between us.\u201d</p><p>The slight scratching on the open door drew Simon\u2019s attention from the maps spread out across his desk. He looked up at the butler with both brows raised. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a young man at the door asking for Lady Winter, sir. I did tell him that neither she nor you were at home, but he refuses to leave. \u201d</p><p>Simon straightened. \u201cOh? Who is it?\u201d</p><p>The servant cleared his throat. \u201cHe appears to be a Gypsy. \u201d</p><p>Surprise held his tongue for the length of a heartbeat. Then Simon said, \u201cShow him in. \u201d</p><p>He took a moment to clear away the sensitive documents on his desk. Then he sat and waited for the dark-haired youth who entered his study a moment later.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Lady Winter?\u201d the boy asked, the set of his shoulders and jaw betraying his mulish determination to get whatever it was he came for.</p><p>Simon leaned back in his chair. \u201cShe is traveling the Continent, last I heard. \u201d</p><p>The boy frowned. \u201cIs Miss Benbridge with her? How can I find them? Do you have their direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. Mitchell, would you care for a drink?\u201d Simon stood and moved to the row of decanters that lined the table in front of the window.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Hiding a smile, Simon poured two fingers of brandy into a glass and then turned around, leaning his hip against the console with one heel crossed over the other. Mitchell stood in the same spot, his gaze searching the room, pausing occasionally on various objects with narrowed eyes. Hunting for clues to the answers he sought. He was a finely built young man, and attractive in an exotic way that Simon imagined the ladies found most appealing.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do if you find the fair Amelia?\u201d Simon asked. \u201cWork in the stables? Care for her horses?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know who you are, though I was told you were dead.\u201d Simon lifted his glass and tossed back the contents. His belly warmed, making him smile. \u201cSo do you intend to work as her underling, pining for her from afar? Or perhaps you hope to tumble her in the hay as often as possible until she either marries or grows fat with your child.\u201d</p><p>Simon straightened and set down his glass, bracing himself for the expected\u2014yet, surprisingly impressive\u2014tackle that knocked him to the floor. He and the boy rolled, locked in combat, knocking over a small table and shattering the porcelain figurines that had graced its top.</p><p>It took only a few moments for Simon to claim the upper hand. The time would have been shorter had he not been so concerned about hurting the lad.</p><p>\u201cCease,\u201d he ordered, \u201cand listen to me.\u201d He no longer drawled; his tone was now deadly earnest.</p><p>Mitchell stilled, but his features remained stamped with fury. \u201cDon\u2019t ever speak of Amelia in that way!\u201d</p><p>Pushing to his feet, Simon extended his hand to assist the young man up. \u201cI am only pointing out the obvious. You have nothing. Nothing to offer, nothing with which to support her, no title to give her prestige.\u201d</p><p>The clenching of the young man\u2019s jaw and fists betrayed his hatred for the truth. \u201cI know all of that. \u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now\u201d\u2014Simon righted his clothing and resumed his seat behind the desk\u2014\u201cwhat if I offered to help you acquire what you need to make you worthy\u2014coin, a fitting home, perhaps even a title from some distant land that would suit the physical features provided by your heritage?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell stilled, his gaze narrowing with avid interest. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am engaged in certain . . . activities that could be facilitated by a youth with your potential. I heard of your dashing near rescue of Miss Benbridge. With the right molding, you could be quite an asset to me. \u201d Simon smiled. \u201cI would not make this offer to anyone else. So consider yourself fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Mitchell asked suspiciously, and not without a little scorn. He was slightly cynical, which Simon thought was excellent. A purely green boy would be of no use at all. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, or what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d</p><p>Simon held his gaze steadily. \u201cI understand well the lengths a man will go to for a woman he cares for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. To the point where you would seek her out at great cost to yourself. I need dedication such as that. In return, I will ensure that you become a man of some means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would take years.\u201d Mitchell ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I can bear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive yourselves time to mature. Allow her to see what she has missed all of these years. Then, if she will have you anyway, you will know that she is making the decision with a woman\u2019s heart, and not a child\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment, the young man remained motionless, the weight of his indecision a tangible thing.</p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d Simon urged. \u201cWhat harm can come from the effort?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, Mitchell heaved out his breath and sank into the seat opposite the desk. \u201cI\u2019m listening. \u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d Simon leaned back in his chair. \u201cNow here are my thoughts . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you say nothing to me?\u201d Maria asked when the tale was finished, staring at Simon as if he were a stranger. She felt as if he were.</p><p>\u201cIf I had told you, mhuirn\u00edn,\u201d Simon said softly, \u201cwould you have withheld the information from your sibling? Of course not, and the secret was not mine to share.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat of Amelia\u2019s pain and suffering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunate, but not something I could alleviate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me he was alive!\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cMitchell had every right to make himself worthy of Amelia\u2019s esteem. Do not fault him for pursuing the woman he loves in the only manner available to him. Of all men, I understand his motivations very well.\u201d He paused a moment, then spoke in a calmer voice. \u201cBesides, what he did with his life was no concern of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a concern of mine,\u201d drawled a voice from behind them, \u201cnow that it affects Miss Benbridge.\u201d</p> <p>Maria turned in her chair and faced the man who approached. \u201cLord Ware,\u201d she greeted, her heart sinking.</p><p>The earl was dressed as casually as she had ever seen him, but there was a tension to his tall frame and a tautness to his jaw that told her leisure was far from his mind. His dark hair was unadorned but for a ribbon at his nape, and he wore boots instead of heels.</p><p>\u201cThis is the fianc\u00e9?\u201d Mademoiselle Rousseau asked.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Christopher greeted. \u201cI am impressed by your dedication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil she tells me otherwise,\u201d the earl said grimly, \u201cI consider Miss Benbridge\u2019s welfare one of my responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not had this much fun in ages,\u201d the Frenchwoman said, smiling wide.</p> <p>Maria closed her eyes and rubbed the space between her brows. Christopher, who stood at her back, set his hand on her shoulder and gave a commiserating squeeze.</p><p>\u201cWould someone care to fill me in?\u201d Ware asked.</p><p>She looked at Simon. He raised both brows. \u201cHow delicately should I phrase this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo delicacy required,\u201d Ware said. \u201cI am neither ignorant nor cursed with a weak constitution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does intend to marry into our family,\u201d Christopher pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Simon said, though his gaze narrowed. He relayed the events leading up to the present moment, carefully leaving out names like Eddington\u2019s, which could not be shared.</p><p>\u201cSo this man in the mask is Colin Mitchell?\u201d Ware asked, scowling. \u201cThe boy Miss Benbridge fancied in her youth? And she does not know it is him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows it now,\u201d Tim muttered.</p> <p>\u201cMitchell is telling her as we speak,\u201d Christopher explained.</p><p>There was a thud behind them, and they all turned to find Pietro, who stood gaping with a dropped valise at his feet. \u201cThat isn\u2019t possible!\u201d the coachman said heatedly. \u201cColin is gone.\u201d</p><p>Maria glanced at Simon, who winced.</p><p>\u201cThis grows more fascinating by the moment,\u201d Mademoiselle Rousseau said.</p><p>\u201cYou are a vile creature,\u201d Simon snapped.</p><p>Looking up at Christopher, Maria signaled her intent to stand, and he stepped back. \u201cI should go see how things are progressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d he murmured, his gaze trained beyond her.</p><p>All heads turned toward the hallway that led to the private dining room. Amelia appeared with reddened eyes and nose and disheveled hair, the picture of tormented heartbroken loveliness.</p><p>Mitchell came into view directly behind her, and the sight of him took Maria aback, as it did everyone who saw him. Elegantly attired and proud of bearing, he left no traces of servitude clinging to his tall frame. He was an arrestingly beautiful man, with dark, sensual eyes framed by long, thick lashes and a voluptuary\u2019s mouth framed by a firm, determined jaw. He, too, looked devastated and gravely wounded, and Maria\u2019s heart went out to both of them.</p><p>\u201cAmelia . . .\u201d Ware\u2019s cultured drawl was rough with concern.</p><p>Her verdant gaze met his and filled with tears.</p><p>A low growl rumbled from the earl\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cColin.\u201d Pietro\u2019s agonized tone deepened the trauma of the day\u2019s revelations.</p><p>Distracted by the many unfolding events, Maria did not foresee Ware\u2019s intent until he stalked up to Mitchell and asked, \u201cDo you consider yourself a gentleman?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Ware threw a glove down at Mitchell\u2019s feet. \u201cThen I demand satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Maria breathed, her hand at her throat.</p><p>Christopher left her side. He drew to a halt beside the earl and said, \u201cI would be honored to serve as your second, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ware replied.</p><p>\u201cI will serve as Mitchell\u2019s,\u201d Simon said, joining them.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Amelia cried, her horrified gaze darting between the grim masculine faces. \u201cThis is absurd.\u201d</p><p>Maria pulled her away. \u201cYou cannot intercede.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Amelia asked. \u201cThis is not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a home in Bristol,\u201d Ware said. \u201cI suggest we retire there. Our audience will then be made up of those we trust.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell nodded. \u201cThat was my destination, so the location is convenient for me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI caused this.\u201d Amelia looked pleadingly at Maria. \u201cMy selfishness has led to this end. How do I stop this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is done, is done,\u201d Maria said, rubbing her hand soothingly down Amelia\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cI want to go with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would not be wise.\u201d</p><p>Christopher turned to her, and she saw in his face that he disagreed. She did not understand why he would wish them to go, but she could learn his motives later. As it was, she trusted him implicitly and knew that his first concern was always for her health and happiness.</p><p>\u201cI want to go,\u201d Amelia said again, with more strength.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Maria soothed. \u201cWe can discuss this over a hot bath and a change of clothes.\u201d</p><p>Her sibling nodded, and they moved away to order heated water and a tub. With everyone distracted with their own thoughts, no one noted the man who occupied a shadowed seat in the far corner. He attracted even less attention when he left.</p><p>Stepping outside, Jacques tugged the brim of his hat down and sauntered across the drive toward the carriage that waited a short ways down the lane.</p><p>He opened the door and looked inside. \u201cMitchell was just challenged to a duel.\u201d</p><p>Cartland smiled. \u201cCome in and tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>It never ceased to amaze Amelia how a man as vibrant and impossible to ignore as Christopher St. John could fade into oblivion when he chose to. As it was, she hardly noticed that he shared the same squab with Maria as they traveled to Bristol. He held his tongue as she poured out her heart, and she was grateful to him for his silence. Few would believe that the notorious criminal could tolerate hours upon hours of a weeping woman\u2019s lamentations over love, but he did and he did it well.</p><p>\u201cYou told him you would not see him again?\u201d Maria asked gently.</p><p>\u201cUntil Ware challenged him, that had been my intent,\u201d Amelia said from behind the handkerchief she held to her nose. She had refused to talk about anything yesterday on the ride to Swindon. Only today did she feel capable of discussing Colin without crying too copiously to speak. \u201cWe will be happier apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not look happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be, over the duration of my life, as will Colin.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNo one can be happy pretending day after day to be someone they are not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he is not pretending,\u201d Maria suggested softly.</p><p>\u201cRegardless, the new Colin harbors the same doubts as the old. Despite all that he has accomplished, he still believed Ware was the better choice until just days ago. He continues to make decisions regarding my welfare without consulting me. I had enough of such treatment in my childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are allowing your past to cloud your present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou champion his actions?\u201d Amelia asked with wide eyes. \u201cHow can you? I can find nothing good in what he has done. He is wealthy, yes\u2014that is obvious in the quality of everything he owns\u2014but accepting that end as being worthy of my grief and heartache puts a price on my love, and I cannot abide that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not champion his actions,\u201d Maria murmured, \u201cbut I do believe he loves you and that he thought he was acting in your best interests. I also believe that you love him. Surely, there is something good in that?\u201d</p><p>Amelia ran a hand over her skirts and gazed out the window. Behind them, Colin rode in his carriage with Jacques, Mr. Quinn, and Mademoiselle Rousseau. Ware led their procession in his coach. She was trapped between the two, both figuratively and literally.</p><p>\u201cI have come to the realization that passion is not as the poets would have us believe,\u201d she said.</p><p>There was a suspicious choking sound from the opposite squab, but when she shot a narrowed glance at St. John, his face was studiously impassive.</p><p>\u201cI am quite serious,\u201d she argued. \u201cPrior to these last weeks, my life was orderly and comfortable. My equanimity was intact. Ware was content, as were both of you. Colin, too, had an existence that was progressing in its own fashion. Now all of our lives are in disarray. You\u2019ve no notion of how it pains me to realize that my resemblance to Lord Welton is more than skin deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia. That is absolute nonsense.\u201d Maria\u2019s voice was stern.</p><p>\u201cIs it? Have I not done exactly as he would do? Cared only for my own pleasure?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI would rather be a woman who lives for duty than one who lives for her own indulgences. At least I would have honor then.\u201d</p><p>Concern filled Maria\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cYou are overwrought. It has been a long journey and the inn in Swindon had little to recommend it, but we are almost to Bristol, and then you must rest for a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore or after the duel?\u201d Amelia asked testily.</p><p>\u201cPoppet\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a distant shout heard outside, and then the carriage turned. Leaning forward, she looked out the window and watched a long, manicured lane empty into a circular drive graced by a sizeable center fountain. The lavish manse beyond that was breathtaking with its graceful columns and massive portico flanked by abundant, cheery flowerbeds.</p><p>The line of carriages rolled to a halt before the steps, and the front door opened, allowing a veritable swarm of gray-and black-liveried servants to flow out. St. John exited first. He then assisted Maria and Amelia down to the graveled drive.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Ware said, as he joined them. His mouth curved in a rakish half smile as he lifted Amelia\u2019s gloved hand to his lips. He looked dashing in his garb of pale blue breeches and coat the exact color of his eyes, and the strained smile she returned had true appreciation for his charm behind it.</p><p>\u201cYour home is lovely, my lord,\u201d Maria murmured.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I hope you will find it even lovelier once you are inside.\u201d</p><p>In unison, they turned to look toward Colin\u2019s coach. Amelia steeled herself inwardly for his appearance, expecting that he would look at her as he had done all of yesterday\u2014with entreaty in his dark eyes.</p><p>Sadly, no preparation on her part could mitigate the effect he had on her as he vaulted down from his carriage and approached with an elegant stride that was entirely sensual. Damn the man. He had always moved with an animal grace that made her tingle all over. Now that she knew how well that latent sexuality translated to bedplay, the response was worse.</p><p>She looked away in an effort to hide the irresistible attraction she felt.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Colin said, his smooth voice roughened by obvious dislike. \u201cIf someone could kindly provide direction to the nearest inn, I will be on my way. Mr. Quinn will return later to make the necessary arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like you to stay here,\u201d Ware said, startling everyone.</p><p>Amelia looked at him with mouth agape.</p><p>\u201cThat is impossible,\u201d Colin protested.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ware challenged with both brows raised.</p><p>Colin\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cI have my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d St. John asked, a note in his voice alerting Amelia. Apparently he saw something in the exchange that she did not. \u201cAllow me to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will not be necessary,\u201d Colin said stiffly. \u201cKeep Miss Benbridge safe. That is all the assistance I require.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are in danger,\u201d Maria said, \u201cI would prefer to keep you close. Perhaps we should stay at the inn as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Ware said in his customary drawl, as composed as ever. \u201cEveryone will be safer here than in a public venue with frequent traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. John,\u201d Colin said. \u201cIf I could have a moment of your time.\u201d</p><p>St. John nodded and excused himself. The two men moved a short distance away and spoke in tones too low to overhear. They became more animated, the conversation more heated.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Amelia asked Maria.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew,\u201d Maria replied.</p><p>\u201cAllow Mrs. Barney to show you to your rooms,\u201d Ware said, gesturing to the housekeeper who waited on the lower step with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what is happening,\u201d Amelia said.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d Ware murmured, setting his hand at her lower back and leading her toward the manse. \u201cAnd I promise to tell you everything as soon as I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d She looked up at him from beneath the brim of her hat.</p><p>\u201cOf course. When have I ever lied to you?\u201d</p><p>She understood the message. I am not Mitchell, it said. I have always been true to you. Grateful for him, Amelia offered a thankful, shaky smile. Maria joined her, and together they followed Mrs. Barney into the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colin watched Lord Ware lead Amelia toward the manse and fought the urge to wrench her away. It was unbearable to see her with another man. It ate at him as acid would, burning and stinging and leaving a gaping hole behind.</p><p>\u201cI think you should stay,\u201d St. John said, drawing Colin\u2019s attention away from Amelia\u2019s departing back.</p><p>\u201cYou do not understand,\u201d Colin argued. \u201cWe have been followed ever since we left Reading. If I keep my distance from Miss Benbridge, I will draw the danger away from her.\u201d</p><p>St. John looked grim. \u201cUnless she has a mind to follow you again,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThen she will be far more vulnerable than if she were to remain here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBloody hell. I did not think of that.\u201d Lifting a hand to the back of his neck, Colin rubbed at the tense muscle that pained him. \u201cIn her present mood, I do not think she will go to the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you cannot be certain, and neither can I. Therefore, I think it best to err on the side of caution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you not deter her in some way?\u201d Colin asked. \u201cCartland cannot be allowed anywhere near her. If he suspects how much she means to me, he will exploit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been able to deter her? Do not expect miracles from me.\u201d St. John smiled. \u201cMy wife is considered the Deadliest Woman in England, and she taught her sibling everything she knows. Amelia can cross swords with the best of men, and she can throw a knife better than anyone, even me. If she decides to follow you, she will find a way.\u201d</p><p>Colin blinked, then gave a resigned exhalation. \u201cOddly enough, I am not as surprised by that revelation as I should be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have liked to have met their mother. She must have been extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not have the time to socialize,\u201d Colin growled. \u201cI must be either the hunter or the prey, and the latter role does not suit me.\u201d</p><p>St. John nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish Mademoiselle Rousseau would believe Jacques\u2019s witness of the events of that night, but she refuses. I cannot collect why. Why dismiss him so completely? How can she trust Cartland\u2019s word over anyone else\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know what it is she seeks, but I will lend you whatever support you need. There is little that requires your attention tonight. Allow my men to begin the search in town. You can pick it up tomorrow. I think one night of domesticity will soothe Amelia enough to keep her from haring after you.\u201d</p><p>The thought of spending an intimate evening in the company of Amelia and Lord Ware was a torment unparalleled.</p> <p>\u201cWill you stay?\u201d the earl asked, joining them. \u201cRooms are being prepared for you and your acquaintances as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d It was all Colin could manage. \u201cI will tell the others.\u201d He turned on his heel and walked away.</p><p>St. John watched him go, noting the stiffness of his posture and the anger evident in his stride. \u201cHe loves her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>Turning his head, St. John found the earl watching Mitchell with a narrowed glance. \u201cI know why I think he should remain. I cannot collect why you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur differences will be more obvious in direct contrast.\u201d Ware met his gaze. \u201cI am the best choice for her. If I doubted that for a moment, I would step aside. I want her happiness above all else. I do not think he is capable of giving it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a formidable opponent in the challenge ahead. Mitchell has lived by his wits and his sword for several years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not without skill of my own,\u201d the earl said easily, \u201cregardless of the civilized manner in which I acquired it.\u201d</p> <p>St. John nodded and followed Ware\u2019s urging to move into the house. Tim was overseeing the removal of both trunks and servants from the trailing coach. Mitchell was scowling at Quinn, who was assisting a grinning Mademoiselle Rousseau down from their carriage.</p><p>For his part, St. John wondered if other men went through such difficulties when attempting to marry off a younger sibling. Shaking his head, he climbed the stairs and moved directly to the suite assigned to him where he knew he would find his wife. Together, they would strategize the events of the coming few days.</p><p>The thought made him smile.</p><p>Bathed, dressed, yet inwardly shaky, Amelia slipped out of her bedchamber and hurried down the long gallery. Maria had told her to nap in preparation for afternoon tea, but Amelia could not sleep. What she felt was the urge to roam, to stretch her legs, to breathe fresh air and clear her head. As a child, she had learned that a brisk walk was capable of alleviating many ills, and she felt in strong need of that now.</p><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d</p><p>She paused at the sound of her name. Turning, she found Lord Ware exiting a room a few doors behind her. She curtsied. \u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>He shot a pointed glance at her walking boots. \u201cMay I join you?\u201d</p><p>She briefly considered voicing a kind objection, then thought better of it. As much as she wished to be alone with her thoughts, Ware deserved an explanation and the opportunity to chastise her, if he so wished. \u201cI would be honored.\u201d</p><p>He smiled his charming, dashing smile and came toward her. He was dressed as a country gentleman, and the more leisurely appearance suited him well. It reminded her of their meeting in Lincolnshire, and the smile she returned to him was genuine.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely you are,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwhen your smiles reach your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is because you look so handsome,\u201d she returned.</p><p>Ware lifted Amelia\u2019s hand to his lips and his gaze beyond her shoulder, where he saw Mitchell at the end of the hall, watching them both with daggers in his eyes. Tucking Amelia\u2019s hand around his arm, he led her away toward the stairs, which would take them to the lower floor and the rear garden.</p><p>He felt his rival\u2019s stare burning a hole in his back for the entire way.</p><p>Colin watched Lord Ware\u2019s proprietary handling of Amelia with something so akin to blood rage, it frightened him.</p><p>He could not bear it.</p><p>\u201cYou must find something to occupy yourself with, mon ami,\u201d Jacques said, startling Colin with his sudden, silent appearance. \u201cYou will act regrettably if you think endlessly of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have always thought endlessly of her,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI know of no other way to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe requires time. I admire your fortitude in giving it to her.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s fists clenched. \u201cIt is not fortitude. I simply do not wish to kill a man in front of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlors . . . you must leave. Distract yourself with a task.\u201d</p><p>Inhaling sharply, Colin nodded. He had been set upon that end when he chanced upon Amelia with Ware. He forced himself to look away from where the couple had stood mere moments ago. \u201cThat was my intent. I was seeking you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d the Frenchman asked, looking grim as always.</p><p>\u201cI cannot go into town. There is some concern that Miss Benbridge will follow, and while I find that highly unlikely, the request is valid, so I must stay for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. John is sending a man to rally those who work for him in Bristol. Go and direct the search. Tell them what to look for, what to expect. If you find anything of import, send for me.\u201d</p><p>Jacques nodded and set off immediately. The Frenchman took the main staircase; Colin took the servants\u2019. It emptied by the kitchen, and he ignored the startled glances sent his way as he exited out the delivery door and headed toward the stables.</p><p>Every step he took grew heavier, his heart weighed upon by the upcoming confrontation that would cut him nigh as deeply as the one with Amelia had.</p><p>He entered silently and inhaled deeply, finding the smells of hay and horses both familiar and soothing. The many beasts inside snorted and shifted restlessly as his scent filled the air and disturbed their equanimity. Glancing about, he looked for the groomsmen\u2019s quarters. His stride faltered when he found the doorway. A man leaned against the jamb, watching him with wounded, angry eyes.</p><p>The years had been kind to Pietro. Aside from a slight pouch at the belly, the rest of his body was still fit and strong. Strands of silver accented his temples and beard, but his skin was smooth and free of wrinkles.</p><p>\u201cUncle,\u201d Colin greeted, his throat tight with sorrow and affection.</p><p>\u201cMy only nephew is dead,\u201d Pietro said coldly.</p><p>Colin flinched at the repudiation. \u201cI have missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie! You let me think you were dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was offered the chance at a different life.\u201d Colin held out his hands in a silent plea for understanding. \u201cI had one chance to accept and no time to second-guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of me?\u201d Pietro demanded, straightening. \u201cWhat of my grief? Was that nothing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I was not grieving?\u201d Colin bit out, stung by the condemnation of yet another person he loved. \u201cI might as well have been dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you do it?\u201d Pietro came forward. \u201cI have tried to see what would make you do such a thing, but I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had nothing to offer anyone before. No way to create a life of comfort for those I loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComfort from what? The only discomfort in my life has been my mourning for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of freedom from work?\u201d Colin challenged. \u201cWhat of a life of travel and discovery? I can offer you those things now, when I could not before.\u201d</p><p>Pain wracked Pietro\u2019s handsome features. \u201cI am a simple man, Colin. A roof over my head . . . food . . . family. Those are all I need to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish my needs were as simple.\u201d Colin moved to the nearest stall and set his crossed arms along the top of it. \u201cI need Amelia to be happy, and this was the only way I could conceive of to have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin . . .\u201d He heard his uncle sigh. \u201cYou love her still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no notion how not to love her. It is ingrained in me, as much a part of me as my hair and skin color.\u201d</p><p>Pietro joined him at the stall door. \u201cI should have raised you in the camp. Then you wouldn\u2019t want things that are beyond your reach.\u201d</p><p>Colin smiled and looked aside at him. \u201cAmelia and I would have met at some point, at some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is your Romany blood talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, as each attempted to find the right thing to say. \u201cHow long have you been in England?\u201d Pietro asked finally.</p><p>\u201cA few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few weeks and you didn\u2019t come to me?\u201d Pietro shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that I know you at all. The boy I raised had more care for the feelings of others.\u201d</p><p>Aching from the pain he had inflicted, Colin reached out and set his hand atop Pietro\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIf my love is in err, it is not due to lack of it for you but to a surfeit for her. I would have done anything, gone anywhere, to become worthy of Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have accomplished what you set out to do,\u201d Pietro said quietly. \u201cYour clothes and carriage are fine indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems a waste now. She is as angry as you are. I do not know if she will forgive me, and if she does not, all is lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all. You\u2019ll always have me.\u201d</p><p>Tears came to Colin\u2019s eyes, and he brushed them away with jerking movements. His uncle looked at him a moment, then heaved out his breath and embraced him.</p><p>\u201cThere is still some of the Colin of old in you,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for the pain I caused,\u201d Colin whispered, his throat too tight to speak any louder. \u201cI saw only the end, not the interim. I wanted everything, and now I have nothing.\u201d</p><p>Pietro shook his head and stepped back. \u201cDon\u2019t give up yet. You\u2019ve worked too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d If he could manage to win back the love of one, perhaps there was a possibility that he could win back the other.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d A grin split the depths of his uncle\u2019s beard. \u201cI have six horses to groom.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s mouth curved wryly. \u201cI am at your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Pietro put his arm around Colin\u2019s shoulders and urged him toward the groomsmen\u2019s quarters. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to change your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can buy more if these are ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d His uncle looked at him consideringly. \u201cHow wealthy are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObscenely.\u201d</p><p>Pietro whistled. \u201cTell me how you did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Colin smiled. \u201cWe have time.\u201d</p><p>It was late afternoon. The sun was dipping to the west and supper was being prepared. Ware\u2019s guests would eat earlier tonight than they would in Town, then spend the evening in the parlor, attempting to ignore the tension simmering between all parties. It would no doubt be unpleasant, but Ware understood the emotional undercurrents that were affecting everyone but him. He cared for Amelia and thought her the most suitable bride for his needs. That was his only tie to all of the rest.</p><p>\u201cMitchell stayed,\u201d he said to Amelia, as they strolled through the rear garden.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She stared straight ahead. With a sigh, he drew to a halt, which forced her to do the same.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Amelia. That has always been the core strength of our friendship.\u201d</p><p>With a shaky smile, she canted her body to face his. \u201cI am so sorry to have done this to you,\u201d she said remorsefully. \u201cIf I could go back and alter the events of this last week, I would. I would go back years and have married you long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d He tugged her closer, and set his hands lightly on her hips. Behind her, a profusion of climbing roses hugged an archway that led to a pond. Dandelion seeds drifted in the breeze, creating an enchanting backdrop for an enchanting woman.</p><p>\u201cYes. All these years I mourned him and he was thriving.\u201d Something deliciously like a growl escaped her. \u201cHe finds it far too easy to leave me behind. I am sick of being left behind. First my father, now Colin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amelia wrenched away and began to pace, her long legs moving with a lithe, determined elegance.</p><p>\u201cI have never left you,\u201d he said, pointing out what he knew to be his greatest strength. \u201cI enjoy your company far too much. There are precious few people in this world about whom I feel similarly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Bless you. I love you for that.\u201d She managed a brief smile. \u201cThat is what has decided my mind. You will be steadfast and supportive. You do not seek to be someone you are not. You inspire me to be decorous and deport myself in a manner befitting a lady. We rub along well together.\u201d</p><p>Ware frowned, considering. \u201cAmelia. I should like to discuss your thoughts on decorum and deportment in greater detail. Forgive me, but I find it rather odd to mention those traits as being most attractive. I would think our friendship and ease of association would lure you most.\u201d</p> <p>She halted, her pale green skirts settling gently around her feet. \u201cI have come to realize something these past days, Ware. I have reckless tendencies, just as Welton did. I require a certain environment in order to restrain those selfish impulses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I provide this environment.\u201d</p><p>Amelia beamed at him. \u201cYes. Yes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d He rubbed his jaw. \u201cAnd Mitchell inspires your reckless nature?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Goads\u2019 would be a more apt word choice, but yes, he does.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d Ware smiled wryly. \u201cHis role sounds more fun than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWare!\u201d She looked affronted, which made him laugh.</p><p>\u201cSorry, love. I must be honest. In one breath, you point out that I do not seek to be someone I am not\u2014in opposition, I presume, to Mr. Mitchell. Then in the next breath, you say that I inhibit a part of your nature that you are not proud of. Is that not seeking to be someone you are not . . . in a fashion?\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip quivered in that way it had when she was upset. She set her hands on her hips and demanded, \u201cDo you want me to be with him?\u201d she cried. \u201cIs that what you are saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d All traces of amusement left him, and he bared the emotions he kept hidden below the surface. \u201cI do not think he is the man for you. I do not think he deserves you. I do not believe he can provide a life that would content you. But that does not mean I want to live with only half of you.\u201d</p><p>Amelia blinked. \u201cYou are angry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at you,\u201d he said gruffly, reaching for her again. He gripped her by the elbows and pulled her close. \u201cBut I may eventually become so and I do not want that. I resent that I can have only the one side of you. If you choose me, Amelia, I can make you happy. The question left is whether you can make me happy, and I wonder if that is possible if I am forever waiting for the return of that precocious girl who asked me to kiss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWare . . .\u201d</p><p>She cupped his cheek with her hand, and he nuzzled into it, inhaling the sweet scent of honeysuckle that clung to her.</p><p>\u201cI do not deserve you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIs that not what Mitchell said to you?\u201d he asked, altering his hold to embrace her fully. Resting his cheek against her temple, he said, \u201cI will leave you now. I have arrangements to make, and you require time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want you to fight him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is too late to change that end, Amelia. But I demand first blood, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>He felt relief relax the tautness of her spine. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Ware brushed away the lone tear that stained her cheek, and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI am available to you at all times. Do not hesitate to seek me out if you have a need.\u201d</p><p>Amelia nodded, and watched Ware turn about and head toward the manse. When he disappeared from her view, she glanced around her, feeling lost and alone. No one knew how she felt, how deeply wounded she was by Colin\u2019s reappearance after all these years.</p><p>She stilled, her heartbeat stumbling for a moment over a sudden realization.</p><p>There was one person who loved Colin as she had. One person who would be equally devastated by his betrayal.</p><p>Knowing Pietro would need comfort as she did, Amelia lifted her skirts and hurried toward the stables.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Francois Depardue assumed a vaguely bored expression as he entered the inn in Bristol. He took the stairs to the guest rooms above and knocked on the appropriate door. A shout of permission for entry was heard from the interior, and he answered it by stepping inside.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Cartland asked impatiently, glancing up from the maps he had spread across the small, round table.</p><p>It was with great effort that Francois bit back an angry retort. With every day that passed, he disliked the brash, arrogant Englishman more and more. He\u2019d argued with and then begged his superiors to have Cartland held in custody until he could ascertain who was truly guilty of Leroux\u2019s murder, but to no avail.</p><p>If he is lying, they said, he will be close at hand for you to eliminate.</p><p>They had insisted that Cartland join the search, and the Englishman had immediately assumed that he was in charge. He was an excellent tracker and even better killer, but those skills were tempered by his mistaken belief in his own superiority.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that Mitchell will be staying with Lord Ware. The manse is heavily guarded for some distance around. I would guess that is due to the presence of Christopher St. John.\u201d</p><p>Cartland smiled. \u201cThe earl is likely concerned that Mitchell will flee like the coward he is before the challenge can be met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say,\u201d Francois said.</p><p>The Englishman\u2019s features darkened. \u201cI think the presence of Mademoiselle Rousseau has spoiled your temper.\u201d</p><p>Lysette. Francois smiled at the thought of her. Once, she had been harmless, but he and his men had ensured that she would never be harmless, or innocent, again. Aside from his sincere desire to see justice brought to Leroux\u2019s killer, his one pleasure in this miserable assignment was the thought of crossing paths with Lysette again.</p><p>His blood heated in anticipation. She would fight him, she always did, and she improved with every encounter. The harder she resisted him, the more he enjoyed it. Now that the Illumin\u00e9s, on whose behalf she worked, had tasked her with ensuring either Cartland or Mitchell paid for Leroux\u2019s death, he imagined his inevitable domination of her body would be that much sweeter.</p><p>Perhaps the Illumin\u00e9s thought he would welcome their assistance, but he did not like being second-guessed, which was how he viewed their interference.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any suggestions for how we should proceed?\u201d Francois asked.</p><p>\u201cWe could possibly lure the bulk of the guards away, using me as bait. Then we can attack the manse at night and kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that will not tell me who is guilty, will it?\u201d</p><p>Pushing to his feet, Cartland snapped, \u201cI am obviously innocent, or they would not have sent me to find Mitchell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, then, is Mademoiselle Rousseau here?\u201d Francois smiled. \u201cYou think she is merely present to observe and support my efforts? Surely you are not so stupid. It was well planned to send you with me and Quinn with her. Nothing has been left to chance. You think your spy\u201d\u2014he gestured to the stocky man in the corner with a jerk of his chin\u2014\u201cgives you an advantage, but you are wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest we do?\u201d Cartland\u2019s face flushed.</p><p>Francois debated a moment, then shrugged. \u201cMitchell is dueling over a woman. Perhaps she is the key to his confession.\u201d</p><p>The Englishman paled. \u201cYou think to take St. John\u2019s sister-in-law? Are you insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely he cannot be as fearsome as is rumored,\u201d Francois scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no notion,\u201d Cartland muttered. Then his features took on a mien of wily determination. \u201cThen again . . . perhaps you are right.\u201d He smiled smugly. \u201cI will think of a way. Give me time.\u201d</p><p>Francois shrugged, but inwardly he was making his own plans. \u201cFine. I will go eat downstairs. Either of you care to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We both have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Cartland watched Depardue leave with a narrowed glance.</p><p>\u201cHe is becoming more trouble than he is worth,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSince killing him myself is out of the question, we must find another way to hasten the man to his reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him to capture the girl, then,\u201d Jacques replied easily. \u201cSince it was his idea, he should not object.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Cartland considered the beauty of the plan. If Mitchell or St. John took care of Depardue for him, it would only strengthen his own protestations of innocence.</p><p>\u201cCan you arrange for him to gain entry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMais oui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. See to it.\u201d</p><p>Amelia found Pietro leading a bridled horse from the nearby corral to the stable yard. For a long moment, she was struck dumb by the resemblance he bore to Colin. With her memories of her childhood love arrested in the past, she had not noticed before. Now that she had seen him as a man, the similarities were unavoidable and agonizing. Tears welled, and though she tried to blink them back, they were plentiful and blurred her vision. She wiped them angrily away.</p><p>\u201cMiss Benbridge.\u201d Pietro looked at her with commiseration in his dark eyes. \u201cIt hurts. I know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHow are you faring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m angry,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut grateful to have him back. If you still love the boy he was, perhaps you feel the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am glad he is alive,\u201d she managed. \u201cIs there anything you need?\u201d</p><p>A smile lifted the corner of his mouth. \u201cIt is sweet of you to think of me during this time. I can see why he adores you as he does.\u201d</p><p>Her face heated at the gentle praise.</p><p>\u201cHe has loved you a long time, Miss Benbridge.\u201d Pietro\u2019s deep, slightly accented voice soothed her, though his words did not. \u201cFrom the beginning, I tried to discourage him, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. I think it says a great deal that you both care so deeply for each other after all these years apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does not change the fact that he feels inferior to me\u201d\u2014she released a shaky breath\u2014\u201cor that I do not like the person I become trying to convince him of his worth.\u201d</p><p>He watched her for a long moment, then nodded. \u201cWill you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Amelia stepped closer. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you lead this horse into the stable for me? I have a few more to round up before the sun sets.\u201d</p><p>She accepted the proffered reins. The smile he gave her was strange, but presently everything in her life felt odd.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he murmured, then walked away.</p><p>Amelia turned and moved through the open stable door. The moment she stepped inside, she realized Pietro\u2019s intent. She paused, her breath caught in a mixture of surprise and volatile lust.</p><p>Colin worked with his back to her, but his identity was never in question. His torso was bare, his legs clad in worn coarse breeches, his calves hugged lovingly by polished Hessians. Powerful muscles bunched and flexed beneath sweat-sheened skin as he stroked a brush rapidly over a horse\u2019s flanks.</p><p>The sudden assailment of memories from their youth almost brought her to her knees. The sight of scratches left by her nails in the golden flesh added a carnal claim to his beautiful body that she longed to enforce.</p><p>As she watched, he stilled. Her exhale was a pant, and his head swiveled to face her in a lightning quick movement.</p><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and pivoted, baring the chest she had worshipped with both mouth and hands.</p><p>Dear God, he was divine. So handsome and virile, he made her heart ache.</p><p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUtterly.\u201d</p><p>Colin flinched and stepped toward her.</p><p>\u201cPlease do not come closer,\u201d she said.</p><p>His jaw tightened and he halted. \u201cStay. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is there to say? I heard your reasons. I understand why you acted as you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there hope for us? Any at all?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Agony transformed his features. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he said in a broken voice. \u201cLook at where we are. This is where I would be if I had not left\u2014tending St. John\u2019s horses while you lived your life in a manse I am not allowed to enter. How could we have been together? Tell me that.\u201d</p><p>Amelia covered her mouth to stifle a sob.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I gave it all away?\u201d His words were laced with a desperation that broke her heart into even smaller pieces. \u201cWhat if I resumed my place as a servant in your household? Would you have me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she cried, her shoulders straightening in self-defense. \u201cWhy must you change yourself to suit me? Why can you not simply be who you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is who I am!\u201d He spread his arms wide. \u201cThis is the man I have become, but he is still not what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares what I want?\u201d She stalked toward him. \u201cWhat about what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so quick to leave my side?\u201d she snapped. \u201cIf you want me, fight for me. Do it for you, not for me.\u201d</p><p>Amelia thrust the reins at him.</p><p>He caught her hand and held it. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough,\u201d she whispered, yanking free. Then she turned and ran from the stable in a flurry of skirts and lace.</p><p>Colin stared after her for long moments, attempting to reason what more he could do, what more he could say to win her love back. He had done everything, lost everything . . .</p><p>A dark shape filled the doorway, and he pushed his roiling emotions aside. \u201cSt. John.\u201d</p><p>The pirate stared at him with knowing eyes. \u201cThere was a lone rider spotted on a hill nearby. He is being followed back to town.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupper will be served shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think I can bear it.\u201d The thought of the fa\u00e7ade he would have to wear while Ware publicly laid claim to Amelia was too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will make your excuses, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you a great deal.\u201d</p><p>St. John hesitated a moment, then stepped farther inside. \u201cDid you ever have the misfortune to meet Lord Welton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce.

Any action she takes that is prompted by her desires rather than her reason is a suspected weakness.\u201d</p> <p>Colin digested the information carefully. With him, Amelia was a creature of passion. She always had been. But they had been separated at the same time she\u2019d learned of her father\u2019s treacherous nature. Certainly the revelation of Welton\u2019s true evil would have changed her, altered her in some way. In his heart he was attempting to woo the girl of old, but she was not that same girl any longer. He had to take that into consideration.</p><p>\u201cWare is the reasonable choice,\u201d Colin said, but he no longer thought the earl was the best choice. Amelia\u2019s vitality came from the passionate fire within her. It needed to be celebrated, as it would be with Colin. Not extinguished by the decorum Society would demand from Ware\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d St. John agreed. \u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>The pirate made his egress as silently as he\u2019d arrived, leaving Colin with a great deal to consider.</p><p>Amelia sat stiffly during dinner, highly conscious of the fact that Colin took his meal in his room. The discussion she\u2019d had with him in the stables prodded at her and gave her no rest. She was poor company, speaking little and casting a dark cloud over everyone\u2019s already somber mood. Despite her best efforts, she could not forget the sight of Colin working in the stable, a station he might still occupy if he had stayed in her employ. It was a shocking revelation to her, and she did not know what to think of it.</p><p>She retired early and hoped exhaustion would claim her, but fate was not so merciful. Unable to sleep, Amelia spent long hours tossing about in her bed. She finally abandoned the effort and left the confines of her disheveled linens. Donning her robe over her night rail, she slipped downstairs to the library.</p> <p>The hour was late, all parties abed, leaving her the massive manse to herself. There were many times she roamed the St. John house at night, finding comfort in the silence and feeling of aloneness so reminiscent of her youth. Her imagination wandered, creating stories and tales in her mind, her memories picking up various passages from favorite books until she found herself at the library.</p><p>The door was slightly ajar, the flickering light of a blazing fire betraying the presence of someone inside. A shiver of awareness coursed over her skin in a wave of gooseflesh, urging her to forsake thoughts of reading and return to the safety of her bed. She debated a moment, internally examining why she would proceed when she valued stability so highly.</p><p>Ever since Colin had returned to her life, she had been acting with reckless disregard for anything but her own wants and needs. The correlation to her pater could not be ignored, and her jaw clenched with determination. It was most likely Ware in the library, and his presence would ground her and mitigate the riot of emotions she did not know how to deal with.</p><p>She pushed open the door.</p><p>Entering on silent feet, she noted the shirtsleeve-clad arm hanging over the side of a wing chair and the large hand holding a crystal goblet at a careless angle. From the darkened color of the skin, she knew she had incorrectly guessed the occupant\u2019s identity, but she did not retreat. Something about the way the glass was held alarmed her. The amber liquid inside was tilted perilously close to the rim, threatening to spill onto the English rug.</p><p>The room was warm and comfortable, the walls lined floor-to-ceiling with bookcases displaying a mixture of worn volumes and priceless artifacts. Overstuffed furniture was scattered around the space, as were many side tables. It was a library that was actually used, rather than serving as merely an ostentatious display of wealth. Despite the inevitable upcoming confrontation with the man in the chair, she was soothed by the smells of parchment and leather, and took comfort in the silence inherent in a place of learning and discovery.</p><p>Amelia rounded the wingback and found Colin sprawled within its cradle, his long legs stretched out to rest his booted feet atop a footstool, his torso sans a coat and waistcoat, his throat bared by a missing cravat. He looked at her with heavy-lidded, emotionless eyes and lifted the goblet to sculpted lips. There was a scratch near his brow and a trail of dried blood below it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cHow were you hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay away,\u201d he said in low, rough tone. \u201cI am in a dark place, Amelia, and I have consumed more liquor than is wise. I cannot say what I will do if you come too close.\u201d</p><p>Draped on the carved wooden arm of a nearby chair were his waistcoat, coat, and weapons\u2014a small sword and dagger.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have yet to leave.\u201d He turned his head to look into the fire.</p><p>She heard the sadness and despair beneath the words, and her heart hurt for him. For her. \u201cI am glad you did not go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Colin\u2019s head turned. In the light of the flickering fire, his beautiful face was hard, his dark eyes cold. \u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could you have done in this condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no reason for me to evade Cartland. I should turn myself over to him and spare everyone the jeopardy my presence creates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life is the reason!\u201d she protested. \u201cIf you concede, you will die.\u201d</p><p>A wry smile tugged at the corner of his lips. \u201cWithout any hope of having you, perhaps such a fate would be merciful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin! How can you say such a thing?\u201d She covered her mouth and fought the tears that welled.</p><p>He cursed softly. \u201cGo away. I am not fit company, as I warned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am afraid to leave you.\u201d She feared that he would do as he threatened and surrender.</p><p>\u201cNo, you are not. You already left me, remember?\u201d</p><p>Amelia almost said more, but his dangerous mood stilled her tongue. She had seen St. John in similar moods at times and had always wondered at Maria\u2019s fortitude in seeking him out when he was so afflicted.</p><p>He needs me, Maria would say in explanation.</p><p>It was obvious that Colin needed comfort, too. And Amelia had distanced herself from him, which left him only the bottle to turn to for solace.</p><p>She approached him with shoulders squared, lifting the hem of her robe to her lips where she wet it. Reaching him, Amelia raised his chin with one hand and used the other to smooth away the blood. He was still, his eyes watchful, the tension that gripped him reaching out and surrounding her as well, making every nerve ending tingle and every breath a pant.</p><p>With an edgy snarl, Colin turned his head and pressed his lips to the sensitive skin of her wrist. She froze, unable to move as his tongue stroked over her now madly fluttering vein.</p><p>His glass hit the rug with a soft thud and a splash, and then he was on her, wrapping his big body around her and pulling her to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d His hot open mouth moved ravenously over the tender flesh of her throat. \u201cSo badly, it\u2019s eating me alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin . . .\u201d The feel of him, over six feet of potently aroused male, ignited her simmering passion to a raging fire. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing can stop it,\u201d he said, his hand pushing open the halves of her robe and cupping her breast. \u201cYou belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze turned to the door she had left open when she entered. \u201cThe door\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips surrounded her nipple through her night rail. Amelia gasped and clutched his hair.</p><p>\u201cRemember that night,\u201d he whispered against her breast. \u201cRemember how I felt inside you. Remember how deep . . . how I filled you . . .\u201d</p><p>She quivered in longing, her blood hot, her breasts heavy and aching. His callused fingertips rolled and tugged at her nipple, sending waves of pleasure along the length of her body.</p><p>\u201cColin\u2014\u201d</p><p>He came over her and took her mouth, inundating her senses with the taste of brandy and the exotic spice that was uniquely his. She moaned in delight, sucking at his thrusting tongue in a desperate effort to drink in more of him.</p><p>Distantly, she felt his hands on her thighs. The chill of the evening air over feverish skin betrayed the lifting of her gown. As everything tightened and coiled in anticipation of his touch, Amelia whimpered into his mouth. His knee intruded between hers, urging her legs apart. Shameless, she complied, spreading her thighs to give him access to the throbbing flesh at the apex.</p><p>Colin lifted his head and watched her as he cupped her sex in his hand. \u201cYou melt for me,\u201d he breathed, his chest lifting and falling rapidly. He pushed two fingers inside her, and she arched in helpless pleasure. \u201cYou were made for me.\u201d</p><p>The feel of him there, where she ached, was too much. Wrapping her arms around his shoulders, she breathed, \u201cCome in me. Fill me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze darkened, the irises swallowed by dilated pupils. \u201cThere is so much I can do to your body, Amelia. So many ways to impart pleasure. Shall I show you what you will miss when we part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came back.\u201d His seductive tone was in sharp contrast to the pain she saw on his features. \u201cWill you come back? If I love you well enough . . . if I addict your body to mine . . . will you come back to me?\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip quivered and he licked across it, his breath hot and scented of liquor. His fingers advanced and retreated, plunging shallowly into her clenching sex, building her ardor with tender skill. It was searingly intimate, but in a different way than before. The emotions they bared were not hope and pleasure but despair and pain.</p><p>\u201cIt would be worth everything,\u201d he said in a serrated whisper, \u201cif there was any chance that you might love me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never stopped.\u201d She cried softly, tears trailing down her temples to wet her hair. \u201cLack of love for you is not the problem.\u201d</p><p>Colin pressed his cheek to hers. \u201cMy greatest regret is that I could not be enough for you, despite my best efforts.\u201d</p><p>Amelia turned her head and pressed her lips to his, unwilling to argue again about their differences when he was already hurting. He took her kiss with tangible desperation, his heart beating so violently, she could hear it over her own racing pulse. All the while his shoulders flexed beneath her touch, the muscles working to propel his fingers into her drenched, aching sex. She cried out softly, a thready sound of female surrender and lust.</p><p>The sound changed him; she felt it. The wounded boy from her past gave way to the determined man of her present. Desperation altered to dominance; despair altered to desire. When his head lifted and he met her gaze again, he had the devil in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf only you could see what I see,\u201d he murmured, gentling his fingers, pulling free of her to slide across her clitoris with a slick, expert touch.</p><p>She gasped, her hips lifting involuntarily in an effort to increase the pressure of his teasing rubbing.</p><p>\u201cAlways hungry,\u201d he whispered, \u201calways passionate. You burn for me, Amelia, as if you had Gypsy blood in your veins.\u201d</p><p>Colin nipped at her chin, then slid lower, licking along her throat until he reached the obtrusive ruffled neckline of her night rail. He moved, taking a kneeling position, hovering over her in a way that made her feel ravished. She was splayed beneath him, her clothes in disarray, his fingers touching her as only a husband should. The wantonness of her pose only increased her ardor, made her hotter and more desperate.</p><p>He pushed up her gown, higher and higher, until her stiffened nipples were kissed by the air and then by his mouth. His tongue was an instrument of pleasure and agony. The gentle licking over the tight peak made her clutch at his hair and pull him closer. As he suckled her, his cheeks hollowed, goading the sensations bombarding her until there was no way to register them all.</p><p>Colin. Her beautiful, exotic Colin was making love to her as she had never dreamed he would, and she could not resist him. His need and longing tapped into her own, freeing her of her inhibitions, making her a willing supplicant to his demands.</p><p>\u201cSuch beautiful breasts,\u201d he praised, kissing across the valley between them to pay a like service to her neglected, jealous nipple. Colin cupped the swollen flesh with his hand, plumping it with gentle kneading, rolling the beaded point between thumb and forefinger. \u201cYou are so sweet and soft. I could lose myself in you for days . . . weeks . . .\u201d</p><p>The thought of being the recipient of the full force of his desires was as arousing as his touch, and Amelia rode his hand, the need to orgasm becoming a driving urge. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>His teeth bit into her nipple, eliciting a gasp of surprise. Then he traveled lower to circle her navel with the point of his tongue. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she begged, her need so intense, she could hear how wet she was. \u201cPlease . . . now.\u201d</p><p>Colin reared up to a kneeling position, leaving her bereft of his warmth and touch. He smiled as she protested, revealing the rakish dimples she had always loved. His shirtsleeves were tugged from the confinement of his breeches and pulled over his head, baring a sculpted chest and abdomen that made her mouth water. His skin was dark and stretched tightly over a highly defined musculature. She loved his body, always had. She adored the way hard labor made him powerful and strong.</p><p>\u201cThe way you look at me will keep us up all night,\u201d he said with darkly sensual promise.</p><p>He reached for the placket of his breeches and freed the straining length of his erection. Whatever arguments of reason she might have uttered died a fiery end, her entire focus narrowing to encompass only the man before her. He was a sensual fantasy come to life with his glistening torso bared to the waist and his thick, hungry cock curving upward in proud enticement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Licking her lips, she sat up and reached for him.</p><p>\u201cAmelia . . .\u201d His tone was a warning, but he made no move to deter her as she angled him down to meet her waiting mouth.</p><p>\u201cJust a taste,\u201d she whispered, licking her lips. \u201cOne taste . . .\u201d</p><p>Her tongue swept across the tiny hole at the tip.</p><p>Colin\u2019s breath hissed out between his teeth.</p><p>The skin was softer than anything she had ever touched before, and the taste of him, salty and primitively male, was an aphrodisiac. With a moan, Amelia circled the wide, flared head with her lips and gave a tentative suck.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d he groaned, shuddering. His hands came up to cup the back of her head.</p><p>Emboldened by his response and a wild desire to have him at her mercy, Amelia tilted her head and licked the pulsing length from top to bottom. The point of her tongue followed the path of a pulsing vein to the thick crest. She licked around and around, tasting the thick essence of his seed.</p><p>Colin was certain he would die of the pleasure Amelia bestowed with such enthusiasm. She seemed lost in the act, less focused on him and more on her own enjoyment. Her beautiful face was flushed, her green eyes glassy with arousal, her lips red and swollen and stretched tightly around his girth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered, as she moaned and sucked harder. \u201cYour mouth is heaven . . . take me deeper . . . yes . . .\u201d</p><p>His body ached with the force under which he leashed it. He was trembling, burning, gasping for air. The sight of his cock sliding in and out of the ring of her lips was killing him. An hour ago, he had thought he would never touch her again, never hold her or feel her hot and wet around his cock as she climaxed beneath him. The pain of that loss was nearly too much to survive. To lose all hope and be left with nothing, only to see this\u2014his breeches barely parted, his cock engorged and throbbing with need, and Amelia . . . the love of his life . . . servicing his lust with such passionate fervor. It made the ecstasy of her luscious mouth agonizingly intense.</p><p>\u201cMy love . . . I won\u2019t last . . .\u201d His voice was so guttural, he barely understood himself, but she knew. She collected his meaning. He felt it in the way she touched him, saw it in the way she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she breathed, her words warm against his wet skin. Her hand fisted around him and pumped, drawing up his bollocks and making his thighs quake with the intensity of his rising climax. She cupped him there, her fingers sliding through the rough hair and fondling his sack.</p><p>He cursed, the tension in his spine painfully acute. \u201cI will flood you\u2014damn it . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eager mouth flowed over the aching head of his cock in a burning caress of drenching heat and hungry suction. His lungs seized, his vision darkened, his fingers tightened on her scalp.</p><p>He was moving on instinct alone; his hips bucked and thrust, running his cock over her flickering tongue and against the back of her throat. Her clenched hand prevented him from moving too deep, kept him from taking too much. Amelia moaned in sensual supplication, the vibration tingling up the length of his erection and freeing his coiling orgasm.</p><p>Colin growled as he erupted, his cock jerking with every wrenching pulse of semen, his fingers tangling in her hair. Over the mad beating of his heart and harsh, panting breaths, he heard her seductive mewls and desperate swallows as he came such as he\u2019d never come before, pumping hard and fast into the milking depths of her mouth until he was completely and utterly spent.</p><p>She released him with a last, lingering suck, her lips shiny with his seed and curved in a purely woman\u2019s smile. Colin stared down at her in a daze, his thoughts lost in an alcohol-soaked, orgasm-induced fog. His heart, however, was as alive as it had ever been.</p><p>Had he truly thought sex would temper his love for her and make it more manageable? He loved her more now than ever, with a reckless, saturating abandon.</p><p>Lose her? Never.</p><p>Pushing her back, he slid down. He parted her thighs with his palms and buried his face in the slick, humid paradise of her glistening sex. Colin licked her, parting the pouty lips to stroke across her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cColin!\u201d she cried out, her voice filled with startled, embarrassed pleasure.</p><p>He smiled against her, then kissed her deeply, turning his head to push his tongue inside the tiny, clenching slit that was made to hold his cock. The taste of her intoxicated him, addicted him.</p> <p>\u201cNo . . . Please. \u201d</p><p>There was something in her voice, a note of panic that urged him to lift his head. He stared at her, saw the wild light in her eyes and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Stop.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, noting the high flush on her cheeks and the trembling of her thighs beneath his hands. She was hopelessly aroused, yet she stayed him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot think . . .\u201d</p><p>Reason. Conscious thought. She wanted it. Servicing him gave her power. Being serviced by him took it all away.</p><p>\u201cYou think too much,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cGive in. Free the woman who took me to her bed without care for anything or anyone.\u201d</p><p>She struggled beneath him. \u201cYou want t-too much . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he growled. \u201cAll of you. Every piece . . .\u201d</p><p>He was in her then, giving her pleasure with avid lips and tongue, eating at her, drinking her in, inhaling the primal scent of her deep into his lungs. The innate hunger he felt for her stirred in response, rousing and climbing, swelling his cock as if she had not just drained him.</p><p>Amelia twisted beneath Colin, clawing at his shoulders, begging for mercy in a voice roughened by pure female lust. She was on the edge of a steep cliff that terrified her, and he was pushing her, giving her no quarter, allowing her no space to retreat.</p><p>His tongue was an instrument of torturous pleasure, lashing and flickering, driving her higher and harder. His lips circled her clitoris, sucking and pulling. And the noises he made. The wet smacking, the rumbling purrs, the groans of need that made her slicker and hotter.</p><p>Thick skeins of dark hair tickled her inner thighs, moving as he did, narrowing her focus until all she knew was the tightening of her womb and the helpless rolling of her hips.</p><p>He demanded her response, forced it from her, turned her into a mindless creature of desire and need and desperate wanting.</p><p>\u201cNo . . . no . . . no . . .\u201d she gasped, fighting him even as her fingers tangled in his locks and pulled him closer.</p><p>So that he could not leave her again.</p><p>Colin cupped her buttocks and lifted her, altering the angle, urging her thighs to widen so that he could take everything. He thrust his tongue hard and fast into the spasming opening, and she climaxed violently, her arms falling heavily to the floor, her nails clawing at the rug.</p><p>\u201cColin!\u201d</p><p>She was devastated, destroyed. But he was not done with her. Before she could catch her breath, he was over her, inside her, pushing deep into the heart of her with the thick, hot length of his cock.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He groaned, sliding his arms beneath her shoulders, holding her in place as he lunged with sensual grace and seated himself to the hilt. \u201cJesus . . . you feel so good.\u201d</p><p>He ground his hips against her, rubbing deep inside her, making her feel every throbbing inch of him.</p><p>Gasping, writhing, Amelia accepted his possession with ravenous greed, her swollen tissues parting for his relentless drives with a quivering welcome. He gripped her throat with one hand, her hip with the other, pinning her down. Dominating her. Possessing her. Branding her as his.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he growled, sliding in and out of her, the movements of his hips leisurely, though nothing else about him was.</p><p>There was a look on his flushed and sweat-dampened face. Part agony, part pleasure. So austere and focused. So intent. His eyes blazing with heat. His handsome features stretched tautly with strain. It was searingly erotic. Intimate.</p><p>Colin was making love to her. He was alive and in her arms, in her body. Whispering words of love and desire, making dreams come true that she had thought were forever dead to her.</p><p>Again the tension built and coiled, causing her to tighten around his straining cock and ripple along its length, making him curse and growl. She felt the chafing rubbing of his waistband between her thighs, heard the sound of his boots digging into the weave of the rug, realized he was still partly dressed just as she was.</p><p>The image in her mind of how they must look\u2014she with parted robe and lifted night rail, he with boots and breeches lowered just enough to free his beautiful cock, both locked on the floor in carnal congress\u2014took her to orgasm.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he purred, watching her with a feral smile of possession, thrusting strong and sure, extending her pleasure until she thought it might kill her. The surge of sensation was unbearable, tingling across her skin until it was too tight and sensitive.</p><p>When she was limp and whimpering, he sought his own pleasure, his dark head thrown back, his neck corded tightly, his cock so thick and hard.</p><p>Amelia watched him as he had watched her, her legs wrapped around his working hips, her hands at his waist. Pulling him into her.</p><p>His pace picked up, his grip tightened. She felt the climax coming, felt it grip him in a fist, felt it tighten his lungs. It burst from him in shocking spurts of molten liquid inside her, again and again, the breaking dam heralded by his ragged, extended groan and jerking, wrenching shudders.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d he gasped, quaking, rubbing his pelvic bone against her swollen, oversensitive clitoris and making her come again. Suffusing her body with delight that seeped into her bones and heart and soul. Making them one.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d he breathed, rubbing his big body against hers, drenching her in the scent of his skin. \u201cI won\u2019t release you. You\u2019re mine\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stemmed further words with a desperate kiss.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Amelia woke to a hand held over her mouth. Scared beyond measure, she struggled against her assailant, her nails clawing at his wrist.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>She stilled at the command, her eyes opening wide, her heart racing madly as her sleep-fuzzy brain came to an awareness of Colin looming over her in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he hissed, his gaze darting to the windows. \u201cThere are men outside. A dozen at least. I don\u2019t know who they are, but they are not your father\u2019s men. \u201d</p><p>She yanked her head to the side to free her mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe horses woke me as the men walked by the stable. \u201d Colin stepped back and yanked off her counterpane. \u201cI snuck out the back and came round to fetch you. \u201d</p><p>Embarrassed to be seen in only her night rail, Amelia yanked the covers back over her.</p><p>He yanked them off again. \u201cCome on!\u201d he said urgently.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she asked in a furious whisper.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d Colin\u2019s dark eyes glittered in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do as I say, and ask questions later. \u201d</p><p>She had no notion of what was happening, but she knew he wasn\u2019t jesting. Sucking in a deep breath, she nodded and slipped from the bed. The room was lit only by the moonlight that entered through the window glass. The heavy length of her hair hung down her back in a thick, swinging braid, and Colin caught it, rubbing it between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cPut something on, \u201d he said. \u201cQuickly. \u201d</p><p>Amelia hurried behind the screen in the corner and disrobed, then slipped the chemise and gown she had worn earlier over her head.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot close the back. I need my abigail. \u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s hand thrust behind the screen and caught her elbow, tugging her from behind it so that he could drag her to the door.</p><p>\u201cMy feet are bare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time, \u201d he muttered. Opening her bedroom door, he peered out to the hallway.</p><p>It was so dark, Amelia could barely see anything. But she heard male voices. \u201cWhat is going\u2014\u201d</p><p>Moving with lightning speed, Colin spun and covered her mouth again, his head shaking violently.</p><p>Startled, it took her a moment to understand. Then she nodded her agreement to say nothing.</p><p>He stepped out to the hallway with silent steps, her hand in his. Somehow, despite her shoeless state, the floorboard beneath her squeaked, when it hadn\u2019t under Colin\u2019s boots. He froze, as did she. Below them, the voices she had heard were also silent. It felt as if the house were holding its breath. Waiting.</p><p>Colin placed his finger to his lips. Then he picked her up and hefted her over his shoulder. What followed was a blur. Suspended upside down, she was disoriented and unable to discern how he managed to carry her from her second-floor bedroom to the lower floor. Then a shout was heard upstairs as she was discovered missing, and pounding feet thundered above them. Colin cursed and ran, jostling her so that her teeth ached and her braid whipped his legs so hard, she feared hurting him. Her arms wrapped around his lean hips, and his pace picked up. They burst out the front door and down the steps.</p><p>More shouting. More running. Swords clashed and Miss Pool\u2019s screams pierced the night.</p><p>\u201cThere she is!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>The ground rushed by beneath her.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d</p><p>Benny\u2019s voice was music to her ears. Colin altered direction. Lifting her head, she caught a glimpse of pursuers, and then more men intercepted them, some she recognized, others she didn\u2019t. The new additions to the fray bought them precious time, and soon she could not see anyone on their heels.</p><p>A moment later she was set on her feet. Wild-eyed, she glanced around to catch her bearings, and found Benny on horseback and Colin mounting the back of another beast.</p><p>\u201cAmelia!\u201d He held out one hand to her, the other expertly holding the reins. She set her hand in his, and he dragged her up and over, belly down across his lap. His powerful thighs bunched beneath her as he spurred the horse, and then they were off, galloping through the night.</p><p>She hung on for dear life, her stomach heaving with the jolting impacts. But it did not last long. Just as they reached the open road, a shot rang out, echoing through the darkness. Colin jerked and cried out. She screamed as her entire world shifted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sliding, falling . . .</p><p>Amelia awoke to a hand held over her mouth and a whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cShh . . . Someone is in the house.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s voice anchored her in the semidarkness. For the space of several heartbeats, the horror and fear from the vivid dream lingered. Then the feel of Colin\u2019s body pressed to her back and his strong arms around her provided much needed comfort.</p> <p>Awareness seeped in slowly. She noted the elaborate moldings on the ceiling and felt velvet beneath her calf.</p><p>They were on the settee in the library. From the look of the fire in the grate\u2014now reduced to mere embers\u2014she had been asleep for at least a couple of hours.</p><p>Turning in Colin\u2019s embrace, she faced him and pressed her mouth to his ear. \u201cWho is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Colin shook his head, his dark eyes glittering.</p><p>Amelia held still, absorbing the tension that gripped his frame. Then she heard it. The sound of a booted foot falling on the parquet floor.</p> <p>Boots. At this hour.</p><p>Her heartbeat leaped from the steady rhythm of slumber to a racing tempo. Unlike her dream, this time it was Colin who was endangered.</p><p>He pressed his lips to hers in a quick, hard kiss. Then he slid silently off the edge of the couch. On his knees, he fastened his breeches. He drew his discarded shirtsleeves over his head, then reached for his small sword.</p><p>She, too, slid to the floor and belted her robe.</p><p>\u201cSecure the door when I leave,\u201d he whispered, pulling his blade free of its scabbard with torturous slowness to avoid making any sound.</p><p>Denying him with a shake of her head, Amelia crawled over to where a faint glimmer betrayed the jeweled hilt of his dagger lying atop his waistcoat and coat. The moment her hand wrapped around it, he was behind her.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d She turned her head to press her cheek to his.</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cMy sanity hinges on your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I feel differently about you?\u201d She touched his cheek with a shaking hand, tracing the faint line that marked the spot where a dashing dimple appeared when he was happy. \u201cRest easy. My sister is the Wintry Widow.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, his throat working as he considered what she was saying.</p><p>\u201cLet me help,\u201d she breathed. \u201cHow will we ever move forward together if you always leave me behind?\u201d</p><p>She knew how the thought of her in danger tormented him, because she felt likewise about him.</p><p>Finally, Colin managed a jerky nod. With a swift kiss to his parted lips, she pulled the dagger free of its sheath.</p> <p>I love you. The words were spoken soundlessly, his lips against hers.</p><p>Amelia lifted his hand and kissed the back.</p><p>Colin wrenched away from her and moved to the door. At some point while she was sleeping, he had closed it. Now, he turned the knob and cracked it just wide enough to see. The well-oiled hinges made no sound.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he was gone. She counted to ten, then slipped out after him.</p><p>Bolstered by the feel of the dagger hilt, Amelia crawled along the runner toward the stairs, her senses acute. The sound of the wind blowing and the nocturnal call of a preying owl grounded her to the moment. She breathed shallowly, her emotions suppressed by the instinct to survive and the need to protect Colin. There was a sudden silence, as if the house held its breath, and then she heard the barest hint of sound\u2014a stealthy footfall straight ahead.</p><p>She paused. Pushing to her knees, she huddled in the darkness.</p><p>A clear shot, just one.</p><p>To her right, a movement caught her eye. Holding the blade and aiming the hilt, Amelia prepared to throw. Her arm was steady, her nerves taut but manageable. She had never killed before, but if it became necessary, she would act first and face the consequences later.</p><p>Her arm went back, her focus narrowed on a slim shaft of moonlight lying directly across the bottom step.</p><p>Although there was no discernable sound of progress, Amelia sensed the intruder moving closer to that tiny beam of light.</p><p>Closer . . . closer . . .</p><p>Suddenly, Colin lunged. She knew it was him by the white of his shirt, as he arced through the moonlight. He crashed into a body so well concealed by shadows that Amelia had been unable to see the outline of it at her present angle. A loud crash heralded the colliding of the two figures into a breakable object.</p><p>She leaped to her feet. Crossing the hallway, she reached the opposite wall, improving the chances of a successful strike.</p><p>It was too dark to identify one form or the other. With both figures tangled in a writhing mass of limbs, she could do nothing but pray.</p><p>Mercifully, a door opened on the upper floor. She bit back a sob of relief. The light cast by an approaching lantern bearer was sufficient illumination to catch an uplifted blade too short to be Colin\u2019s small sword. Amelia pulled back her arm and threw, putting weight behind the volley with an oft-practiced lunge.</p><p>It spun hilt-over-blade in a lightning quick roll. A pained grunt rent the air. The knife that had been aimed at Colin clattered noisily, yet harmlessly, to the parquet.</p><p>St. John rushed down the staircase with a pistol held in one hand and a lantern held aloft in the other. Maria was directly behind him with a foil at the ready.</p><p>Light spilled across the foyer, revealing Amelia\u2019s target. Clutching his chest, the intruder sank to his knees. The hilt of the dagger protruded from between his clutching hands. He swayed morbidly for a long moment, then fell forward.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Colin breathed, rushing to her side. \u201cBeautifully done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was excellent, Amelia,\u201d St. John said with much pride, his gaze on the body lying slumped at his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat in hell is transpiring out here?\u201d Ware demanded, descending the staircase. Mr. Quinn and Mademoiselle Rousseau joined the gathering in short order.</p><p>\u201cDepardue,\u201d the Frenchwoman said. She lowered to a crouch and set her hand on his shoulder, pushing him gently to his back. \u201cComment te sens-tu?\u201d</p><p>The Frenchman groaned softly and opened his eyes. \u201cLysette. . .\u201d</p><p>She reached for the dagger and withdrew it. Then stabbed him again, this time through the heart.</p><p>The sound of the blade scraping across a rib bone and a sharp abbreviated cry from Depardue made Amelia shudder violently. \u201cGood God!\u201d she cried, feeling ill.</p><p>The Frenchwoman\u2019s arm lifted and fell again. Mr. Quinn lunged and yanked her back, the dagger pulling free with her retreat and hitting the floor. \u201cEnough! You killed him.\u201d</p><p>Mademoiselle Rousseau fought her confinement, hurling expletives in French with such venom, Amelia took an involuntary step backward. Then the woman spat on the corpse.</p><p>The display left everyone in stunned silence for a long moment. Then St. John cleared his throat. \u201cWell . . . that one is no longer a threat. However, there must be more of them. I doubt the man would come alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will search the downstairs.\u201d Colin looked at Amelia. \u201cGo to your room. Lock the door.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. The sight of the dead man and the rapidly spreading pool of blood at her feet made her stomach churn. Now that help was at hand, the full effect of her actions began to seep into her consciousness.</p><p>\u201cI found something. \u201d</p><p>All eyes turned toward the direction of the foyer, where Tim appeared, carrying Jacques by the scruff of his neck.</p><p>\u201c\u2019E was sneaking about outside,\u201d the giant rumbled.</p><p>No one could fail to note the Frenchman\u2019s fully dressed state.</p><p>\u201cI was not \u2018sneaking\u2019 about!\u201d Jacques protested.</p><p>\u201cI think \u2019e let that one\u201d\u2014Tim jerked his chin toward Depardue\u2014\u201cin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have a traitor in our midst?\u201d St. John asked ominously.</p><p>A cold chill swept across Amelia\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201c\u00c7a alors!\u201d Mademoiselle Rousseau threw up her hands, one of which was covered in blood. \u201cShould we be wasting time on him when there could be others outside?\u201d</p><p>Tim looked at St. John. \u201cWe caught three more, not including these two.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s face hardened. \u201cWe will question all of them, then. Someone will tell us something of import.\u201d</p><p>Mademoiselle Rousseau snorted. \u201cAbsurde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest we do?\u201d Simon asked with exaggerated politeness. \u201cTorture him slowly over many days? Would that better slake your blood lust?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand carelessly. \u201cWhy exert yourself? Kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalope!\u201d Jacques yelled. \u201cYou would eat your own young.\u201d</p><p>St. John\u2019s brows rose.</p><p>\u201cShe works with me,\u201d the Frenchman cried, struggling in Tim\u2019s grip. \u201cI, at least, can bear witness to Mitchell\u2019s innocence in the matter of Leroux\u2019s murder. She has nothing of value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Colin said, his frame stiffening. \u201cDid you say you both work together?\u201d</p><p>Amelia wrapped her arms around her waist, shivering.</p><p>\u201cTa gueule!\u201d Mademoiselle Rousseau hissed.</p><p>Jacques\u2019s smile was maliciously triumphant.</p><p>\u201cI think we should separate them,\u201d Colin suggested.</p><p>St. John nodded.</p><p>\u201cI will take Lysette,\u201d Simon said with a hard edge to his voice.</p><p>When the Frenchwoman shivered with apparent apprehension, Amelia looked away and fought a flare of sympathy for the woman.</p><p>\u201cCome along, poppet,\u201d Maria murmured, linking arms with her. \u201cLet us gather tea and spirits for the men. We have a long night ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Colin stared at the man he\u2019d thought was a friend and attempted to comprehend the fullness of the plot being explained to him. \u201cYou have been working with Mademoiselle Rousseau from the beginning? Before you met at the inn a few days ago?\u201d</p><p>Jacques nodded. He was bound to a damask and gilded chair in Ware\u2019s study, his calves tied to the legs, his hands restrained behind the back. \u201cWe did not meet at the inn. I have known her for some time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you both acted as if you had just become acquainted,\u201d Simon argued. When Mademoiselle Rousseau had proven to be more stubborn in holding her silence, he had left her bound and guarded in a guest room and joined the rest of the party in questioning her coconspirator.</p><p>\u201cBecause we had to make you believe that this matter was about Cartland and his murder of Leroux,\u201d Jacques explained.</p><p>\u201cIs that not what this has all been about?\u201d St. John asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNo. The Illumin\u00e9s sought to end your inquiries and activities in France, which have become increasingly troublesome. I was sent to discover the identity of your superior.\u201d</p><p>Colin froze. \u201cThe Illumin\u00e9s?\u201d He had heard whispers of a secret society of \u201cenlightened\u201d members who sought power through hidden channels, but the rumors were unsubstantiated. Until now. \u201cWhat do they have to do with Leroux?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of this had anything to do with Leroux,\u201d the Frenchman snapped. \u201cIn fact, Cartland\u2019s murder of Leroux has been a complication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Simon asked from his position on the settee. Dressed in his evening robe and holding a cheroot in one hand, he looked the part of a man at leisure, which was definitely not the case.</p><p>\u201cThe Illumin\u00e9s learned that Mitchell was returning to England,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cI secured a cabin aboard the same ship with the intent to befriend him on the journey. It was hoped that our association would eventually lead to a disclosure of the identity of the man you work for here in England. I followed Mitchell the night we were to set sail, and I took advantage of the opportunity presented to me. I used the situation to build a friendship with Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d St. John murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd what of Lysette?\u201d Simon asked.</p><p>\u201cMitchell was my target,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cYou were hers. The Illumin\u00e9s do not like to leave anything to chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d Colin growled his frustration. \u201cAnd what of tonight? What role did Depardue play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was responsible for discovering the truth regarding Leroux\u2019s death, which is a personal matter to the agent-general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I am still wanted in France,\u201d Colin said, \u201cand someone must pay for Leroux\u2019s death. My predicament has not changed, merely your and Mademoiselle Rousseau\u2019s role in it.\u201d</p><p>Jacques smiled grimly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now Depardue is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not regret that outcome, mon ami. As Mademoiselle Rousseau can attest, he was a far from honorable man. I would never allow you to suffer for his crimes. I assured you of that from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you allowed Depardue into my house,\u201d Ware pointed out. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCartland sent him to find Miss Benbridge,\u201d Jacques explained. \u201cI agreed to assist him, but my intent was not to let him succeed. I had hoped to be the one to \u2018discover\u2019 him and kill him, thereby deepening your trust in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not understand.\u201d St. John stepped closer. \u201cWhy does Cartland trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Depardue. When Mitchell and I were still in London, I searched for Cartland. I found Depardue and told him I was working with Lysette to apprehend Leroux\u2019s killer. Lysette\u2019s involvement made Depardue wary. This created an opening with Cartland, who needed alternate French support because Depardue did not believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Cartland now?\u201d Colin asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the inn, waiting for word.\u201d</p><p>Colin looked at Quinn, who stood.</p><p>\u201cI will change swiftly,\u201d Quinn said.</p><p>St. John rose. \u201cI shall come along, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will stay here with the women,\u201d Ware offered. Then he smiled. \u201cThough I doubt they need my protection.\u201d</p><p>Colin left the room and moved toward the library with a rapid, eager stride. Quinn fell into step beside him.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that your vindication is at hand,\u201d the Irishman said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Finally.\u201d Anticipation thrummed through Colin\u2019s veins and made his heart race. The divide separating him from Amelia still existed, but the scent of their lovemaking clung to his skin and gave him hope. She loved him. The rest would come in time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He and Quinn parted ways by the staircase, and Colin returned to the library to collect his coats. His fist curled around the empty sheath that normally held his dagger, and his mind returned to the moment when Amelia had come to his aid, defending him to the death. Earlier today he had thought it impossible to love her more than he did. Now he realized he was falling in love with her all over again. With the woman Amelia had grown into.</p><p>For the first time, Colin was absolutely certain there was no other man in the world better for Amelia. And even if that were not the case, damn them all regardless. She belonged to him. With perseverance he might convince her to believe that, too.</p><p>Resolute and determined, he shrugged into his garments and left the room. Ware was standing at the foot of the staircase, staring down at the location where Depardue\u2019s body had lain not long ago. The scene was tidied now, but Colin suspected the memory would haunt the earl for years to come.</p><p>At the sound of footfalls, Ware turned his head, and his gaze narrowed upon seeing Colin.</p> <p>\u201cIf you capture Cartland,\u201d Ware said, \u201cyou will have no further business here.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cExcept for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we meet at dawn?\u201d Colin suggested. The duel was one more impediment to his future with Amelia. He wanted it dispatched immediately. \u201cWe will both have been awake through the night. No advantage for either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you will fight at length or return wounded,\u201d the earl said grimly. \u201cHowever, if neither of those conditions applies, dawn will suit me well.\u201d</p><p>Colin bowed and hastened toward the stables, spurred by the thought that the sun could rise upon an entirely new life for him. He found St. John waiting with a dozen men. Quinn appeared shortly after.</p><p>Within a half hour, a troop of over a dozen riders was on its way into town.</p> <p>Chapter 17</p><p>Cartland heard the sounds of many booted feet approaching his room and reached for the gun resting on the table before him. Sending Depardue along with four others had been a gamble he would have preferred to avoid, but sometimes such risks reaped the greatest rewards.</p><p>Holding a pistol lightly in one hand, he waited for the knock and then called out for entry. The door opened, and one of his men entered in a rush.</p><p>\u201cI cannot be certain,\u201d the man said; \u201cperhaps I am overcautious, but a group of three heavily armed gentlemen entered the tavern below.\u201d</p><p>Cartland tucked his weapon into his waistband and reached for his coat. \u201cBetter to be cautious than foolhardy.\u201d He caught up his small sword and moved swiftly toward the door. \u201cAre the others below?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and two in the stables.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent, come with me.\u201d</p><p>Moving with long, rapid strides, Cartland made his egress by way of the servants\u2019 staircase. Straight ahead was the rear exit, but he turned left instead and went through the kitchen to the delivery door. It always paid to be careful.</p><p>The door was ajar, allowing the cool night breeze into the hot kitchen. Cartland saw nothing but darkness beyond the small pool of spilling light, but he rushed outside to the alley in a near run to give himself a better chance of escape if a trap was set.</p><p>Once he was shrouded by the enveloping moonlit night, he felt safer.</p><p>Until he heard the pained grunt of the lackey who ran just behind him.</p><p>Startled, Cartland stumbled over a loose bit of gravel. He spun, pulling his gun free as he did so, his gaze wild and seeking.</p><p>\u201cSo good to see you again,\u201d Mitchell called out.</p><p>The light of the moon illuminated the narrow alley and the prone body on the ground with the knife hilt protruding from its back. The lackey groaned and writhed and was absolutely useless to Cartland.</p> <p>\u201cYou!\u201d he sputtered, unable to see the man who hunted him.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Mitchell agreed from the shadows.</p><p>The echo created by the surrounding buildings made it difficult to determine where Mitchell was.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cartland was out in the open.</p><p>Brandishing his firearm, Cartland said, \u201cThe French won\u2019t believe that I am at fault. They trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>There was a thud to the left, and Cartland fired in that general direction. When a large, round rock rolled down the shallow incline to rest against his booted foot, he knew he\u2019d been tricked. Had he not been so panicked, he would have known better. His heart sank into his gut, frozen by terror.</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s laughter filled the night. Then the Gypsy appeared in a flurry of a swirling cape like some phantom apparition. In each hand was a weapon. One was a pistol, which left Cartland with no options beyond death or surrender. His useless, smoking gun fell from his nerveless fingers and clattered to the alley floor.</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d he offered urgently. \u201cI can speak on your behalf and clear your name.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s teeth flashed white in the darkness. \u201cYes, you will\u2014by returning to France and paying for your crimes.\u201d</p><p>Amelia jolted awake just before dawn. Her heart was racing as if she\u2019d run a great distance, but she could not discern why.</p><p>She lay abed for a long moment, blinking up at the canopy above her. Her bleary gaze lingered upon the gold tassels that framed the edges, and she attempted to regulate her panting by concentrating on every breath.</p><p>Then she heard an unmistakable noise that filled her with dread\u2014the sound of swords clashing outside.</p><p>For a moment, she feared the men had not succeeded with their early morning capture of Cartland, but the lack of shouting and mayhem dispelled that thought.</p><p>The duel!</p><p>She called out for her abigail as she leaped up from the bed. \u201cAnne!\u201d</p><p>Hurrying to the window, she threw the drapes wide, cursing under her breath to see the pale gray-and-pink sky.</p><p>Amelia rushed to her armoire and pulled out a shawl. \u201cAnne!\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and she turned in an agitated flurry. \u201cWhy did you not wake me before\u2014Maria!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d</p><p>The note of sympathy in Maria\u2019s voice caused gooseflesh to flare across Amelia\u2019s arms. \u201cNo!\u201d she breathed, rushing past her sister to the gallery.</p><p>\u201cPoppet! Wait!\u201d</p><p>But she did not. She ran with all the strength she had, nearly crashing into an industrious chambermaid before skittering around the corner and stumbling down the stairs. As she approached the lower floor, the unmistakable ring of clashing foils iced her blood. Amelia was nearly to the French doors that led to the rear terrace and the lawn beyond that when she was caught in a crushing embrace and restrained. She attempted a scream, but was gagged by a massive hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Tim muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t let you distract \u2019em while they\u2019re fighting. That\u2019s \u2019ow men are killed.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered violently at the thought of either man being injured. Struggling like a madwoman, Amelia fought for freedom, but even grown men could not best Tim. As the sounds of fighting continued, tears welled and coursed freely. Every clang of steel clashing against steel struck her like a blow, causing her to jerk repeatedly in Tim\u2019s arms. He cursed and pressed his cheek to hers, murmuring things meant to soothe, but nothing could alleviate her distress.</p><p>Then . . . silence.</p><p>Amelia froze, afraid to breathe in case the sound would overpower the heralds of whatever was transpiring outside.</p><p>Tim carried her to a nearby window and pushed up the sash a bare inch. A damp, chilly breeze blew through the tiny gap, making her shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou are the better man.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s voice drifted to her ears, and her lips quivered against Tim\u2019s palm.</p><p>\u201cYou are the reasonable choice,\u201d he continued in a grim tone. \u201cYou have been steadfast and true to her. Unlike my estate, your wealth and title are long-standing. You can give her things that I cannot.\u201d</p><p>Amelia hung limply in Tim\u2019s arms, sobbing silently.</p><p>\u201cMost importantly, her affection for me is not something she welcomes, while she gratefully embraces her future with you.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned to the side, her tear-stained cheek pressing against Tim\u2019s thundering heart.</p><p>Colin was leaving her, as he had so many times before.</p><p>Tim\u2019s hand fell away from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cRelease me,\u201d she whispered, her spirit broken. \u201cI will not go outside.\u201d</p><p>He set her down and she turned away.</p><p>\u201cPoppet.\u201d Maria waited at the bottom of the stairs with her arms wide open. Amelia walked gratefully into them, her knees weakening, forcing them both to sit on the bottom step.</p><p>\u201cI had hope,\u201d Amelia whispered, her chest crushed by grief such as she had not felt since she first believed Colin had died. \u201cI hate myself for having hope. Why can I not learn from the past? Those I love do not stay in my life. They all leave. Every one of them. Except for you . . . only you stay . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. You are overwrought.\u201d</p><p>Strong arms curved beneath her as Tim lifted her up. She curled against his chest as he carried her back to her bedchamber with Maria in tow.</p><p>Colin straightened from his low bow, his eyes meeting Ware\u2019s as the earl mimicked his movements. He felt the hot trickle of blood weeping from the shallow wound caused by Ware\u2019s blade, but he did not care. Ware had satisfaction, but that was all he would have. It would have to be enough for the earl, for Colin intended to take the spoils.</p><p>\u201cBut regardless of everything that recommends you, my lord,\u201d Colin continued, \u201cI concede only this duel. Not Miss Benbridge. Her deeper affection is for me, as always. And I believe my feelings for her are quite obvious to one and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you abandoned her for several years?\u201d the earl scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI cannot alter the past. However, I can assure you that from the present moment onward, nothing on Earth can take her from me.\u201d</p><p>Ware\u2019s blue eyes narrowed, and thick tension filled the air between them. Then the corner of the earl\u2019s mouth lifted. \u201cPerhaps you are not the man I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d</p><p>They bowed again, then quit the lawn, both men heading in the separate directions their lives would now take them.</p><p>The next half hour of Amelia\u2019s life\u2014or was it an hour?\u2014passed in a daze. Maria forced tea upon her, as well as a hefty dose of laudanum.</p><p>\u201cIt will calm you,\u201d her sister murmured.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she muttered, slapping at the many hands that sought to soothe her brow.</p><p>\u201cI will read quietly,\u201d Maria said, \u201cand send your abigail away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You go, too.\u201d</p><p>Eventually they gave up and went away, leaving Amelia to curl into herself and fall back into a dreamless, drug-induced sleep.</p><p>Sadly, the respite did not last long. Far too soon another hand brushed the curls back from her face.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I have only myself to blame for your lack of faith.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s voice brushed across her skin like a tangible caress. She rolled into him, grasping with her hands. He caught them with his own and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to sleep straight through this morning,\u201d he murmured, pulling the blankets back from her. \u201cI wanted to spare you any possibility of distress.\u201d</p><p>She was lifted and cradled to a warm, hard chest. The scent of his skin, so alluringly masculine and uniquely Colin, urged her to bury her tear-streaked face in his cravat.</p><p>She was distantly aware of being carried. It felt as if they descended a staircase, and then fresh air was drifting over her skin, making her shiver.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a blanket in my carriage,\u201d he murmured. \u201cA minute more and then you will be comfortable again.\u201d</p><p>A moment later she was jostled into a carriage, and it set off with a lurch, the wheels crunching across gravel. She was held securely in Colin\u2019s lap and covered warmly. Tears leaked out between her closed eyelids, and she prayed that she would never wake from such a wonderful dream.</p><p>His firm lips pressed tightly against her forehead. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>Drugged by the laudanum, she did.</p><p>It was the sudden cessation of motion that woke Amelia. Blinking, she fought off the remnants of sleep.</p><p>\u201cThe horses are fatigued and I am near starved.\u201d Colin\u2019s deep voice pulled her from half awareness to full cognizance in an instant.</p><p>The duel . . .</p><p>Bolting upright, the top of her head made sharp contact with his chin, causing them both to cry out.</p><p>\u201cOw, damn it,\u201d he muttered, rearranging her atop his lap as if she weighed nothing at all.</p><p>Wild-eyed, Amelia took in the luxurious appointments of Colin\u2019s travel coach and then leaned out the window. They were in the courtyard of what appeared to be an inn.</p><p>She glanced at him and found him rubbing his chin. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be wed.\u201d</p><p>Amelia blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His smile revealed his dimples and reminded her of the boy she had fallen so deeply in love with. \u201cYou said that we had no hope of moving forward together if I was forever leaving you behind. Since I had no further reason to enjoy Lord Ware\u2019s hospitality, it was time for us to go.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment, trying to collect what it was that he was saying. \u201cI do not understand. Did you not duel this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he not win? Did you not say he was the better man? Dear God, am I losing my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, and no.\u201d Colin tightened the arm banded around her waist and pulled her closer. \u201cI allowed him first blood,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe had a right to it. When I took you, you were still his.\u201d</p><p>Amelia opened her mouth to protest, and he covered her lips with his fingertips. \u201cAllow me to finish.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment, absorbing the sudden gravity reflected on his countenance. Then she nodded and slipped free of his embrace, moving to the opposite squab so that she could think properly.</p><p>It was then she noted that she was dressed in her night rail. For his part, Colin was beautifully attired in a velvet ensemble of dark green. She still encountered difficulty correlating the Colin before her with the Colin of old, but she had no difficulty loving him, regardless. The sight of him filled her with pleasure, just as it always had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is no point in denying that Ware can offer you things that I cannot,\u201d Colin said, his dark eyes watching her with a mixture of love and determination. \u201cThat is what you overheard this morning. However, I have come to realize that I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d Amelia\u2019s hand went to her fluttering stomach.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d He crossed his arms, revealing the powerful muscles she found endlessly arousing. \u201cI love you. I want you. I intend to have you. Every other consideration be damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve stolen you, Amelia. Run away with you, just as I have always wanted to do.\u201d He smiled again. \u201cWithin a fortnight, you and I will be husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have no say in the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say \u2018yes\u2019 if you like. Otherwise, you have no say.\u201d</p><p>Amelia laughed even as tears fell.</p><p>Colin leaned forward and set his elbows on his knees. \u201cTell me those are happy tears.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColin . . .\u201d She gave a shaky sigh. \u201cHow can I say yes? Discarding Ware so callously for my own pleasure is exactly the sort of behavior my father excelled at. I could not live with myself if I acted so selfishly. Perhaps I would even grow to resent you for tempting me into such reckless deportment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d He straightened. \u201cIf I tell you that Ware would want nothing more than your happiness, it might alleviate your concern and goad your agreement, but that is not what I want.\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are acting impetuously,\u201d he continued. \u201cYes, we are seizing the day and our love without a care for the world. That is who we are. That is our affinity. You and I are not ones to restrain our joys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople cannot live in that manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they can. As long as doing so brings no pain to others.\u201d His voice grew more impassioned, arresting her. \u201cWare does not love you, not as I do. And you do not love him. I also suspect that you do not love yourself, not as you should. You accused me of molding myself into someone I am not, yet you are guilty of the same offense. You seek to mold yourself into a woman of decorum and duty, but that is not who you are! Do not be ashamed of the facets of you that I love so much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWelton was an awful man,\u201d she cried. \u201cI cannot be like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never could be.\u201d Colin caught up her hands. \u201cYou are filled with love for life and family. Your father was filled with love only for himself. Two very different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWare . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWare knows what I am doing. He could stop us if he wishes, but he won\u2019t. Regardless, I am altering myself to have you. I am taking this day and you, and forsaking all of the rest. It is frightening, yes. We will both have to leave the cages we created for ourselves and venture into the unknown. But we will have each other.\u201d</p><p>Cages. She had been caged for so long, one part of her hating the restrictions, the other part grateful that they restrained her from being too much like Welton. \u201cYou know me so well,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know you better than anyone. You told me to believe that I was worthy of you. Now it is your turn to believe that you are worthy of me. Trust that you are free from whatever defect of character your father suffered. Trust that I am smart enough to love a wonderful woman.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to her knuckles. \u201cMake the leap with me, Amelia. I am holding on to our love with both hands, despite all the reasons why I shouldn\u2019t. Do the same. Embrace your wild nature and run with me. Be free with me. We shall all be happier for it.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him for a long moment, her vision blurring with tears. Then she threw herself into his arms.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered with her cheek pressed to his. \u201cLet\u2019s be free.\u201d</p><p>Christopher, Simon, and Ware were engrossed in a discussion when Maria burst into the room with her skirts held in one hand and a missive in the other.</p><p>All three men rose immediately. Christopher and Simon both stepped toward her with frowns marring their handsome features. Ware merely raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cI found this atop Amelia\u2019s pillow! Mitchell has absconded with her.\u201d</p><p>Simon blinked. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Christopher smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe says he intends to marry her.\u201d She glanced down at the note to read it again. \u201cThey are already headed north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must hurry or we will miss the nuptials,\u201d Ware said.</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d Maria stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cI hoped,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI am pleased to see the man has come to his senses.\u201d</p><p>Maria opened her mouth, then shut it again.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s not dally,\u201d Christopher said, catching her elbow and spinning her back around toward the door. \u201cWe have packing to see to. Tim can guard Mademoiselle Rousseau and Jacques while we are absent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth,\u201d Simon muttered. \u201cMay I ride in your carriage, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>Still finding it difficult to believe, Maria glanced over her shoulder at Ware.</p><p>\u201cThis is a happy occasion, Mrs. St. John,\u201d he drawled, following directly behind them. \u201cYou should be smiling as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Christopher, who nodded. With that, she shrugged and laughed aloud. Then she lifted her skirts and raced her husband up the stairs.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cWe set sail in a few hours,\u201d Quinn said, fingering a coined tassel on a multicolored pillow. \u201cMy trunks and valet are aboard, and Lysette is safely restrained in my cabin.\u201d</p><p>They sat in the family parlor of Colin\u2019s new town house in London. It was a large room, beautifully decorated in shades of soft blue and gold. Around the room, Amelia had added colorful touches of his heritage\u2014pillows encased in glorious scarves, small carved figurines, and bowls of Romany trinkets given to them by Pietro as wedding gifts. The style was unfashionable and would be considered horrifyingly gauche by many, but they both loved the space and spent a great deal of time curled up together there.</p><p>Embrace who you are, she had said, with a new confidence that aroused him unbearably. She, too, was embracing the reckless side of herself that she had fought to contain for so long. Fears of becoming too much like her father were banished, just as Colin\u2019s fear of being unworthy of her no longer had power to dictate his actions.</p><p>Colin leaned back in his chair and asked Quinn, \u201cDid the French agree to release your men in a trade for the return of Mademoiselle Rousseau and Cartland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jacques. They want him, too. But I am only taking Lysette with me for now. They can have the other two back after I am certain they will honor their end of the agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not envy you that trip,\u201d Colin said, wincing. \u201cI cannot imagine Mademoiselle Rousseau makes a very good prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is miserable, but I am enjoying the whole thing immensely.\u201d</p><p>Colin laughed. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a cad. When will you return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not certain.\u201d Shrugging, Quinn said, \u201cPerhaps after I ensure that the others are released. Or perhaps not even then. Maybe I will travel some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are good to your men, Quinn. It is a trait I have always admired in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are not my men any longer. I have resigned.\u201d He nodded at Colin\u2019s raised brows. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true. My work for Eddington was diverting for a time, but now I must find new ways to amuse myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome sort of trouble will come up.\u201d Quinn grinned. \u201cSeeing you in your evening finery reminds me that a life of social indulgence is not for me. It would bore me to tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with the right woman.\u201d</p><p>Quinn threw his dark head back and laughed, a rich, full sound that brought a smile to Colin\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cEven when I was maudlin with love for Maria,\u201d Quinn said, pushing to his feet, \u201cI thankfully never spouted such nonsense.\u201d</p><p>Colin rose with him, flushing sheepishly. \u201cOne day, I hope to remind you of your protestations and watch you eat your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! That day will be a long time coming, my friend. Likely, neither of us will live long enough to see it.\u201d</p><p>As Quinn turned to leave the room, Colin felt more than a small measure of sadness at their parting. Quinn was a wanderer by nature; therefore, they would see each other far less often. After all they had endured and experienced together, he thought of Quinn as a brother and would miss him accordingly.</p><p>\u201cFarewell, my friend.\u201d Quinn clapped him on the back when they reached the foyer. \u201cI wish you much joy and many children in your marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you happy, as well.\u201d</p><p>Quinn touched his brow in a smart salute, and then he was gone. Off to find his next adventure.</p><p>Colin stared at the closed front door for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cDarling. \u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s throaty purr sent a wave of heat across his skin.</p><p>He turned to face her with a smile and found her paused at the top of the stairs, dressed in only her robe. Her hair was beautifully, intricately arranged with twinkling diamonds weaved among the powdered strands.</p><p>\u201cYou have yet to dress?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was nearly finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does not appear that way to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to stop when Anne brought me the finishing touches to my ensemble . . . and the final piece of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His smile widened. He knew well that look of seductive mischief in her eyes.</p><p>Her left arm lifted gracefully, the emerald of her wedding ring glinting in the candlelight from the foyer chandelier, her delicate fingers wrapped with lustrous black satin and dangling a familiar white mask.</p><p>Every muscle in his body hardened.</p><p>\u201cIf you like,\u201d she murmured, \u201cwe can go to the masquerade as planned. I know it took you some time to dress.\u201d</p><p>He strode toward the stairs. \u201cIt would take me considerably less time to undress,\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u201cI should like you to wear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI set it out for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWicked man.\u201d</p><p>Colin took the steps two at a time and caught her up, relishing the feel of her soft, unfettered body pressed to his. \u201cI\u2019m wicked? It is you, Countess Montoya, who lures me away from a staid social outing in favor of a night of licentious revelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot resist.\u201d She lifted the mask to his face and secured the ribbons. \u201cI have a passion for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndulge it,\u201d he growled, his lips to her throat. \u201cI beg of you.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter was filled with joy and love. It filled his heart then, and over the course of many hours afterward. Along with other, equally wondrous sounds. </p> </body></html>"]
