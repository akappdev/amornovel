The day was dying, becoming red, red like the color of the blood seeping to the ground, making that terrible, distinctive noise. Drip, drip, drip...</p><p>Ashley Donegal was there. She wasn\u2019t even sure where there was, but she knew that she didn\u2019t want to be there.</p><p>Suddenly, the mist seemed to swirl in a violent gust, and then settle softly, closer to the ground. It parted as she walked through. She could see her surroundings, and, at that moment, she knew. She was in the cemetery. She had played here so often as a child\u2014respectfully, of course. Her grandfather never would have had it any other way. Those elegant tombs, all constructed with such love, and an eye to the priorities of the day. The finest craftsmen had been hired, artists and artisans, and the place was truly beautiful. Angels and archangels graced the various tombs, winged cherubs, saints and crosses. She had never been afraid.</p><p>But now...</p> <p>From a distance, she could hear shouts. Soldiers. Ridiculous. Grown men playing as soldiers. But they did it so well. She might almost have been back in time. The powder came from the howitzer and the Enfield rifles. The shouts sounded as the men played out their roles, edging from the river road to the outbuildings and then the stables, to the final confrontation on the lawn and in the cemetery. The blood would come from stage packets within their uniforms, of course, but...</p><p>This was real blood. She knew because it had a distinctive odor, and because, yes, damn it, she could smell it. Nothing smelled like real blood.</p><p>She looked at the ground, and she could see the puddle where the blood was falling, but she was afraid to look up. If she looked up, she would see a dead man.</p><p>But she did so anyway. She saw him. There was a hat pulled low over his face, but soon he would lift his head.</p><p>He did. And she saw a man in his prime, handsome, with strength of purpose in the sculpture of his face. But there was weariness in his eyes.</p><p>Weariness and death. Yet they were just playacting; that past was so, so long ago now....</p> <p>She didn\u2019t speak. Neither did he. Because his face began to rot. It blackened, and while she watched, the scabrous decaying flesh began to peel away. Soon she was staring into the empty eye sockets of a skull.</p><p>She started to scream.</p><p>Above that sound, she could hear someone calling to her. Someone calling her name. The sound was deep, rich and masculine, and she knew it....</p><p>It was Jake! He would help.... Surely he would help.</p><p>But she could only stare at the skeletal mask in front of her.</p><p>Smell the blood.</p><p>And scream.</p><p>A strange sound in the middle of the night awoke Ashley. She sat up with a start and realized she was doing the screaming. She clamped her own hand quickly over her mouth, embarrassed and praying that she hadn\u2019t roused the household. She waited in silence; nope, no one.</p> <p>That was pretty pathetic. It must have been a horrifically pathetic scream. If she ever really needed to scream, she\u2019d probably be out of luck.</p><p>Lord, that had been some nightmare.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have nightmares. She was the most grounded human being she knew; hell, she had grown up next to a bayou full of alligators and cottonmouths, and she had lived in a downtrodden area of New York City near Chinatown in order to afford NYU. She knew all about real monsters\u2014ghosts were creations to reel tourists in.</p><p>So...</p><p>With a groan, she threw her head back on her pillow and glanced at the clock. She needed to sleep. In a week\u2019s time, they\u2019d be celebrating Donegal Plantation\u2019s biggest annual event: the reenactment of the skirmish here that had cost her ancestor his life.</p><p>Ah, yes, and she had been dreaming about the skirmish\u2014or the reenactment?</p><p>That was it, she thought, grinning. She was dreaming about the events at Donegal Plantation because they were preparing for the day.</p><p>History was always alive at Donegal. The plantation house was furnished with antiques, most of which had been in the family forever. There was an attic room that contained more artifacts from the Civil War than many a museum, down to letters, mess kits, knapsacks, pistols, rifles and bayonets. Still, the reenactment remained a major undertaking.</p><p>But they\u2019d been running it since before she had even been born. It was rote by now. All the same, there was still plenty of bustle and confusion, along with everything that had to happen before the event could take place, including a mound of paperwork on her desk that had to do with the \u201csutler\u2019s tent,\u201d the pop-up shop where period clothing and curios and other paraphernalia, such as weapons and antiques, were sold. Which meant registrations and taxes. Then there was the insurance they needed for the day, and the officers to direct traffic and so on.</p><p>That was it. She just had a lot on her mind.</p><p>And the reenactment always reminded her of Jake. He\u2019d never been a soldier, North or South. But he\u2019d dressed up, and he\u2019d played his guitar and sang music from the era. And sometimes she had played with him, and he\u2019d always known how to make it just right, to bring back the past, with the light of truth.</p><p>She eased down in her covers, determined to forget both her anxiety and Jake.</p><p>Not so easy, even though it had been a long time since Jake had been in her life.</p><p>Finally, she started to drift again. She was comfortable; she loved her bed and her room, even if she had lived here her whole life other than college. Though she loved to learn about new people and new places, she also loved to be home.</p><p>She started again, certain that she had felt a touch; something soft and gentle, smoothing her hair, stroking her cheek.</p><p>She sat up. Moonlight streamed into the room, and there was no one else here; with so many guests around, she had locked her bedroom door. She looked at her pillow and decided that she had merely rubbed against a side of the pillowcase.</p><p>As she did so, she glanced at her dresser.</p><p>There was something different about it. She studied it for a moment, wondering what it was.</p><p>Then she knew.</p><p>She kept a picture of her parents there, on her dresser. It had been taken almost twenty years ago. They were together, holding her between them, when she had been five. It had been developed in sepia tone, and they\u2019d had it done when one of the guests at a reenactment had found a way of making nice money by pretending to be Matthew Brady, the famed Civil War photographer. Throughout the day, he had answered historical questions about photography and its place in the Civil War.</p><p>As was the custom of the day, none of them was smiling, but there was still something exceptionally charming about the picture. There was a light in her father\u2019s eyes, and just the hint of a curl at her mother\u2019s lips. Her father\u2019s arm was around her, his hand coming to rest tenderly on her mother\u2019s shoulder. She was sandwiched close between them, and in her mind, the picture had been filled with love. It had become an even greater treasure when she had lost them.</p><p>It usually faced at a slight angle toward her bed.</p><p>The picture was turned away, as if someone had been looking at it from a different angle. It was such a little thing, but...</p><p>Maybe someone had wandered into her room. Cliff ran the property and she ran the house, but they employed extra housekeepers in the main house when they had guests. They hadn\u2019t had guests in the house in the last few weeks, but the house was usually open, and her grandfather loved to walk anyone staying on the property through it. Depending on his mood, a tour could get long.</p><p>And the picture...</p><p>She turned over, groaning. It was just the angle of the picture.</p><p>Jake Mallory should have slept well, with a hard case finally settled.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>The odd thing about his nightmares was that they were a recent phenomenon. When he had begun to realize and make use of this gift or curse\u2014those things he somehow knew\u2014there had been no dreams.</p><p>During the summer of the storms, during Katrina and the flooding, they had all been so busy. While it had been happening, he\u2019d never explained to his coworkers that he was so good at finding the remains of the deceased because they called out to him; they spoke to him. It was heartbreaking; it was agony. But the dead needed their loved ones to know, and so he listened. And he didn\u2019t dream those nights.</p><p>Later, the dreams had come, and they were always the same.</p><p>He was alone in his small, flat-bottomed boat, though he\u2019d never been alone during any of the searches.</p><p>He was alone, and the heat of the day had cranked down to the lesser heat of the night, and he was searching specifically for someone, though he didn\u2019t know who. As the boat moved through the water that should have been a street, he began to see people on the rooftops, clinging to branches here and there, and even floating in the water.</p><p>They saw him; they reached out to him. And he felt like weeping. They weren\u2019t living people. They were those who had lost the fight.</p><p>As he drifted along, he looked back at them all, men and women, old and young, black and white and all colors in between. He wanted to ease their suffering, but he could no longer save them. Their faces had an ashen cast, and the bone structure was sucked in and hollow; they didn\u2019t seem to know that there was nothing he could do for them anymore. In the dream, he knew that he, like many law-enforcement officers, scent dogs and volunteers, would be called upon to find the dead in the future.</p><p>But now he was seeking the living.</p><p>They called out to him; they were trying to tell him something. Bit by bit, he saw they were trying to show him the way. He thought that there should have been sound, but there was none. He didn\u2019t hear his passage through the water, and nothing emitted from the mouths of the corpses he passed.</p><p>Then he saw the figure on the roof far ahead. He thought it was a woman. She seemed to be in something flowing, which was not unusual. Many victims, living and dead, had been found in nightgowns or boxers or flannel pajamas. What was strange was that she seemed to be the only one alive. She was in tremendous peril as the water rose all around her. He felt that there was something familiar about her, but he didn\u2019t understand what it was that seemed to touch him. The light of the full moon turned her hair golden and gleaming, her white gown flowed in the breeze. Amidst the destruction, she was a beautiful survivor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tried to get closer.</p><p>The watery road grew more clogged and congested. Downed tree branches and appliances floated by. A soaked teddy bear with big black button eyes stared at him sightlessly as it drifted. He ached inside; it was an agony to fight the river, but it was also something he knew he had to do. Especially when she waited; when he could save her. He just had to reach her before the water level rose higher and higher, and swept her away.</p><p>He grew close...</p> <p>And that was when he felt the darkness at his back.</p><p>He tried to turn, but he could not. The wind had picked up, and the effort was too much. No matter how he strained, he couldn\u2019t see what evil thing seemed to be tracking him.</p><p>There was suddenly sound. The woman. She was calling out to him.</p><p>She called him by name.</p><p>But he could feel the thing behind him gaining on him. He could almost reach out for her, but he had to turn, had to find out what seemed to be breathing fetid air down his back....</p> <p>She called out again.</p><p>Jake!</p><p>If they were to survive, to outrun whatever horror was behind him, they would have to do so together.</p><p>Jake!</p><p>Her voice rang out almost as clearly as if she were next to him in the boat.</p><p>But the darkness was on him, so close....</p> <p>He could feel it then, enveloping him, crushing the sound of her voice as it did.</p><p>And he woke with a jerk.</p><p>Jake sat up in bed, deeply disturbed by the reappearance of his frequent dream. For the first time, he knew who he had seen on the roof of the house, about to be swallowed up by the floodwaters.</p><p>It was Ashley. Ashley Donegal.</p><p>He stood and stretched, irritated. The clock on his mantel indicated it was still early.</p><p>He swore and got dressed. He knew why he\u2019d had the dream\u2014and made Ashley the woman on the rooftop. He knew the date. The reenactment was coming. Donegal Plantation would be busy and alive; Ashley would still hurt from the fact that her dad had passed away and would no longer be playing Marshall Donegal, his ancestor. But she\u2019d never show it. She\u2019d be the grand mistress of the ceremonies, beautiful and regal in her Civil War attire.</p><p>He wondered if he would ever fall out of love with her. And then he wondered if the dream had meant something more. Angela\u2014who seemed to have the best sixth sense in what the FBI called their special unit\u2014had told him that dreams could open many doors. In REM sleep, the mind was at the stage where dreams came, and those dreams could easily focus on what the conscious mind rejected. When she was trying to reach memories of the past, she often used sleep.</p><p>If that were the guide, he could easily convince himself to think that Ashley now wanted him. Needed him. And that this was the sign.</p> <p>Of course, that was just Angela\u2019s way of seeking the ghosts of the past\u2014even in their own group, they weren\u2019t sure about all the rules of seeking out the help of ghosts.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to laugh at himself or not.</p><p>Their team was legitimate; they were on-the-books federal agents. They had just spent days at the local training facility, improving their weapons skills, computer literacy and understanding of the mission policy.</p><p>But they were a one-of-a-kind unit, and their true designation wasn\u2019t written down anywhere. Among themselves, they were the Krewe of Hunters; on paper, they were Adam Harrison\u2019s Special Unit. In bizarre situations, they were supposed to smoke out the fakers\u2014and find what might really be remnants of the past.</p><p>The world was filled with ghost hunters and would-be ghost hunters. The problem that most people didn\u2019t see was the fact that few ghosts would really appear for a television crew. Some ghost lore did seem to be true. There were the residual hauntings\u2014ghosts that played out a situation, such as a battle scene at Gettysburg, over and over again. And there were intelligent hauntings: ghosts that lingered for some reason. Ghosts didn\u2019t seem to have rules. Some could find certain individuals who saw them as clearly as day; they could carry on long conversations, appear and disappear, and interact. Sometimes ghosts were frightened of the living, and they hid, and only someone with a real ability to suspend disbelief could coax them out. It was complicated; he was still learning. Sometimes ghosts tried to warn those they cared about when something evil was about to occur, and ghosts often entered into the REM sleep of those they hadn\u2019t managed yet to really touch in the conscious world.</p><p>So the dream meant that Ashley needed him....</p><p>Or he wanted the dream to mean that Ashley needed him.</p><p>He stood up and walked over to his hotel window and looked out over the dark streets of the French Quarter. There was so much history here. So many lives had been lived; so much drama had taken place. Sometimes it was impossible to believe that the energy of the past didn\u2019t remain. Ghosts didn\u2019t have to be old; he knew that himself, though he hadn\u2019t wanted to accept the truth until he had met Adam Harrison and become a part of the unit Adam had started for the FBI. He had been glad of his ability to feel where people were; to imagine that he heard them telling him to come, please. Sometimes he had even been able to find the living. And sometimes he had heard the voices of the dead, when he hadn\u2019t known that they were dead.</p><p>His \u201cgift\u201d had cost him Ashley.</p><p>So why now, all these years later, was he seeing her, adrift, about to be engulfed, and yet reaching for him, even as he reached for her?</p><p>1</p><p>\u201cAh, dammit! I don\u2019t want to be a Yankee,\u201d Charles Osgood said.</p><p>It was there; it had finally come, and Ashley was grateful.</p><p>And the semi-drama going on here surely meant her mind had been trying to warn her that the day was not going to come without its share of trouble, because it was already proving to be one hell of an afternoon.</p><p>Morning had brought the business of breakfast, visitors pouring onto the property to spend time at the campsites. Now they were coming close to the main event of the day, the reenactment of the battle that had taken place at Donegal Plantation.</p><p>She\u2019d never expected the real trouble to come over the sad situation of an ailing faux-Yankee.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Charles exclaimed again.</p><p>Ashley thought that the man sounded like a petulant teenager, though she knew that he didn\u2019t really want to argue. Not on a day like today. He flushed as the words came out of his mouth, and cast her a quick glance of dismay. She wasn\u2019t even the one handing out the assignments, though she was the only Donegal among them now. The relish the group was taking in telling Charles his new role unsettled her a bit. Charles Osgood was the newest in the \u201ccavalry unit\u201d of reenactors, which meant that he got the assignment to play for the other side. Yet this seemed to be turning into a college hazing; they were all friends, and they were usually courteous to one another.</p><p>\u201cCharlie, come on! Being a Yankee will be fun. Okay, so they were jerks\u2014well, the ones here\u2014who couldn\u2019t spy on a neon sign, couldn\u2019t hunt, couldn\u2019t shoot.... But come on! Being a Yank will be fun!\u201d Griffin Grant teased.</p><p>Ashley shook her head; how could grown men be so immature?</p><p>In her mind, although she truly loved the living history that took place at the plantation, she thought the units clinging to so-called glory were nothing more than inane. The event had ended with the death of one her ancestors\u2014not a party.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, all of you!\u201d Ashley said, addressing the men around her and using the voice she would utilize when working with one of the school groups\u2014the grade-school groups. \u201cI know you all like to cling to the magical illusion that the antebellum South was a place of beauty, grace and honor\u2014where men were men. Real men, hunting, riding, brawling\u2014but honorable. Yes, we reenact what was. But this is now, and that was then! None of you would seriously want to go back to the Civil War, and no one here is prejudiced. The slavery of any person was a horrendous way of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley\u2014you\u2019re making it sound like being a real man is bad thing!\u201d Cliff Boudreaux commented, laughing. Cliff, horse master at Donegal, was clearly amused and having a good time.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, Ashley, it\u2019s not like we take this too seriously,\u201d Griffin Grant said, staring back at her as if she was the one who didn\u2019t understand the question. Griffin was a striking man in his early thirties, sleek and slick, a CEO for a cable company in New Orleans, though his ancestors had lived out here, two hours down the road from the big city. \u201cWe know reality\u2014and like it. But this is important playacting!\u201d</p><p>She groaned softly.</p><p>They were good guys, really.</p><p>It was playacting, and for the playacting they were able to believe truly with their whole hearts that it had been about nothing other than states\u2019 rights. Ashley knew all the statistics about the fighting men\u2014most of the men who fought and died for the South during the war couldn\u2019t have begun to have afforded a slave\u2014and war was seldom caused by one issue. But her parents and her grandfather had never been the types to overlook the plantation\u2019s complicated history. Cliff was part of that with his gold-green eyes, bronze-colored skin and dark tawny hair. She knew that half their visitors were immediately enthralled with him. He was one of the reenactors on the Southern side because of the Donegal blood that ran in his veins. Early on, a Donegal widower had fallen in love with a slave, creating the first racial mix in his background. In the 1920s, his great-grandfather had married a Donegal cousin, something that caused a serious scandal at that time in history, but which now gave both halves of the family a sense of pleasure and pride. She wasn\u2019t sure how to count second and third or twice-removed relatives, so she considered Cliff to be her cousin.</p><p>History was history. Donegal was steeped in it, good and bad, and they didn\u2019t hide any of it.</p><p>\u201cCharles, they\u2019re right. It\u2019s a performance, you know,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a show, maybe even an important show in its small way. It\u2019s where people can see the weapons of the day, the uniforms that were worn. And, actually, remember, this particular fight started because men had a bar brawl\u2014and then an excuse to fight because the war was getting underway. You\u2019re all examples of keeping history alive, and I\u2019m so grateful to all of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charles stared back at her blankly; the other men were smirking.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t they all get it? They were actors in a show, hopefully teaching American history, with several perspectives, along the way. But some things died really slowly here, in plantation country. Family was still everything. Loyalty to hearth and home, kin, parish and state. They\u2019d been wrong; they\u2019d been beaten, and they knew it, but still, only one side of the cast of players was considered to be elite. And the reenactors could be incredibly snobbish.</p><p>That made Charles Osgood the odd man out.</p> <p>Toby Keaton cleared his throat and then said softly, \u201cCharles\u2014come on. You\u2019re lucky to be in with the 27th Bayou Militia Cavalry Unit. Most of the time, the fellows taking part in the reenactments here are direct descendants of those who fought before. You\u2019ve got to see the truth of this thing. You claim your place in the ranks through marriage\u2014your stepfather was an O\u2019Reilly, and I know he raised you, but, you know, in other old Southern units, that wouldn\u2019t count.\u201d Toby was forty-four, and Ashley\u2019s next-door neighbor at Beaumont, his Creole plantation, though they both had acres and acres of land. Toby grinned as if to cut the harshness of his words. \u201cNewcomer\u2014odd man out. You\u2019re a Yankee if I\u2019ve ever seen one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! So now I\u2019m a newcomer\u2014and that makes me an outsider?\u201d Charles asked, staring around the room. \u201cCome on, guys, you\u2019ve just got to understand. This will really make it look as if I don\u2019t belong here at all!\u201d</p><p>He gave his appeal to the others gathered at the horse master\u2019s office in the old barn at Donegal Plantation that day\u2014Cliff Boudreaux, Griffin Grant, Toby Keaton, Ramsay Clayton, Hank Trebly, all still with property in the general area, John Ashton, tour director from New Orleans, and Ashley herself. The \u201cYankees\u201d were gathering in the old smokehouse\u2014a separate building, and now a small apartment. Charles would be joining them soon; all of the reenactors gathered together for their roundtable discussions on the war, but each side met separately first on the day of the reenactment to make sure that every member knew the character he was playing. Later, they\u2019d all meet back here to make sure that everyone was apprised of all the safety factors involved.</p><p>One, Charles, so it seemed, would have to play a Yankee, and go join the group in the apartment. They were short a Yankee, and that\u2019s the way it was. All of them belonged to Civil War roundtables, and these days, none of them really cared about sides\u2014they just liked to discuss tactics and procedure. They often met in the dining room at Donegal; Ashley loved to listen, because they also knew their history, and they spoke about events in the lives of many of the key players in the war, and the fact that the generals had often been best friends before they had been forced to choose sides in the bloody conflict. They knew about weapons, uniforms, sad stories about treason and resisters, draft riots, food, clothing, trade and so much more.</p><p>\u201cCharles,\u201d Cliff Boudreaux said patiently. \u201cWe\u2019re all just teasing you here, really. We\u2019re short on Yankees today, on account of Barton Waverly being sick with the flu. We\u2019re pretty desperate. And that\u2019s the rule; newcomers play Yankees when our brothers from up North ask for help. Hell, remember that year when half of us were laid up with the croup? Three of them Yankees had to come play Southern boys. We\u2019re not doing anything bad to you\u2014really.\u201d</p> <p>Ramsay Clayton was seated across the table from Cliff. Ramsay looked like an artist; he was tall, with a wiry muscle structure, long dark hair and classical features. He owned a small place down the road, but he spent a lot of time in New Orleans, where he sometimes showed his work at Jackson Square and sometimes had showings at the galleries. He grinned at Charles. \u201cYeah, and don\u2019t forget, the Yankees won. Hell, come to think about it, where were all the Southern boys when we were losing this thing?\u201d he asked lightly. \u201cAh, well. Born in our day and age, it\u2019s easy to look back at the South\u2019s part in the Civil War and wonder, \u2018What the hell were we thinking?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ashley smiled. She liked Ramsay. He was a good guy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wish I could just step up to the plate, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t play a Yankee\u2014I just can\u2019t,\u201d Toby Keaton said. \u201cHell, my great-great-great-whatever grandfather was the first one to answer Marshall Donegal\u2019s call for volunteers. He was one of his best friends. I think he\u2019d roll in his grave if I played a Yankee. Good God! I own a plantation! Wouldn\u2019t be fitting for me to play a Yankee. Lord knows, it could be bad for business.\u201d</p><p>Hank Trebly grinned. \u201cWell, I\u2019m just big sugar. I don\u2019t really give a whit. I see the war as over, over, over, and that\u2019s the way it is. Lord A-mighty! The damn thing ended in 1865.\u201d Hank owned the property next to Donegal, and his ancestors had owned it forever. The old plantation had been replaced by a sugar refinery years ago. He was a small man, in his early forties, and his business meant everything to him.</p><p>John Ashton shrugged. \u201cMy family might have been here, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Civil War means my income these days\u2014tourists love to go back. But I love \u2019em all. Yankees, rebels, Brits, Brazilians! Bring them on. They all spend money and take tours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened here was in 1861, for God\u2019s sake, before the thing had really even gotten going,\u201d Griffin said, shaking his head. \u201cCome on, now! My ancestor went on to die at the Second Battle of Manassas\u2014now, that\u2019s a damned big battle. We\u2019re here to teach, and to remember everything that happened in the past\u2014and how it made us what we are today. Let\u2019s have fun, folks. C\u2019mon\u2014I come out here to forget the office and programming and statistics, computers and red tape. I don\u2019t care who plays what. It\u2019s just for a good time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI spend most of my time in New Orleans, art on the square and all that\u2014you can call me a doughboy for all I care. It\u2019s the spirit of this thing,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cAnd Lord knows, what happened here couldn\u2019t even be called a battle. My ancestor and most of the Southern boys except for Marshall survived, but, as we\u2019ve all pointed out now\u2014the North won. We are living the United States of America. This wasn\u2019t even really a battle.\u201d</p><p>He was right. What had taken place late in 1861 hadn\u2019t even been a battle. Drinking downriver, toward New Orleans, two Yankee spies had heard about Donegal\u2019s then-owner\u2014Marshall Donegal\u2014preparing a major summons to area troops to prepare them for an invasion of New Orleans. In trying to draw Marshall Donegal\u2019s men out further on the subject, they had all gotten into a fistfight when one made a ridiculous statement about Northerners being chickens. The two Confederates suspected the men of being spies, and had run back to Donegal. The spies went back to their headquarters, but they were spies, and thus their numbers were small. On each side, six men were mustered\u2014and, rather than be executed as spies if they were caught, the Union men donned their uniforms.</p><p>The fighting had ranged from the stables to the porch of the main house and out to the chapel and cemetery\u2014ending when Captain Marshall Donegal had died of a bayonet wound in his own family graveyard. The enemy had \u201cskedaddled,\u201d according to the Southern side; the rebels had been left in utter defeat, according to their Northern counterparts.</p><p>Now, the \u201cbattle\u201d was something that taught history, and, largely due to its small size\u2014and the fact that the current owner of the plantation, Ashley\u2019s grandfather, Frazier Donegal, was a history buff and glad to welcome the units on his property\u2014it was a popular event. \u201cLiving history\u201d took place frequently at Donegal, as often as once a week, but an actual reenactment was done only once a year. Sometimes the actors doing the reenactments were involved in other locations. Some belonged not just to Civil War units, but Revolutionary War units, and it just depended on where the biggest shindig was going on. Luckily, most of the men who could claim to have had ancestors in the brawl loved the plantation and the nearly exact-to-the-past-moment location of the place, and they usually made this reenactment a priority.</p><p>Donegal House was surely one of the prettiest places left on the river road, with memories of the antebellum era held in place. The great house still maintained a gorgeous front. It had been built with magnificent Greek columns and wraparound porches, and elegant tree-shaded entries stretched forever before the front and back doors. The currently used stables, housing only six horses, were next to the house, while the larger stables needed in a bygone era were far back from the house, to the left, riverside, and offered three apartments for those who wanted to stay for the night. The old smokehouse and servants\u2019 quarters were available for rent as well, and sometimes they even rented out five of the rooms in the main house. With Beth there, Ashley\u2019s extraordinarily talented friend and chef, and the efforts they were making with the restaurant and the crazy business that came along with the reenactment, they had chosen this year just to let rooms in the outbuildings.</p><p>All this\u2014living history and their bed-and-breakfast rentals\u2014was done to survive into the twenty-first century. But the Donegal family had been letting the place out for nearly thirty years now. And the living history and the reenactments were the true highlights to be found here, distinguishing it from other great plantations along the river.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sure. You all are right,\u201d Charles said. \u201cIt\u2019s over. Long over. Hell, the Yankees did win the war.\u201d</p><p>Cliff laughed. \u201cStill hard to convince my mama and a few other folks I know that it\u2019s true. But thanks, Charles, that\u2019s great. The Yanks are good guys. Man, it\u2019s sad to think back, though, huh? We would have wound up being enemies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho knows what our feelings would have been back then?\u201d Ashley asked. \u201cWe might have chosen to fight for the North.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a different time, a different lifestyle,\u201d Griffin pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re all indignant now about injustice, but you didn\u2019t live back then. You didn\u2019t grow up in an economy of cotton and sugar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRich men wanted to stay rich,\u201d Ramsay agreed dryly.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s being Marshall Donegal today?\u201d Charles asked.</p><p>\u201cThat would be me,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cI\u2019ve done it the past five years.\u201d He was quiet a minute; he had done it since Ashley\u2019s father had passed away. \u201cAshley could don a uniform herself, but she thinks we boys should just be boys. So I get the honor.\u201d</p> <p>Ramsay was trying to move quickly past the mention of her father, Ashley knew. He had been gone five years now; he had died shortly after her mother. She had accepted their loss\u2014and she knew as well that there would still be a little core of pain when she thought about them, even if she lived to be one hundred. Inwardly, she winced. She hadn\u2019t just lost her father that day; that had been the end of her and Jake. Her fault, her call, and she still wasn\u2019t sure why. He had frightened her, she thought. It seemed he had scratched the surface of something, and she didn\u2019t want to know what was beneath. And still, to this day, she knew that although she had closed the door, she missed Jake. And missing Jake had colored everything else in her life.</p><p>\u201cHe died,\u201d Charles reminded him. \u201cMarshall Donegal was killed, you know,\u201d he added quickly.</p><p>\u201cWell, as we\u2019ve said, the war is long over, so I guess they\u2019re all dead now anyway,\u201d Ramsay pointed out.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Ashley said, speaking at last, \u201cI want you all to know that you are greatly appreciated. You\u2019re all such wonderful actors, taking on whatever role is needed, whenever it\u2019s needed! Charles, the Yankees are great guys. Michael Bonaventure lives in town, and his ancestors lived there as well, right in the heart of the French Quarter. His family left when the war started, because Bonaventure\u2019s ancestor was fighting for the Union. Hadley Mason is from Lafayette, but his ancestors agreed with the Northern cause as well. It will be fun for you to be a Yankee. It\u2019s acting, just like when we act out the encampments. And I truly appreciate you taking on the role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe do get all tied up in what was. The way the past still has so much to do with the present! Charles, come on, you\u2019re a stepchild. We all really had ancestors back then who were involved with this thing. You\u2019re welcome among us\u2014totally welcome. But, hey, if I had come in on this recently, I\u2019d be happy just to be a part of it all.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Osgood offered Ashley a weak smile. \u201cSure. You know me\u2014I\u2019m just happy to be here.\u201d</p><p>To Ashley\u2019s surprise, Ramsay Clayton suddenly spoke up again. \u201cCharles, I have an idea. Some of those guys really are my friends. My good friends. I\u2019ll be a Yankee today. You be Marshall Donegal.\u201d</p><p>Charles opened his mouth, stunned, and stared at Ramsay. \u201cOh! Oh, no. I couldn\u2019t take that honor away from you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get killed, you know,\u201d Ramsay reminded him.</p><p>\u201cOh, like you said, they\u2019re all dead now. I just couldn\u2019t\u2014I really couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I think I want to be a Yankee for once,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. You be Marshall Donegal, and I\u2019ll be a Yankee. No arguments\u2014it\u2019s decided. I\u2019ll be a winner for a change!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say!\u201d Charles told him.</p><p>\u201cSay thanks, and let\u2019s get on with it. We have to finish planning this thing,\u201d Ramsay said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be Marshall Donegal!\u201d Charles said, still awed.</p><p>Ashley lowered her head, hiding her laughter. These guys really were like children when it came to the reenactment. They were so dedicated. But it was really good, she reminded herself. They kept history alive. It had been on a trip to Europe with her parents when she had seen the quote that meant so much to her: \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d It was the philosopher George Santayana who had written those words, and she had seen them above the gates of a concentration camp. So, whether history was sterling or not\u2014pitting man at his best and his worst\u2014it was necessary to remember.</p><p>The reenactors did a fantastic job. Although there had been only a small encampment at Donegal Plantation at the time, they recreated a larger one, complete with a medical tent, where surgeries were acted out, officers\u2019 quarters and tents for enlisted men.</p><p>\u201cThis is a right nice place to meet, but we need to get to business,\u201d Griffin said, winking at Ashley.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ramsay, looks like you need to skedaddle!\u201d Cliff teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of here!\u201d Ramsay said, rising. He looked around. \u201cSadly, I do like Cliff\u2019s digs better than being cramped up in an apartment!\u201d</p> <p>Griffin was right: they were in a nice place to meet. The office/living quarters in the stables were extremely pleasant; there was no heavy smell of hay, horses or droppings in any way, since the office had long ago been fitted out with air-conditioning and an air purifier to boot. There were a number of trophies along with books on horses, horse care, tack and maps on the shelves around the old massive desk with its iMac and printer. It was the horse master\u2019s realm. No matter the state of riches or poverty the Donegal Plantation might be in, there was always a horse master. These days, the horse master did more than look after the six horses that remained. He was a tour guide, overseer\u2014though they didn\u2019t grow anything other than a few flowers now and then and a tomato plant or two\u2014and general man about the house.</p><p>Ashley stood and gave him a shove. \u201cOur apartments are beautiful. Get on out of here, and get this all moving!\u201d She spoke with teasing force. \u201cI\u2019m going out to check on the camp setup and see that everything is running smoothly, then get ready. I\u2019ll leave you gentlemen to agree on the final assignments and action. The day is moving on. We need to be prepared to start with the battle at sundown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I hope they got a uniform that will fit me!\u201d He winked. Ramsay was a good guy. He had a small house that had once been a working plantation, but his land had been eaten up over the years. Plantation actually meant farm, and Ramsay had no farmland left at all. He spent most of his time in the city, where he actually was a working artist making a nice income.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off to join the Yankees!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Charles Osgood lifted a hand to Ramsay, and then to Ashley, looking dazed. He was getting the prime role for the day, and he still seemed to be surprised.</p><p>It didn\u2019t mean as much to Ramsay, Ashley thought, watching him as he walked from the stables to the old barn. He was from here; he\u2019d been born a part of it all. He\u2019d played soldiers over and over again, and though it had been magnanimous of him to hand over the role, she wasn\u2019t sure that Ramsay hadn\u2019t decided that being a Yankee might not be that bad a thing for the day. After all, they ended the day with the Pledge of Allegiance and the \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d Even if they did begin it with a rousing chorus of \u201cDixie\u201d!</p><p>She left Cliff\u2019s to make a quick check of the horses. \u201cThank God you darlings don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Yankees or rebels!\u201d she said affectionately, pausing to rub Abe\u2019s ears. She saw that the tack for the Northern cavalry was ready for each of the mounts, saddles and saddle blankets set on sawhorses and the bridles with their insignias hanging from hooks right outside the stalls. Abe, Jeff, Varina, Tigger, Nellie and Bobby were all groomed and sleekly beautiful, ready to play their parts. She paused to give Varina a pat; she loved all the horses, but Varina was her special mare, the horse she always chose to ride.</p><p>Leaving the stables, Ashley paused for a moment to look across the expanse of acreage to the left, where the tents of the living encampment had been set up. She could see the sutler\u2019s stretch of canvas, and she walked over to see who was working that day. Tourists\u2014parked way down the river road\u2014were milling around the goods for sale. She heard children squealing with delight as they discovered toys from the mid-nineteenth century, just as she heard women ooh and aah over some of the corsets and clothing. She saw that a crowd had gathered around the medical tent where reenactors were doing a spectacular job of performing an amputation. The patient let out a horrific scream, and then passed out. Dr. Ben Austin\u2014playing his ancestor, also Dr. Ben Austin\u2014stood in an apron covered in stage blood and explained the procedure. Ben would later be part of the battle reenactment, but for now, he was explaining medicine. Ashley reached him in time to capture part of his spiel.</p><p>\u201cAmputation was frequently the only choice for a Civil War surgeon, and field surgeons could perform an amputation in as little as ten minutes,\u201d Ben told the crowd. \u201cChloroform existed, but it was scarce. The South had alcohol. When the surgeon could, he would do everything in his power to make the traumatic operation easier for his patient, but at major battles, the pile of amputated limbs could easily grow to be five feet tall. There was no real understanding of germs, and more men died from disease than from wounds or bullets. To carry that further, more men died in the Civil War than in any other American war, and more men died at Sharpsburg, or Antietam, as those of you from the North might know it, than died during the D-Day invasion.\u201d</p><p>Ben saw Ashley watching him and lifted a bloody hand. Well, it was covered in faux blood from the faux surgery. Ben knew how to be dramatic. She smiled and waved in return and went on, stopping to chat with some of the women who were cooking, darning or sewing at the living-encampment tents. There were soldiers around as well, explaining Enfield rifles to little boys, whittling, playing harmonicas or engaging in other period activities. One laundress was hanging shirts and long johns out to dry\u2014a nice touch, Ashley thought.</p><p>\u201cWhen the war started, the North already had a commissary department\u2014and the South didn\u2019t,\u201d Matty, the sutler\u2019s wife, was explaining to a group who stood around the campfire she had nurtured throughout the day. \u201cHardtack\u2014dried biscuits, really\u2014molasses, coffee, sugar, salted beef or pork and whatever they could scrounge off the land was what fed the soldiers, and the South had to scramble to feed the troops. Didn\u2019t matter how rich you were\u2014you were pretty much stuck with what could be gotten. There were points, especially at the beginning of the war, during which the Southern soldiers were doing all right. They were on Southern soil. But war can strip the land. What I\u2019m doing here is boiling salted beef and trying to come up with something like a gravy to soften up the hardtack. With a few precious spices, salt and sugar, it won\u2019t be too bad. A few people can taste, if they like! Of course, I\u2019ve made sure that our hardtack has no boll weevils. The soldiers were fighting every kind of varmint, big and small, to keep their own food.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everything seemed to be in perfect order; Ashley\u2019s dreams had been for nothing.</p><p>Except, of course, that the reenactment always made her think about Jake.</p><p>They were due to leave soon, within the next few days, but since Adam Harrison\u2019s group was still in New Orleans, they finished with the training they were doing there, and waiting for the move, Jake had agreed to go wandering around the French Quarter with his fellow newly minted agent, Whitney Tremont.</p> <p>\u201cI must admit, I\u2019m going to be sorry to leave New Orleans,\u201d Whitney said. She stared out toward Jackson Square. \u201cThere was so much paperwork after the Holloway case, it felt like we were picking up the pieces for days at first. But it\u2019s been nice to have this bit of time to get ready for our move, since we\u2019re all taking up residence in the D.C. area. Though, I\u2019m excited\u2014I mean, we\u2019re going to have offices, Jake. Like really cool offices, in a building in Alexandria\u2014with help! A forensics lab! State-of-the-art equipment.\u201d</p><p>Jake grinned. \u201cYes, it\u2019s going to be interesting to get settled in.\u201d</p><p>Whitney grinned back. Her skin was like the caf\u00e9 au lait that sat before them. He knew that the others had thought the two of them might wind up together, but what they had formed instead was a friendship, deep and binding.</p><p>\u201cBut it was good, I think\u2014just being thrown together as freelancers of a sort for our first case. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d she asked. \u201cBut federal positions...though I don\u2019t think we really get to stay in those fancy buildings that often, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re like any other team or unit for the FBI, I believe. The cases come in, and I\u2019m assuming that Adam Harrison and Jackson Crow decide what looks like something we should take on. We\u2019ll get to discuss the situation then. And make the plans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think that any of us could put a case forward?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, Whitney, we are an experiment in paranormal investigations. We\u2019re unique, and I\u2019m sure there are those who will make fun of the \u2018Krewe of Hunters\u2019 unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. Not after the Holloway case,\u201d she said proudly.</p><p>\u201cWe have to keep proving that we\u2019re good at what we do,\u201d Jake said. The name \u201cKrewe\u201d they\u2019d given themselves had begun as a joke, but they\u2019d become a real crew through their passion for the work.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Whitney said, twirling her straw in her iced caf\u00e9 au lait. \u201cIt\u2019s here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? What\u2019s here? Sometimes you make no sense.\u201d</p> <p>That made her laugh. \u201cOnly sometimes? I think that our new case is going to be here. Somewhere in Louisiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to move to Alexandria,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...I just have a feeling. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be going yet. You wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d Jake asked. Whitney\u2019s prowess was with film, sound and video. But she also seemed to have amazing intuition. Of course, they had all been gathered into the group because of their intuition, their ability to solve problems where others could not, but where Angela Hawkins was quiet, finding what she found without much ado, and Jackson would always be the skeptic, Whitney went in wide-eyed, eager for whatever might not be considered normal.</p><p>\u201cFeelings and logic, that\u2019s kind of the Krewe of Hunters motto, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He laughed, but something was knotting in the pit of his stomach. \u201cI think it\u2019s supposed to be logic\u2014and then feelings,\u201d he told her. He gazed idly across the street. The mule-drawn carriages were starting to arrive in front of Jackson Square. An early-morning tour group was forming on Decatur Street. One of the history tours, he thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, good old Jackson, he\u2019s still swearing solving cases is all logic, and we all know that he knows best,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Jake wasn\u2019t really paying attention. He had seen the tour-group leader come out\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure where she had come from. Of course, there were a number of restaurants and bars in the area, and some had been open forever. It was New Orleans. No one frowned if you discovered you were dying for that 8:00 a.m. drink.</p> <p>The tour guide was a blonde woman dressed in Civil War attire. Her bonnet hid her face, but she was tall and statuesque, and he had a feeling that she was going to be an attractive woman before he saw her face. Assured, probably in her mid to late thirties, she moved among the chattering crowd as they waited.</p><p>She was coming toward the sidewalk, politely excusing herself as she did so, but people didn\u2019t seem to notice as she made her way through them, which said a lot for the good nature of the group, since she was wearing a respectable day dress with large hoops.</p><p>She paused when she reached the sidewalk.</p><p>Jake started. She was staring straight at him, and she smiled, but her smile seemed to be very sad. Her mouth moved. He squinted. He wasn\u2019t all that much at reading lips, but it was almost as if he could hear her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting, we need you. Hurry,\u201d he thought she said.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He turned back to look at Whitney.</p><p>\u201cWant to move on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, sure,\u201d he agreed. He stood and left a tip on the table, having already paid the waiter.</p><p>When he glanced up again, the tour had moved on down toward the cathedral. He didn\u2019t see the woman, but they would be walking in the same direction.</p><p>\u201cWhitney,\u201d he asked as they did so, \u201cdid you understand what that woman was trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was the guide for that group that\u2019s ahead of us. She looked right over at us and said something,\u201d Jake told her.</p><p>Whitney arched a delicately formed brow. \u201cFirst, I didn\u2019t see the woman, but I wasn\u2019t looking. And second, if she\u2019d spoken from across the street, unless she\u2019d been yelling, how could I have heard anything she had to say?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>They walked up St. Ann Street, took a pedestrian thruway as they passed by the square, then turned in right in front of the cathedral, where the tour group had now paused.</p><p>The woman wasn\u2019t with them. There was a man in a top hat and frock coat leading the tour.</p><p>Jake stopped short.</p><p>\u201cHey! Hey there, remember me?\u201d Whitney said, nudging him.</p><p>\u201cJust a second,\u201d Jake said. He knew that the man would finish his spiel about St. Louis Cathedral, and then allow the group to take pictures.</p><p>This guide, however, apparently liked to hear himself speak. He added in several personal anecdotes regarding the cathedral, before allowing his group to disperse for pictures.</p><p>When the group finally thinned, Jake approached him. The fellow, in his mid-twenties, saw them coming.</p><p>\u201cThe tour offices are actually on Decatur, sir, if you\u2019re interested in any of our offerings. We do history tours, ghost tours, vampire tours, plantation tours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we\u2019re locals and could do the tours,\u201d Jake said, interrupting him with a pleasant tone. \u201cI\u2019m just curious\u2014why did you all change tour guides at the last minute?\u201d</p><p>The man frowned. \u201cWe didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been scheduled for over a week to do this tour.\u201d</p><p>Jake frowned. \u201cI saw a woman with your group. She was dressed in antebellum clothing, bonnet and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she was probably heading for Le Petit Theatre,\u201d the tour guide said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing several performances of Our American Cousin. She\u2019s a bit early to be in costume for the matinee, but I imagine you saw one of the actresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, thanks,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I just thought she was trying to tell me something,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cIf she was trying to tell you something, wouldn\u2019t she have just done so?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>Jake was irritated by the tone; frankly, he hadn\u2019t liked the man since he\u2019d heard him giving his own life\u2019s history along with the tour.</p><p>He felt Whitney\u2019s hand on his arm.</p><p>He forced a smile. \u201cThanks, thanks for the help,\u201d he said.</p><p>Whitney pulled him along. \u201cJerk,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAss,\u201d Jake agreed.</p><p>\u201cI meant you,\u201d Whitney teased. \u201cNo, sorry\u2014he was a jerk. But come on now! We don\u2019t have any reason to go to the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re going to pass it!\u201d Jake protested.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Jake. You saw an actress, and you thought she had something to say. Without sounding just as jerky as that jerk, it\u2019s true\u2014if she\u2019d really wanted to talk to you, she would have come on over. I don\u2019t want to help you stalk a woman, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to stalk her. I want to know who she is,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>But they did pass right by Le Petit Theatre. He couldn\u2019t help but stop to read the playbill and look at the pictures of the actors in the show.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, God knows, this is New Orleans. Maybe she\u2019s just a kook who likes to dress up in Southern belle attire, though God knows why, the heat can be a bitch. Forget it, Jake.\u201d</p><p>Jake agreed. He didn\u2019t know why it was bothering him so much that he\u2019d seen the woman and hadn\u2019t been able to talk to her.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t true. He did know. There had been something vaguely familiar about her, although he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on what it was.</p><p>\u201cJake? Are you okay?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really. Hey, nothing that car bombs tonight after dinner with the group won\u2019t cure, right?\u201d he said, setting an arm around her shoulders as he led her down the street.</p><p>Car bombs weren\u2019t going to fix anything. He was truly disturbed by the woman.</p><p>Why was she so familiar? Was she real, or was she in his imagination? Had he brought his dream world to the surface, and did he want her to be from Donegal? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was absurd, even for a ghost hunter, to believe that someone from the past was calling out to him, trying to reach him.</p><p>Logic\u2014and then feelings. That was Jackson Crow\u2019s motto. It was only logical that he think about Ashley now, and logical that even after all these years, he wanted her to need him.</p><p>Logic...</p> <p>Somehow, it just wasn\u2019t working. Feelings were taking over. And thoughts of Ashley and Donegal Plantation.</p><p>2</p><p>Ashley surveyed the expanse of the property one last time; everything was going extremely well. Children were playing and laughing, the camp looked wonderful and there were activities going on everywhere.</p><p>She headed for the house. It was time for her to become Emma Donegal and get ready for the evening\u2019s battle.</p><p>But as she walked toward the house, she slowed, paused and looked over at the cemetery. The gate was locked.</p> <p>Still, a creeping feeling of unease swept over her.</p><p>She shrugged it off; a dream was a dream. Good God, she\u2019d dreamed once that she\u2019d kissed Vance Thibault in high school one day, and she loathed him! She hurried on toward the house, trying to forget her unease.</p><p>Her grandfather, Frazier Donegal, was sitting on the back porch. She grinned; he looked spectacular, she thought. Frazier was eighty-three, but he showed little sign of slowing down. Today he was dressed in a frock coat, pinstripe breeches and high riding boots\u2014a pure gentleman of the age with his full head of snow-white, a Colonel Sanders mustache and goatee, and bright blue eyes. She worried about him constantly; his health was good, but he was eighty-three.</p><p>He was really in the mood today, though, she thought. He was sipping a mint julep. He didn\u2019t even like mint juleps.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d he said. \u201cI was starting to wonder.\u201d</p><p>Ashley sat in one of the wicker rockers across from him. \u201cLast-minute details in the stables,\u201d she told him. \u201cCharles Osgood didn\u2019t want to be a Yankee.\u201d</p> <p>Frazier rolled his eyes and shook his head. \u201cIt works, you know, for the property, it works. But why on earth everyone always wants to be on the losing side, I\u2019ll just never know. Did he finally accept his assignment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did\u2014but Ramsay Clayton stepped in at the last minute to let him play Marshall Donegal,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Ramsay cares. It\u2019s all play to him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRamsay is a good fellow. You think he was trying to appear magnanimous in front of you?\u201d Frazier asked.</p><p>Ashley shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s never going to be anything between Ramsay and me, Grampa, there just isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands. \u201cI was just asking about his motives.\u201d</p><p>Ramsay had asked Ashley out the previous year; she had always liked him. He was a good artist, and a handsome man, but she had never felt the least bit of chemistry with him. He had accepted her wish that they just maintain a good friendship. Ramsay had been on the rebound, having broken up with his longtime lover. She wondered if she was still on the rebound\u2014even if she had been the one who had run from Jake.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly believe Ramsay just doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll have fun saying, \u2018Oh, Lord! I had to be a Yankee.\u2019 No, Ramsay isn\u2019t trying to impress me. Griffin even asked me to be his friendly companion for a dinner he had\u2014and I said no. They all understand that the friendships we have are too important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, good for Ramsay. And you\u2014you better get dressed,\u201d Frazier told her.</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019m on it.\u201d</p><p>She rose and walked into the house from the riverside.</p><p>The original architects had taken advantage of the river and bayou breezes when they had built the house. It hadn\u2019t been changed much since the day it had been built. One long hallway stretched from the front of the house to the back, and before the advent of air-conditioning, the double doors on each end had often been kept open. The house had one unique feature: double winding staircases to a second-floor landing that led to the six bedrooms, three on each side of the house on that floor. The stairway to the third floor, or attic, where there were still two rooms that could be guest rooms or let out to renters, was on the second floor, bayou side, of the house.</p><p>Beth Reardon was in Ashley\u2019s room, sitting at the foot of the bed and drawing laces through her corset.</p><p>Her skin was pure ebony; she was tall, regal and beautifully built. But she had chosen to get into the action. She was wearing a cotton skirt and cotton blouse and her hair was wrapped up in a bandana. She gazed over at Ashley. \u201cHey! Time is a-wasting, girl. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettling an argument over who had to be a Yankee,\u201d Ashley told her.</p><p>\u201cYankee. That\u2019s the North, right?\u201d Beth asked. Beth was from New York, and before that, her family had lived in Jamaica. Her accent, however, was all American, and none of her ancestors had been in the United States during the Civil War.</p><p>Ashley frowned.</p><p>Beth laughed. \u201cJust kidding! Come on, I took history classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cYou should be. Let\u2019s get you in this ridiculous contraption. So, people really churned butter in these things? No, wait\u2014your relatives sat around looking pretty while the slaves and servants churned the butter, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, in our family, everyone worked. And I think that everyone had to sweat when churning butter. Most of the time, the plantation mistress had to work really hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupervising?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd making soap and doing laundry and all the rest,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cWell, maybe if you were really, really, really rich you just sat around. We were rich, but not that rich, and if we\u2019re ever going to be rich again, it\u2019s up to you, since I can barely boil water.\u201d Beth had come to work at Donegal as the chef less than a year ago, determined to make the restaurant one of the most important in the South.</p><p>\u201cAnyone can boil water,\u201d Beth assured her. \u201cAnd you cook okay. You\u2019re not great, but, then, you are one hell of a storyteller. Step into the skirts already, I\u2019m dying to see this show.\u201d</p><p>Arranging the layers of clothing that constituted the formal dress of a Southern plantation mistress took some time. They both laughed over the absurdity of the apparel that had been required in Louisiana despite the heat and the humidity. Ashley told Beth, \u201cIt\u2019s worse for the guys. The authentic uniforms are wool\u2014those poor little puppies just die out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, honey, I think I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m the unpaid help for this shindig, then,\u201d Beth told her, grinning. \u201cCotton like this\u2014it\u2019s nothing. And I do love the bandana! Poor Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it really was poor Emma,\u201d Ashley told her. \u201cLots of the soldiers left journals about what happened at the battle. It was only after the war that the rumors about Emma having killed her husband got started. It\u2019s as if someone wanted to sully her name. Of course, nothing that we can find was written about her having been charged with the crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was a different time. Maybe she did the unthinkable. Maybe she took a lover. Maybe even, God forbid, he was a Yankee or a carpetbagger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ashley agreed. \u201cFrom all the family lore, she loved her husband, she was devastated when he died, and she managed to hold on to the property and raise her children here, even though the South lost and carpetbaggers did sweep down on the South. Carpetbaggers were even more despised than Yanks,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey were the people who weren\u2019t fighting for a cause\u2014their cause was just to prey off the vanquished and get rich.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, Ashley was ready, and they headed back to the porch that faced the river. A crowd had already gathered, since the schedule for the day was printed out on brochures that attendees could pick up at the entrance to the property. A high-school student, seeking extra credit in history, was usually given that job.</p><p>Ashley came out to stand next to her grandfather, looking out over the property as she could see it from the back porch. Bright tape in blue and gray cordoned off the areas where the reenactors would move during the events, though they no longer went into the cemetery for the moment of Marshall Donegal\u2019s death and the tactical retreat of the two surviving Union soldiers.</p><p>She found herself staring at the cemetery off to her left again. An odd tremor washed over her, but she quickly forgot it and looked at Frazier.</p><p>\u201cNice crowd today,\u201d he said quietly. Ashley squeezed his hand.</p><p>The small band\u2014posing as the military band that had been part of Marshall Donegal\u2019s cavalry unit\u2014launched into the haunting strains of \u201cDixie.\u201d</p><p>Frazier Donegal began to speak midway through, giving an excellent history lesson. He didn\u2019t shy away from the slavery question, admitting that cotton was king in the South, and sugarcane, and both needed workers. The citizens of the South had not invented slavery; many had clung to it whether, in their hearts, they accepted the injustice or not. Few men like to admit they were wrong or cruel to their fellow human beings. And they had hardly been magnanimous when it meant they would also lose their livelihood. It wasn\u2019t an excuse, but it was history. Then as now, prejudice was not something with which a man was born\u2014it was something that was taught. He spoke with passion, conviction and sincerity, and a thunderous round of applause greeted his words; he would have been a great politician, Ashley thought. Except that he had never cared about politics; he had always cared about people.</p><p>The first roar of close fire sounded from the stables area, and people screamed and jumped. It was all sound and black powder. There was no live ammunition at the reenactment.</p><p>The Yankees, mounted on their horses, rode in hard from the east, dismounting at the stables to use the buildings as defensive positions as they began their attack.</p><p>Ashley went on to introduce herself as Emma Donegal. She told about the beginning of the war, and how her husband, Marshall Donegal, famed for his exploits in the Mexican-American War more than ten years earlier, had returned to the military, raising a cavalry unit for the Louisiana militia that would be ready to join the Confederate army at any time. But federal forces were always spying in Louisiana. It would be the Union naval leader, David Farragut, a seasoned sailor, who would assault New Orleans and take the city in 1862, but before that time, Union forces snuck down regularly to survey the situation and report back on the Confederate forces guarding the city. The battle at Donegal Plantation began when the federal spies who had participated in the bar brawl rode swiftly to the plantation in uniform, hoping to engage the Confederates before they could summon more men. At Donegal Plantation, however, four of the spies died at the hands of the small Confederate force to be found there, and the only Confederate casualty was Marshall Donegal himself, who had succumbed to the onslaught of the federals, killing three before falling in a pool of his own blood. She explained that history longed to blame her\u2014Emma Donegal\u2014but she was innocent. Truly, she was innocent! The world hadn\u2019t changed that much; people loved to talk, and everyone wanted there to be more to the story. There simply wasn\u2019t. She and her husband had been married thirteen years; they had four children they were raising happily together. She was heartsick at her husband\u2019s death and survived her grief only because she had to keep food on the table for her children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, she knew the story like the back of her hand. She told it well and was greeted with wild applause when she pointed across the yard. \u201cThere! It all begins!\u201d</p><p>And thus began the round of shots that made the expanse of land between the stables and the house rich and ripe with black powder. The federals had been traveling with a small, easily maneuvered six-pound howitzer, and in their attempts to seize the property, they sent their bronze cannon balls sailing for the house and ground. In fact, they had missed. At the time, their attempts to use the small cannon had done little but rip up great chunks of the earth. Today, it caused the air to become heavy with black powder.</p><p>\u201cThe Confederates had to stop the attack before the barn, stables and outbuildings could be set afire,\u201d Frazier Donegal announced from the porch, with a microphone, his voice rich and deep and rising well above the screams and shouting.</p> <p>Though there was no live ammunition, the small fight clearly taught onlookers just how horrendous it must have been for men in major battles. As the Confederates and federals fought here with guerilla tactics, Ashley asked the crowd to imagine thousands of men marching forward side by side, some of them able to reload three times in a minute. The carnage was terrible. The Civil War was considered to be the last of the ancient wars\u2014and the first of the modern wars.</p><p>The defenders split, most of the men rushing the stables from the front. But the Yankees had come around the other side, and in their maneuvering they escaped the body of men they had been determined to fight. One of the attackers was killed at the stables; the others made it around to the cemetery, attempting to use the old vaults as shields. But Marshall Donegal had come around the other side, and while his men were held up, he met up with the attackers at the cemetery.</p><p>The fighting originally ended inside the cemetery, but now they ended it just outside, the only difference from that day to this. First, the crowd wouldn\u2019t be able to see any of the action if it occurred there, and, with that many people tramping through, historic funerary art could be destroyed. And so, Charles Osgood, as Marshall, brought down several of the enemy and perished, brutally stabbed to death by bayonets, in front of the gates. The two surviving federal men\u2014Justin Binder and Ramsay\u2014raced toward the stables, whistling for their mounts. They leapt atop their horses and tore for the river road.</p><p>Frazier announced, \u201cAnd thus did the fighting at Donegal Plantation come to an end.\u201d</p><p>They said the Pledge of Allegiance, and then the band played \u201cDixie\u201d and then \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d After the burst of applause that followed the last song, people began to surround the actors\u2014who had remained in the battle positions where they had fallen\u2014as they came to their feet, and they all seemed to disappear into the crowd as they were congratulated, questioned and requested for picture-taking opportunities. Then, at last, the crowd began to melt away, and the sutler began to close down his shop.</p> <p>Darkness was falling in earnest.</p><p>It had been a tremendous success; standing on the porch and watching the crowd ebb, Ashley told herself that she\u2019d been an idiot, letting a dream get to her.</p><p>But, as she looked out, it seemed that the plantation was covered in a mist again.</p><p>It was the remnants of the black powder from the guns, she told herself.</p><p>The mist bore a reddish color. Bloodred.</p><p>The sun had set in the west; it was due to the dying of the day.</p> <p>Whatever the explanation, the entire scene was eerie.</p><p>A breeze lifted, and she had the odd feeling that somehow everything had gone askew and changed, and she had somehow entered into a world of mist and shadow herself.</p><p>\u201cWell, old girl,\u201d Frazier said quietly, smiling as he set a hand on Ashley\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnother wonderful day. Thank you for all your hard work on this.\u201d</p><p>Ashley smiled. Her grandfather was happy. She adored Frazier, and she was always glad when he was happy. She worried about him constantly\u2014driving him crazy, she knew. He had always been somewhat bony\u2014though dignified! But now he seemed thinner, his cheeks hollow. He was old; but a man\u2019s life span could be long, and she wanted him with her for many more years. Now he was smiling, basking in the pleasant glow of the day\u2019s success.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s head into the parlor,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cI think we should probably be there to toast our actors and friends, eh?\u201d</p><p>The family and some friends\u2014including the soldiers for the day\u2014traditionally retired to the riverside parlor for drinks and unwinding.</p><p>\u201cYou go on,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there, I promise. I just want to see that everyone is really moving on.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure Beth has already put out all manner of delicious little snacks, despite the fact we told her that chips would do. I\u2019ll go supervise my liquor cabinet,\u201d he said, wiggling his white brows.</p> <p>She grinned. \u201cYou\u2019d better do that. Ramsay will say that he deserves your hundred-year-old Scotch for being so generous!\u201d</p><p>Frazier pantomimed real fear and then walked on into the house. Ashley was exhausted and ready for a fine glass of hundred-year-old Scotch herself.</p><p>But she left the porch to walk around to the front for one last look. Jerry Blake, one of the off-duty officers they hired for traffic and crowd control, was still out by the road, waving at the last of the cars to get them safely on their way. She lifted a hand to him and shouted, \u201cYou coming in, Jerry?\u201d</p><p>He waved back at her and shouted in return, \u201cNo, thanks! I\u2019m on my way home. I have an early patrol shift tomorrow. See you, Ashley!\u201d</p><p>A minute later, she saw him check that the day visitors\u2019 cars were all gone. Then he headed for his own car.</p><p>The buzz of chatter from inside filled the new silence. She followed the sound to the front parlor, where the reenactors were gathering. Looking around, she had the same strange sense of time encapsulated that she had felt before; none of the soldiers had changed out of their uniforms yet, and she was still in her Emma Donegal attire. Even Beth, who had seemed to get a tremendous sense of entertainment out of the day, was still in her 1860s garb. Some of the men had cigars, and they were allowed to smoke them in the house that night. Only the beer bottle in the hand of Matty Martin, the sutler\u2019s wife, provided a modern note.</p><p>Matty came over and gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cWhy, Mrs. Emma Donegal, you do create a mighty fine party, a mighty fine party! What a day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, Mrs. Martin,\u201d Ashley said, inclining her head regally as a plantation mistress of the day might have done.</p><p>Matty dropped the act for a minute. \u201cOh, Ashley, we sold so much! And I can\u2019t tell you how many people ordered custom uniforms. I\u2019ll be sewing my fingers to the bone for the next months, but what a great day we had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad,\u201d Ashley told her. She walked for the buffet with its crocheted doily and poured herself a Scotch whiskey\u2014it wasn\u2019t a hundred years old, but it would do. Others came up to her and she responded\u2014so many friends, and everyone involved in the reenactment. The men bowed and kissed her hand, still playing elite gentlemen of the era.</p><p>Ramsay grinned when he was near her. \u201cI\u2019d say ninety percent of the fighting men never tasted a good brandy, so I\u2019m sure glad we get to be the rich of the past.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and agreed. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be something if we could have Lee and Grant, and Davis and Lincoln, and show them all that the war created the country we have now?\u201d</p><p>Griffin walked over to them, lifting his glass. \u201cGrant was an alcoholic. A functional one, but an alcoholic. No relation, of course. My Grant family was Southern to the core. Cheers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cynic, Mr. Grant,\u201d Ashley said, inclining her head.</p><p>Griffin laughed. \u201cNot at all. We strive for an understanding of history around here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Ashley agreed. \u201cAnd, historically, many of them were truly honorable people. Can you imagine being Mrs. Robert E. Lee\u2014and losing a historic family home, built by George Washington\u2019s stepgrandson and filled with objects that had belonged to George and Martha? Remember, Arlington was a home long before it became a national cemetery!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers to that, I suppose,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWhiskey, Mrs. Donegal? Why, my dear woman, you should be sipping sherry with the other wives!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a whiskey tonight!\u201d</p><p>Ramsay and Griffin laughed, and she joined them while she listened to her guests chatting. Some of the other men argued history, too\u2014and she saw that everyone involved in the actual reenactment had shown up. Cliff, Ramsay, Hank, Griffin, Toby and John\u2014and the Yankees, Michael Bonaventure, Hadley Mason, Justin Binder, Tom Dixon and Victor Quibbly, along with John Martin, of course, and Dr. Ben Austin.</p><p>Everyone but Charles Osgood. She couldn\u2019t imagine that he wasn\u2019t there. He must have been thrilled to death with the day.</p><p>\u201cHey, where\u2019s Charles?\u201d Ashley asked, interrupting a rousing discussion of Farragut\u2019s naval prowess.</p><p>A few of those close to her quit talking to look around.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since he very dramatically died of his wounds,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cI \u2018skedaddled\u2019 right after and rode out with Justin, before we rode back to take our fair share of the applause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff?\u201d Ashley asked.</p><p>Cliff shook his head. \u201cNo, I was with the soldiers who came rushing in too late when Charles was being besieged by the enemy. I thought he just stood up and bowed when everyone was clapping. I don\u2019t remember seeing him when you and Frazier started talking...or when the band played.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably outside somewhere. I\u2019ll call his cell,\u201d Ramsay said. He pulled out his phone and hit a number of buttons.</p><p>Ashley watched him. She realized the others had already turned away and were becoming involved in their conversations again.</p><p>Ramsay shook his head at her. \u201cNo answer.\u201d</p><p>Cliff cleared his throat. \u201cNot to be disrespectful in any way, but maybe he met a girl and\u2014got lucky.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah for Charles!\u201d Justin Binder said, lifting his glass. He was somewhat tipsy\u2014if not drunk\u2014Ashley thought. Good thing he was staying on the property. The others were all still playacting; they were entrenched in the past.</p><p>They didn\u2019t want to look for someone they obviously believed was just off enjoying his own star turn. But...</p><p>\u201cHe would have wanted to be here tonight,\u201d Ashley said stubbornly. \u201cHe was so thrilled to be taking the part of Marshall Donegal. I\u2019m going out to see if his car is still here.\u201d</p> <p>Ramsay lifted a hand. \u201cSorry, don\u2019t bother, Ashley. He didn\u2019t drive. He came with me. I told him that I couldn\u2019t give him a ride back since I was going to stay at the house out here for a while, but he told me he\u2019d hitch a ride back in with someone. Said he didn\u2019t have to be back to work until Tuesday morning and for me not to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, perhaps a search is in order,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cA Civil War parlor game of sorts.\u201d</p><p>They all stared at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Ashley said, relief coloring her tone. \u201cFind the lost rebel. Beth will create a five-star private meal for a party of four, payable to the man\u2014or woman\u2014who finds Charles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d Beth said. She looked at Ashley. \u201cUm, it will be\u2014sumptuous!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of property to cover,\u201d Ramsay murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe need to organize, then,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIt will be fun. Yankees take the cemetery side, and rebels search out the bayou side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that fair?\u201d Griffin asked. \u201cIf he\u2019s still around, old Charlie would be by the cemetery, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pick scouting detail!\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cYes! Let\u2019s find Charles!\u201d Toby said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check out the area around the oaks out front,\u201d Matty Martin offered. She was watching Ashley and seemed to realize that Ashley was seriously worried. \u201cJohn, you can come with me. It\u2019s mighty dark out there, even with all the lights from the house and the property floodlights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, my dear,\u201d John told her. \u201cThey should have let women fight the war,\u201d he muttered, following her out.</p><p>Hank laughed. \u201cYeah, imagine, mud wrestling at its best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHank!\u201d Cliff admonished. \u201cWar is always a serious affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course it is,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWar is very serious\u2014but we\u2019re not at war. We\u2019re playing a game. We\u2019re looking for old Charles. Hey, Ashley, if no one wins...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at some point, we\u2019ll just all have dinner,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Beth muttered to her. \u201cNow I get to cook for all of them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that I\u2019ve got the bayou side!\u201d Toby Keaton said. \u201cBorders my property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the cemetery,\u201d Frazier said.</p> <p>\u201cYou will not. It\u2019s dark and dangerous in there,\u201d Ashley told him.</p><p>\u201cNot for me, dear. It\u2019s memories for me,\u201d he said softly, and quickly turned away. Neither of them wanted to think about Ashley\u2019s parents, entombed in the majestic family vault.</p><p>\u201cGrampa, please\u2014you need to be here as everyone returns,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the cemetery,\u201d Ben offered. \u201cI\u2019m really familiar with the living and the dead,\u201d he added and winked. \u201cJust give me one of the big old flashlights at the back door. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Ben would be fine. He was a big, strapping man in his mid-forties. Besides, he\u2019d attended funerals for both her parents and knew the cemetery well.</p><p>Ashley wanted to take the cemetery herself; that dream had to have been a sign.</p><p>No, that would be insane. Ben knew what he was doing. She wasn\u2019t going to let a dream dictate what she did in her life.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so where are we going?\u201d Beth asked Ashley.</p><p>\u201cThe stables?\u201d Ashley suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you and stand there, but I\u2019m not going near the horses!\u201d</p><p>An hour later, they had finished the actual search as best they could in the night.</p><p>Ramsay went to speak with the guests who were staying in the rooms that had been the old stables, and the Yankee contingent spoke with those in the other outbuildings. Cliff went to his office, wondering if Charles might have slipped in there to rest.</p><p>They all searched, from the river to the road, from the sugar fields to the bayou, but there was no sign of Charles Osgood. By midnight, all the searchers were back at the house.</p><p>\u201cAshley, really, he must be out somewhere else,\u201d</p><p>Cliff told her.</p><p>She looked at Ben. \u201cYou searched everywhere in the cemetery? There are so many paths, little roads between all the vaults.\u201d</p><p>Ben sighed. \u201cAshley, I searched. But we can all take another look.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat was actually not a suggestion,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll go myself,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help,\u201d Ramsay said, tugging at Cliff\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve still got the key, so I\u2019ll come, too,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>Ashley led the way, wondering why she thought that she\u2019d really find Charles in the cemetery, just because she\u2019d had a dream.</p><p>But she was determined.</p><p>Ben opened the lock on the gate, though, of course, they could have all crawled over the stone wall.</p><p>Ashley headed straight for her family tomb. The real Marshall Donegal had died there.</p><p>The last interment had been her father\u2019s. The usual little pain in her heart sparked\u2014it always came when she thought about him, and her mother. And tonight, especially, she missed Jake.</p><p>There was no sign of Charles there, and no sign that he had been there.</p><p>She almost fell, she was so relieved.</p><p>The tomb glowed white beneath the gentle touch of the moon, dignified in its decaying majesty. She heard the three men calling to one another from different sections of the graveyard, and she followed a voice to reach Cliff. He looked at her. \u201cAshley, Charles left. Whether he was spirited away by aliens or not, I don\u2019t know. But he isn\u2019t here. This isn\u2019t any parlor game, is it? You\u2019re really worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Did you go in the chapel?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou think that Charles is hiding in the chapel? Or kneeling down, still thanking the good Lord for the chance to be Marshall Donegal?\u201d Cliff asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cliff?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. He walked around the ell that would lead them to the chapel, in the far corner near the embankment of the river. The chapel had carved oak double doors, which creaked when he opened them. He fumbled for the light switch, and light flared in the lovely little place with its stained-glass windows, marble altar and old mahogany podium.</p><p>The place was empty.</p><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d Cliff asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t help it\u2014I\u2019m worried,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d</p><p>They walked back to the house, where the others were still milling on the back porch\u2014many of them having retrieved their drinks.</p><p>\u201cSo, the bastard did get lucky!\u201d Ramsay said, laughing. \u201cHell, if I had foreseen that, I\u2019d have had him play Marshall Donegal a couple of years ago!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call the police,\u201d Ashley said, looking at her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been missing just a few hours,\u201d Beth pointed out. \u201cHe might have thought that he said good-night to everyone. There\u2019s so much confusion going on when the fighting ends. I mean, I thought it was amazing\u2014it really was living history. But it\u2019s mass confusion. I can only imagine a Gettysburg reenactment.\u201d</p><p>Ashley realized that everyone was staring at her\u2014skeptically. They had searched and searched, and grown bored and tired. But she couldn\u2019t help her feelings of unease, even while they all stood silent, just staring at her.</p><p>The river breeze brought the chirp of the chickadees\u2014her senses were so attuned to her home area that somewhere, distantly, down the bayou, she thought she could hear an alligator slip into the water. This was her home; she knew these sounds.</p><p>They were normal; they were natural. But the sounds of the darkness weren\u2019t reassuring to her now.</p><p>\u201cGrampa, I think we need to report this to the police,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cGreat. He\u2019s probably at some bar in the big city, bragging about the fact that he got to play Marshall Donegal today,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll drag him out and he\u2019ll act like a two-year-old again.\u201d</p><p>Frazier stared at Ashley and nodded. If she wanted to call the police, they would do so.</p><p>The parish police were called, and Officer Drew Montague, a nice-enough man whom Ashley had met a few times over the years, took all the information.</p><p>\u201cYou say you all saw him just a few hours ago?\u201d he asked. Montague had a thick head of dark hair and eyebrows that met in the middle.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that he\u2019s actually missing? Perhaps there\u2019s a woman involved. Is he married? Look, Miss Donegal, you know that we appreciate everything that you do for the area, but...we\u2019re talking about a grown man who has been gone just a few hours,\u201d the officer said.</p><p>\u201cHe was proud of the role he was playing. He would have stayed,\u201d Ashley insisted.</p><p>Officer Montague shifted his weight. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve taken the report, and I\u2019ll put out a local bulletin to be on the lookout for him, but he\u2019s an adult. An adult really needs to be gone for forty-eight hours before he is officially missing.\u201d</p><p>Frazier spoke before Ashley could. \u201cAnything you can do will be greatly appreciated. We\u2019re always proud that the parish is about people, and not just red tape and rules.\u201d</p><p>Montague nodded. \u201cRight. Well, I\u2019ll get this moving, then. We\u2019ll all be on the lookout for Mr. Osgood.\u201d</p><p>Ashley thanked him. The others had remained behind, politely and patiently waiting. Now it was really late, and once again there were a number of weary men and women\u2014all still in Civil War\u2013era attire\u2014staring at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Officer Montague left, mollified by Frazier Donegal over the fact that he had been called out on a ridiculous mission.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ashley said to the others. The evening had started out as a party and turned into a search committee.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cliff said, grinning, \u201cI don\u2019t have far to go home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying in the stables anyway, kid,\u201d Justin Binder told her. He had played a Yankee, and happily. His family hailed from Pennsylvania.</p><p>Griffin laughed and gave her an affectionate hug. \u201cYou made me sober up, which is good. I am driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d John Ashton said. He held her shoulders and kissed her cheek. \u201cCharles is just fine. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>She thanked them all and said good-night, and they drifted away, some to the old outbuildings where they were staying, and some to their cars, parked in the lot out front and down the road.</p><p>She stood on the porch with Beth and her grand-father. She couldn\u2019t tell whether they thought she was being ridiculous or not, they were both so patient.</p> <p>Beth gave her a kiss on the cheek and said, \u201cWe still have about sixteen guests, and the household. I\u2019ve got to get up early to whip up our spectacular plantation breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Ashley bid her good-night. It was down to her grandfather and herself, and Frazier was going to wait for her to be ready to head off to bed.</p><p>\u201cSomething is wrong. I can feel it, Grampa,\u201d she said.</p><p>He set an arm around her shoulder. \u201cYou know...I have an old friend. I\u2019ve been meaning to call him for a long time\u2014tonight seems a good time to have a chat with him. If Charles really is gone, he may be able to help us. His name is Adam Harrison. I don\u2019t know if you remember meeting him\u2014I see him up in Virginia and D.C. sometimes. He worked for private concerns for many years, finding the right investigators for strange situations. Then the government started calling him, and his projects were all kind of combined for a while, civilian and federal. But he\u2019s got a special unit now, and he\u2019s got federal power behind him on it. His people are a select group from the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI. I\u2019ll give him a call. We\u2019ll get someone out here to help by tomorrow. And if Charles turns up, no harm done.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head. Adam Harrison. She knew the name. His unit had been involved in solving the death of Regina Holloway\u2014it had been all over the media because she was a senator\u2019s wife. And she knew, too, that Jake Mallory was part of that unit. She might not be a part of his world, but she hadn\u2019t been able to miss it when she\u2019d seen his name in the papers. She had broken off something that had been real with Jake, because he had terrified her...because he was certain that he had spoken with her father, after he had died. And now....</p><p>Now Frazier was going to call Adam. Of course, it could come to nothing. She was panicking over a missing man because of an equally irrational dream.</p> <p>She looked out on the beautiful expanse of their property. The river rolling by. The moon high over the clouds. The vaults in the cemetery silent and ghostly and opalescent in the pale glow of night.</p><p>Jake, I\u2019m so...scared.</p><p>Something was wrong. It was the oddest thing; she felt that she really understood the expression I feel it in my bones. Something wasn\u2019t right about Charles\u2019s disappearance, and she knew it.</p><p>It was almost as if the past had truly merged into this eerie and haunting reality, and the collision of time here was not going to go away.</p><p>Interlude</p><p>He\u2019d known for a long time what he\u2019d had to do. The voice had been telling him for years.</p><p>At first, of course, he had ignored it. The vision he\u2019d seen of the past hadn\u2019t been real. But then he\u2019d known. He\u2019d known who he was, and he\u2019d come to know that the voice wouldn\u2019t go away until he\u2019d done what needed to be done. And he\u2019d carefully planned it all out, though things had gone a bit strangely today. Didn\u2019t matter, though, who was playing Marshall Donegal. It didn\u2019t matter at all. Because, of course, an actor was just an actor.</p><p>It was Donegal Plantation itself that needed to repay the old debt. That old debt could only be repaid one way.</p> <p>With blood.</p><p>God bless a crowd. There was nothing in the world like mayhem, nothing like hundreds of witnesses to pull off an escapade such as he had planned, and to do it perfectly.</p><p>There had been a horde surrounding them. One particular brunette was the right age, exceptionally pretty and with a Massachusetts accent. When she spoke, there was an r on the name Linda, and there was no r on the car she had \u201cpahked\u201d down the river road.</p><p>She had giggled when she spoke to Charles, so it was easy to whisper in the man\u2019s ear in his moment of greatest achievement and convince him that the girl was waiting to meet him.</p><p>And in the madness surrounding everyone engaged in the action then, it was easy enough to meld into the crowd himself, and to swiftly disappear, and hurry to the river road.</p><p>And there was Charles.</p><p>He\u2019d approached Charles with a smile.</p><p>And, of course, Charles was smiling as well. At least he would go in a state of sheer happiness. It might even be a kindness. How many people got to die that happy?</p><p>Poor, dumb Charles\u2014he never suspected a thing. After the initial whack, he never even felt the prick of the needle.</p><p>He\u2019d thought it all out, exactly where he\u2019d send Charles, because it all had to be done in plain sight. In plain sight, people never really knew what they saw.</p><p>There were tourists heading to their cars. But they\u2019d never notice two fellows in uniform chatting by a car. Not at an event like this. People liked to dress up.</p><p>Maybe everyone wanted to be someone else, someone they weren\u2019t.</p><p>But to them, it would just appear that they were two cronies, faces covered by their broad-brimmed hats, leaning against one another as they chatted and laughed over a joke.</p><p>Then...hide the body. Or if he had been seen, \u201chelp\u201d an inebriated friend into a car.</p><p>He would need more time for the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. Initially, it had taken him less than twenty minutes to stash Charles and rejoin all those rejoicing over the day.</p><p>He had never felt more victorious. The difficult part, of course, would be to hide his anticipation for all that was destined to follow.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem that anything could go so impossibly well.</p><p>Ashley, damn her, though. Leave it to Ashley to be worried about Charles! Still and all, it did make the entire plan more exciting. Now, with the evening at a close, he was feeling elated.</p><p>The place had settled down; though everyone had been willing to look for Charles, only Ashley had been really concerned. He had played with the idea of actually disposing of poor old Charles immediately, but now he was satisfied that he had decided he should make it something more dramatic\u2014and allow time between the reenactment and the beginning of the end.</p><p>Oh, he had worked with the others. He had searched so hard. There might have been just a few minutes when he feared someone would actually search the cars, but Charles hadn\u2019t driven.</p><p>It had almost been as if he\u2019d been part of the plan.</p><p>Now he sat next to good old Charles.</p><p>This was necessary. The voice had said that it had to be done, and his ancestor made him know that nothing could be right until then.</p><p>He\u2019d never realized that he\u2019d enjoy it all so much.</p><p>He patted him on the back. Charles didn\u2019t move. The drug was holding, but he\u2019d administer more. He didn\u2019t want the big lug waking up.</p><p>He needed him alive until the time was right.</p><p>Every time he\u2019d been at Donegal recently, he\u2019d felt as if he were being pushed harder and harder. The past was the past\u2014so they all said. But it wasn\u2019t. The past created the present, and he knew now that he had to use the present to set the past right. It wasn\u2019t crazy; he\u2019d heard the voices in his head. A collective consciousness that seemed to scream through history.</p><p>Now, maybe, the voices would stop.</p><p>3</p><p>Car bombs didn\u2019t exactly do it for him, but Jake indulged in a few anyway.</p><p>\u201cCheers!\u201d Jenna said, dropping her shot glass into her Guinness, and swallowing down the mixture.</p><p>\u201cCheat!\u201d Will said to Whitney. \u201cYou poured your shot in\u2014you just drink the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you drink it your way, and I\u2019ll drink it mine!\u201d Whitney protested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing it the Irish way,\u201d Will said, looking to Jenna for help.</p><p>\u201cDrink it however you like!\u201d Jenna said, smiling sweetly at Will.</p><p>There was a small room in the back of the bar, and Jake, Will Chan, Jenna Duffy and Whitney Tremont had it to themselves that night, so it was nice. Jackson Crow was back at the hotel with Angela Hawkins. They\u2019d all just met for the first time on the Holloway case, and Jackson, the skeptic, had quickly fallen in love with Angela\u2014despite their different approaches to their work. Go figure. The entire team respected and admired them both, and they were glad that the two were indulging in some quality time together.</p><p>And for Jake, it felt good to be in the bar with his coworkers.</p><p>During the Holloway case, they had gotten to know one another. Will and Whitney were excellent with cameras and sound systems; Jenna was a registered nurse, something that could always come in handy when traipsing through strange landscapes and old buildings. His own expertise was computers\u2014and computer hacking. He could usually find any piece of information on any site, public, private or even heavily coded. Yet they\u2019d all had certain unusual experiences in life that had led them to being excellent investigators\u2014and, together, able to discern deeper, darker undercurrents to the event they researched. Now, they also had badges. After the Holloway case, it had been deemed that they would continue to work together, and they would do so with all proper credentials as FBI agents.</p><p>\u201cNow, quit whining over the way a woman drinks her drink,\u201d Jenna said and turned, leaning an elbow on their table, to talk to Whitney. She had brilliant green eyes and red hair, and a smile that could melt ice. \u201cI want to know what else I\u2019ve missed. The World War II museum, the Civil War museum, plantations, the zoo...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShall we have another drink?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>But before Jenna could answer, they all heard their phones buzz.</p><p>\u201cText from Jackson,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p> <p>\u201cMeeting in the morning,\u201d Jenna said, the slight Irish lilt in her voice grave.</p><p>\u201cHmm.

After they parted, Jake sat up a very long time.</p> <p>It became morning at last. Ashley didn\u2019t feel as if she\u2019d slept at all. The dreams continued to plague her, only now she was Emma Donegal, leaving the house in the aftermath of the battle to find the bloody body of her husband. And when she woke herself from the dream, she could have sworn that deceased Confederate soldier was sitting in the wingback chair by the doors to the second-story wraparound porch. She was more tired from being in bed than she was from being awake.</p><p>A shower helped revive her a little. Dressed and ready for the day, she headed down to the kitchen. Once it had been a gentleman\u2019s den, and then it had been an office, and then, when it was no longer deemed necessary to have the main kitchen in an outbuilding, it had become a wonderful, bright kitchen. The walls were a pale yellow. There was a center granite worktable with stools around it, and suspended racks that held several dozen shining copper cooking utensils. A breakfast nook held a table that sat eight.</p><p>Beth was just pouring milk from a carton into serving pitchers. \u201cCoffee is on. None of the guests have made it in yet,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for breakfast?\u201d Ashley asked.</p><p>\u201cDown-home comfort food this morning,\u201d Beth said. \u201cCorn bread, blueberry muffins, bacon and cheese omelets, and country cheese grits. Want to grab a plate and eat before it starts getting crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Ashley said. She watched as her beautiful friend made art out of an omelet and shook her head as Beth handed her the plate full of light, fluffy eggs.</p> <p>\u201cGrits are in the bowl, corn bread is sliced and in those baskets,\u201d Beth said.</p><p>Ashley helped herself. \u201cI\u2019m going to waddle across the lawn soon,\u201d Ashley told her.</p><p>Beth grinned. \u201cI doubt it. You\u2019re too fond of those awful creatures out in the stables. You get plenty of exercise.\u201d She shivered.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re afraid of horses.\u201d Ashley laughed.</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014one of the bastards bit me when I was a child!\u201d Beth said.</p><p>\u201cWell, ours won\u2019t bite you. You should try riding Tigger. She\u2019s a twenty-year-old sweetie. She moves like an old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she may be crotchety as one, too,\u201d Beth said. \u201cNo, honey, you stick to your horses, and I\u2019ll stick to cooking.\u201d</p><p>Ashley dutifully bit into her omelet, and it was delicious. As she was finishing, guests began to stream by her, heading in for breakfast or stopping to clear their tabs. They\u2019d be down to eight guests that night; the reenactment had taken place on a Sunday, and many of those who came for the reenactment managed to take off the Monday if they had a regular workweek. By Monday night, they were usually down to just a few guests.</p> <p>She heard Frazier speaking with people on the other side of the stairway, his tone rich and filled with humor as he told old family tales and pointed out certain portraits on the walls.</p><p>Ashley took her place at the desk to fill out the registry and books\u2014by hand; people actually signed her guest book, and she wrote personal thank-yous\u2014and then could have sworn that someone had approached her. She looked up, but she was alone. For a moment, her brows knit in consternation, but people milled throughout the lower level of the house now and any one of them might have stopped nearby. She gave her concentration back to the project at hand.</p><p>She heard a throat being cleared then, and looked up\u2014this time, someone was there. Justin.</p><p>He sat in the one of the period wingback chairs that faced the desk.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAre you checking out? I thought you were staying a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am staying another few days, Ashley. I just stopped to see how you\u2019re doing,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She liked Justin. At forty, he was a widower, though years before, he had brought his wife with him, and she had played at being a camp follower\u2014with great relish. They had been married for years before he had lost her to cancer. But Justin still came.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks. Nancy\u2019s got the girls?\u201d His mother-in-law, Nancy, now came along to help Justin with his ten-year-old twin girls. Hard to be a \u201cfighting federal\u201d and keep an eye on twins.</p><p>\u201cYes. Any word on Charles?\u201d</p><p>She set her pen down. \u201cNo. But I haven\u2019t tried calling anyone this morning. Everyone on that search party last night is weary of me torturing them, so... If he\u2019s been found, I\u2019ll be called right away.\u201d</p><p>He reached across the desk and put his hand on hers, giving a comforting squeeze.</p><p>\u201cAshley, you are part of the charm of this place.</p><p>You really care. None of us thinks you were torturing us. I was thinking of taking the family for a horse ride later, and I know that Cliff does a lot of the riding tours, but I thought you and I could make another search of it, too.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised. \u201cSure! And thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeanine and Meg don\u2019t ride well. They don\u2019t get a chance to go riding often enough. You still have two horses calm as the Dead Sea, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNellie is our sweetest. And Tigger is a good old girl if I\u2019ve ever known one. Nellie loves him, so they\u2019re great on a ride together. They\u2019ll be perfect for the twins.\u201d</p><p>Justin grinned and stood. \u201cNancy\u2019s bringing the crew in for breakfast. Say an hour or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours will work for me.\u201d</p><p>Justin thanked her. She finished with paperwork and realized she was constantly looking up, certain that she was going to see a Confederate soldier staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in ghosts,\u201d she reminded herself. But saying the words out loud sounded defensive. \u201cI don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t!\u201d she said to the empty room.</p><p>Irritated with herself, she went out to the stables. Justin\u2019s family would be out soon.</p><p>Ashley saddled Varina and stroked her mane. The farmer they had bought her from when Ashley had been a teen had been an avid fan of Varina Davis, the one and only first lady of the Confederate States of America. Because she had been named Varina, they named Nellie\u2019s last colt Jeff, for Jefferson Davis, the one and only President of the Confederate States. That morning, she and Justin chose Varina and Jeff as their mounts, while she assigned Nellie to the younger, slightly more timid of Justin\u2019s twin girls, and Tigger to the other, while Nancy, Justin\u2019s mother-in-law, was on the slightly more spirited Abraham.</p><p>Ashley took the girls around the paddock a few times, just going over the basics. Justin had been right about their experience, but they were smart little girls with common sense, and Ashley thought they would do well.</p><p>Ashley gave her attention to the girls as they rode around the outbuildings and then toward Beaumont, the Creole plantation \u201cnext door.\u201d The girls were delighted by the ride, waving to everyone they passed while traversing the house and outbuildings area and then concentrating on their father\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s admonitions to be on the lookout for wildlife.</p><p>\u201cAre there alligators?\u201d Meg, the bolder of the twins, demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, by the bayou. But they\u2019ll leave you alone if you leave them alone. We won\u2019t dismount anywhere near the bayou. Now, you don\u2019t want to bring a small-sized dog or even a medium-sized dog out there. They look like dinnertime to the alligators,\u201d Ashley told them. She was listening to the girls; she was looking everywhere. They had searched last night, but it had been dark. Now it was daylight, and, hopefully, if Charles Osgood had come out here and fallen, hurt himself or had some other trial, they might find him now.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a dog,\u201d Jeanine, Meg\u2019s sister, younger by five minutes, said.</p><p>\u201cCan we get a puppy, Dad?\u201d Meg asked.</p><p>\u201cSoon enough,\u201d Nancy said, grinning at Ashley.</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d Meg asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause Daddy is busy,\u201d Nancy answered. Nancy was one of those women who had gone to a beautiful shade of silver-white naturally.</p><p>\u201cWatch for animals, girls,\u201d Ashley interceded. \u201cWe\u2019ll be close enough to see the alligators basking in the sun. These woods aren\u2019t that dense, but with all this land, every once in a while a black bear or a cougar wanders across the road. I know that you see nutria\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are nutria?\u201d Meg interrupted.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the largest rat, essentially,\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d Jeanine said.</p><p>\u201cThe buggers were brought over years ago, in the 1930s, and they\u2019ve multiplied into the millions,\u201d Ashley explained. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a bounty on them, because they can be so destructive. But they don\u2019t hurt people. The animal that you do have to be careful of in these parts is the cottonmouth snake. But it likes water, too, and we\u2019re not going in the water. Animals usually leave you alone as long as you leave them alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch for herons!\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind seeing a cougar,\u201d Meg announced.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re shy, too. But we\u2019ll see what we see,\u201d Ashley assured them.</p><p>They counted seven herons, two raccoons, an armadillo and three owls up in the trees. When they came to the bayou, Ashley pointed out two alligators sunning on the opposite bank. As she did so, she saw that staff members at Beaumont were engaged in their work already. A man dressed in a droop hat, cutoff denim and a dotted cotton shirt was standing by a wagon that showed freshly hewn sugarcane. Another, dressed more like an early nineteenth-century Louisiana French businessman, was giving a tour. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked up toward the second story of the plantation house, where the family had lived. A man was standing there, dressed in a Confederate uniform frock coat.</p><p>Ashley blinked against the light. He looked like...</p><p>Like her ancestor, Marshall Donegal.</p> <p>The man lifted a hand to her.</p><p>Yet when she blinked again, he was gone. Her imagination at work again. Of course, she was still concerned about Charles Osgood. But he was due back to work the next morning. If he didn\u2019t turn up by then, the police would have to get involved at a serious level.</p><p>She realized that Justin was watching her.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Ashley?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. The light is playing tricks, that\u2019s all. I thought I saw a Confederate soldier at the window. Toby Keaton does workshops and tours on the real workings of a sugar plantation over there. We do the Civil War\u2014keeps me sending tourists to him, and him sending them to Donegal Plantation,\u201d she said. Would she have told the truth if Jake were here? Jake, who seemed to know what the dead were saying.</p> <p>\u201cYou have Charles Osgood on your mind,\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cI do. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>They rode along the bayou for a while, and then Ashley led them around the second trail to head back to the house. The girls chattered the whole time.</p><p>Justin nudged Jeff and the horse trotted up next to Ashley again. \u201cI know you were hoping to find Charles,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am worried, Justin, really worried,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll show up. But let him know how worried you were. That will make him feel good,\u201d Justin told her.</p> <p>Ashley offered him a smile. \u201cSure, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Back at the stable, Ashley tried to keep her mind busy, letting the girls help her with the saddles and bridle and tack. She taught them how to groom their horses.</p><p>As she put away the last of the brushes, Justin strode over to her. \u201cGreat. Now Jeanine doesn\u2019t want a puppy anymore. She wants a horse.\u201d</p><p>Ashley laughed. \u201cMaybe you better look into the puppy thing, fast. Of course, there\u2019s always kittens, you know.\u201d</p><p>Restless, she returned to the house, showered again and went down to join Beth, who was planning the offerings for the restaurant\u2019s evening meal.</p><p>Jackson Crow was nothing if not a man of incredible thought and organization; there were six folders on the table awaiting them all.</p><p>Jake and Whitney were precisely on time, but he was the last to slide into his seat at Le Caf\u00e9, the Hotel Monteleone\u2019s bright and charming dining facility for breakfast and lunch. There were other diners about, but they\u2019d been given a table in the far corner, near the windows to Royal Street, and they were certainly far enough from others to carry on a meeting in normal tones.</p><p>Jackson, ever the gentleman, had risen while Whitney took her seat, which meant that Will did, too. They were both tall, and the kind of men who drew attention. Jackson had the rugged, square-jawed history of Native Americans in his face, while Will\u2019s Trinidadian mix of English, Indian, Chinese and African ancestry gave him a fascinating appeal.</p> <p>\u201cThank you all for being on time,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThough I want you all to know that we\u2019re not in an emergency situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is our situation?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, we\u2019d been due to leave here and set up shop in our headquarters in Alexandria. But instead we\u2019re going to stay here, in the area, a few more days,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Whitney kicked Jake under the table. He scowled at her.</p><p>Jackson continued, \u201cThis may be absolutely nothing, but since we were already in the vicinity, we\u2019ve been asked to check out a disappearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not a child?\u201d Jenna asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, a man named Charles Osgood, thirty-eight years old,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAs you may or may not know, Adam Harrison is quite the philanthropist, and he\u2019s friends with a Louisiana legend with whom he\u2019s worked on many committees to improve education in the Southern states, housing reform, storm relief and so on. Apparently, although the local police aren\u2019t terribly concerned, Osgood disappeared right after a battle reenactment.\u201d</p><p>Jake knew; he already knew. There had been the dreams; there had been the woman he had seen when he\u2019d been out with Whitney.</p><p>There had been those images of Ashley calling to him.</p><p>He knew, damn it, knew....</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>Jackson glanced at her, remembered she had spent most of her own school years in Ireland, and explained. \u201cA Civil War reenactment. We do tons of them in this country. Many battlefields are now national parks, and many of those that aren\u2019t are owned by people who don\u2019t mind reliving the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. It\u2019s \u2018living history,\u2019 and a good thing, in my opinion. We learn from our mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, or else you\u2019ll die,\u201d Jenna said. She looked around and shrugged. \u201cSurvival of the fittest. But, yes, they do reenactments everywhere, of course.\u201d</p><p>The others smiled at her tone. Jake felt the unease sweeping through him. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been missing?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cNot even twenty-four hours,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cAre we even sure he\u2019s missing?\u201d Jenna asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to hang in a bit\u2014wait here in New Orleans. You have a day entirely to yourselves. If he\u2019s still missing after this evening, we\u2019ll become involved with the search. Adam is making sure that we\u2019re officially invited in. I have folders regarding Osgood\u2019s situation\u2014when he was last seen, the location and why the people at Donegal are so concerned.\u201d</p><p>Donegal.</p><p>Jake picked up his folder, his fingers feeling oddly numb and too big. When he flipped the page, he felt a sweep of old emotion.</p><p>Donegal. The computer printout offered a beautiful shot of a large and majestic plantation house, complete with sweeping oaks, pine forest, outbuildings, horses in a paddock and the low wall and gates of an historic family cemetery.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need the computer printout. He could see the plantation clearly in his mind\u2019s eye at any time.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>Jackson was staring at him.</p><p>\u201cAdam mentioned that Frazier Donegal told him that one of the team members had a history with the family and the plantation. That\u2019s not a problem for you in any way, is it, Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Jackson was still staring at him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated quietly. \u201cOur families are old friends, that\u2019s all. But I haven\u2019t been out there in ages,\u201d he explained. \u201cAshley Donegal and I spent a lot of time together when we were kids. I saw her at her father\u2019s funeral, and I stayed on a few days after. She was pretty devastated when he died. She\u2019d lost her mom just a few years earlier.\u201d</p><p>We were more than friends. Somehow, he kept his gaze steady as he met Jackson\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Every word he had said was absolutely the truth.</p><p>\u201cThen, be advised, we\u2019re officially on hold,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIf this fellow turns up at work tomorrow, green from celebratory alcohol, we\u2019ll be clear to head up to Alexandria. If not, we\u2019ll start working on the disappearance. Take your folders and read up\u2014we\u2019ll need to be ready either way.\u201d</p><p>The official part of the meeting was over. They all chatted casually and ordered breakfast as the restaurant was about to close for the break before lunch. Jake joined in. But he opted not to go to the World War II museum with Will, Jenna and Whitney, or join Angela and Jackson on a trip to the aquarium with a hop over to the casino. He shrugged off both groups, saying that he had woken early and thought he\u2019d get in some sleep, just in case they were on call.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take a nap.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d never sleep. He didn\u2019t want to sleep.</p><p>He wandered the city, looking for the woman in the historic costume.</p><p>No, he knew exactly who he was looking for: Emma Donegal.</p><p>He didn\u2019t find her, but he hadn\u2019t expected to.</p><p>Ghosts never seemed to appear when they were needed. It was aggravating. They reached out\u2014and then stepped back and disappeared, assuming that they had gotten the living working on whatever it was that they wanted them working on.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you could be helpful,\u201d he said out loud, standing on Jackson Square near the spot he had first seen her. All he received for his effort was a worried glance from a woman passing by. She gripped her husband\u2019s arm tighter.</p><p>It really wasn\u2019t prudent to attempt speaking to ghosts when others were near. They just thought you were crazy or worse\u2014dangerous.</p><p>Had Ashley thought that he was dangerous?</p><p>He stopped for coffee at C.C.\u2019s, then returned to his room, where he did lie down.</p><p>Ashley. Donegal Plantation. The light was fading; night had come.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stand it. He would be crawling the walls by morning. He stood up and looked around at his room. Packing up would take him all of ten minutes.</p><p>He picked up his phone and dialed Jackson. When Jackson answered, he said, \u201cI\u2019m heading out tonight, if that\u2019s all right. If this fellow shows up in the morning, I\u2019ll come right back. Frazier Donegal is not a spring chicken. If they\u2019re worried, I\u2019d just like to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read your folder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing so right now. I\u2019ll pack up and be out of this room in another few hours. I\u2019ll get to the plantation really late, but I\u2019ll give Frazier a call and tell him I\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Just be careful, Jake. If you have a personal stake in this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may be nothing,\u201d Jake reminded him.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not, wait for the team before rushing into danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and finished packing, the same two words running through his mind over and over again.</p><p>Ashley. Donegal. Ashley. Donegal.</p><p>Ashley....</p><p>Interlude</p><p>Nighttime\u2014the haunting time...</p><p>When all the earth was still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And old Charles, while still breathing, was getting a little ripe.</p><p>Unconscious now for over twenty-four hours, he had a certain... Well, honestly, there was a stink about him. The man was still dressed in wool, for God\u2019s sake, and since he\u2019d never had a chance to regain consciousness, he hadn\u2019t managed to handle personal hygiene, and, well...</p><p>But that was all right. He didn\u2019t blame poor old Charles for the way he smelled.</p> <p>With any luck, no one would see him. He\u2019d sail through this, and it would be easy, as easy as luring the man to his car, as easy as that first solid blow against his head, as easy as the injection of the needle into his flesh. Not long now...</p><p>He anticipated the horror when others found the body.</p><p>Of course, when they found the body, he\u2019d be as horrified, stunned and confused as all the others.</p><p>He grunted, picking him up. Damned Charles\u2014the man was no lightweight.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go through the gate, and crawling over the wall with his victim\u2019s dead weight was no easy feat.</p> <p>\u201cYou should have laid off the andouille, fried chicken and Cajun rice, buddy!\u201d he whispered aloud, struggling. He was careful, of course. His shoes were encased in plastic shower caps, and he wore thin latex hospital gloves. Now, well, hell, if someone caught him now...</p><p>\u201cI was by the water, searching for a buckle I lost, and I couldn\u2019t just stick my hands in the muck....\u201d</p><p>That one didn\u2019t fly. Not at all. Not even to him. Didn\u2019t matter. He was near the end.</p><p>He found the right place. Now he needed all his strength and the aid of the broken stone marker he\u2019d made note of earlier. He heard himself grunting with exertion and paused, making sure that he wasn\u2019t sweating\u2014it was all no good if someone could pull sweat off of old Charles. God, he hated contemporary forensics, though he was sure he had studied enough manuals on the subject to make sure that he was doing it all the right way. After all, he had planned this for years.</p><p>Finally, he had Charles where he wanted him. And it was time; Charles was still heavily sedated. He\u2019d never know exactly how he reached the pearly gates.</p><p>He loved his weapon of choice.</p> <p>For a moment, he admired his handiwork. And then he struck.</p><p>His victim never uttered so much as a whimper.</p><p>4</p><p>Ashley opened her eyes. Pale and surreal moonlight flowed through the gauze curtains and into her room, soft and evocative in the night. The white curtains shifted in the breeze. She had awakened in the middle of the night, not at all sure why. There should have been something, a loud noise, a gust of wind, a scream in the darkness, something.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even been dreaming.</p><p>Thank God!</p><p>She was sure that there hadn\u2019t been any kind of commotion or noise. It was disturbing that she was so suddenly wide-awake, with no clue as to why.</p><p>She stood, curious, and walked to French doors that opened out to the wraparound porch, slipped by the hauntingly sheer curtains and out to the balcony, where she held the rail, as she had as a child, and looked over the beauty of the grounds. The moon was a crescent in the sky, and stars sparkled beautifully if opaquely. Rain might be coming, she thought. The ethereal light of the stars and moon\u2014and the large lanterns at the front and rear doors of the grand old house\u2014created a scene of misted and mysterious beauty.</p> <p>So what had wakened her so swiftly and completely?</p><p>\u201cWorry!\u201d she whispered aloud. \u201c\u2018Hmm, Sherlock,\u2019 said Watson, \u2018there shouldn\u2019t be any werewolves out tonight. Werewolves need a full moon, so I believe!\u2019 Oh, God, I\u2019m talking to myself again!\u201d she moaned.</p><p>But\u2014what?</p><p>Charles Osgood was still missing.</p><p>Jake was coming. That was certainly something that had to be haunting her mind\u2014and maybe the mere thought of Jake, in the flesh, had never really allowed her sleep.</p><p>She began to wonder if Charles Osgood was really alive and well, and had returned tonight, wanting to play some kind of demented joke on everyone to prove that he really had been the right choice to play Marshall Donegal. The thought of Charles Osgood running around the property in the perpetuation of some kind of a hoax was irritating\u2014but left her hopeful as well.</p><p>She found herself looking out to the graveyard.</p><p>She thought she saw a light flickering there.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>From her vantage point on the second-floor porch, she could see the ghostly white tombs and vaults, the weeping angels, mournful cherubs, praying saints and all the exquisite mortuary art to be found here.</p><p>She needed to put the nonsense regarding Charles out of her head and start remembering that she ran a business, a bed-and-breakfast and living museum. And, yes, Charles was on her mind, but there were still other problems that could arise.</p><p>Ah, yes, Jake always kept her grounded, and he always had that half smile on his face, the charming light in his eyes, and when he was there, she was whole.</p><p>Somehow, knowing that Jake was coming gave her that strength!</p><p>Brilliant woman! So, push the man away!</p><p>Still, just thinking about him...</p><p>Something was going on out there. It was her property, and it was going to stop. She was sick of wondering what had happened and what was going on. She was going out to discover just what the hell that flicker of light might be.</p><p>Indignant, she turned back and put on the pair of sandals by her bedside, found her white robe and hurried out of her room. She could hear the horses whinnying and neighing, as if something in the night had disturbed them as well. But she didn\u2019t head for the stables\u2014they\u2019d had problems before with local teens thinking it would be great to get high and play in the old Donegal graveyard. And although guests were always asked not to tramp around the grounds after eleven, every once in while they had a ghost hunter who just had to be in the cemetery at midnight or beyond.</p><p>She crossed the stretch of lawn that led toward the old cast-iron graveyard gate. The gate, of course, meant nothing, since the stone wall surrounding the family \u201ccity of the dead\u201d was only four feet tall.</p><p>The gate was open.</p><p>Kids would be kids. When she had been young, she had held some great slumber parties, and her guests had gone into the family cemetery at night, and they\u2019d told ghost stories with flashlights aimed at their faces. But it was her home; her family graveyard. They had never been destructive.</p><p>Perhaps such an old, private cemetery on a property now run as an inn was just too big a temptation for people.</p><p>A few years ago, some young people from the local high school had broken one of the cherubs that had graced the walk near the gate. That might have been an accident; they\u2019d caught the culprits, and the boys had said that they\u2019d been terrified\u2014chased by the ghost of a Confederate soldier. Their imaginations at work, Ashley was certain, and she hadn\u2019t particularly wanted that group severely punished\u2014she was angrier with the teens who had left beer cans, cigarette butts, the tail ends of joints lying around...and had written a bunch of voodoo symbols on the tombs. Once caught, they, too, had claimed that ghosts had chased them out, but in that instance, Ashley was damned sure that the only ghosts had been the spirits they\u2019d imbibed, and the weed.</p><p>She realized how ridiculous she must look, wandering toward a cemetery in a white nightgown and robe; if there were kids there, she\u2019d probably scare them to death herself. The gate was open wide enough to let a body slip through. She did so, careful not to touch it as the old iron creaked.</p><p>Even she, who had lived here all her life, imagined that a cherub ever-so-slightly turned its head to watch her walk by.</p><p>She paused, listening, and realized that she heard only the rustling of the trees, the grand old oaks that stood sentinel along the walls, shrouded in moss. And yet, there seemed to be soft voices in the night. The sound possibly created by movement of the air, the natural settling of the earth and manmade structures as well. Still, it was almost as if she could hear her name spoken softly, urging her on, calling to her.</p><p>But then she heard something that wasn\u2019t the whisper of branches moving or the moan of the soft breeze. It was like a thump or a rhythmic tapping sound, and it was coming from just down the path and to the right, from the large and beautiful vault where her ancestors had been laid to rest. She hurried silently along, wanting to catch the prankster red-handed.</p><p>\u201cCharles? Charles Osgood? Is that you? Show yourself. The reenactments are not a joke! Don\u2019t ruin it all by being a jerk!\u201d Ashley called out.</p><p>She turned the corner and stopped dead, a scream rising in her throat. As if on cue, a drifting cloud un-curtained the moon, and the Donegal family vault glowed in opalescent majesty. Mist swirled at the base. An angel rose high atop the chapel-like roof, hands folded, eyes lifted to heaven.</p><p>The body of a man dangled from the base of the angel, the straps of his backpack caught upon the marble structure, his feet just brushing the ground. His cavalry hat covered his face, and blood, from a series of wounds to his abdomen and chest, streaked down his torso and limbs and pooled at his feet.</p><p>Terror filled her; she stared, blinking. Too afraid to run, too afraid to allow her trapped scream to escape, a confusion of thoughts tearing through her mind.</p><p>For a moment, it was as if her mind hit Pause on the horrible image before her.</p><p>Her home was haunted. This was the ghost of Marshall Donegal, the valiant man who had died there defending his property in 1861.</p><p>If she stepped forward, his head might rise with the hollow, skeletal grin of a man dead more than a century and a half....</p><p>She heard the rapping sound again. It was the dead man\u2019s sword, rapping, tapping, against the tomb.</p><p>And it snapped her out of her paralysis.</p><p>At last, she screamed.</p><p>This man wasn\u2019t a ghost.</p><p>He was never going to grin at her, or anyone else.</p><p>He was real, and he was certainly dead, murdered and in the cemetery, where she now stood alone with nothing at all to defend herself. She closed her mouth quickly, cutting off the sound of her scream.</p><p>She had been right to worry, and to search. She had felt even last night that they had to find Charles Osgood. And now, she had found him.</p><p>But the prank had been pulled not by him, but on him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And it was fresh blood that dripped beneath his dangling feet.</p><p>A killer might still be here, watching from the shadows that melded with the mist in the darkness of the graveyard.</p><p>Donegal Plantation. Few plantations rivaled it. A haunting opaque white shimmer in the moonlight, the building rose up on the bank in all its majesty. It sat before Jake Mallory as it had all his life; a stunning representation of a bygone era.</p> <p>Nowadays, the very circumstances that had defeated those who had lived here long ago were the ones that made the area a place of such amazing history and beauty. The war had scarcely begun when the Union might had throttled the city and parish of New Orleans, and, for miles around the city center, the surrender that had seemed like such a tragic disaster had kept enemy forces from laying waste to the magnificent houses that had been built when cotton had been king.</p><p>He remembered the first time he had come here; his parents were friends with Ashley\u2019s parents. He remembered the first time he saw her, hiding behind her mother\u2019s skirts. She had been five; he had been eight.</p><p>Compare that to the last time he had seen her. The way the light had gone out in her eyes. She had built a wall around her heart and soul that was as impregnable as brick.</p><p>He was still damaged goods himself. He had learned to cope with what he was because of Adam Harrison and the team he had put together in a way he had never managed on his own. Maybe because he had discovered that he wasn\u2019t so strange. Still, the images that lived in his mind would always create a divide with Ashley.</p><p>There had been good times, though. Their parents had played as a team in pool tournaments. Jake and Ashley had come along, played in the various game rooms offered by different venues, shared sodas and snacks. But more than pool had kept them together as friends when they\u2019d been really young. Once, they\u2019d been part of a garage band together; they\u2019d been pretty good at that, too. And when the three years between them had seemed unbridgeable and they spent most of their time within a year of their own age group, Ashley had come to him upon occasion with her dating dilemmas, or to comment on his dating choices. He smiled as he thought about Ashley and remembered the way her lips would purse when she was trying to tell him something. Somehow, someway, Ashley had retained something of the Southern belle in her behavior; the word bimbo would not cross her lips, nor would she tell him that his latest crush was a slut, a tramp or trailer trash, nor would she use any other such derogatory term. The question was always, \u201cSeriously, Jake, is she what you\u2019re really looking for? I\u2019m not certain that her behavior is really...nice. But, hey, you want what you want, right?\u201d</p> <p>Nighttime here really seemed to be a time warp back to the past. Tonight, the house, seen through the veil of oaks that led to the sweeping entrance, seemed to stand guard upon a hill. A soft breeze caused the branches to sway in the ethereal light, and the path to the house might have led right into a different time and dimension. There was nothing to mar the perfection of the picture; whatever cars might have been there were hidden away in the car park, and the view he saw was one of sheer magnificence.</p><p>He drove up the vast and sweeping, oak-lined drive from the road. Once upon a time, the road had been a carriageway, and the rear entrance from the road had not been considered a grand entry at all. The grand entry had faced the river. Some things had changed. The mighty barges bringing cotton downriver were outdated. Still, with the working sugar mill and Beaumont plantations as the nearest neighbors to Donegal, and both a mile away, the view of Donegal, even by night, was spectacular.</p><p>It was quiet when he parked; yet just yesterday there had been hundreds\u2014possibly thousands\u2014of people crawling all over the place, from the reenactors to the visitors who flocked here on the day of the actual reenactment. That thought made him smile as well\u2014in comparison to the real battles that had taken place during the war, the skirmish here had been nothing. But Donegal Plantation had always been home to those who knew how to survive. When Marshall Donegal had been killed, Emma Donegal had raised her son and daughters on her own, and she had kept the plantation thriving, even under Union rule. It was sad\u2014and probably not at all fair\u2014that legend had her as the one to slip out into the skirmish and kill her husband. Her motive was supposedly the fact that she didn\u2019t agree with his management of the plantation, or with the management of their slaves, several of whom he was supposed to have slept with, along with quadroons at the quadroon balls in New Orleans, and the wives of a few of his best friends. Their daughters, too. But those rumors weren\u2019t anything new. People loved to speculate. He knew that neither Ashley nor Frazier believed in the rumors regarding Emma, and he didn\u2019t take them very seriously, either.</p><p>He parked the car directly before the house and got out. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t be out here at all, and the team wouldn\u2019t be on call, if Adam Harrison hadn\u2019t been old friends with Frazier Donegal.</p><p>An inexplicable discomfort settled over him. It was late, of course, and he was miles and miles away from Bourbon Street, where the parties were just hitting their stride. Out here, the world was sleeping.</p><p>Still, he hesitated.</p> <p>Lights in the large old stable building showed him that tourists were still quartered there, and he even saw some light emitting from the smaller stables, still in use, behind the large barn structure.</p><p>The house looked ominously quiet.</p><p>He walked around the side of the house, not certain why he was experiencing such a distinct impression that something was wrong. And then he knew. As he stood there, he saw a figure in white come tearing out of the graveyard.</p><p>For a split second, he was paralyzed. She looked like a phantom, a stunning vision from the past, a gorgeous ghost in a long, flowing white gown, her golden hair caught in the wind.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a ghost; it was Ashley.</p><p>She looked just as she had looked in his dream: a shimmering figure standing upon a roof with the floodwaters rising. She looked as she had looked, reaching out for him and yet trying to warn him of something horrible and dark that loomed behind him. Her fingers had slipped through his...</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let that happen now.</p><p>He raced across the grounds, hearing earth and gravel crunch beneath his feet. \u201cAshley!\u201d he called her name.</p> <p>She stopped; she stared at him with huge blue eyes the size of saucers, like a doe caught in the headlights of a car.</p><p>She still saw him as a pariah.</p><p>\u201cAshley,\u201d he called again. She screamed and started to run away.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t parted that badly. She wasn\u2019t seeing him, she realized. She was still imagining whatever nightmare had caused her to run.</p><p>She turned just as he reached her, and they collided and fell to the ground. She struck out at him from below, and he caught her arms, perplexed and yet aware that she could deliver a solid blow if she chose. She seemed to be fighting for her life.</p><p>\u201cAshley! It\u2019s me. Jake. Jake Mallory!\u201d</p><p>She went dead still. He realized that she was trembling violently.</p><p>\u201cAshley, it\u2019s Jake. Come on, Ashley, whatever else, you\u2019ve known me all your life! It\u2019s Jake. What is it, what are you running from?\u201d</p><p>Her trembling subsided.</p><p>\u201cI found him,\u201d she said. \u201cI found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound who, Ashley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles. Charles Osgood.\u201d</p><p>Dead. She\u2019d found him dead, of course. No one acted like this unless they had seen something really terrible. Certainly not Ashley Donegal.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked, easing back.</p><p>He wanted to fix things for her. This was Ashley. Certainly, one of the most beautiful women he had ever known and once loved. He wanted to hold her and tell her everything would be all right....</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t, of course. She had found a dead man.</p><p>He rose quickly, taking her hand to bring her to her feet. \u201cWhere, Ashley?\u201d he asked again, his tone quiet but authoritative.</p><p>She blinked and seemed to gain possession of herself again. \u201cThe graveyard. The family vault,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he is dead? You\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his cell phone and dialed 911, and carefully gave the address and the situation. Ashley stared at him while he did so. If Jackson Crow was already on the case, then they had federal jurisdiction. But they needed a medical pathologist out here now, and, naturally, they\u2019d have to work closely with the local police.</p><p>\u201cGo on inside,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe police are coming.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m with you. I\u2019m not moving. I mean, I\u2019m not moving if you\u2019re not moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to tell your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s smart\u2014he\u2019ll figure it out when he hears the sirens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he hears the sirens, he\u2019ll be worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with you!\u201d</p><p>He wondered if she was actually so shaken that she was afraid to head for the house herself\u2014afraid, perhaps, of everyone on her property now.</p><p>\u201cAll right, but we need to keep a distance from the actual...scene,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCorpse,\u201d she said dully.</p><p>He walked back to the cemetery. She hadn\u2019t released his hand. She wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>They had to part momentarily to slip through the gate without opening it further, and Jake was loath to make any changes to the scene. A stone cherub seemed to follow their passage through the rows of vaults, shimmering beneath the moonlight.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to ask her to lead him; he knew exactly where to find the Donegal vault.</p><p>It was the largest, the most ornate and the most beautiful in the graveyard. When they turned the corner in the center to reach it, he stopped, trying to take in everything that he saw before the local authorities came to assess the situation.</p><p>There was the vault. Cherubs and gargoyles guarded the iron-gate doors and the four corners of the tomb. High at the front was a life-size angel, and, caught upon its foundation by the heavy canvas straps of a period backpack, was the body of a man. He hadn\u2019t known Charles Osgood, and if he hadn\u2019t seen many a portrait of Marshall Donegal, he wouldn\u2019t have known that this wasn\u2019t a trick of time, that they hadn\u2019t gone back approximately one hundred and fifty years to discover a dead cavalry man in the cemetery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Convenient place to die. Or be murdered.</p><p>But despite the blood that dripped from the body and pooled at the feet, he didn\u2019t believe that the man had been killed here. He had been brought here soon after death, but he hadn\u2019t died here. The body had been put on display. It was evident that whoever had killed the man had done so to be historically accurate\u2014and to make sure that the world knew that a man had been killed just as Marshall Donegal had been killed long ago. Was it an assault on the Donegal family? Or had someone wanted this particular man dead and used the Donegal family history as a means of throwing off suspicion?</p><p>\u201cHe was so proud to be playing Marshall Donegal!\u201d Ashley whispered.</p> <p>\u201cStay here\u2014exactly here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He was afraid that she was going to cling to him, but she didn\u2019t. With him there, she seemed to be finding her own strength.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s a crime scene,\u201d she said woodenly.</p><p>Jake, watching where he walked, searched the area surrounding the tomb. There was nothing there. The graveled paths around the tombs certainly didn\u2019t allow much room for footprints, and he didn\u2019t expect to find any. They would have to hope that the forensic team summoned could find fingerprints, hair, fibers, DNA\u2014anything that might tell them who had brought the man to his death, and then here.</p><p>They could hear the sirens then, shrieking through the night. And then voices as guests staying in the various rental rooms began to rouse.</p> <p>\u201cGet to the cemetery gates,\u201d Jake told her. \u201cMake sure no one but the police comes through.\u201d</p><p>She nodded jerkily yet didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cAshley!\u201d he said, taking her shoulders. \u201cYou don\u2019t want guests wandering in here, and your grandfather will be coming out any minute, worried to death, and he is in his eighties!\u201d</p><p>She snapped to finally and nodded, spinning about in a whirl of shimmering white. He watched her go, his insides twisting in a knot of pain. She didn\u2019t need this; she didn\u2019t deserve this. Of course, the dead man hadn\u2019t deserved it, either. As he heard the sirens come closer and closer, he pulled out his cell phone and dialed Jackson Crow. It hadn\u2019t been so important before that the team arrive quickly; now, it was.</p><p>He looked back at the corpse, and time melted away again.</p><p>Someone had reenacted murder.</p> <p>5</p><p>Ashley stood shivering at the gates of the cemetery, trying to compose herself. She had certainly been in something like shock, but Jake was here, and now she was okay. It was bizarre that she was okay because Jake was here, but that was the way that it was; he was in control, and it brought her back to herself.</p><p>She had felt that she\u2019d been losing her mind; the dreams had plagued her mercilessly, and Charles had been gone, and she had longed to see Jake.</p><p>And Charles was dead\u2014and Jake was here. Really here.</p><p>And she had to quit behaving like a \u201cdumb blonde\u201d screamer out of an old movie. She started to move again, thinking that she had to get to her grandfather.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t get that far.</p><p>The first person to rise and rush out, hearing the wail of the sirens, was Cliff Boudreaux, and he didn\u2019t have far to come, racing out of his quarters in a flannel robe. His graying brown hair was mussed and he was barefoot, as if he had been sleeping. She saw that he first looked back to the house, but then saw her and ran to her instead, gripping her shoulders, his eyes filled with worry.</p><p>\u201cAshley? Ashley, why are you standing here like this? What the hell has happened?\u201d</p> <p>She stared back at him, suddenly more assured, and she was even angry again, furious. Someone had killed Charles Osgood. He could be petulant; he could be whiney; but he was a good man who, to the best of her knowledge, had never hurt anyone.</p><p>She felt all sense of trembling and shaking fade away completely. Yes, Jake had done that for her.</p><p>\u201cCharles Osgood is dead. I just found him in the cemetery,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cThe police are on their way.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she saw that people were beginning to emerge from the far stables, where the rental rooms were.</p><p>\u201cCliff, I\u2019m going to get my grandfather. Please make sure no one wanders into the cemetery,\u201d she said.</p><p>She turned toward the house, noticing Beth and her grandfather had come out to the riverside porch together and looked as confused as anyone else. She broke into a run, crossing the distance from the graveyard to the steps.</p><p>\u201cAshley!\u201d</p><p>Frazier reached out, and she ran straight into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m all right, Grampa, I\u2019m all right. But I found Charles Osgood. He\u2019s...dead.\u201d</p><p>Frazier drew away from her, staring into her eyes. Beth let out a soft gasp but said nothing.</p><p>Ashley continued, \u201cI thought I heard something in the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard something in a cemetery\u2014and you hurried into it to find out what was going on? Lord, girl!\u201d Beth said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived my whole life with the family cemetery in full view from my window, Beth,\u201d Ashley reminded her. \u201cAnd Jake\u2019s here,\u201d she added quickly.</p><p>\u201cJake\u2019s here?\u201d Frazier said, and it seemed to make everything better.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, Jake\u2019s here,\u201d she said, nodding. It might be best to let them think that Jake had been in the cemetery with her from the beginning.</p><p>Two police cars pulled into the front. The driver of the first seemed to hesitate a minute, but then he pulled straight on down by the side of the house, slowly passing the onlookers who had gathered outside. The second car came to a halt by the first. Ashley quickly ran down the steps from the porch to meet the officer who exited the first car. It was Drew Montague, who had been on call when she had reported Charles Osgood as missing.</p><p>\u201cWell, Ashley, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Drew Montague asked her. Behind him a uniformed man got out of the car.</p><p>\u201cI found Charles Osgood. He\u2019s in the cemetery. Someone bayoneted him and hung him on the family tomb,\u201d she said. She spoke to Drew but kept glancing at the other man who had approached them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Detective Mack Colby, Miss Donegal, with the parish sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d he explained. He was so pleasantly nondescript, she wondered whether that was part of his act. \u201cCan you take me to the body and explain, please, how you happened to discover it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woke up after I\u2019d gone to bed. I thought I saw lights out there, and I went to investigate,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou ran into a cemetery in the middle of the night when you thought that someone might be out there?\u201d Mack asked politely. He and Drew exchanged a glance. There was suspicion in his tone, despite the even level.</p><p>She let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cI have lived here forever. My dead ancestors are in that cemetery. I\u2019m not afraid of it!\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst we\u2019ve ever found before has been potheads and frat boys. I am not afraid of my own property,\u201d she said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you should be,\u201d Drew Montague murmured.</p><p>\u201cMontague,\u201d Mack Colby said, \u201ccan you keep people away from the gates? The forensic crew will be here shortly. Miss Donegal, please take me to the body. Did you touch him? Are you quite certain he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead. And, no, I didn\u2019t touch him,\u201d Ashley said. By then, her grandfather was by her side.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said icily, \u201cit would be best if you investigated the dead man without giving my granddaughter difficulty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s right, this is a murder investigation,\u201d Colby said, his eyes narrowing. \u201cAnd you are\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrazier Donegal. We\u2019ve not met, but you\u2019ve surely known that this property was here and who owns it. My granddaughter insisted we call this man\u2019s disappearance in last night, afraid that something bad had happened. None of you seemed interested at the time.\u201d</p><p>More sirens blared in the night; a rescue vehicle came to a halt behind the police cars. Augie Merton, a medical pathologist from the coroner\u2019s office, emerged from the passenger\u2019s seat. He was a nice man; Ashley knew him. He sometimes came out to do lectures on Civil War medicine. Though the former New Yorker had lived in the parish for almost thirty years, he was still affectionately called the Yankee doc.</p><p>\u201cAshley, Frazier, sorry to see you here under unhappy circumstances,\u201d he said, coming forward with his black bag.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, let\u2019s get to the corpse,\u201d Mack Colby said. \u201cLead the way. With any luck, no one has disturbed the crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has. Jake Mallory is in the cemetery, watching over the scene,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>Mack Colby stopped walking. \u201cAnd who the hell is Jake Mallory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old friend,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cA good old boy. Great!\u201d Mack Colby muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with the federal government,\u201d Frazier in formed him.</p><p>\u201cFeds have to be asked in. He\u2019d best not be fiddling around in my jurisdiction!\u201d Colby said.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think he and his team fiddle with cases. I think they solve them,\u201d Ashley said, staring at him. Of course, she didn\u2019t really know much of anything about Jake\u2019s team, but this man was truly patronizing, and she was feeling just as indignant as Frazier.</p><p>Before he could respond, she said, \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley, they can surely find the body on their own,\u201d Frazier said, worried about her and apparently not at all fond of Detective Mack Colby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him. She mentally drew herself up, though it was difficult to do so with dignity when she was running around in a white nightgown.</p><p>She turned quickly, assuming that the men would follow. They did. It was surprising that Beth and Frazier chose to follow as well; she was certain that corpses did not fall into Beth\u2019s usual life. But she didn\u2019t protest; Frazier was proud and would insist on seeing what happened on his property. And there was no stopping Beth when she made up her mind.</p><p>When they reached the gate, Mack Colby said, \u201cStop! Who has touched this gate?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ashley turned to stare at him. \u201cPossibly? Hundreds of people. Maybe thousands. There was a reenactment here yesterday. It was after the reenactment that Charles Osgood disappeared\u2014something that we reported to the police.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long had he been missing when you called in the disappearance?\u201d Colby asked.</p><p>\u201cA few hours,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cYou called in about a missing adult after just a few hours?\u201d Colby asked, his voice level, and yet there was something suspicious in his tone.</p> <p>\u201cHe had very badly wanted to play my ancestor, which he did,\u201d Ashley explained. \u201cHe should have been around to celebrate with the others afterwards.\u201d</p><p>Augie let out a sound of impatience. \u201cWhere is my body, please?\u201d</p><p>Mack Colby lifted a hand, put on a latex glove with a snap, and pushed the gate open to a wider degree. Ashley slipped through, followed by her strange posse: Mack Colby and Augie, her grandfather and Beth.</p><p>Jake Mallory waited at the end of the path, before the turn to the Donegal family vault. Jake had always had a certain presence. His arms were crossed over his chest; he stood with his feet planted slightly apart and appeared formidable and authoritative as he stood there. Part of it was his height. He wasn\u2019t particularly heavily built, but his muscles were toned, his stance was straight, and, when he moved, it was with a swift agility one might not expect in a man so tall. He wasn\u2019t easily ruffled, and his temper seldom stood in the way of his intentions.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the fed, huh? Did you touch anything?\u201d Mack Colby demanded. \u201cAnd what the hell kind of federal officer are you?\u201d</p> <p>Jake remained calm as he reached into the pocket of his jeans for a slim leather wallet, which he opened and presented to Mack Colby. \u201cAgent Jake Mallory,\u201d he said. Colby frowned, stepping forward to examine the credentials Jake had offered. His frown didn\u2019t disappear as he stepped back.</p><p>\u201cHow did you happen to be in the area?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAnd you do understand the concept of local jurisdiction? You have to be invited down if we have a problem, and I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll have a problem here. We\u2019re capable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are capable. I\u2019m a friend of the family. I happened to be on my way to the house. My boss is a friend of the Donegal family as well, and Frazier Donegal called him when Ashley was first worried about the disappearance of one of their reenactors. If you\u2019ll check with your superiors, we have been asked to join in the investigation. Of course, we were looking for a missing man before. Now, we\u2019re looking for a killer,\u201d Jake said evenly.</p><p>Colby wasn\u2019t satisfied; his gaze remained fixed on Jake.</p><p>Augie cleared his throat. \u201cMay I get to the body, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minute, Augie,\u201d Colby said. \u201cThey found a corpse\u2014a man obviously not in need of an ambulance. I want the crime-scene people in here\u2014I want pictures of the body in situ. I want every fiber, hair, fingerprint. And I want all the rest of you people out!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDetective, I\u2019d like to stay,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Mack Colby grunted. \u201cLet me tell you\u2014this parish has amazing forensic facilities. And we\u2019re not a bunch of local yokels just because we\u2019re in bayou country. You like to come down here from the big cities and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Louisiana,\u201d Jake interrupted. \u201cI was born and raised in Orleans Parish.\u201d</p><p>Mack Colby paused at that. He lifted his hands. \u201cFine. You stay.\u201d He turned around and looked at Ashley, Frazier and Beth. \u201cAll right. The rest of you\u2014out!\u201d</p><p>Ashley looked at Jake. He gave her a small, reassuring smile. Despite the fact that she was standing in her family graveyard with a dead man not far away in the middle of a bizarre night, she did feel reassured. In fact, she wanted to run to him. The breeze lifted her hair and touched her face, and she kept eye contact with him. Jake Mallory had always been steady and reassuring\u2014when they were kids, when he teased her, when he taught her how to hold a cue stick, when he played his guitar and patiently went through a melody or a beat over and over again.</p><p>When he made love to her....</p><p>She had still thought that it would be awkward to see him again. They had been so close for so many years, friends and then lovers, and she had shut him out as cleanly as if she\u2019d shut a door in his face.</p><p>Nothing like a dead man to ease the transition into seeing one another again, she thought dryly.</p> <p>The thought brought a rumble of something that threatened to be hysterical laughter from her throat, and she swallowed it down quickly.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Colby repeated. \u201cGood God, it\u2019s a crime scene!\u201d</p><p>She nodded, turned and said to Beth and her grandfather, \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my property,\u201d Frazier said to Mack Colby.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am a law-abiding citizen, a veteran of foreign wars, and, Detective Colby, I will be kept informed of what has happened and is happening on my property. I asked Agent Mallory and his team down\u2014he is here on my request.\u201d</p><p>Frazier had said his piece. He turned to Ashley and nodded.</p><p>As they departed, a trio dressed in the parish\u2019s crime-unit jumpsuits paused for a moment to ask the way to the scene. Ashley indicated the path through the vaults with their decaying elegance and hurried on out.</p><p>More officers were on crowd control; two in uniform, flanked by Drew Montague.</p><p>\u201cSomeone want to talk to that group?\u201d Drew asked them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, Grampa,\u201d Ashley said, hurrying forward.</p><p>One woman was weeping. Ashley quickly made her way through the officers and cars with their bright lights and reached the group of guests hovering by the old stables.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, we\u2019ve just discovered a friend, dead, in the cemetery.\u201d She winced. Her words sounded like an oxymoron, though they were not. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you checked out quickly, and please, be assured, no one will be paying for the night.\u201d</p><p>She had to lift a hand against the bright car beams that were now on her. \u201cPlease come through the front door of the main house, and we\u2019ll be sure that you\u2019re completely cleared of all charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to go back to sleep!\u201d one man called out.</p><p>She looked back at Drew Montague. He shrugged. \u201cI guess it\u2019s all right. We had a body in a hotel parking lot once, and they didn\u2019t evacuate the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Anyone who wants to go back to sleep is welcome to do so,\u201d she said, hoping that was the right thing for an innkeeper to say under the circumstances. She didn\u2019t know anything more about crime and murderers than what she had learned on television and the news, but it seemed that someone had killed Charles Osgood and displayed his body in a certain way for a reason. The scenario didn\u2019t appear to offer danger to her guests for the rest of that night, especially since she was pretty sure the place would be crawling with police and crime-scene investigators until daylight and possibly beyond.</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll be safe enough tonight, with the police prowling around everywhere,\u201d a woman said as if following Ashley\u2019s own train of thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d someone else demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything right now,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cThe police are here. I\u2019m sure one of the most important things is that no one goes near the cemetery until the scene is cleared by the police. And, please, of course, be very careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! He was murdered, he was murdered!\u201d Another woman cried out. She was about fifty, in a house robe, and wearing curlers. \u201cOh, oh! We\u2019ve got to get out of here, we\u2019ve got to get out of here!\u201d she cried, running forward and then running back.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Martha!\u201d a man said firmly, stepping forward to grab her arm. \u201cWe have nothing to do with any of this. I\u2019m going back to sleep. We\u2019ll check out in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, all of you, I\u2019ll be at the desk in front. Stay the night, or pack up and leave. Whichever you prefer,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>She noticed that Justin had appeared; he had come out of the stables alone, and she assumed that he had left Nancy with the children. He moved through the crowd and reached her side. \u201cCharles?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She nodded grimly.</p><p>\u201cIn the cemetery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe searched there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was in there myself,\u201d she said dully. \u201cI have to get in the house and start handling this situation. You have the children\u2014I assume you want to get them out of here, and don\u2019t worry, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all right,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about us. You\u2019ve got enough on your hands right now.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and raised her voice. \u201cAnyone who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast!\u201d</p><p>She turned around to see that Mack Colby was striding toward her. He gazed at her impatiently and addressed the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, folks. I\u2019ll need a few minutes with each of you before you pack up and leave. It can be tonight, or into the morning hours, but I\u2019ll need to question you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Martha\u2019s husband demanded indignantly. \u201cWe had nothing to do with this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, and a man was murdered here. He took part in the reenactment, he disappeared and now he has reappeared\u2014dead. You all were here. This is simple, people. Someone killed him, and you\u2019re all suspects until you\u2019re cleared. I\u2019ll need to question every single one of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Martha shouted. And then she dropped to the ground in a dead faint.</p><p>Jake called Jackson, sorry to wake him up, but knowing that Jackson needed to be advised immediately about the situation and the arrival of Mack Colby on the scene.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Tread carefully,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019ll call Adam right now and have him get hold of his congressional friends and make sure they speak with the local officials again. They weren\u2019t interested before\u2014they\u2019d already given us jurisdiction on the case. I doubt if there will be any trouble; Frazier Donegal is a force in this area, so it seems, and his contacts are endless. Do your best to get along with the local police. I\u2019ll pack up with Angela, and we\u2019ll be out right away. I\u2019ll have the others follow as soon as they\u2019ve gotten their equipment together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>He hung up; the pathologist from the coroner\u2019s office had arrived. Jake continued to watch as the forensics team took pictures and combed the area. He remained a bit surprised that Mack Colby hadn\u2019t forced him out when he had finished listening to the pathologist regarding the corpse.</p><p>Of course, there wouldn\u2019t be a final determination until the body had been taken to the coroner\u2019s office for a full autopsy. But according to Augie in his preliminary findings, Charles Osgood had probably been rendered unconscious by a blow to the head\u2014there was a pre-mortem bruise appearing on his forehead\u2014sometime yesterday; death had not occurred until two or three hours ago, when he had, quite simply, bled to death. He had received five stab wounds to the abdomen area, apparently after his inert body had been hung from the angel, the wounds obviously caused by a sharp instrument. His blood had slowly oozed from his body, creating the puddle on the ground.</p> <p>With any luck, the blow to his head had been severe enough to have kept him unconscious until death had come, though, since it had been more than twenty-four hours since he had gone missing, Augie suspected they would find drugs of some kind in his system. It seemed that the killer had been intent on keeping his victim quiet until the act of murder had been completed, but, at the least, he had saved Charles Osgood from the agony and fear that surely would have accompanied his death had he been conscious.</p><p>Jake waited while Augie\u2019s assistants brought the body down, carefully preserving the backpack and the straps that had kept him dangling from the tomb\u2019s majestic angel. Meanwhile the team searched the ground for possible footprints and used specialized lights to seek fingerprints on the tomb wall itself. There were hundreds of fingerprints, so it seemed, and the hundreds were atop more hundreds. In a small way, the Donegal cemetery was a tourist attraction in itself. The gates were usually locked, but the wall was really no obstacle, and someone might have forgotten to lock up again.</p><p>Jake wished them well. It was going to be a difficult and long haul, trying to sort evidence. Unless something could be found on the body or the backpack itself, any fingerprints or evidence could have belonged to any of the visitors or tenants who had traversed the cemetery.</p><p>He\u2019d been to the reenactment at the plantation several times throughout the years. He closed his eyes for a moment, imagining it. The real battle had ended in the cemetery, oddly and sadly for Marshall Donegal, in front of his family crypt\u2014he had bled out there, just like the murder victim, Charles Osgood. Jake found it curious that the body had been left so...displayed. And that the murderer had waited until now, more than twenty-four hours after the disappearance of the victim. If someone\u2019s intent had been just to ease Charles Osgood from his mortal life, that someone could have far more easily managed to stab him in the midst of the crowd that flocked around the reenactment. If the murderer had left him just lying there, the slim chance that it had been accidental\u2014boys being boys and playing with real sharp weapons\u2014would have existed. Someone, obviously, would have still been guilty of manslaughter, but the display meant murder for certain\u2014and that the murderer wanted it known.</p><p>The body was wrapped, ready to be transported to the coroner\u2019s office.</p> <p>\u201cDr. Merton,\u201d Jake said, addressing the pathologist. \u201cAnything else you can tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugie, just Augie,\u201d the medical examiner replied. \u201cNot yet\u2014I have to cut him open. But I do believe that toxicology reports will prove that my assumptions are correct.\u201d He was quiet for a moment, shaking his head. \u201cSeems like Miss Donegal was concerned from the start. If someone had paid more attention to her, he might have been found and saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that they did search for the fellow. My bosses were called in because the Donegals were so concerned,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t search hard enough, did they?\u201d Augie asked. He looked around. \u201cMust have been some feat\u2014this man was no Tinkerbell. A hefty fellow. He was brought here before he was killed. That\u2019s evident by the blood patterns, I\u2019d say, even though I\u2019m not a blood-spatter specialist. Then again, I am an M.D., with a specialization in medical pathology, and I don\u2019t think anyone needed my expertise to see that the man was dead. Well, young man, if you need anything from me, you call me. Don\u2019t worry about blunderbuss Detective Colby. He\u2019s not a bad chap. We don\u2019t have this kind of thing happen often out here. Come to think of it, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this\u2014anywhere. But he\u2019s a decent fellow, just trying to play alpha dog right off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all be fine,\u201d Jake told him. He was done here himself; the crime-scene unit was still searching, dusting, taping and hoping for the smallest clue. There was nothing else he could do at the scene for the moment.</p><p>He followed Augie and the body out of the cemetery.</p> <p>Returning to the lawn area between the house and the outbuilding, Jake saw that while the police were holding a line with their vehicles and a number of officers, the guests who had been staying at Donegal Plantation were now gathered up by the cottage, all speaking at once. Mack Colby was lifting his hands and trying to maintain some sense of order.</p><p>Ashley was still there, still the historical damsel in distress in her white gown. She knelt next to a woman who was sitting on the ground, head between her knees, and he could see the way that Ashley\u2019s jaw was hardening. Mack Colby was really beginning to anger her. It was a good thing the detective hadn\u2019t chosen to be a doctor, because his bedside manner would have killed many a patient before curing them.</p><p>Jake walked quickly through the crowd to reach her side, hunkering down by her.</p><p>\u201cI need to get Martha into the house!\u201d Ashley said irritably.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Colby said. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, but I repeat\u2014no one, do you understand me? No one leaves. So settle in, folks, and if you\u2019re in a hurry to get out of here, try to be first in line for the questioning.\u201d</p><p>The elderly woman paled, and Jake stepped in hastily to curb what Ashley might say.</p><p>\u201cMay I pick you up?\u201d Jake asked Martha. \u201cWith your permission, I can carry you in and set you on one of the sofas.\u201d</p><p>Ashley flashed him a glance of gratitude.</p> <p>Martha placed a hand on his cheek. \u201cOh, yes, young man, please. My legs are feeling very wobbly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said an older man next to them, obviously Martha\u2019s husband. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite up to lifting these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHerbert, I am not that heavy!\u201d Martha protested.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re heavy, my dear,\u201d Herbert said, \u201cit\u2019s that I\u2019m old.\u201d</p><p>Martha waved a hand in the air. Jake put his arms around her and lifted her, and Ashley led the way into the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need a room where I can be alone with each individual,\u201d Colby said, elbowing his way past everyone as he entered the parlor.</p><p>Tense and rigid, her lips pursed, Ashley directed him to a study on the bayou side of the house. Jake laid Martha down on the Duncan Phyfe sofa near the double stairway where her husband joined her, and followed Ashley and Colby.</p><p>The study was a pleasant room with a mahogany desk, computer, printer, and shelves lined with books and family pictures. It was a spacious room; two chairs sat in front of the desk, and a wingback chair faced the bayou-side windows. Mack Colby had sat himself behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to create any problems here,\u201d Jake said, his voice firm. \u201cAnd if you question these people and have the courtesy to keep proper records, I believe everything will be in order. As I said before, the federal government was called in when this was a missing persons case. Since the victim was apparently kidnapped, the federal government has jurisdiction. But I suggest that we handle it as a joint investigation. It\u2019s a truly sad, horrible and bizarre situation, and I would think that all possible means of law enforcement would be indicated.\u201d</p><p>Colby stared at him as if he would implode. His face was mottled and almost as red as the pool of blood in the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cYour behavior is outrageous!\u201d Colby told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I suggest you call your superiors, at your leisure, of course. There\u2019s no reason that this can\u2019t be a combined effort, which is always best. There\u2019s nothing in the world like cooperation between law-enforcement agencies. You\u2019ll be so much more knowledgeable than we could possibly be on so many fronts.\u201d</p><p>Mack Colby kept looking at him as if he would finally pop, but he seemed to know that Jake was telling the truth. He leveled a finger at him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something fishy here. These folks called in the feds when a man had only been missing a few hours. A grown man. Someone knew something had happened to him, and if you\u2019re not going to get at the truth, I\u2019ll be making a stink they hear up in Washington and beyond!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good God!\u201d Ashley, who had been standing quietly near Jake, exploded. \u201cI\u2019m the one who raised the alarm, and I raised it because I know\u2014knew\u2014Charles Osgood! He would have been here celebrating. He wasn\u2019t. I knew him, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>Jake set an arm on Ashley\u2019s shoulders. \u201cReally, I think Detective Colby realizes that now\u2014he is just doing his job. But we\u2019re all good now.\u201d He turned back to Colby. \u201cLook, Detective, my team\u2019s expertise is in understanding why people behave the way that they do. And Ashley\u2019s intuitions assist us. Yes, we need to question everyone, but, because of the display of the body, it\u2019s evident that this wasn\u2019t simply an act of passion, a mistake or accident in the reenactment, or the casual act of a thief or drifter. This was personal, or, possibly, ritualistic. If you want to start with the guests who are down here for the first time, that\u2019s great. They can be cleared quickly, and we can begin to look at the people involved with Donegal, the reenactors and the locals.\u201d</p><p>Colby seemed somewhat mollified, but his facial muscles were still taut. He nodded jerkily to Jake. \u201cFine. You\u2019re sitting in? Or are you going to do the questioning?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit in and watch.

Ashley\u2014tough Ashley\u2014was back.</p> <p>He settled into a chair. It was going to be a long night.</p><p>Martha could stand and walk and move, so it seemed most reasonable to let Martha, and then Herbert, go first. Ashley realized that she was trying to bring people in and out from a police questioning room as if she were still a hostess and it was a social situation, and she felt a little foolish at first but then decided it was the best way to keep everyone calm.</p><p>Beth pitched right in, brewing coffee and producing a nice array of finger foods.</p><p>Jake emerged from the room at one point, asking her to check her registration books and make sure that all guests still at the plantation were present, and also to give him a list of those who had left already.</p><p>She nodded, glad of anything to do that kept her moving and busy.</p> <p>She realized that no one had really shed a tear yet for Charles Osgood. She felt like crying over his life then. He hadn\u2019t been handsome; he hadn\u2019t been popular. He had still been a decent fellow\u2014always wanting to be handsome and popular. And now he was gone. And the question remained, of course: Had he been killed because he\u2019d been Charles Osgood...or because he\u2019d been playing the part of Marshall Donegal?</p><p>Finally, Colby had interviewed all of their casual guests, moved on to repeat guests and was ready to start on those who were close to the reenactment, the plantation or the family. Beth was surprised when she was called in, but she shrugged and went all the same. Justin followed next, and Ashley was close enough to the door to hear one of his answers to Colby.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Of course, I brought my children along while I planned and plotted a bizarre murder. I\u2019ve been hiding Charles under the kids\u2019 beds for the last night. Right, yes, of course, question away.\u201d</p><p>She grinned before moving on. She heard Jake patiently explain that they were hoping to find out if he\u2019d seen anything, noticed anything or could give them any possible information.</p><p>Cliff went in after him, and while Cliff was being interviewed, she was startled to see that two new comers\u2014people she\u2019d never seen before\u2014were in the parlor, chatting with Frazier, who was still up, still making sure that he went the distance with his guests.</p><p>She hurried over to meet the couple. The man was tall, taller even, perhaps, than Jake. He obviously had Native American blood in his heritage somewhere. The woman was a pretty blonde, who almost appeared fragile.</p> <p>\u201cAshley, Jackson Crow and Angela Hawkins,\u201d Frazier said.</p><p>She shook hands with both of them. \u201cYou\u2019re with Adam Harrison\u2019s team,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cYes, and we\u2019re so sorry that your missing person has been discovered dead,\u201d Angela told her.</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cWill you bring me, please, to Jake and the local officer who is doing the questioning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth will bring Angela up, assign them and Jake rooms,\u201d Frazier told her.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d And she took him in.</p><p>Jackson Crow had a low, level voice, rich with authority. The door to the study had quickly shut behind him, but she had to smile, hearing the tone of his voice, through the wood paneling. He and Jake seemed to have the ability to be completely even-keeled\u2014and yet say exactly what they meant in a way that brooked no interference.</p> <p>She started to walk away, but the door opened and Jake came out.</p><p>\u201cYou and your household are to go to bed and get some sleep,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done here for the night. Jackson is taking over,\u201d Jake told her. \u201cI want to get some sleep. You must need some, too. How about it? Where am I sleeping?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to ask, Could you sleep in the chair in my room?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Grampa would have told Beth to put you in the Jeb Stuart room,\u201d she told him. \u201cDo you want to get your things?\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand in the air. \u201cRight now, I want to crash. If I remember right, there\u2019s soap, shampoo, razors, toothpaste, you name it, in the rooms, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll run down in the morning. Come on, I\u2019ll walk you to your room.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes, Jake could be the Southern gentleman. There was no \u201chome\u201d to walk her to now, so he\u2019d walk her to her room.</p><p>\u201cHey, I live here,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to see you in. And lock your door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Jake! I am not afraid of my grandfather or Beth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone managed to get an unconscious, living man into the graveyard and to kill him there. Ashley, lock your door.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. They went through the living room, where Jake assured Beth and Frazier that they were free to get some rest; Jackson would deal with Mack Colby and arrangements for the continuing investigation. They\u2019d see that Cliff got back to his place, that officers remained on the property until midmorning and that everything was locked up and safe.</p><p>Frazier kissed Ashley\u2019s forehead; Beth gave her a hug. She and Jake followed them up the stairs.</p><p>The Jeb Stuart room was next to Ashley\u2019s at the back of the house, so he didn\u2019t have to go far.</p><p>At her door, he said, \u201cGood-night, and scream blue blazes if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jake.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a minute. Jake had amazing sea-green eyes. They changed like the sea as well, but they were striking against his tanned face and auburn hair. She lowered her head suddenly, wondering why she had needed so desperately to step away from him.</p><p>Because her father had been dead. Dead. And Jake seemed to have spoken to him. Strange and scary\u2014but, somehow believable. So her reaction had just been...fear.</p><p>Maybe even fear that her dreams should be believed as well.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you all right? Are you okay with me being here?\u201d he asked her, lifting her chin and searching out her eyes. \u201cThe team is excellent. Angela and Jackson are amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I mean, you know the plantation as no other investigator could possibly know it, and you know many of the people involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I just want you to be all right...with me being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She winced inwardly. \u201cJake, actually, I\u2019m sorry. I know I overreacted, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father was dead,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cThat was the past. It\u2019s fine. I understand. Okay, as I said, I\u2019m right next door. Just whistle\u2014you know the old line!\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to go into her room and lock the door; then she heard him enter his own room next door.</p><p>Ashley washed her face, brushed her teeth and realized she was still in her nightgown, but it was filthy, so she showered and changed. It was almost morning\u2014no matter. She lay down and prayed for sleep.</p><p>It came.</p><p>The first pale rays of morning light seeping through the drapes woke her.</p><p>She frowned, still groggy. Was there someone at the foot of her bed?</p><p>Jake?</p><p>No, not Jake. It was a man in a Confederate uniform. He wore a sweeping, plumed hat. She knew who he was\u2014her ancestor, Marshall Donegal.</p><p>She blinked; he would disappear, she knew.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>She opened her mouth to scream, and he leapt to his feet.</p><p>\u201cBy sweet Jesus, did I breed a line of whimpering cowards? Ashley Donegal, pull yourself together! I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d</p><p>Interlude</p><p>The television stations had gotten hold of the information.</p><p>He was stunned; the body shouldn\u2019t have been found until morning. There should have been time for Charles to...ripen a bit.</p><p>But alone with his screen in front of him and dawn just breaking, he could see the reporter by the side of the road; a police car was blocking entry to the estate, but there was Donegal Plantation, as grand as ever, surviving time and death and change.</p><p>He didn\u2019t quite feel the satisfaction he should have from the kill.</p><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t that he wanted to torture poor old Charles. He wanted the Donegal clan to suffer. It might have taken more than a hundred and fifty years for them to pay the piper, but they would be the ones to suffer. The sins of the fathers had to be paid.</p><p>The news crews couldn\u2019t get onto the property, so they were padding the broadcast with pictures. First, old Frazier. He could almost hear the old man\u2019s voice, rich but low, rippling along in that light accent like a roll of the Mississippi.</p><p>Then Ashley. The beautiful blonde, the belle, the last of the Donegal clan.</p><p>6</p><p>Back at Donegal. Jake couldn\u2019t settle in. He\u2019d stripped down to his briefs but now lay staring at the double doors to the wraparound porch, the ceiling and around the room.</p><p>Back at Donegal.</p><p>Alone, he could remember why he and Ashley had parted. He would never forget the look in her eyes, the last time he had seen her. The look in her eyes...the way she had backed away from him.</p><p>They\u2019d been friends forever. When they\u2019d been young, the three-years difference in their ages had been gargantuan; as they had grown older, the annoying little girl had become inquisitive and fun. And he had loved to tease her. They\u2019d argued incessantly; they\u2019d done their best to beat each other at every game, to outrace each other on Donegal horses, and they\u2019d laughed when they\u2019d unseated one another.</p><p>Then they had grown older still.</p><p>And he had fallen in love. Maybe he\u2019d been falling in love all his life, and he had just been waiting for her to catch up.</p><p>They\u2019d flirted, they\u2019d played, they\u2019d kissed\u2014and when he\u2019d been twenty-two and she had been nineteen, the flirting and the stolen adolescent kisses had become much more. He\u2019d never forget the night. He\u2019d been due to leave for his last semester at Carnegie Mellon, and everyone had come in from the countryside to celebrate his last night home. They couldn\u2019t all crowd down to the bars on Bourbon or Frenchman streets, because several in the group were still underage, so they had rented out one of the old historic inns on St. Anne\u2019s. They had partied by the brick fire and then, sometime in the wee hours, he\u2019d walked her to her room and gone to his...but seconds later, he\u2019d heard a knock on his door, and Ashley had been there with this look in her eyes. She had asked, \u201cMust you be such a gentleman? After all, you\u2019re heading back to college, and I\u2019m off to school in Florida, and shouldn\u2019t we have a few memories?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There had been nothing awkward about the night. Memory, of course, could alter and be selective, but he could still see the way she had looked that night, the brilliance in her eyes, the silky shimmer of her hair in the pale light and shadows. Clothing had melted away, and there had never been such a rush as just feeling her flesh against his. He hadn\u2019t wanted to leave after that night, but she had told him, \u201cWe\u2019ve been best friends for years\u2014you have always been a part of my life. You have a semester left, and I have faith and trust. A little thing like distance can\u2019t tear us apart.\u201d</p><p>Distance hadn\u2019t ripped them apart. Death had done so.</p><p>For him, it had been the odd beginning of another part of his life. For her, it had been the end. At a time when he should have been able to comfort her the most, he had become anathema.</p> <p>But now, he was back at Donegal.</p><p>And a man had been murdered.</p><p>He stood up and got dressed again; he wasn\u2019t going to sleep.</p><p>Jake left his room, pausing to listen at Ashley\u2019s door, but all was silent. He flushed, glad that she didn\u2019t suddenly swing the door open and see him standing there.</p><p>Downstairs in the darkened dining room, he heard voices. Looking out, he saw that the police were still there\u2014at least, the patrol cars.</p> <p>A drone of voices from the study alerted him to the fact that Jackson was still in with Mack Colby, and maybe Cliff. He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>He frowned; the commotion from outside had grown louder. Curious, he walked out the roadside door and looked down the avenue of oaks.</p><p>The police were blocking the entrance to the plantation, but he could see that several news crews were out on the road. Crunching down the drive, he reached the officers. Drew Montague was standing in front of his police car, arms crossed over his chest, a look of pure annoyance on his face.</p><p>Montague saw him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the word got out so fast. They\u2019re like flies on a corpse. If you\u2019ll excuse the expression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone spoken to them?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI told them that it was a crime scene, and that they couldn\u2019t come on the property. That\u2019s all. Luckily, it is private property, so it makes it easier to keep them away.\u201d</p> <p>Jake leaned on the police car next to Drew Montague, trying to listen. There were three reporters with their camera crews situated so as to pick up the plantation house in the background of their shots. He recognized the local network-affiliate anchorwoman, Marty Dean\u2014he\u2019d actually gone to high school with her\u2014but the other two reporters were men he\u2019d never noticed on the news before.</p><p>Perhaps they thought this story would be picked up by a national network. He was sure that the information that a man had been murdered on the property was out\u2014they were living in the era of cell phones, texts and instant communication, and Donegal Plantation housed many guests.</p><p>He could hear Marty clearly.</p><p>\u201cDonegal Plantation, historically a place of tragedy and loss, and filled with strange and eerie happenings throughout the years. Have the ghosts of Donegal arisen? Unconfirmed reports state that the body of a man in a Confederate uniform was found in the family cemetery on the estate. But other deaths have occurred at Donegal as well. Some are documented, and some are rumor, such as the hanging of a house slave after the murder of the master\u2019s wife during the first half of the 1800s. The Civil War\u2013era master of the estate, Marshall Donegal, a brilliant tactician who might have served the Confederacy well, died within that cemetery. Perhaps he is still waging war against his enemies!\u201d</p><p>That was too much.</p><p>Jake pushed away from the car and approached Marty. She saw him; her eyes widened, she smiled with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI see a Donegal guest now,\u201d she said into the microphone, nodding at her cameraman.</p><p>Jake felt the camera come his way. It didn\u2019t disturb him or stop him.</p> <p>\u201cJake Mallory, one of our local heroes, seems to have been staying at Donegal Plantation. Mr. Mallory, can you tell us what has happened here? Some speculate that the ghosts are murdering people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police will give the media everything when they have something to say, Miss Dean. I\u2019d just like to point out that Donegal Plantation is far more than a place of tragedy and loss. I think it\u2019s rather foolish for anyone to imply that ghosts might be running around murdering people. A man is dead, and first and foremost, his death is a sad occasion. I\u2019m sure that everyone involved with responsible media will see to it that our sorrow over his death is respected and that an historic residence and business which has offered education and entertainment to visitors for decades should not be maligned in any way. Thank you, Miss Dean\u2014I know that you will report responsibly.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked away.</p><p>\u201cJake\u2014wait!\u201d Marty called after him.</p><p>He ignored her. The other two newsmen had seen him, and he walked quickly by Drew Montague. Montague grinned, liking what he had said. As Marty chased Jake, Montague stopped her.</p><p>\u201cCrime scene, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m still not cleared to let you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Mallory is an invited guest at the plantation, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, Jake kept walking. He didn\u2019t turn back.</p><p>There was just no way out of it.</p><p>Ashley felt the scream escaping through her lips, though it was more like a gasp or choke than a scream.</p><p>The ghost swore beneath his breath and faded into nothing, and she was left staring at an empty room, wondering if she could wake herself up. But she wasn\u2019t sleeping. She was wide-awake\u2014and seeing things.</p><p>She leapt up and ran around, turning on every light in the room. It wasn\u2019t all that necessary\u2014it was going to be light outside soon. But she didn\u2019t want the shadows that were created when the sun first began to rise; she wanted light, brilliant light, and a lot of it.</p><p>But she froze when she heard a light tap at her door and then a voice.</p><p>\u201cAshley?\u201d</p><p>It was Jake. And she suddenly felt that dreaming about him had caused her to have dreams or nightmares about a body in the graveyard\u2014before it had been there\u2014and Confederate soldiers who somehow got into her room and faded away as swiftly as she could blink. She was overtired, she knew.</p><p>She was losing all grip on reality.</p><p>She walked to her door and threw it open, staring at him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just making sure you were all right,\u201d he said.</p><p>As at all times, he was so damned easy and confident. And he couldn\u2019t have heard her\u2014the scream she emitted hadn\u2019t even been a squeak when finally uttered.</p><p>How the hell did he just know things?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, just fine.\u201d Was Jake\u2019s presence here making her think that she had seen a ghost?</p><p>He believed they existed, even if he hadn\u2019t said as much. And his special team seemed to have some kind of insight that others didn\u2019t have\u2014surely that was why they were so special.</p><p>She was glad to have him here; she would have willed him here, if she could have done so.</p><p>But now she was frightened again.</p><p>\u201cI know you think you...see things, know things, that others don\u2019t. But please don\u2019t suggest that the ghost of Charles Osgood is telling you things to tell me, all right? If you\u2019re an investigator, investigate. Real things. Blood. Fingerprints.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her easily, with absolutely no show of emotion.</p><p>\u201cI heard you walking around the room. I just wanted to make sure you were all right. I\u2019m fairly new in my actual position, but Jackson has been with the federal government for years. He\u2019s excellent at following blood or DNA trails and fingerprints. Good night, again, Ashley. I\u2019m sorry I disturbed you.\u201d</p><p>He headed down the hall. She watched him, her stomach knotting, her heart sinking. Well, she had to be looking like a schizophrenic now, welcoming one minute and greeting him like a shrew the next.</p><p>Because, once again, she was afraid. She was afraid that she could see things that others didn\u2019t sometimes, and that was truly terrifying.</p><p>This time, she couldn\u2019t shut herself away; she had to be reasonable, and she even had to learn to accept what Jake said. And what she saw.</p><p>A man had been murdered.</p><p>She needed sleep. Ashley decided to leave the lights on. It was nearly six now, she saw by the bedside clock. Daylight would come quickly, but until then, she would be glad of the lights.</p><p>And the television! A television would distract her. But when she turned on the television, she saw Jake. They were repeating a newscast.</p><p>She started to change the channel, but she paused, listening to him, his strong and authoritative manner\u2014and the way he pegged the pretty anchorwoman. She had to smile.</p><p>She changed the channel. It seemed that half a dozen channels bought footage from Marty Dean\u2019s newscast. There was Jake, once again.</p><p>She hit the remote.</p><p>And again.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t possibly be on Nick at Nite! She hit the changer until she came across Dora the Explorer, and at last, satisfied, and hoping that maybe she\u2019d even learn some Spanish through her subconscious mind, she eased her head down on her pillow.</p><p>And slept soundly and without dreams intervening.</p><p>Jake took time to speak with Jackson and Angela, choosing the study for the privacy it offered. He briefed them on the events that had occurred before their arrival, and Jackson told him about the last of the interviews.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely amazing that no one saw anything,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cNo, not really. I mean, obviously, I wasn\u2019t here for this reenactment, but I\u2019ve been here before when they\u2019ve gone on. There\u2019s so much confusion. There\u2019s black powder in the air everywhere. When the fighting is over, everyone is paying attention to the riverside porch where Ashley and her grandfather are speaking, finishing up the event. It\u2019s a patriotic moment\u2014everyone sings \u2018The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know Charles Osgood?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>\u201cI met him a few times years ago. He was part of the outfit, but his stepfather was alive back then, and so Charles wasn\u2019t asked to take part in the battle. There are only six Confederate roles to be played, and there is a strict pecking order to who gets to do what when.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe need that pecking order written down,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the strange thing, from what I\u2019ve understood so far. Charles shouldn\u2019t have been playing Marshall Donegal. The role should have gone to Ramsay Clayton, but Charles was apparently causing a stink about having to play a Yankee\u2014they were short a Yankee\u2014and Ramsay decided to let Charles have the honor and play a Yankee himself.\u201d</p><p>Jake realized that they were both staring at him. He sighed. \u201cSlavery was obviously wrong, but for some reason, it\u2019s more romantic to be a rebel now. Especially if you are from the South. Don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p> <p>Angela chuckled. \u201cHey, I\u2019m from Virginia. I\u2019ve seen plenty a Civil War roundtable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you staring at me like that?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cI was staring at you because it seems that Ramsay Clayton is the first man we have to investigate,\u201d Jackson told him. He cleared his throat. \u201cGet anything you can on the man off the computer. See if he made any waves anywhere\u2014angered anyone.\u201d Jake nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut first let\u2019s head down to the local police station. I want to see that our use of their forensics department is going to be respected.\u201d</p> <p>Jake nodded again. He didn\u2019t really want to leave the house, but he usually accompanied Jackson on their police liaison.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, nice handling of the media,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cOh? I thought I walked onto a live broadcast?\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Jackson grinned. \u201cApparently, it was bought by several stations. Anyway, you handled the anchorwoman well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019d bet big-time that she\u2019ll be traipsing around here a lot. You can take the press on this one, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s hardly my expertise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you just didn\u2019t know it was your expertise,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in front in five minutes,\u201d he added, rising to leave the room.</p><p>Angela was still there. She looked like an angelic piece of fluff, but she could handle a Glock as if she\u2019d been a shooting champ for a hundred years.</p><p>She set her hand on his. \u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThe place is riddled with ghosts, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHave you met any yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t tried. But I promise I\u2019ll be getting right on that. And,\u201d she added, a curve to her lips and a light in her eyes, \u201cyou know me\u2014I usually need a little time and quiet. God knows why\u2014most ghosts are shy of disbelievers. You\u2019d think it would be the other way around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d think Charles Osgood\u2019s spirit would be around here somewhere,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou never know who lingers and who moves right on,\u201d Angela said. \u201cRemember, death doesn\u2019t make the soul all-seeing. Sometimes, ghosts don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened\u2014we all know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Jake said. \u201cDeath is as confusing as life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry today,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my eye on your Miss Donegal\u2014and her grandfather, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jake told her.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me about it?\u201d Angela asked him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe were close, intimately close. Her father died, but I knew when he first went into emergency, and I shouldn\u2019t have. And I related a dream I\u2019d just had about him, in which he said how much he loved her and that he was all right\u2014and two seconds later the nurse walked in to say that he was dead. In that moment, I became a pariah.\u201d</p><p>Angela nodded sympathetically. \u201cThat\u2019s why we learn to keep our own council. But you\u2019re okay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I swear it. Don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m working, and my emotions won\u2019t sway me in any way,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cOur emotions always sway us,\u201d Angela told him. \u201cJust so long as they sway us in the right direction, we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>He left her, ready to head to the front of the house. But he heard noise in the dining room and stepped in. Ashley was there, pouring herself coffee from the samovar on the buffet.</p><p>\u201cAshley, can you get me a list of the Yankees and the rebels who took part in the reenactment? I\u2019m sure the police asked you for your rosters, but would you write up the names\u2014and what they do and how long they\u2019ve been involved with the plantation?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>That morning she was in jeans and a T-shirt. She still appeared as gloriously beautiful as she had in flowing white. She had that same air of dignity that sat so well on Frazier.</p><p>And elegance. Even in jeans.</p><p>And she seemed to have forgotten her earlier tirade.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she repeated. She looked away for a moment and then back to him. \u201cSorry about earlier. I was really tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It meant nothing.\u201d</p><p>She looked down. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she murmured. But she looked up again, frowning. \u201cAre you leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a few hours\u2014just down to the station. Angela will be here. And there are still two patrol officers getting your guests out and stopping others from coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, I really can\u2019t believe that one of our reenactors could have done this. I\u2019ve known most of these guys since I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you need to think hard about anyone who might have had a grudge against Charles\u2014or Ramsay Clayton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one had a grudge against Charles. They felt sorry for him all the time, if anything. And I really can\u2019t imagine anyone having a grudge against Ramsay. He\u2019s a pleasant person, not much of a temper\u2014actually, a nice man. He had no problem with letting Charles take his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t\u2014if he knew something was going to happen to the actor playing Marshall Donegal,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>She stiffened at that. \u201cIt was a last-minute change,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t this have been a random killing?\u201d</p><p>He paused, thinking that was obvious\u2014except that Ashley very stubbornly didn\u2019t want to believe that anyone with whom she\u2019d been friends could possibly have plotted out the brutal killing.</p><p>\u201cFirst, Ashley, simple logic,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to know this area to have kidnapped a man and kept him hostage\u2014even drugged\u2014for that long a time. You\u2019d have to know Donegal Plantation well to know the cemetery, how to reach the Donegal vault easily and to escape unseen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re open to the public\u2014we\u2019re a bed-and-breakfast. And the history of the place is written up in a number of books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley,\u201d he said seriously, \u201ca murder like that isn\u2019t a sudden act. It was preplanned, and preplanned carefully. Is it possible that a stranger came on a tour and devised a way to find notoriety? Yes. But it\u2019s most likely, considering human nature and behavior, that someone close to Donegal Plantation committed this crime. I\u2019m sure that law enforcement will look at all angles, but we\u2014the team\u2014specialize in behavior\u2014\u201d he broke off; he didn\u2019t want to tell Ashley bluntly that they would also be seeking those who weren\u2019t still living for help \u201c\u2014and even the events that occurred in the past that cause someone to act a particular way in the present, and so, we\u2019ll put our focus on those who are close to the family and Donegal Plantation. I\u2019m sorry, but I honestly believe you\u2019re going to have to accept the fact that someone you know is a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be wrong,\u201d she said.</p><p>He had to grin ruefully at that. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re still stubborn as hell. Think about it again, about everything I said. A random act of violence wouldn\u2019t explain someone holding a man drugged and hostage and then killing him with a bayonet\u2014as your ancestor was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could be wrong,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Jackson was waiting for him in the hall. He drove, and as he headed out, he looked back in the rearview mirror as Donegal Plantation became smaller and smaller, and disappeared in the trees.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to leave. Not while someone was still out there.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d Beth commented, \u201cis sad!\u201d</p><p>She and Ashley were at the dining-room table. All of the guests were now gone, including Justin, who had taken his family into New Orleans. At this point, it was definitely going to be better to think about his children enjoying the zoo and the aquarium than hanging around Donegal Plantation.</p><p>Ashley looked at Beth, frowning, \u201cWell, of course, it\u2019s sad. A man is dead.\u201d</p><p>Beth shook her head. \u201cNo, this\u2014the two of us sitting here, drooping on our elbows, getting nothing done. That\u2019s sad!\u201d</p><p>Ashley sat back. \u201cThey asked me for a list\u2014I\u2019ve done the list. I\u2019ve checked on my grandfather\u2014he\u2019s actually sleeping. There are two guys in uniform hanging around outside, and I\u2019m not sure what else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to cook.\u201d Beth stood up. \u201cAnd I suggest that you go befriend the blonde cop who is wandering all over the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela. Angela Hawkins?\u201d Ashley murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat would be the name of the blonde cop or fed or whatever we have walking around,\u201d Beth told her. \u201cGo on. I\u2019m going to occupy myself. Alone. Go find the investigator. Maybe you can help her.\u201d</p><p>Ashley rose. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said.</p><p>She left Beth and looked through the rooms on the ground floor. Upstairs, she saw the door to Angela and Jackson\u2019s room was open; Angela was inside, sitting on the bed and staring into space.</p><p>Ashley approached the door. \u201cHello?\u201d she said.</p><p>The woman started and looked at her, and then smiled. \u201cHello. This is a beautiful place. Absolutely beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s full of legends,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to share a few?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Lord, well...there are supposedly several soldiers wandering around. We had an actor die of a heart attack, in the 1940s, I believe, in the barn. Members of the Donegal family have died of old age. So, let\u2019s see, we\u2019re supposedly haunted by Unionists, rebels, actors\u2014oh, a World War I cavalryman who died in France but made his way back here. The house was built in the early eighteen hundreds, so we\u2019ve decades of ghosts running around,\u201d Ashley said lightly. \u201cThen, of course, we have the rumored ghosts who really can\u2019t possibly exist\u2014not here. Every plantation is supposed to have the beautiful slave girl who poisoned the mistress and was then hanged from one of the oaks. But it didn\u2019t happen here. Not that way, anyway. I\u2019ve had guests, however, who swear they\u2019ve seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sometimes people see what they want to see, don\u2019t they?\u201d Angela asked her.</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes, what they don\u2019t want to,\u201d Ashley replied.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding Charles,\u201d Ashley said, looking away. It wasn\u2019t what she had meant at all. She had just met this woman.</p> <p>And maybe it wasn\u2019t such a good idea to remain with her.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said awkwardly, \u201cthank you for being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we do,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Ashley inclined her head. \u201cThank you anyway. I\u2019ll let you get back to\u2014to whatever you\u2019re doing. Excuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley!\u201d Angela called when she would have walked away.</p><p>Ashley paused.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what Jake told you, but we were banded together because we learned how to blend our intuitions with logic, and even to analyze our dreams. Don\u2019t let any of that scare you. If you let yourself turn fear into careful thought, you\u2019ll discover just how much you may know yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who killed Charles, and I don\u2019t have a logical\u2014or even illogical\u2014thought on what might have happened. I wish I did,\u201d Ashley said. She gave Angela a forced smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here if you need me,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Ashley told her and waved, walking away. She wasn\u2019t sure where to go, and she found herself returning to her own room. She lay down on the bed, remembering that she\u2019d slept no more than two or three hours. If she tried closing her eyes, maybe she would sleep.</p><p>What now?</p><p>The world was strange; they were waiting. Waiting for what, she wasn\u2019t certain. The police seldom captured a murderer immediately, and they were in a very bad position here, since they depended on tourism and their guests to keep the place afloat.</p><p>\u201cAshley.\u201d</p><p>The whisper of her name brushed her ears, and she didn\u2019t trust the sound was real, or if it was all in her mind.</p> <p>She kept her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded crossly.</p><p>\u201cYou hear me. I know you hear me. It\u2019s so difficult to find someone who actually does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the illusion of a tormented mind,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>She swallowed hard as something settled at the foot of her bed.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it\u2014don\u2019t open your eyes! she commanded herself.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m trying to help you. I swear. You\u2019re my great-great-great\u2014I don\u2019t know how many greats\u2014granddaughter, and I\u2019d never hurt you, not for the world, but I\u2019m afraid for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid for me, go away. You\u2019ll give me a heart attack. Or the police will have to collect me and put me in a straitjacket if you don\u2019t,\u201d Ashley said, still keeping her eyes tightly closed.</p><p>\u201cDonegal women are not cowards!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a coward. I\u2019m trying to stay sane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, young woman!\u201d</p><p>She did so. She blinked. She wanted to scream, but, of course, she couldn\u2019t. Her throat was locked.</p><p>And he looked so damned comfortable. He sat on the edge of the bed, a handsome man. His hair was a darker blond than hers, long and actually curling around his neck. A large-brimmed, plumed hat sat atop his head, and he had brilliant blue Donegal eyes. His uniform appeared to be new, and in pristine shape, and bore Louisiana militia insignia. A scabbard held his sword in place around his hip, even as he sat, the sheathed sword at an angle.</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>She stared at him.</p><p>Eventually, the lump went down in her throat. She wondered if she was dreaming again. She didn\u2019t think that she was. She could feel the pillows beneath her head, and the fabric of the sheets she lay upon. Daylight was streaming through from the balcony. She could see the sky beyond. She was awake, and she pinched herself to prove it, feeling a bit ridiculous as she did so.</p><p>\u201cYou really see me!\u201d he whispered with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my mind,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but you see me.\u201d She hated to deny a man such evident pleasure at so simple a thing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a ghost, haunting Donegal Plantation,\u201d she said flatly. She groaned. \u201cNo, haunting me. Why me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s in you\u2014it\u2019s always been in you to reach me. And I\u2019ve tried to reach you forever.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know that you could startle a ghost, but apparently you could, because he jumped when she suddenly sat up. She stood then and walked around, turning away and turning back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t disappear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in my dreams,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cEasiest contact,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She shook her head and then approached him, angry. \u201cThen\u2014you knew. You knew someone was going to kill Charles. Who is it? Damn it, tell me, tell me what\u2019s going on, and we can solve this. What did you see? What do you know?\u201d</p><p>He rose to meet her. He was really quite the swash-buckling figure, and she could see where he had been an impressive man\u2014until he\u2019d gotten himself killed.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I know nothing. Look, a ghost can\u2019t be everywhere at the same time. I\u2019ve had this odd feeling for a long time that something was going to happen. Something bad. I\u2019ve tried to reach you, to make your see me and be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a feeling?\u201d she demanded incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re a ghost!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the ghost of the man I was, and the essence of what I was is still what I am,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>She blinked, trying to make sense of what he was saying. \u201cExplain that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat remains is the soul,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the essence of our being. The body is fragile\u2014it ages and it dies. But the soul, the energy of what we are, is what we always were.\u201d He searched out her eyes and tried again. \u201cWe learn through the ages, through everyone we watch. I\u2019ve seen generations come and go, and I\u2019ve shed tears that no one sees through many a tragedy. I touched your father once, but he does not remain\u2014he went with your mother when the call came.\u201d</p><p>Her parents had gone on. She missed them, so much, still. The beginnings of tears tightened her throat.</p><p>She steeled herself, wondering if she could possibly be speaking to the ghost of a long-dead ancestor, or if the events had just become too much for her.</p><p>\u201cYou watched all that\u2014but you didn\u2019t see who killed Charles?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo! I was with you and Frazier on the porch. I love the reenactments. Now, that is. But the first few years of my\u2014ghosthood?\u2014I was a bitter fool. I really was. I owned slaves, yes\u2014it was a way of life, and we didn\u2019t really know any better. Really. I was bitter when we lost the war. I was bitter when the carpetbaggers came down. Then I began to learn. I began to watch the world as the years went by. I could see that I\u2019d been\u2014not a fool\u2014but utterly ignorant to many truths in life. Now I\u2019ve watched many young people go off to war, and I\u2019ve seen the fallacy of our ways, and I\u2019m glad we lost the war\u2014we never should have fought it.\u201d</p><p>He was really there. Or, in her mind, he was real, and he was just like a reasoning, functioning human being.</p><p>Except that he was dead.</p><p>She shook her head again and realized she was doing so enough to give herself brain damage. She forced herself to stop.</p><p>\u201cThis is great,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a ghost\u2014and you can\u2019t even help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d Marshall Donegal said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do my best to watch the behavior of those around us now even more closely, and I can do my best to stay near you and look after you. If you know I\u2019m here and accept that I can be here, and you\u2019ll let me in, you\u2019ll hear me now when I know that there is danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know there was danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could feel it,\u201d he said again, exasperated. \u201cI tried to warn your great-grandfather when the old fellow was about to keel over in the barn. No one saw me\u2014no one came to help when I screamed. Now that poor old bastard is spending his afterlife pacing out there in the stables, and he won\u2019t move on. I talk to him, and he doesn\u2019t hear me. He just waits for his opportunity to act out a long-gone and lamented war, and there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t speak to other ghosts?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Sometimes it\u2019s as if we never quite touch,\u201d he said sadly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just one big old ghostly community out there?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cSome don\u2019t accept that they\u2019re dead,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOthers know, and they\u2019re not sure why they linger. Some just can\u2019t go on. And sometimes we can reach one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Emma?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He turned away from her. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, his back to her. \u201cPerhaps she has gone on. Perhaps we are being punished. But, no, I can\u2019t see or reach Emma.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPunished for what?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her, waving a hand in the air. \u201cThat\u2019s not important. What\u2019s important is that you have a killer on your hands. A cruel killer, one who mocked the way I died. I died for a cause that might have had serious flaws, but I believed that I was fighting for my family and my state. Why should we be mocked so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Donegal clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone killed Charles\u2014to hurt the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe days of cotton and sugar being a means to all ends has long passed\u2014the plantation survives on the guests who come. Donegal does well because there are always visitors. If the place becomes known as the site of a heinous recent murder, the people will not come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, that may not be true,\u201d Ashley said dryly. \u201cIt may attract more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will hurt, I believe.\u201d</p> <p>She pointed at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not really a ghost, and I\u2019m not really seeing you. You are a creation of my subconscious, and you\u2019re logic\u2014telling me that I can figure this out if I think hard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not going away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just ignore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll be behaving in a most foolish manner. Think about the day, about the event. Think about the men involved, Ashley. Your friend is right, and you know it. Someone close to Donegal Plantation committed that murder.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>\u201cNo hairs, no fibers, nothing on the bastard but the wool of his uniform and fluff from a pair of cavalry gloves,\u201d Colby said, disgusted. \u201cAnd, of course, there are so many fingerprints on the tomb, we can\u2019t begin to sort them. Same thing with tire tracks\u2014there are none close to the cemetery wall, and there are thousands in the gravel and the road out front. We have begun to sort them out, but it will take a great deal of time, and when we have them, what will we have?\u201d The man was clearly frustrated. \u201cThere was absolutely no sign of a struggle. There\u2019s no sign that Charles Osgood was dragged to the tomb. Science isn\u2019t going to point us straight to the murderer on this one, and we need warrants to just go digging into the personal effects of the hundreds of people who might have been around. He was killed with a bayonet, so getting a judge to move on collecting the weaponry used at the reenactment has been a piece of cake, but once we go beyond that...well, it will be hard to pinpoint the fellow\u2014not unless he strikes again, or gets careless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t strike again,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course. It doesn\u2019t look like a serial killing, does it? The way I see it, someone had a grudge on Charles Osgood and found a way to really drag out his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re grateful, Detective Mack, that your officers began collecting all of the rifles and bayonets used by the men in the reenactment, and that you\u2019ve been so gracious to share information\u201d Jackson said. \u201cProfiling isn\u2019t an exact science. We all know that. And we don\u2019t believe we\u2019re dealing with a serial killer, either, but still, finding someone who holds a grudge\u2014even finding out if there was a perceived slight to someone\u2014can often help point law enforcement in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>Detective Colby nodded. \u201cFine. We\u2019ll track down people. We can narrow the field, but it will still be a big field.\u201d He was quiet a minute. \u201cI heard you all did a damned good job in New Orleans. Some of the information seems to be a bit vague. Do you people mind-read, or something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe explore history\u2014history in time, and history as it pertains to individuals,\u201d Jake said smoothly. He had a feeling that with Colby, they\u2019d be thrown out if they were to mention the fact that they sought out ghosts.</p><p>\u201cDetective,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cwe\u2019re truly grateful that you\u2019re allowing us to work with you. I believe that the cemetery was thoroughly searched when Charles first went missing. When his body was discovered, he was still wearing his uniform, so he was held from the time he disappeared until he was found. He was apparently held in a drugged condition, and perhaps the murderer was able to go about his customary life while stashing his victim somewhere. But if we have alibis for the time before the body was found\u2014we know he had only been dead for a few hours, tops\u2014then we can eliminate those people and concentrate on the lies someone might be telling, or on alibis that might have a few holes in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know there were hundreds of people on that plantation for the reenactment,\u201d Colby said wearily. \u201cWe\u2019re on it, but the manpower needed for that kind of investigation is great.\u201d He was quiet for a minute and said grudgingly, \u201cThis is a sensational case. We\u2019re, uh, grateful that you\u2019re here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a needle in a haystack,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the bayonets of the men who were already gone that day?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cIf the men were gone with those bayonets, they couldn\u2019t have killed him with them,\u201d Mack Colby said.</p><p>\u201cIf they were really gone, which, of course, your men will find out,\u201d Jake said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that any of the men who were playing Yankees\u2014who had left the property already\u2014are guilty, but I believe that two of them are local, Southerners who had ancestors who did choose the Northern side. Once we eliminate\u2014\u201d Jake began.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get every weapon. Every blade,\u201d Colby said grimly. \u201cThey\u2019ll be wiped clean, of course. But sometimes, no matter how you wipe down a blade, the forensics folks can still find a miniscule dot of blood. I\u2019m doubting it with this guy, though. This damned thing was planned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Mack Colby seemed pleased Jackson agreed with him.</p><p>\u201cHow much of the property was searched by your men?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cWe had an entire team in the cemetery,\u201d the detective said. \u201cAnd, of course, I had officers comb the area around the cemetery as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to extend that search\u2014take it to a daylight level,\u201d Jake said. \u201cIf I had committed such a murder, I wouldn\u2019t have kept the murder weapon on my person anywhere. If you\u2019re found with the murder weapon, it\u2019s most likely you\u2019re the killer. He\u2019s gotten rid of that bayonet\u2014and I believe it might well still be on or near the property. He might have been on the property after the murder, or nearby, and I just don\u2019t think he\u2019d risk being found with the weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, we don\u2019t even know how the bastard got his victim there, with no one at all seeing him. The plantation was still crowded\u2014lots of folks staying over,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cThe river,\u201d Jake said, imagining the scene in his mind\u2019s eye. \u201cHe might have come by the river. The cemetery abuts it. Easy enough to take a rowboat, tie her up, drag your victim in and disappear the same way\u2014you\u2019d never have to go by the house or the outbuildings,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a team back out there by this afternoon,\u201d the detective assured them. \u201cI\u2019ll muster up our best techs to go over the property again, and call in some divers. It will take me a few hours, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the dive myself,\u201d Jake told Jackson.</p><p>\u201cSurfer boy, that\u2019s a hard current\u2014you\u2019d better be a damned good diver,\u201d Colby told him.</p><p>Jake held his temper and smiled. He didn\u2019t look like a \u201csurfer boy.\u201d He had just stepped on Mack Colby\u2019s toes the first night of the crime by being there when the body was found. Colby had accepted them; he even seemed to like Jackson. But Jake had been there when the body had first been discovered, and Colby seemed to have a bit of grudge because of it.</p><p>\u201cI used to scrape barnacles off shrimp boats, and I\u2019ve fixed a few motors in the Gulf and the Mississippi. I\u2019ll be careful,\u201d he said pleasantly.</p><p>He thought that Colby would sniff out his disdain, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Adam Harrison\u2019s reach was long. The investigation was theirs, not that they had any problem working closely with the local police. Mack Colby just had a chip on his shoulder, even though he was trying to pretend it wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cAnd, of course, we are talking muddy water and hard currents. I\u2019ll sure be grateful for the help of your police divers,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>At his side, Jackson grinned and lowered his head to hide it.</p><p>Colby was mollified.</p><p>Jackson and Jake left the police station. \u201cYou really know that muddy water so well?\u201d</p><p>Jake laughed. \u201cYeah, I actually do. But I have to admit, I\u2019d be in the damned muck anyway even if I didn\u2019t. There\u2019s just something about that damned detective. And I won\u2019t go alone. I know that Cliff Boudreaux is a diver. Cliff has been on the plantation forever. His dad was a manager and tour director here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff Boudreaux took part in the reenactment and has lived at the plantation forever,\u201d Jackson said, looking over at him.</p><p>\u201cRight\u2014that\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes him a suspect,\u201d Jackson reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAn unlikely suspect,\u201d Jake argued. \u201cCliff has been an open book. Two of his ancestors were Donegals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could make him a prime suspect,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI knew him when I was a kid,\u201d Jake told Jackson.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still a suspect. I want to believe we can communicate with the dead at times,\u201d Jackson said gruffly. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of us joining them. I won\u2019t let you go alone.\u201d</p><p>Jake didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>When they reached the house, Jackson motioned for Jake to follow him. They went up to the bedroom Jackson and Angela were sharing to find her at the desk lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cEverything is all right here, right?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Angela looked up in surprise at his entry.</p><p>\u201cAny sense of...anyone who might be able to help us?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>She quirked a brow. Jackson knew that the world wasn\u2019t always what it seemed, but he still had trouble just asking her if she might have met a ghost who could flat out tell them the truth about the situation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare laugh at me\u2014I\u2019m letting the house get to know me. And, Jackson Crow, you know as well as I do that we\u2019re unlikely to come across an entity who just happened to see the whole thing. If the ghosts haunting the cemetery are active, they probably get the hell away when a reenactment takes place because people are everywhere, and if they\u2019re just reliving the fight\u2014well, then they don\u2019t see anything but what was. Some of those entities have been around forever, but still can\u2019t quite reach out and touch anyone, much less a newcomer to the property. Give me time.\u201d She looked at Jake. \u201cAnd give Jake time. He knows the place. And those who might still haunt this house and these grounds know that Jake is familiar here. And Ashley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley?\u201d Jake said, frowning.</p><p>Angela nodded, looking at him. \u201cI think that Ashley has a sense that there is more\u2014and I think it terrifies her. Maybe she\u2019ll come around. You can\u2019t force ghosts\u2014and you can\u2019t force anyone to admit that they might see ghosts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe murderer was alive,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSo let\u2019s concentrate on behavioral analysis of the living for the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that someone wanted Charles dead\u2014and killed him here,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cToo pat, too hard and too complicated. If someone just wanted Charles dead, there were easier ways to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA narcissist,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHe\u2019s sure of himself. He believes in his intelligence and his ability to carry out the plot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re looking for someone who isn\u2019t stupid,\u201d Ashley said.</p> <p>\u201cThe police will be working hard on the masses and their alibis. I think we have to look at the probable first. So we\u2019ll go with the fact that we believe that it\u2019s someone close to the family. We all thought that from the beginning. Initial instinct is a good place to start. This is someone who, I believe, is a functioning psychopath. He\u2019s living with the belief that he\u2019s been harmed in some way by the people here, or even by the plantation itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cEven then, we have to start narrowing down the suspect pool,\u201d Angela reminded them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say we can get it down to a handful soon enough. Prove where people were physically, and we\u2019ll find out answers. Or, at least, get the number down to where we can apply some pressure and perhaps cause this particular person to break. I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s well. This is the kind of murder perpetrated by a person with some kind of mistaken belief in the righteousness of what he\u2019s doing. We just have to figure out who is really a concerned friend\u2014and who is wearing a mask of friendship. I believe that he\u2019ll eventually break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just afraid of what might happen if we don\u2019t find him quickly. He may start to spin out of control before he breaks, and that could be really dangerous,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cThat could be fatal,\u201d Jake said. \u201cWe need to take care\u2014great care.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson nodded. \u201cGo work with Ashley now,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jake went back downstairs and found Ashley in the study. He sat down in a chair across the desk from her and surveyed her. She handed him a sheet of paper. It was filled with the names of those who had played rebels and those who had played Yankees. There was a little paragraph about each man\u2019s family, employment and character that followed. He smiled, looking down at the sheet.</p><p>The first name on it was Cliff Boudreaux. And Ashley had typed, You\u2019ve known him almost as long as I have. Cliff, competent, good-looking, strong, self-assured. Tour guide, jack-of-all-trades. We all know he has family blood and that he loves the family.</p><p>Mentally, he added Jackson\u2019s note: because of that very family association, he may have underlying feelings of resentment, as in, he has as much right to the property as Frazier and Ashley.</p><p>Following Cliff\u2019s name was Charles Osgood. Not a suicide. Underlined three times. An accountant, always an in-between man, not bad-looking, not a charmer. Thrilled to play Marshall Donegal; change happened at the last minute.</p><p>Charles was followed by Ramsay Clayton and then by Hank Trebly, which made sense. Hank was involved with the sugar mill on the cemetery side of the property.</p><p>Hank Trebly, Ashley wrote, reminds me just a bit of a hobbit. A little short, a little squat\u2014I know you know Hank. Fortysomething, balding a bit, always chewing his lower lip, concerned with politics, and the environmentalists coming after the sugar mills. I hear he\u2019s a good guy, though, insisting that corners never be cut, and that they follow regulations to a T.</p><p>Jake looked up again, smiling as he caught Ashley studying him with serious eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. This is perfect, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson\u2019s specialty is behavioral science. This is exactly what he\u2019ll need. He hasn\u2019t met these people, and your information is the kind of thing that a behavioral scientist works with. Perfect,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She nodded, but her gaze shifted toward the door. He looked around. There was no one there. Was she praying someone would come get them both out of here?</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, not taking her eyes from his again.</p><p>He turned again, feeling as if someone were behind him; no matter where she was looking, it was as if she had seen something.</p><p>But there was no one there.</p><p>He looked into her eyes questioningly, but she had her hands folded on the desk, and she maintained eye contact. He looked back to the list.</p><p>Griffin Grant, affable fellow, think you\u2019ve met him, though his uncle used to do the reenactments. Adores the place and the playing\u2014he\u2019s a CEO, VP (?) at a cable company out of New Orleans. Early thirties, good-looking, sharp and well-dressed, nice sense of humor, especially considering the fact that he\u2019s a total business geek.</p><p>Toby Keaton, owns Beaumont, but you know that. Medium height, medium weight, early forties, thinning hair. Our families have always gotten along well\u2014starting from the beginning of the \u201csurvival by tourism\u201d days. We do Civil War and reenactments; he works on Creole history, the real day-to-day work involved in such a plantation. He\u2019s always been part of the reenactment.</p><p>John Ashton, nice guy, his father did the reenacting in the old days. He\u2019s in his late twenties, bookish, glasses, even has special wire frames just so that they work for the reenactments. He runs a tour company in New Orleans, and has long been a good friend of the plantation.</p><p>Jake looked up at Ashley again, seeing her and imagining the reenactments as he had seen them so many times before. He knew the positions the men would take\u2014he could run it in his own mind easily. \u201cSo, Charles winds up playing Marshall Donegal. The rebel troops are complete with Cliff, Griffin, Hank, John and Toby. Ramsay goes off to be a Yankee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ramsay went off to join the Yankees, and that group included two locals, men you know as well\u2014\u201d Ashley reached over to tap the paper \u201c\u2014Michael Bonaventure, from New Orleans, bar owner, has a place off Royal Street, and Hadley Mason, an engineer from Lafayette. Justin Binder is from Philadelphia, and he was here with his mother-in-law and two children. He\u2019s a widower. The other two Yankees were Tom Dixon, from New York City, and Victor Quibbly, from Chicago, and they both left the morning after the reenactment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey flew out from New Orleans?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>Ashley swung around in the chair, hitting the on button on the computer that sat on a stand next to the desk. She nodded. \u201cWe know when everyone is coming in and out from different cities, because we try to arrange rides. Yes, Tom left on American Airlines at noon the following day, and Victor was on Continental fifteen minutes later. Cliff drove them to the airport, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you think of anyone else who is closely involved with this property or with the reenactment?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cDr. Ben Austin\u2014he\u2019s a practicing M.D.\u2014and John Martin, our biggest sutler, or vendor. He was here with his wife, and they were at the party\u2014you know, the wind-down in the house. Every one of those folks was there\u2014except for Charles, of course,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cChange places?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I get on the computer for a minute?\u201d</p><p>She stood up, walking around the desk. As she did so, she looked at the door again, frowning. He followed her line of vision but saw nothing.</p><p>Jake sat at the computer and started punching in keys. He could access sites that the average person couldn\u2019t because he had the proper codes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ashley asked him. She hadn\u2019t taken his chair; she stood at the edge of the desk.</p><p>\u201cSimple elimination,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo Yankees in the clear\u2014they indeed flew away. Their names are on the manifests for the flights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t the police be checking on that kind of thing, too?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, but in my mind, the more people I know to be eliminated entirely on my own, the easier it will be to home in on what really happened. And Jackson is a stickler. He\u2019s a team man\u2014it\u2019s the way he\u2019s always worked. People make mistakes. We can make mistakes. Anyway, I know we\u2019re down to a few-score people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few score,\u201d she repeated, wincing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. That number will go down quickly,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Once again, she wasn\u2019t looking at him. She was looking behind him. He turned quickly, wondering if he didn\u2019t glimpse a shadow...something. Ashley was definitely acting strangely.</p><p>Donegal was known for being haunted. Maybe that was why she had fought all her life against the possibility that ghosts could be real.</p><p>And maybe, she was just beginning to feel or see something....</p><p>There was a tap at the door. Jake was surprised by the way Ashley seemed to all but jump out of her skin.</p><p>Frazier poked his head in. \u201cLunch is served. An excellent meal, it appears.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beth had cooked\u2014and cooked, and cooked. She had gone for just about every staple known to Southern Louisiana\u2014corn bread, jambalaya, crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, gumbo, turnip greens, pecan pie, bread pudding, shrimp salad and more.</p><p>It astounded even Ashley that she could have prepared such a feast so quickly, but then, when the reenactment wasn\u2019t taking place and they weren\u2019t investigating a murder, Beth did run one of the finest restaurants in the area. There was still a crowd for lunch; Jackson, Ashley, Jake, Frazier, Cliff, Beth and herself.</p><p>She noted\u2014as she was sure Cliff did\u2014that their guest investigators did not treat him as a suspect; they treated him as one of the family, which, of course, he had always been. Growing up, he\u2019d been the big brother Ashley had never had, even though he was about thirteen years older than her and had been actually managing much of the plantation while she\u2019d still been playing with her dolls and video games.</p> <p>At the luncheon table, she wasn\u2019t being haunted by an annoying Confederate in full dress uniform. He wasn\u2019t in the dining room. Not at the moment, and Ashley was grateful for that fact. He\u2019d been in the office with her when she\u2019d been giving Jake the list, and he\u2019d been terribly annoying, wanting her to punctuate every detail regarding every man. She kept thinking that Jake would turn around and see him standing there, laugh and tell her that the fellow was an actor hired to torment her.</p><p>But Jake didn\u2019t see the man\u2014so she was the scary one after all, suffering from strange delusions about the dead. They were all probably brought on by the murder.</p><p>During the massive meal, they all spoke as casually as possible in the aftermath of a brutal, senseless killing. Jackson and Jake relayed the conversation they\u2019d had down at the police station until Cliff had left them, saying that he had work at the stables.</p><p>Ashley pretended to listen attentively while wondering again if she had imagined that a ghost\u2014looking as real as flesh and blood\u2014had carried on a meeting with her. She looked here and there around the room, wondering if Marshall Donegal would appear in the flesh\u2014or the appearance of flesh!\u2014sweeping off his great plumed hat and setting a booted foot upon a chair, perhaps.</p><p>But though he had been a pest in the office, he didn\u2019t show. She was so busy worrying that he would, however, that she barely heard what was being said. She wondered if Frazier had ever seen the man\u2014or even Cliff. After all, one way or another, they were all related.</p> <p>Then one word that Jake uttered brought her to.</p><p>...diving...</p><p>\u201cDiving?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe that the murderer might have thrown his weapon into the Mississippi,\u201d Jake explained. \u201cHe\u2019s organized, and intelligent. Such a killer would know that the murder weapon would be searched for immediately, and that he couldn\u2019t be found with it on his person or his property. So if it were me, I\u2019d throw it in the river as quickly as possible. Actually, I think the killer had Charles with him, maybe drove him away after the reenactment and then brought him back here in some kind of a boat. That being the case, he\u2019d have thrown the weapon into the river while he returned to wherever he had come from by boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless, of course,\u201d Ashley said, staring back at Jake as if she dared him to agree, \u201cthe murderer held Charles drugged on the property. If that was the case, the killer could have taken him into the cemetery, where he bayoneted him to death, and went on to return to his room. The river has a terrific current, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible, too,\u201d Jake said evenly. \u201cBut I think he threw it in the river\u2014the weight of a weapon could have easily caused it to sink.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a suspect, am I?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>Ashley straightened, looking around the table at the three investigators.</p><p>Jake smiled and answered. \u201cNo. It\u2019s highly unlikely that you have the strength needed to carry out what was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the Lord!\u201d Beth said.</p><p>\u201cBut Cliff could be guilty,\u201d Frazier said.</p><p>\u201cWe certainly hope not,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Ashley protested. She didn\u2019t believe that Cliff could be guilty, but she didn\u2019t believe that any of the men who had acted like children on the day of the reenactment could possibly be guilty of such a heinous crime. \u201cWho\u2019s going diving? Aren\u2019t they sending out police divers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jake said, frowning slightly. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that at this point they\u2019ll be along really soon. But I want first crack, before the water is churned by a team of four or five.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014are you authorized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are working co-jurisdiction,\u201d Jackson said, glancing at Frazier. \u201cAdam\u2019s your grandfather\u2019s friend, and Adam has the influence to make a great deal happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley, you know that I know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Jake told her. \u201cI\u2019m going to get started now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAshley\u2014\u201d Jake began.</p><p>\u201cNo one should dive alone,\u201d she reminded him primly. \u201cThe water is brown\u2014even with lights, vision is limited,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need a dive buddy. And it\u2019s my property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley,\u201d Frazier said, \u201cmy dearest grandchild, my old heart is still ticking. It\u2019s still my property. You two children can fish through the regulators, tanks and masks we keep because of work that has to sometimes be done down by the bayou.\u201d</p><p>Frazier had spoken lightly, wanting to ease the tension with smiles. He managed the feat.</p><p>\u201cGrampa!\u201d Ashley protested.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t look at me!\u201d Beth said. \u201cDive in that nasty old muddy water? No, no, dishes look much, much better than diving in the Mississippi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning on working with Jake, too,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. But I\u2019m going,\u201d Ashley said firmly.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s get on it,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Half an hour later, the divers were nearly ready. Ashley had opted for a dive suit\u2014she didn\u2019t like everything in the Mississippi touching her bare skin. Jake and Jackson had eschewed the idea of suits and were just in swim trunks, booties, gloves and their masks and regulators.</p><p>Angela, Beth and Frazier had come down to the embankment near the cemetery while they checked and rechecked their equipment and the flashlights they\u2019d be working with.</p><p>Angela had watched Jake walk over and over the embankment near the cemetery wall. He found a spot that seemed to satisfy him.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, looking at them all.</p><p>Jackson, apparently, knew what he was talking about. He came over and hunkered down next to Jake, inspecting the ground. He stood after a moment. \u201cHard to tell, but possible. We\u2019ll go in here. Time for tanks, children,\u201d he said.</p><p>The three assisted each other, buckling into the heavy dive tanks. \u201cYou\u2019re just walking in, right?\u201d Angela asked. \u201cSeriously, shouldn\u2019t we be waiting for the police? They\u2019ll have metal detectors\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jake lifted a rod he had on a cord at his wrist. \u201cJackson has one, too,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIt is one big damned river,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the bayou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, sir,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThis is how he managed the movement of the body. This is where he\u2019ll have ditched the weapon.\u201d</p><p>Frazier nodded. He gazed at Ashley, and she knew that he was worried about her. It was only fair; she was worried about him. She blew him a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow the current and watch for you down by the public ramp,\u201d Angela reminded them. \u201cDon\u2019t try to get back\u2014I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep up with us,\u201d Jake warned, catching Ashley\u2019s hand.</p><p>Pride dictated that she draw away, pride and maybe fear that it was too easy to depend on him so swiftly. But she didn\u2019t draw away; they were diving together, and she wasn\u2019t going to be uncooperative.</p><p>They eased into the water over the embankment, a difficult task as it was shallow next to the levee and they sank into the mud. She immediately felt the strength of the current, and she knew what Jake was thinking: if the killer had indeed followed this route, he had gone with the current in whatever little boat he had been maneuvering. He wouldn\u2019t have used a motor; a motor might have been heard.</p><p>The brown, muddy waters of the Mississippi covered their heads, and they went with the current themselves, using their flippers to thrust them downward. Ten feet, twenty feet, thirty feet...forty feet. She\u2019d been in the water here before, but only ever to clear growth from the seawall or work with their little strip of dock. The water was filled with silt, and everything before her eyes was curtained behind a brown haze. The sun didn\u2019t penetrate deeply.</p><p>A massive catfish glided by them, taking a look, moving off quickly. They passed over the ruins of a broken-up tugboat. Gar drifted by, and in the few feet she could see ahead, even with her diving light, Ashley saw that a blue suckerfish was watching them avidly. There seemed to be little else of interest. Diving in clear waters was beautiful, but the Mississippi wasn\u2019t clear. It seemed as if the light dimmed quickly, as if the riverbed sucked it up into the mottled brown darkness.</p><p>She heard the rhythmic sound of her regulator, air moving in and out of her own lungs. She usually loved that sound. She glanced over to see that Jake was still moving fluidly at her side, inspecting the river bottom as they drifted along, barely using their fins, the current was so strong.</p><p>She tried to give her concentration over to the task at hand.</p><p>She felt a jerk on her hand; she turned and saw Jake\u2019s blue-green eyes through his mask. He motioned that they needed to go down. His metal detector had come upon something.</p><p>Fighting the current, they shot downward, only to discover car parts that had been in the river long enough to acquire massive growth. She and Jake, with Jackson close behind, started to move onward again.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all sure how she saw it, but suddenly it seemed that something bright flickered in the glow of her beam. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She started toward it.</p><p>A jerk on her ankle made her panic for a moment; alligators didn\u2019t usually travel out into the depths of the river\u2014they preferred the bayou and the shallows. But it would be quite ridiculous if she were to be consumed by a natural predator she knew and respected in the hunt for a human monster.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an alligator; it was Jake. He frowned at her, indicating that she wasn\u2019t to take off without him.</p> <p>She nodded and pointed. Then, of course, her beam picked up nothing, but he nodded and followed her downward.</p><p>They were in an area of soft packed mud and underwater growth. At first Ashley thought she had imagined the glitter in the water. It was dark, and with the current, once the muck was disturbed, it spread out, creating an even darker brown haze.</p><p>Then she felt Jake squeeze her hand, and he indicated the metal detector.</p><p>There was definitely something there.</p><p>They had to move quickly, because the water around them was becoming browner by the second. There was nothing easy about maintaining their position in the water; they fought the current hard. But Jake was digging in the mud, and she did the same.</p> <p>There, beneath one of the plumes Jake had just started.</p><p>She saw it.</p><p>It was still in excellent shape; it looked as if it had just been set down on the river bottom. The 1853 Enfield rifle that shot a Burton-Minie ball still had its bayonet, which had surely glittered in the glow of her flashlight, soundly attached.</p><p>It was the weapon that had been carried not just by the defenders, but by all of the federals on the day of the skirmish that had taken place in 1861. It would have a thirty-nine-inch barrel with three grooves, and the stock had three metal bands, so that it was sometimes called the popular \u201cthree-banded\u201d rifle. Reproductions of the rifle were carried by all the reenactors. At the beginning of the war, it had been quite typical, appreciated on both sides of the great conflict.</p><p>She pointed; Jake reached down a hand and collected the weapon by the stock. He nodded to Ashley and indicated that they head toward the riverbank.</p><p>They emerged about a hundred feet shy of the boat ramp. Sludging up the muddy bank, Ashley saw that Angela had been true to her word and was there leaning against Jake\u2019s car down by the public ramp.</p> <p>She saw them right away and came hurrying toward them, heedless of the marshy terrain. She had something in her hand, which turned out to be a large plastic bag of some kind\u2014an evidence bag for the weapon retrieved. Angela, apparently, had had faith in their findings, while Ashley had to admit she hadn\u2019t expected that the four of them would find anything in the Mississippi. Of course, this team had probably been trained, but then again...</p><p>She had been the one to spot the weapon.</p><p>\u201cYou found it!\u201d Angela cried, wrinkling her nose as she stepped into a deep pit and struggled to free her foot.</p><p>\u201cAshley actually made the discovery\u2014without a metal detector,\u201d Jake said. He held the weapon out while Angela opened the bag.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>They both paused, staring at her.</p><p>She studied the weapon.</p><p>The manufacturers of historical weaponry were good\u2014really good. They could replicate weapons to a T.</p> <p>But there was something about this one.</p><p>She didn\u2019t touch it, but she moved closer. Mud encrusted the weapon, and there was no choice. She delicately took a finger protected by her diver glove and dusted aside a speck of the mud.</p><p>And it was there. Deeply, roughly gouged into the stock near the barrel, there were initials.</p><p>She looked up at Jake and Angela, chilled to the bone.</p><p>\u201cThis weapon is real. I mean, authentic to the period\u2014and our house. It belonged to Marshall Donegal. You can see his initials right there, MPD. He carved them by hand himself with his knife. Marshall Patrick Donegal.\u201d</p><p>Interlude</p><p>He watched it again. There she was, that blasted reporter, talking to Jake Mallory.</p><p>Mallory, so cool and solemn and yet easy with the reporter, revealing nothing at all.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have good new footage to show; so far, none of the reporters or their crews had been allowed on the property, and thus they had nothing new to say. Of course, the world now knew that Charles Osgood was dead, and everyone everywhere was deliberating. It was absolutely amusing to discover just how many people were certain that a bitter Confederate ghost had committed the crime.</p><p>Or even a Yankee. Hell, four Yankees had \u201cdied\u201d on the property that day.</p><p>Ridiculous. No one was putting blame where it belonged. Or maybe they were.</p><p>The canned video was replaced by the reporter again, the pretty woman who seemed to have a hard edge. It was the hardness of a woman who wanted to rise in her field and was willing to do just about anything to do so. She\u2019d sleep with the boss while making her cameraman traipse through dangerous territory before setting her pretty face in front of the camera. She\u2019d sleep with the producer. He knew that look. He\u2019d seen it often enough in the business world. With men, it just meant that they\u2019d stab you in the back; with a woman, it meant that she\u2019d do just about anything.</p><p>The reporter\u2019s face was replaced again by the image of a sea of pictures; they were artistically angled in the shot, from, clockwise, left to right, Frazier Donegal, Emma Donegal, Marshall Donegal and Ashley Donegal.</p><p>Ah, and it seemed that the generations had taken DNA from all\u2014Ashley looked like her great-great-however-many-grandfather, and like Emma Donegal. All these decades later.</p><p>The newscast ended.</p><p>He should have felt satisfied. He\u2019d caused the havoc he wanted. They were never going to catch him; there was just no way to prove that he had done any of this.</p><p>But then the newscast changed; there was a \u201cthis just in!\u201d alert.</p><p>The reporter came back on. Anchorwoman Marty Dean identified herself again and announced that police believed that they had the murder weapon, an historic Enfield rifle once owned by the Civil War master of Donegal Plantation, Marshall Donegal. Tests were being done by forensic experts, seeking proof that the weapon, pulled from the Mississippi, had indeed been used in the murder.</p><p>Naturally, Marty\u2019s station would be right on the investigation, bringing news about the heinous events at the plantation the second they became available.</p><p>He clicked off the television, startled.</p><p>The weapon shouldn\u2019t have been found so quickly. He had left no traces; he had ditched the damn thing in the Mississippi River, and he had been careful in every possible forensic way.</p><p>He paced, trying to calm down, and he did.</p><p>They had the weapon. Even if they found old Charles\u2019s blood, they could never trace it to him. Even if they knew how he had gotten there and killed the man, they couldn\u2019t trace it to him.</p><p>Pity, though. The image must have been so brilliant, the dead man\u2014dead. Blood dripping. He\u2019d been in Marshall Donegal\u2019s uniform. The possibilities for amazing ghost stories were endless....</p><p>He sat down again. It wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t going to really choke the life out of the place.</p><p>So...</p><p>They\u2019d be watching the cemetery. And they\u2019d be watching the river.</p><p>There was always the bayou, and before you reached the bayou from the house, there were endless trails with pines, giving way to marshland....</p><p>\u201c\u2018It is well that war is so terrible\u2014lest we should grow too fond of it,\u2019\u201d he whispered aloud, quoting Robert E. Lee, the South\u2019s\u2014no, the country\u2019s\u2014greatest general.</p><p>He smiled, his faith in himself restored.</p><p>\u201cIt is well that bloodletting is so complicated\u2014because it is so actually sweet and entertaining!\u201d he said.</p><p>The killing was the best.</p><p>8</p><p>The Enfield and bayonet had been turned over to the forensics lab, and there was nothing to do on that angle but wait\u2014and, determine, of course, how the priceless family heirloom had gone from its glass-encased place of honor in a small attic museum that guarded such precious pieces into the hands of a murderer, and then into the river.</p><p>Frazier was horrified. Of course, it had never been locked up. They didn\u2019t lock up their artifacts at Donegal Plantation. Marshall Donegal had been buried with his dress sword, but not the Enfield rifle he would have carried into the war. At his death, Emma had kept the weapon above the fireplace in the rear parlor, should they come under attack again at any time. It was most likely that she kept it there until her death in 1890. One of her children had probably moved the rifle and other artifacts from the mid-1860s to the attic. Frazier knew that his father had been the one to purchase the box it had been displayed in now. No one had even known it was missing; when they all returned to the house, he asked Ashley a dozen times at least if she was sure that the weapon they had found had been Marshall Donegal\u2019s, and he had gone upstairs himself to assure himself that the box was empty.</p><p>It was.</p><p>The reality of the Mississippi River was that it was not the nicest place in the world to dive; returning to the house\u2014once the initial questions were asked and answered\u2014Jake hurried up to his room and straight into the shower. He was sure the others were doing the same. But he had barely stripped out of his swim trunks when there was a knock at the door. He frowned, wrapped a towel around his waist and went to it. He opened it a crack.</p><p>Ashley was out there. She had stripped off her dive suit and wore a terry robe over her bathing suit. Her hair was still damp and tangled from the water, but she looked restless and uneasy.</p><p>He opened the door fully without moving aside.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is anything wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked at him with her huge sapphire eyes. It was suddenly impossible\u2014despite the five years that had passed since they\u2019d been together\u2014not to feel an uncomfortable rise of his libido.</p><p>God, he\u2019d loved her, always. Not true, he tried to correct himself. Once, she had been a bright, entertaining, but annoying little precocious kid. But not long; she\u2019d caught up so quickly. And when he had realized that he\u2019d teased her the same way boys had teased girls they had secretly coveted since the be ginning of time, he had just fallen head over heels. It was the sapphire of her eyes, maybe. The perfection of her skin, the softness and the glitter in the color of her hair. Ah, but that was just lust. He\u2019d loved her tomboy antics, the way she could ride, race, challenge, laugh, and argue her side of any matter. It was the sound of her voice.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, a man is dead,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cKilled\u2014with a family heirloom!\u201d</p><p>He started, his reverie fading. \u201cYes, we all know that. Is something wrong? I need to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>He was a fool, of course. She was standing there; he was standing there. He was naked beneath the towel; she wore flimsy pieces of a bikini beneath a terry robe. He had never really fallen out of love, and he\u2019d have to be a hell of a lot older or infirm to fall out of lust.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the point here.</p><p>What was the point?</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why she was here. He didn\u2019t want to be used because he was convenient and her world was going to hell.</p><p>Yes, I do want to be used! his mind raged.</p><p>No.</p> <p>\u201cAshley, let me jump in the shower, and I\u2019ll be right with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI suggest you do the same. You wear even river mud well, but I think you\u2019ll be more comfortable without it.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and forced himself to close the door.</p><p>His shower was pure torment.</p><p>Marty Dean sat at her office desk, studying her phone, and wondering what she could say once she\u2019d reached Jake Mallory. She\u2019d had such a crush on him in high school. His guitar had gained him quite a reputation, and he\u2019d played with some pretty extraordinary bands. Everybody had a crush on Jake! And he\u2019d just gotten better, really. Some of those boys\u2014the big football-hero types\u2014were just downright pudgy now. And Jake? He still had those probing eyes, that sculpted face, those shoulders.... It had been something to see him again. And he had looked right at her\u2014and not given her a thing.</p><p>Well, she thought, pouting, he\u2019d come around. He was a man, and she knew how to make a man come around.</p><p>Her pout became a frown. But, of course, he was at Donegal Plantation, and he and Ashley Donegal had been quite a thing. If he was sleeping with her again...</p> <p>Hmm. The promise of an affair might not do it.</p><p>Maybe she had to promise that she would promote Donegal Plantation, though she would love it if there were a mystical ghost story involved.</p><p>She was still pondering the mode by which she would get him to agree to an interview when the switchboard signaled a call for her.</p><p>\u201cLine four,\u201d the operator told her.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome man who insists you\u2019re going to want what he has to give you,\u201d the operator told her, bored. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not the FBI. I don\u2019t know who he is. You said to send through anything promising\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I got it, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the phone.</p> <p>\u201cMarty?\u201d</p><p>The voice was deep, quiet and husky.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said. \u201cWho is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want an interview. You want to know what\u2019s really going on. You want to break it free. Well, I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d</p><p>Jake! It had to be Jake. Oh, and he was FBI now, or something governmental, and he was one of the big shots on the case. But he did remember high school, did remember that they\u2019d flirted and teased and that she\u2019d been the hottest thing in his class.</p><p>\u201cOh, you sweetie!\u201d she said. \u201cThank you, thank you! Can you come in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can come out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you where to leave your car so that it\u2019s not seen. And I\u2019ll tell you the easiest way to get to me. No cameras. This is between you and me. But it will help you get to the truth. I can\u2019t say more\u2014you have to really solve this on your own after what I tell you. But I won\u2019t speak if there\u2019s anyone else there, so come alone. I mean it. Don\u2019t tell anyone where you\u2019re going. I can\u2019t be involved in this when the news gets out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. Where should I be? When?\u201d</p><p>She listened. She hung up, delighted.</p><p>Her secretary stopped her as she headed out for her car. \u201cYou have the newscast at eleven, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back. I\u2019ve got a lead. I\u2019ve got plenty of time. I just need to meet with an informant\u2014a local informant. It pays to be me!\u201d</p><p>Marty tore out of her office, mentally planning her speed. How fast could she go without being in danger of the cops stopping her?</p><p>Pretty damned fast, she told herself.</p><p>Oh, this was it! This was it! The case of a lifetime.</p><p>By the time Jake came downstairs, he found that he was the last to do so. The others were arrayed in the roadside parlor, seated in the big wingback chairs by the fire and the massive Duncan Phyfe sofa. Jackson\u2019s hair was still wet, so he had obviously just arrived. Ashley had showered and changed into jeans and a tailored blouse; her damp hair was tied in a queue at her nape.</p><p>\u201cThe house itself is seldom locked,\u201d Frazier said as Jake entered the room. \u201cWe\u2019re a bed-and-breakfast. We have a restaurant, and we\u2019re open to the public. God knows when the rifle was taken. I haven\u2019t been up to that little attic museum space in years.\u201d Frazier glanced over at Ashley. \u201cHave you been up there?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSally Mayfield, one of our housekeepers, last did a dusting up there three or four weeks ago, I think. Sally would have noticed if something had been gone, and she would have told me. So I\u2019d say that it had to have been taken within the last three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen were most of the reenactors here last? They still meet ahead of time, right? And what about Civil War roundtables? Frazier, you used to have them here now and then,\u201d Jake said. He heard the front door open as he was speaking; Cliff had arrived to join them. He glanced over at Jackson for a silent communication.</p><p>Cliff remained a prime suspect. They needed to keep a close eye on him.</p><p>Ashley didn\u2019t want to believe it. He didn\u2019t, either. Cliff had always been around when he\u2019d been younger; he\u2019d always been strong and steady and decent, and he loved Donegal Plantation, just as he\u2019d always loved the family.</p><p>Frazier was thoughtful. \u201cYes, of course. I\u2019m not sure of the date of the most recent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a meeting out in the barn about two and half weeks ago. The out-of-towners weren\u2019t here, but the rest of us were,\u201d Cliff volunteered.</p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cEvery one of the locals except for John Ashton,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cHe had a tour group in the city that he had to take out himself. Some bigwigs from the tourist board. And obviously, out of our group, I have continual access to the house. And I suppose I have the physical ability to have done all of it, while, no offense, Frazier, I don\u2019t see you committing this crime at your age, and I sure as hell don\u2019t begin to see Ashley or Beth committing it. I wish I knew how to clear myself, because no matter what you all say or how you act, I know damned well I have to remain a prime suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou even have motive,\u201d Jackson said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I should own the house. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Angela asked gently.</p><p>\u201cWhoever did this might want the whole place to fall apart. Let\u2019s face it, if the place is tainted by a recent murder and a killer who isn\u2019t caught, people could be afraid to come. I\u2019d never want to do that,\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>\u201cWe all survive because of Donegal Plantation\u2014well, except for Beth, who could get a great job anywhere,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cBut Cliff is right. There\u2019s no reason for him to want to lower the value on this place. Besides, Cliff doesn\u2019t even have to wait for Frazier and me to die\u2014he owns a piece of the land, and he has a lifetime lease on his apartment in the stables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitterness,\u201d Jake said. \u201cI mean, if we\u2019re looking for motive. Let\u2019s face it, this whole thing is sick. Cliff, you\u2019re the outsider. You were the product of an illicit affair, historically speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo illicit affairs, really,\u201d Cliff said. He never took a seat; he stood there and shrugged sheepishly. \u201cI can\u2019t prove anything, but I\u2019ll answer any question you may have. Obviously, I didn\u2019t stash a body in the stables\u2014they were searched. Of course, I could have stashed the drugged body of our friend in my apartment and joined the group. I would have had to have been terribly crafty, though, since the place was teeming with people, and the entrance to my apartment is easily visible from the grounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you return the body, then\u2014by the river?\u201d Jake asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou might have done that to throw off suspicion,\u201d Angela told him.</p><p>\u201cI might have,\u201d Cliff agreed. \u201cExcept that I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m going to feed the horses,\u201d he said, then, \u201cBut I\u2019m available to you anytime\u2014I won\u2019t be leaving the property.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSee you all at dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having crab cakes. My best!\u201d Beth assured him.</p><p>When Cliff left, there was an uncomfortable moment of silence in the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d Ashley began.</p><p>\u201cNone of us wants to think, but we have to weigh all the factors, eliminate the impossible and start looking at the possible,\u201d Jackson said to her gently. \u201cSometimes a killer wants to inject himself into the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, Ashley,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cIt is impossible,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cCliff is part of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the old days, brothers would kill brothers to be king,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cLook, Ashley,\u201d Jake said, leaning toward her. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be able to clear Cliff soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re all careful. We all stick together, and we keep doors locked. Agreed?\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cI\u2019ve got Will and Whitney on their way out here now with some new equipment, and Jenna is interviewing Justin Binder and his family in the city. I\u2019m going to pay a call on Ramsay Clayton\u2014I believe he\u2019s still in residence at his old family home down the road\u2014and have a talk with him. There are still a couple of uniformed officers outside, but I think part of the team should always be at the house. Jake and Angela?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Jake assured him. \u201cI\u2019ll get on the computer.\u201d</p><p>Jackson nodded. He looked down at Angela and squeezed her hand, and Jake knew that her assignment was to discover what she felt about the house.</p><p>Frazier walked over to Ashley. She stood quickly, hugging him. He hugged her silently in return. \u201cI\u2019m for a nap,\u201d he said. \u201cAt my age...\u201d He apologized to the others.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in my room, too,\u201d Ashley told him.</p><p>\u201cA nap sounds good to me,\u201d Beth said, yawning. \u201cAnd then dinner.\u201d</p><p>Angela laughed. \u201cOh, my God, after that delicious lunch you prepared! I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to eat dinner. I\u2019m going to...search the house. Combine a little work with exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSearch for what?\u201d Ashley asked her.</p><p>\u201cEvidence,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>Ashley shook her head. \u201cBut that won\u2019t help us. Every man had access to the house at some point. What evidence could we possibly find that would be evidence? And the cops have been here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never really know what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Angela said. She glanced at Jake. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to walk around and think and look, and then you sometimes find what you didn\u2019t know you were looking for. If that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the study,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIf you need me.\u201d</p><p>Beth and Frazier headed for the stairway, arm in arm as they walked up the stairs.</p><p>Ashley lingered until she was alone with Jake. \u201cCliff didn\u2019t do this,\u201d she said with finality.</p><p>He walked over to her, placing his hands on her shoulders. \u201cAshley, honestly? I don\u2019t think that Cliff did it, either. But it\u2019s not going to hurt to be careful, to be with someone, to keep the doors locked, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can be careful,\u201d she murmured, bowing her head.</p><p>He lifted her chin gently so that she met his eyes again. \u201cHey,\u201d he told her huskily. \u201cRemember when we first decided we wanted a rock band and we set up out in the stables? The poor horses! Cliff never said anything. He just moved the drum set into the front yard and told us that birds liked music more than horses\u2014especially heavy metal.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMy father let us move the drum set into the old smokehouse.\u201d Her smile faltered. \u201cJake, my father has never come back from the dead,\u201d she said.</p><p>He was puzzled. She wasn\u2019t angry with him, and she wasn\u2019t even turning away from him or trying to escape him.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to hurt you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I probably managed to hurt myself,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou...scared me. You really, really scared me,\u201d she told him. She was silent a moment, looking at him. \u201cBut you should know. My father isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>She flushed as if she had said more than she had meant to. She backed away from him. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014uh\u2014 I\u2019m going to go to my room,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cInto the land of digital reality for me,\u201d he told her and headed off into the study while she walked toward the stairs.</p> <p>The subtle, almost elusive scent of her perfume lingered, and he had to force himself not call out her name, not to draw her back to him and demand that she understand. Time had done nothing to lessen his feelings for her.</p><p>He wanted to hold her; he wanted the truth. He wanted to make the losses and traumas of her life go away. And, that, of course, was impossible.</p><p>They could do their best to find the killer. That was what he could do for her, he thought.</p><p>But when he sat behind the desk in the study, he didn\u2019t turn to the computer. He sat in the chair, scanning the space around him. \u201cWhere are you, damn you?\u201d he whispered aloud. \u201cEmma Donegal, I saw you. You knew something was wrong. You wanted me here. Please, won\u2019t you come and help me now?\u201d</p><p>Ashley headed for her room, still feeling a flush on her cheeks. Well, she was a fool. She\u2019d turned away from Jake Mallory, cutting him from her life as if she had done so with a sharpened blade. What was she expecting now, and what the hell had she been doing, throwing herself at him just because she was scared?</p><p>\u201cWell, I am scared,\u201d she said and then winced, wanting to nip in the bud the fact that she was talking out loud to herself far too frequently now.</p><p>She threw herself down on her bed and closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t see him; she didn\u2019t feel anything at all, but she knew that Marshall Donegal was there.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go away,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were trying to make me look like an idiot in the study, and I was a nervous wreck all through lunch, thinking you\u2019d make me do something stupid. If you\u2019re my ancestor, and you love me so much, will you quit tormenting me?\u201d</p><p>She felt a shift of weight. He had taken a seat at the foot of the bed. She opened her eyes at last.</p><p>\u201cIf someone comes at me with a weapon, can you protect me?\u201d she demanded, sitting up to stare at him. \u201cWill that ghostly blade save my life? If not\u2014 Where is this going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I protect you? That depends. I am fairly powerful. Being as I am requires concentration and practice, and I was always a disciplined man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So you got into a barroom brawl and died before the war really began,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>He seemed to stiffen. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I didn\u2019t get into the brawl. Peter O\u2019Reilly got into the brawl. I dragged him out of the place before it turned into something right there, though that might have been a mistake. God knows, if we\u2019d brought troops in, the Yankees would have been killed on the spot or hanged for being spies. But I didn\u2019t want murder committed. Hell, I lost my own life because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Reilly?\u201d Ashley asked. \u201cThat would have been Charles Osgood\u2019s great-great-great-great-stepgrandfather, right?\u201d</p><p>Marshall Donegal nodded, rising and walking to look out on the river. He lifted his hands. \u201cI lose track of the generations...but, yes. He wasn\u2019t a bad fellow, just the kind who was quick to anger and to feel an affront. He was eager to \u2018whomp those Yanks!\u2019 He survived the war. I saw him here once, when he came to pay his respects to Emma. He was minus his left leg. It made him a different man. Emma was sorry for him, of course. She offered him work. But he went into New Orleans and became a printer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, do you think that someone\u2019s ancestor knew this and thought it was a justice that Charles should die since his ancestor brought about the whole thing? Maybe one of the Yankees!\u201d Ashley suggested.</p><p>\u201cOne who perished?\u201d Marshall asked her.</p><p>\u201cPossibly. I mean, if the rebels more or less caused it all because of Peter O\u2019Reilly, and four of the Yankees died, maybe it was a sick kind of late-blooming vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven I\u2019m aware\u2014perhaps more so than anyone\u2014that the war is long, long over,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cOther wars have raged since, and will rage in the future,\u201d he added sadly.</p><p>\u201cYes, but whoever did this has to be sick. You don\u2019t drug a man, hide him for a day and half and then take him and bayonet him to death and hang his body off a tomb\u2019s angel if there isn\u2019t something really wrong in your psychological makeup,\u201d Ashley said flatly.</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone avenge someone after a hundred and fifty years?\u201d Marshall demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but Cliff is a prime suspect because of his family relation,\u201d Ashley said. She frowned and then gasped. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I forgot. We do have that old plantation story about the master who supposedly slept with a slave. Were you involved?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet, and he gave her a curious, sad smile. \u201cNot me, and not any plantation master,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cBut you know who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever studied the records?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOf course, but the baby who was Cliff\u2019s great-great-whatever just seemed to appear, and he was raised by Harold Boudreaux and grew up after the war on the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the war. I was dead, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but there\u2019s no exact age on what records we do have,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cThe records for the slaves on the property were kept at the chapel, and the bible recording all the births disappeared sometime during the war, so the lists we still have don\u2019t have birth dates on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff\u2019s great-great-great-great\u2014I believe\u2014grand-parent wasn\u2019t a Donegal man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014who?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was Emma,\u201d he told her quietly.</p><p>Words and numbers seemed to blur Jake\u2019s vision, but he did feel that he was gaining ground.</p><p>Cliff Boudreaux could not be eliminated. Nor could Ramsay Clayton. John Ashton was easy to eliminate. There were pictures of him in New Orleans on the web the day following, and he had gotten an interview on one of the local channels to talk about the history surrounding the city\u2014and to plug his own business. He had been on an evening show that broadcast at seven, and he had been going to give a tour that night that included the broadcaster. It didn\u2019t take long to verify the fact that he had led the tour, as he had said on air. He hadn\u2019t been at the meeting that had taken place approximately when the Enfield rifle and bayonet had most probably disappeared.</p><p>In like fashion, verifying their location at the time the drugged-but-still-living form of Charles Osgood had been taken into the cemetery and murdered, he managed to clear the field of all the Yankees except for Justin Binder. Tom Dixon had attended a party with his wife and children in New York that had gone on \u2019til midnight, and Victor Quibbly had already been in Austin, Texas, on a business matter.</p><p>He looked at his remaining list and his notes. Cliff\u2014no one wanted it to be him. Ramsay\u2014had he set up Charles Osgood? Hank Trebly\u2014why? Sugar interests. Toby Keaton\u2014okay, so he owned Beaumont, the Creole plantation next door, but he was never in competition with the Donegal family...or it didn\u2019t appear that it could be so. Griffin Grant\u2014no amount of searching showed exactly where he had been, other than that he had shown up at his office for the usual workaday world on Monday. He hadn\u2019t even taken the day off, as so many had. Three others to look at would be the sutler, John Martin, Justin Binder, who had stayed in New Orleans at a chain hotel, and Dr. Benjamin Austin, who lived in Francisville and had not had office hours after five on the day that Charles had actually been murdered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat back for a minute, closing his eyes. They could be way off. Anything could have happened. But he was pretty sure he was on the money, and he knew that Jackson would agree with him. Eliminating the household\u2014Beth, Ashley and Frazier\u2014left those who were closest to the household. He knew Ashley, and if he hadn\u2019t known her, he\u2019d still know that no one could have acted the terror she had shown when he had come upon her. Frazier couldn\u2019t have pulled if off physically. Beth had no interest in the family; she hadn\u2019t even really understood the history behind what was going on, and she didn\u2019t have the strength to manage the feat, either. He\u2019d pulled up everything he could find on her on the computer anyway; she couldn\u2019t have any determination to avenge a long-ago ancestor. Her family hadn\u2019t been anywhere near the United States during the war. So, using logic, it seemed to be down to Griffin Grant, Cliff Boudreaux, Ramsay Clayton, Hank Trebly, Toby Keaton or, less likely but still possible, Dr. Benjamin Austin or the sutler, John Martin. He put the last two at the end of the list. Concentration first\u2014Ramsay Clayton and Cliff Boudreaux.</p><p>How in hell to prove that it wasn\u2019t Cliff?</p><p>He looked at the phone on the desk and noted that there was a button to call directly to the stables.</p> <p>Cliff answered quickly. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff, I\u2019m going to be honest. I want to eliminate you as a suspect. Would you be willing to let a forensics team go over your apartment and car?\u201d</p><p>There was silence, dead silence, on the other end.</p><p>Then Cliff answered him, his voice tight and hard. \u201cWhatever it takes, whatever it takes. Bring it on, my friend.\u201d</p><p>As he hung up, his eyes on the desk phone, Jake felt that someone was watching him.</p> <p>He looked up, and his breath caught in his throat.</p><p>It might have been Ashley\u2014Ashley in her attire for the drama they played out at Donegal Plantation.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>It was the woman he had seen in Jackson Square in New Orleans before he had even known that he was going to be coming out to Donegal Plantation.</p><p>Emma. Emma Donegal. He could see the door through her misty form, but he could also see her face clearly. It wasn\u2019t as if he could really hear her voice, and yet he could; it was inside his head.</p><p>\u201cCome!\u201d she said urgently. \u201cPlease, come.\u201d</p> <p>He forgot about Detective Mack Colby and the call he had intended to make to get Cliff\u2019s apartment searched. He followed the ghost out of the office and through the house.</p><p>And on out to the stables.</p><p>Cliff was there, sweeping hay from the slab of concrete in front of his door. He looked up at Jake with guarded eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing the search?\u201d Cliff asked him.</p><p>Jake felt about two feet tall. He had known Cliff for years; he could remember many more occasions with the man than what he had mentioned to Ashley. Cliff had patiently corrected him and taught him about riding, horses, shooting and the plantation itself dozens of times throughout the years. They\u2019d gone out in alligator season together, and Cliff had taught him that even if the creatures were predators, they had their place in life. They had to be hunted to control the population, but they didn\u2019t deserve to be tortured because man had unbalanced nature. A clean kill: a good shot between the eyes. That was the way to kill a gator.</p><p>He had taught him other things. Things like balancing his weight with that of the horse he was riding, how to sit a jumper and how to calm a horse when they ran into a bear in the woods. He\u2019d taught him how to hunt fowl, and, in return, Jake had taught Cliff how to hold a cue and shoot a break that could nearly clear the table.</p><p>\u201cNo, Cliff, honestly, it\u2019s because I want you cleared. I don\u2019t want anyone who doesn\u2019t know you the way I do not knowing that they can trust you,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Cliff studied him and then nodded. He leaned on the broom. \u201cYou come out to go after Ashley?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou ask me, she shouldn\u2019t be out alone right now.\u201d</p> <p>The ghost of Emma Donegal had disappeared when he\u2019d reached the stables.</p><p>But now he knew why he was here.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Ashley?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust ten minutes ago, she came running down and asking me if there was any problem with taking her mare out for a ride. Said she needed to clear her head, and a ride around the property always did that for her. I was going to let her have a few minutes and then take a ride myself. I just don\u2019t feel right about her being alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no!\u201d Jake said. \u201cWhat horse can I take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you head to the bayou, you\u2019ll find a concrete marker. That\u2019s where Emma had Harold Boudreaux buried,\u201d Marshall had told Ashley. \u201cBut don\u2019t go now, young woman. Show some sense of self-preservation. There\u2019s someone out there bent on hurting Donegal Plantation, and you are the last of the Donegal family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff is a Donegal!\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear, not really. Emma wasn\u2019t born a Donegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m not sure exactly what the relationship is, but Cliff\u2019s great-grandfather and a young woman born a Donegal got together in the 1920s, so, yes, he is a Donegal!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I suppose you\u2019re right on that.\u201d</p><p>Marshall Donegal had followed her when she went out to the stables, determined on riding. He kept trying to dissuade her while Cliff kept trying to dissuade her.</p><p>Before she\u2019d mounted up on Varina, she\u2019d given Cliff a huge hug. \u201cI love you, cousin!\u201d she told him.</p><p>Cliff had looked at her strangely and then shook his head. \u201cLook, Ashley, you don\u2019t have to defend me. I didn\u2019t murder anyone.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d grinned at him. \u201cI never thought you did. I just wanted to say that I love you!\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t bothered with a saddle; she had to find out if there was really a stone near the bayou. If so, she wasn\u2019t imagining the ghost. He was really there, telling her things.</p><p>Or she was imagining the ghost, and he was really suppressed memories in the back of her mind. Whichever. She wasn\u2019t doing well fighting the concept of imagining Marshall Donegal, so she might as well try to use what was happening. And it didn\u2019t look as if she\u2019d be running to Jake for comfort. She\u2019d be business, strictly business, from now on out.</p><p>She thought that she had ridden out alone; she should have known better. Marshall Donegal was riding behind her\u2014on a ghost horse, of course. His mount was a beautiful roan, complete with all his Confederate trappings.</p><p>\u201cDammit, woman! Let me lead!\u201d he called to her.</p><p>She felt something as he and the roan seemed to pass through her. Then she took off through the woods, following him.</p><p>They rode for twenty minutes. Then the ghost horse let out a whinny and stopped, and her haunting ancestor slipped from his mount and walked down the trail to a large pine. He tried to rip away the vines and grass and weeds that grew around the base; Ashley saw that the grass moved, but little else happened.</p><p>She began the task herself.</p><p>She gasped out loud. It was there, a large, flat, stone marker. One word had been crudely etched into it.</p><p>FRIEND.</p><p>Ashley sat back on her haunches and looked up. Marshall Donegal leaned against the tree, watching her.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did Emma bury him out here? There\u2019s a tomb for the slaves\u2014and then the servants\u2014who stayed on to work the plantation,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cEmma was truly a wonder,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cAny rumors you heard about fights between us\u2014or my indiscretions\u2014were stories created because people need stories. We fell in love, and when that first blush of love was gone, we still loved one another deeply. She was a strong woman. She held the place together after I died\u2014with the help of Harold Boudreaux. In 1864, they became lovers. The world would never have accepted it. Even after the war ended, they would have been in grave danger. There was a pecking order for those of mixed blood in New Orleans, you know that. Quadroons were all the rage to become a man\u2019s mistress, and the Quadroon balls were infamous. But after the war, the KKK was started up, and if they had been discovered, Harold most probably would have been burned on a cross, and Emma would have been subject to rape and ridicule. They had to keep their affair entirely secret. So he raised their child as one of his own. Another of the former slaves\u2014a young woman of mixed blood herself\u2014was accepted as the child\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you mind? Did you hate what happened?\u201d Ashley asked him. \u201cI mean, as a ghost, were you bitter or...can you still hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy soul can know agony,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut did I mind this? No. I loved Emma with my whole heart. And a dead man knows that the color of his skin doesn\u2019t mean a damned thing. I admired Harold. I loved what he did for my family, and how he taught and defended my children. No, I didn\u2019t mind. Not this. I just thought you should know. Maybe it can help you in some way.\u201d</p><p>They both started at a sound that seemed to come from the woods that led straight to the bayou. Ashley quickly stood up. \u201cProbably a raccoon or even a squirrel,\u201d she said and grimaced. \u201cMaybe even a gator.\u201d She walked toward her mare.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a raccoon, squirrel or gator. As she mounted, she heard the noise from the woods by the bayou again.</p><p>\u201cQuickly,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold the path!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it may be nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alone out here. Get back to the house! Please!\u201d</p><p>She almost laughed and reminded her ghost protector that he was dead.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. She turned to ride, finding the quickest path back to the house and kneeing her mare to a gait that would lead it at all speed through the trails without killing them both.</p><p>But as she made her way homeward, something darted into the path in front of her.</p><p>Varina reared, and she wasn\u2019t as prepared as she should have been. She cursed herself for her carelessness as she felt herself fly into the air.</p><p>And land hard on her rump in the middle of the dirt path.</p><p>As she quickly stood, rubbing her injured section, she realized that it had grown late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darkness was falling, and she was alone in the woods.</p><p>Even her ghost was far behind her now.</p><p>Interlude</p> <p>People were easy.</p><p>Pathetically easy.</p><p>Once you knew what they wanted and you dangled it before them as you might dangle a carrot before a horse, they came. They came\u2014just as the stupid animals they were in truth.</p><p>She barely saw him coming.</p><p>She got just a glimpse of him.</p> <p>During the phone call he\u2019d made to her, she\u2019d guessed that he was Jake. She\u2019d giggled.</p><p>He\u2019d almost giggled, too, it was so damned perfect.</p><p>And what an idiot woman. You\u2019d think they\u2019d have to get through some kind of school to broadcast the news. But a pretty blonde was all you had to be, it seemed. Maybe not. Maybe others were smarter.</p><p>He watched her when she came staggering along the overgrown and marshy trail near the bayou, swearing as she did so. Actually, he watched her for a while. He didn\u2019t know what it was about her that had made him want to do this. He\u2019d plotted and planned his first kill forever; he\u2019d thought that it would be his only kill. But he started hearing the voice again. She was nosy. She was going to start dredging things up and just might have some journalistic abilities. The voice said that she needed to go. And looking at her, he had begun to anticipate the kill.</p><p>He glanced toward Beaumont; he could see the plantation through the trees. But there was nothing going on there\u2014the plantation offered its last tour at four, and people were usually off the property by five. Even the actors and historians would all be by the road now, ready to head out.</p><p>She stumbled her way to the small clearing. Her little red spiked heels were completely ruined, and her jacket was torn. But though she was irritated, she wanted the story more. In fact, when he came upon her, she was looking down at her shoes and cursing about how much they had cost her.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it, what the hell are you doing here?\u201d she demanded, tossing back her head of bleached blond curls. \u201cI was expecting\u2014\u201d</p><p>She never voiced what she was expecting. He was quick. The needle got her with such speed that she barely gasped, much less managed to get out a scream.</p><p>As she fell, he heard the horses. He heard the rummaging over on the next trail.</p><p>He had to move with speed.</p><p>He rolled her down to the true swampy area just before the bayou.</p><p>He held her head under in just a half foot of water.</p><p>She didn\u2019t struggle. She was out, and she was easy to kill.</p><p>When she was dead, he couldn\u2019t help but roll her over. He smiled, looking at her face. That pretty, bitchy face, all clotted with mud now. Her lashes were slipping. False lashes; she\u2019d been all makeup and hype and selfishness. Actually, he\u2019d done the damned world a favor.</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t look so good on the eleven o\u2019clock news now. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t find her right away, and they wouldn\u2019t expect to find her out here.</p><p>But somebody was out here now. He had to move.</p><p>And move quickly.</p><p>9</p><p>She stood in gathering twilight, cursing her mare for throwing her.</p><p>Poor mare; it wasn\u2019t her fault\u2014she had been startled. Scared.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, foul rodent!\u201d she cried into the bushes. She swore softly; it was time to walk, and walk quickly. \u201cLast time I follow a ghost into the woods!\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Was it a ghost? Was there really a ghost? Or did she have deep-seated memories that she needed to address, and seeing the ghost of Marshall Donegal was a way of doing it? Hmm. That would be a good one for a shrink.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, people did see ghosts. And maybe it was some kind of a gift, and she\u2019d been far too terrified to ever recognize the possibility before.</p><p>Jake had that gift\u2014that sixth sense or intuition. And when he\u2019d come to her with it, she had simply panicked.</p><p>Well, too late on that one!</p><p>She paused; she heard something coming from the pines and brush closer to the bayou. Gator? It was unlikely that one of the giant crocodilians she\u2019d known all her life was going to come this far in off the bayou and stalk her.</p><p>She quickened her pace.</p><p>Of course, she knew that even on land an alligator could move damned fast as well.</p><p>But, no. The woods here were filled with birds, the bayou was brimming with fish and there were plenty of small mammals. A gator had not had a whiff of her and decided that it was time for his evening meal.</p><p>She heard it again. Definitely not a gator, because she kept hearing the rustling, would stop\u2014and then the rustling would stop as well. A beast of prey would come straight for her.</p><p>She started to run. As she did so, she heard a thrashing in the woods ahead of her and then from one of the other trails.</p><p>She swore and looked around her. There was a fallen slender pine near her, leaning against an oak. She tested the trunk carefully, found that it would bear her weight and crawled up to the branches of the hardier oak. She kept crawling, hoping that whatever was out there didn\u2019t climb trees.</p><p>The thrashing around her grew louder, as if amplified in the thickening darkness of the night. She finally realized that she could hear hoofbeats, and a rider was coming for her. She waited, barely daring to breathe.</p><p>Of course, Cliff knew that she was out here. When her mare came back without her, he\u2019d be on the trail, coming to find her.</p><p>But even as she heard the sound of a horse, she saw something dark below her. Not a creature\u2014a man. A man who looked like a shadow because he was dressed in black: black boots, jeans, sweatshirt and hoodie. He moved with his face lowered, and in the darkness he might have been a black shadow.</p><p>Was she seeing shadows now instead of ghosts?</p><p>No, he was real.</p><p>He was approaching the tree; he paused as if listening.</p><p>She heard her name called through the trees. And she no longer heard the sound of hoofbeats.</p><p>For a moment, the entire world seemed silent. She waited, not daring to breathe.</p><p>Darkness fell in earnest, but the moon prevailed.</p><p>And then, naturally, the moon was covered by clouds.</p><p>Ashley cursed herself for starting out alone tonight. She had to breathe; she tried to do it silently.</p><p>And then, though she couldn\u2019t see him, she was certain that the man below her in the dark hoodie was looking up.</p><p>Did he see her frozen there?</p><p>She held her position. She couldn\u2019t tell if he was there or not anymore; his form seemed to have been swallowed up by the blackness of the ground below.</p><p>There was rustling.</p><p>There was someone below her, someone who seemed to be stalking the area.</p><p>Something banged against the tree. A man\u2019s hand?</p><p>She started to slip; she felt a splinter of bark shoot into her hand and barely kept from crying out. She tried to shift her position and fell, a scream escaping her lips at last.</p><p>She landed hard on human flesh, toppling the standing man to the ground. Panic seized her and she shot out a fist, striking anywhere she could as she tried to rise. She made it halfway to her feet when she heard him shout out.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, Ashley! Why are you hitting me, damn it?\u201d</p><p>Jake.</p><p>She went still and started trembling. For a minute, she still had to wonder if he\u2019d been in the pines before the bayou, stalking her.</p><p>But then both heard it; more noise coming from the trail.</p><p>\u201cAshley! Jake! Where the hell are you two?\u201d</p><p>That was Cliff\u2019s voice.</p><p>And from the bayou, another voice.</p><p>\u201cHey! What\u2019s going on in there? I have a gun, and I know how to use it!\u201d</p><p>Jake scrambled up, half knocking Ashley over but then drawing her to her feet.</p><p>A light suddenly glared into the darkness, and they both raised their hands to protect their eyes. Cliff came trotting up on his favorite mount, Jeff. He dismounted in the little clearing where he found them.</p><p>\u201cCliff!\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your horse?\u201d Cliff asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your horse?\u201d Ashley asked Jake.</p><p>\u201cMine is tethered down the road\u2014he meant you!\u201d Jake told her, irritated. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, skulking around in the woods by yourself? Jesus, Ashley, how much of an idiot are you?\u201d</p><p>He was clearly upset, but he took a step back.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I would have thought that you had some sense.\u201d</p><p>She heard the safety slide on Cliff\u2019s shotgun, and she felt a millisecond of fear again.</p><p>She was wrong; Cliff was bitter, and he was going to shoot her in the woods.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is coming,\u201d he said.</p><p>A minute later, his shotgun aimed at the clearing, Toby Keaton came into view. Seeing them, he lowered his weapon.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? A family meeting? You guys scared the hell out of me! What\u2019s going on over here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI was out riding. Some fairly big mammal scared Varina, my mare,\u201d said Ashley. Ruefully, she added, \u201cShe threw me.\u201d</p><p>Toby looked at Jake, standing beside her, and Cliff, seated again up on Jeff.</p><p>\u201cWith what went on\u2014you all damn near scared the death out of me. I mean, this side is your property, but I\u2019m just a spit across that bayou. You\u2019ve got to warn me when you\u2019re going to be rustling around by the water at night. I can tell the difference between the sound of a gator and the sound of folks stomping around in the woods, you know!\u201d Toby said.</p><p>He was clearly shaken.</p><p>\u201cToby, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Ashley said. She looked at him. His black jacket didn\u2019t have a hood.</p><p>But he might have a hoodie stuck down beneath his coat; his shirt was black as well.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get over here, Toby?\u201d Jake asked him, as if reading Ashley\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cI live next door, remember?\u201d Toby said, exasperated. \u201cOne of my hounds was going crazy, but he lost the scent at the water. I don\u2019t come out at night without a shotgun. God knows when you\u2019re going to come upon a doped-up schoolkid, a gator or, hell, a damned poacher! Or just a nutcase now, like whoever did in old Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Toby, how did you get here?\u201d Ashley repeated. \u201cHave you been over in the woods right by the bayou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came over in my little aluminum canoe,\u201d Toby said. \u201cI heard all manner of rustling\u2014and it\u2019s turned out to be you!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cLook, Ashley, I know we\u2019re all kind of scared right now, so maybe you could quit with the trail riding in the middle of night until they find whoever killed Charles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be out alone again,\u201d Jake said firmly, in a voice that seemed to scrape all the way down her spine. \u201cIt\u2019s pitch-dark and chilly out here, and the mosquitoes are big enough to rustle the woods themselves. We\u2019re going to get on back now.\u201d</p><p>Toby clicked on his own high-beam flashlight. Once again, they protected their eyes.</p> <p>\u201cToby!\u201d Ashley said quickly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you under this tree a few minutes ago?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked at her and squinted. \u201cNo. Well, hell, I don\u2019t think so. I didn\u2019t know what the hell was out here\u2014I was moving around quiet as I could, trying to listen. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I thought I might have seen you,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019d seen me, it would have been nice if you\u2019d said something,\u201d he told her indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m getting back.\u201d</p><p>Toby turned and started tramping down the trail. They could follow the glow of his flashlight as he headed for the bayou.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Jake asked Ashley.</p><p>\u201cI climbed the tree because...because I was afraid. I thought something was stalking me. I saw someone beneath me, and it scared the hell out of me,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing out here?\u201d Jake demanded, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cRiding!\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s right. You shouldn\u2019t have been, and you damned well better not do so again until the killer is found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if you brilliant people with your brilliant team never find the killer?\u201d Ashley demanded.</p><p>Jake didn\u2019t answer. Cliff did.</p><p>\u201cThen we won\u2019t be out here, period. The plantation will go down, and the Donegal family won\u2019t own it anymore. You\u2019ll see sugarcane here, just like you see it beyond the cemetery side.\u201d</p><p>Jake was staring at her; she could see that in the glow of the flashlight Cliff still held on the little copse where they stood.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him. We\u2019ll find the killer,\u201d Jake said, and he turned away. \u201cCome on, you can ride with me.\u201d</p><p>She was angry...and worse, she realized. She was still feeling rejected, no matter how stupid any of it might have been\u2014even if she had been the one to put a block on him years before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ride with Cliff,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Cliff was startled, but he looked down at her with a shrug, sheathed his shotgun in his saddle and shifted the light in his hands to reach down for her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope Varina made her way home\u2014and that your grandfather hasn\u2019t gone out and had a heart attack!\u201d</p><p>With Cliff\u2019s strong grasp, she leapt up behind him on Jeff. Ahead on the trail, finding his way through the dark, Jake mounted up on his horse.</p><p>They made a silent trek back through the woods to the house.</p><p>Approaching the stables, they saw that Varina had indeed made her way home. She was walking around in the center of the stables as if she were teasing the horses who were still in their stalls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the horses,\u201d Cliff said gruffly. \u201cYou get in the house, Ashley, before Frazier realizes that you\u2019re not around anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She started toward the house. Jake was right behind her. She felt him come closer and closer, but she didn\u2019t realize he was going to stop her until she felt his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you really doing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cRiding. I do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight\u2014after a corpse is found in the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and stared at him.</p><p>\u201cA murdered man!\u201d he said with some force.</p><p>\u201cLook, this is my house. I live here, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m under suspicion\u2014by anyone\u2019s standards. I\u2019ll ride when I feel like riding!\u201d she told him.</p><p>She was startled when she suddenly saw him take a breath and smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just talk to Frazier,\u201d he said and walked past her.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Jake, stop!\u201d</p><p>He did so, turning back to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I heard a rumor after the reenactment,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard that Emma Donegal was actually Cliff\u2019s ancestor and not one of the men in the family. She could never admit\u2014not at that time\u2014that she had an ex-slave, Harold Boudreaux, for a lover, or that she\u2019d given birth to a child of mixed blood. But she loved him, and I heard that there was a gravestone out there. She had him buried out by the bayou. I thought if I found the stone, it might all be real. I went to find it.\u201d</p><p>He paused, watching her for a moment. \u201cAnd did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has his name on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe word Friend was carved into it.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet, and his silence seemed to scream that a stone that said Friend didn\u2019t really mean a thing, and that it was incredibly stupid at this time to be wandering around in the woods looking for the headstone of a man who might or might not have been an ancestor\u2019s lover.</p><p>Before they could argue further, the riverside door opened and Beth stepped out. \u201cThere you are! Goodness, I was starting to get worried. Jake, Jackson got back, and he\u2019s looking for you. Crab cakes are on, and it\u2019s time for dinner!\u201d</p><p>Ashley turned from Jake and looked at Beth, forcing a cheerful smile.</p><p>\u201cCrab cakes! Better yet, your crab cakes. Do we have a minute to wash up? Should I call Cliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him on the house phone, honey. You run on up. Angela has given me a hand in the kitchen, and it will all be on the table in ten minutes, so hurry it up, girlfriend! And, we\u2019ve got more company!\u201d</p><p>Ashley looked at her, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWill and Whitney?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. They\u2019re as nice as they can be!\u201d Beth told Ashley.</p><p>Ashley didn\u2019t doubt that the pair was exactly that. She was surprised to feel a little tug at her heart, created by the sound of pleasure in Jake\u2019s voice.</p><p>His friends were there. Maybe Whitney was more than a friend.</p><p>She suddenly felt out of step with his life and ashamed of herself. Jake had been the best friend in the world; she had loved him. She had turned from him. He deserved a little happiness.</p><p>\u201cIt will be great to meet them,\u201d she said.</p><p>She flashed Jake a quick smile, and hurried on into the house.</p><p>It was odd, but somehow the arrival of Will and Whitney\u2014with all their paraphernalia\u2014was like a breath of fresh air.</p><p>A horrible murder had taken place, and they were in the midst of a rough investigation. But Whitney\u2019s vibrant personality made its mark on the solemn household. As they sat down to dinner, she explained the setup that she and Will had carried out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014we haven\u2019t put cameras in anybody\u2019s bedroom,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we do have the house nicely wired for sight and sound. Ashley, you haven\u2019t seen it yet, but there\u2019s a bank of screens in the living room. We have cameras aimed in both of the parlors, out to the front, out to the back and over the cemetery. Tomorrow we\u2019ll set up over the stables. That way, we\u2019ll be apprised of any unwanted visitors on the property. And\u2014\u201d she hesitated, casting Jake a questioning look \u201c\u2014and we\u2019ll be aware of anything that might happen inside the house as well.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Jake again.</p><p>Do they know that we investigate for paranormal occurrences or help? she seemed to be asking.</p><p>\u201cI think what you\u2019ve managed in a few short hours is amazing,\u201d Jake told her. \u201cA camera setup like this will definitely catch anyone trying to play games in the cemetery again. But we have to rig by the river as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve done that,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cWe got here at about the same time, and I asked them to make sure the back wall of the cemetery and the river were both in view on our screens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have an interesting interview with Ramsay Clayton?\u201d Jake asked him.</p><p>\u201cRamsay swears that he gave Charles the role out of the goodness of his heart. He also said that he\u2019ll be back in New Orleans by tomorrow or the next day. He\u2019s buying a guard dog and a pistol and getting a permit\u2014he\u2019s afraid that whoever killed Charles might have really been targeting him,\u201d Jackson told them.</p><p>\u201cThat is a possibility,\u201d Jake agreed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jackson said simply. \u201cHe asked the police for protection. They couldn\u2019t give him anything full-time, but they have patrol cars watching his residence while he\u2019s here. He said that when he goes back into the city, he\u2019s going to stay at a hotel for a week.\u201d Jackson smiled. \u201cThe casino hotel\u2014there\u2019s lots of security around it. Unseen, half the time, maybe, but it is there.\u201d</p><p>Cliff let out a dry laugh. \u201cRamsay is a crack shot. But a dog is a good thing to have. Dogs really have a sixth sense. We used to have a dog.\u201d</p><p>Ashley smiled. \u201cBrutus,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe was a Rottweiler, and I loved him to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jake asked. He\u2019d never met Brutus.</p><p>\u201cHe loved me in return\u2014but he hated the horses and tried to bite them all the time, and they tried to kick him. He went to live with my mom\u2019s cousin in Gainesville. They\u2019re still happy as clams, I believe,\u201d Ashley said. She looked at her grandfather. \u201cI should call Gina. She\u2019s probably heard all this on the news, and she\u2019ll be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready called her and assured her we were fine,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cShe wants you to come stay with her and Brutus. I said it wasn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Ashley told him. She stood and walked over, slipping her arms around him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do this, and Donegal Plantation itself is being victimized.\u201d She stared across the table at Jake. \u201cThis team will find the killer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No one said anything for a minute.

On a school bus with a swarm of children, I\u2019m afraid, but I\u2019ve been here before. It\u2019s a beautiful place, Mr. Donegal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrazier, please,\u201d Frazier told her, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re so kind as to respect your elders, but I am just Frazier.\u201d</p><p>Frazier was a grandmaster at heading his house hold; Ashley seemed quiet during the meal, but Frazier and Beth drew out the newcomers. They learned, of course, that Will was originally from Trinidad, that he had been a musician and an entertainer, specializing in illusion, before he had gotten into law enforcement. Whitney had been a filmmaker, and she loved film\u2014and the world.</p><p>When the meal had ended, Jackson nodded to Jake, and they went to the study together. Jake brought up the lists he had made during the day, along with what he had discovered or not about his defined list of suspects. Then he told Jackson about the events in the woods.</p><p>\u201cSo, Toby Keaton appeared right in the middle of the chaos in the woods?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Jake nodded. \u201cHe\u2019ll bear further investigation. Basically, he and Hank Trebly are the only neighbors. Well, it\u2019s a sugar plantation-slash-mill on the other side, but the two of them are definitely close enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the \u2018Yankees\u2019?\u201d Jackson asked.</p> <p>\u201cJustin Binder is the only man still without a reliable alibi. He was here the night that the body was found. He didn\u2019t leave until the police cleared him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll pay a visit to the sugar mill. And we\u2019ll drop in on Toby Keaton, too.\u201d</p><p>Jackson stood, ready to leave the room first. Jake hesitated a minute, and then rose to follow him. \u201cBy the way,\u201d Jackson told him, pausing at the door.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela says that the house is riddled with ghosts, and half of them don\u2019t know that the other half are around. And none of them is talkative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is a plantation,\u201d Jake said, not yet wanting to talk about Emma Donegal. \u201cWhat self-respecting plantation comes without its share of ghost stories?\u201d</p><p>Jackson studied him and nodded. \u201cRight. Naturally. Maybe we should let the owners tell us about a few. Let\u2019s hear what they have to say.\u201d</p><p>They went out to the front parlor where the bank of screens was set up. Whitney and Will had created their own little viewing station, pulling a few of the big wingback chairs in front of the screens. Whitney turned, seeing him.</p> <p>\u201cHey! I brought something of yours from the hotel that you forgot, and I can\u2019t believe that you forgot it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cYour guitar,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised his brows, opened his mouth and said nothing.</p><p>His guitar.</p><p>He\u2019d never left his guitar anywhere; it was a beloved Fender.</p><p>Ashley and Donegal Plantation. They could make him forget anything.</p><p>He was surprised to see Ashley walk over to the guitar; Whitney had set it against the wall by the fireplace. She gingerly touched the case and looked at him, a nostalgic smile on her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou still have the old Fender,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cPlay something,\u201d Frazier told him. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re all in for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the nights aren\u2019t easy to get through,\u201d Beth said.</p><p>Jake looked at Jackson, who nodded. This is just what we need.</p><p>Jake took out the guitar, sat and tuned it. He looked at Ashley. \u201cStill play the banjo?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, badly,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGo for it!\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, but Frazier said, \u201cCome on, Ashley. For the love of God, let\u2019s have some music. We need something.\u201d</p><p>She hurried up the stairs and returned. Jake looked at her and smiled. \u201c\u2018Never Marry an Ugly Girl?\u2019\u201d</p><p>She nodded. They both played and he sang, and they encouraged everyone to join in on the chorus. Once they had started, they fell in together.</p><p>As if five years had never gone by.</p><p>They played Arlo Guthrie, and Cliff sang, and even Frazier did a rendition of a Frank Sinatra tune.</p><p>It went on for about forty-five minutes, and then Jake drew off his strap and set the Fender down. \u201cHey, let someone else do the entertaining now. Ashley, tell them some of the ghost stories about the place that have some merit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Marshall Donegal, of course,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cThe poor fellow must be turning in his grave at all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Emma Donegal?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t she accused of having killed her husband and somehow covering it all up with\u2014\u2018the Yankee did it!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ashley spoke up indignantly. \u201cThat\u2019s not true at all, and I don\u2019t know where that story got started. There were several diaries kept by the men who survived, and the surviving enemy even told the story the same way. Emma was innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, I thought she was supposed to haunt these halls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. She died here,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cBy then, of course, her daughters were married and her son had children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did she die?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cShe was in the Jeb Stuart room,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>Jake started; that was something he hadn\u2019t known. And it was strange, of course, because he\u2019d always stayed in that room when he had been a guest at the plantation. He lowered his head quickly. Did Emma appear to him because she felt she knew him?</p><p>\u201cThere was a fellow who had a heart attack before a reenactment and died in the stables,\u201d Cliff offered. \u201cI swear, now and then I think I see a shadow out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall Donegal supposedly guards the plantation in death, just as in life,\u201d Frazier told them. \u201cI\u2019m sad to say, in all my days, I\u2019ve never seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever felt one?\u201d Ashley asked him.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cLots of times. I believe that there are spirits here, spirits of the past, of happiness and of trauma. But if we have ghosts, they\u2019re here to guard us, to watch over us. There\u2019s nothing evil at this plantation,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>Ashley spoke slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing evil at the plantation,\u201d she repeated and looked around. \u201cBut the living can certainly be evil. Do you think that...sometimes people create evil where there was none, because they believe that it existed in the past, and they encourage it in the present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of that going around,\u201d Jake said. \u201cTake prejudice, for example, and the old hatreds people never let die. But, yes, Ashley, people can certainly perceive a wrong and turn it into a personal vindication. And it\u2019s possible that\u2019s what happened here\u2014either that or someone\u2019s personal agenda. Who would benefit if this plantation went down? If we can\u2019t find discover why anyone would have hated Charles\u2014or gone after Ramsay Clayton\u2014we have to find out who wants to see you go down like a sinking ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cNo one that you realize,\u201d Jackson told her.</p><p>Beth ended the evening by rising. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. And, may I say, I\u2019m delighted to have you all in the house!\u201d</p><p>Night again, darkness, and the hour growing later.</p><p>Jake stared at the ceiling.</p><p>He remained disturbed at finding Ashley in the woods, though he wasn\u2019t sure why. It seemed apparent that they had all frightened each other.</p><p>Was that all that it had been?</p><p>Ashley had been up a tree. Well, she had heard Toby Keaton. Toby had said that he\u2019d heard commotion\u2014Ashley. And then him\u2014and then Cliff riding behind him.</p><p>Screw it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t sleep. He rose and walked to the double doors that led to the wraparound porch. It occurred to him that a gymnast could easily figure out a way to enter the house by means of the porch. The house did have an alarm system, but, as Frazier had said, it was a bed-and-breakfast. They catered to the public. The doors were seldom locked, so it was doubtful that the alarm was often activated.</p><p>Out on the balcony, he stared at the night. The moon was now up, its light was shining down with a benign glow. He looked to the cemetery, at the ghostly and beautiful tombs.</p><p>And he looked toward Ashley\u2019s room, and then started, because, as if he had willed her there, she appeared on the balcony, encased in her gossamer white robe.</p><p>She looked his way.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNeither could I.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other as heartbeats went by. She kept her distance.</p><p>\u201cYour friends are very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a good team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhitney is a doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s like a little sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>She walked to the railing, looking out as he had done.</p><p>\u201cThe river looks so peaceful tonight\u2014and beautiful in the moonlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so great when you\u2019re in it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTrue. The police have the rifle and the bayonet at their forensics lab?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey crawled all over the property today, too. I didn\u2019t think that they\u2019d find anything, once we\u2014you\u2014had already found the weapon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill you really solve this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so certain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have to be.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away from the balcony and looked at him. \u201cOh, come on, Jake! I\u2019m not walking to you again. I already made the play, and I fumbled badly.\u201d</p><p>For half a heartbeat, he was still. Then he moved. He covered the distance between them and pulled her to him. He didn\u2019t believe he was being used; he wasn\u2019t sure he cared. Something, whatever lay between them, surfaced with the music, in the woods, even as they argued. He\u2019d been looking for it without even being aware ever since he had lost her.</p><p>Feeling her in his arms, he found it.</p><p>He lifted her chin and touched her lips with his, and when he kissed her, she returned it with a passion and hunger that made his knees weak. He had to pick her up and sweep her off her feet quickly\u2014while he still could.</p> <p>He did so.</p><p>\u201cYour room or mine?\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>\u201cEither!\u201d</p><p>He chose his own. He was certain that Emma Donegal knew all about this desperate kind of love and would leave them in peace.</p><p>He lay down with her on the bed, falling into the cool, clean touch of the sheets and the gossamer mist that surrounded her. He smoothed down the white flurry of the gown and met the crystal beauty of her eyes. She stared up at him with complete openness and trust, and he longed to ask her why she had turned from him so completely, but he didn\u2019t dare take a chance with the moment, because it was fragile. He found her mouth again, rubbing his thumb gently over the dampness of her lower lip, cherishing the contours of her face. Then his mouth found hers, and again their kiss was instantly hot and wet and filled with passion and hunger. As they kissed, they fumbled with one another\u2019s clothing, his easy since he was wearing nothing but briefs, hers a bit more complicated since she wore the light robe and a sheath of silk beneath. But making love had always been easy and natural for them, and in seconds he was feeling hunger and awe that he should be lying here with her once again. She was as smooth to his touch as the silk of her gown, and he swept his hands over her shoulders, cradled her breasts, pressed his lips to her collarbone and shuddered with the pleasure of simply touching her, feeling the pressure of her body, the tug of her fingers in his hair.</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>It was as if there should have been more, but it didn\u2019t need to be said.</p><p>\u201cAshley.\u201d He murmured her name in return, his lips against the taut sleekness of her abdomen.</p><p>Her fingertips played over his shoulders and teased down his spine. He tried to hold on tightly to every moment, knowing moments could become nothing more painful or sweet than memories.</p><p>His thought eclipsed to the back of his mind as he rose against her again, found her lips and felt her tear away then to press her mouth against his chest, to press more fully against him. She was a naturally exotic lover, sensually seductive, writhing or undulating just to cast the ultimate moment of arousal in any given place upon his body. He made love to her torso, breathing in the scent of her, tasting the erotic aroma of her soap and essence with his kiss. Her breasts were beautiful and perfectly formed, her waist winnowed away to nothing and her hips were pure fascination. He couldn\u2019t touch them enough with his caress, with his lips, with his hungry kiss. As he moved against her body, he felt her breath, felt her body giving, yearning. He moved lower against her form, kissed her thighs, caressed her sexuality and grew ever more urgently in need as he felt her response to his touch. At last he rose above her, hungrily capturing her mouth once again. So entwined, he sank between her thighs and entered her. Sinking slowly into a state that was sure heaven, only to be followed by the blinding light of movement, urgent and passionate, and the explosive feel of her beneath him, undulating, tightening, wrapping around him and giving to him.</p><p>Her fingers gripped his shoulder, his back, his buttocks. She wound her thighs around him, and they seemed to rocket with the need and energy of lightning. Thunder tore into his heart, and storm winds created by their mingled breath. The world was still, nonexistent, and everything. And then he felt her gasp, felt the give of her body against his, and he allowed himself to climax, feeling as if he had emptied his body and soul. Giant shudders ripped through him in aftermath; he held her closely against him, and they eased back into the night, back into the bed, back into each other.</p><p>I think that I have loved you all my life.</p><p>The words didn\u2019t escape him; he somehow held on to that modicum of control. Instead, he just held her. Yes, he had loved her. Yes, she had turned away from him. And no, he had never really understood. Maybe she hadn\u2019t herself.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t allowed himself to become a pitiable hermit; he had lived life, and he had enjoyed it. He had even had other lovers.</p> <p>Never like this.</p><p>And it was frightening to be with her again. He\u2019d gotten his soul back once. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d ever be so lucky again.</p><p>So he didn\u2019t speak. He just felt their breathing subside together. He listened to her heartbeat, and to his own, and it almost seemed that they there were in a harmony of motion.</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cAshley,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She was silent for a minute, and he wondered what she had really wanted to say. Was it possible that it would have resembled his own thoughts?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019re here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d he told her. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask her questions; she didn\u2019t try to explain. They lay together and drifted, and awoke, and made love again.</p><p>And in the end, he slept with her in his arms.</p><p>Slept deeply, plagued by no nightmares.</p><p>He had been adrift in a boat, knowing that there were those who had to be found. He had seen Ashley, and he had reached for her, and her fingers had slipped through his again and again.</p><p>But now he had caught her.</p><p>And he could dare pray that the nightmares had really ended.</p><p>Interlude</p><p>Tonight...</p><p>Tonight had been exhilarating!</p><p>There had been those moments of stark fear; fear that he would be discovered and caught in the act, that he would be captured.</p><p>There had been those terrible moments of indecision.</p><p>And yet there had been Ashley.</p><p>Ah, Ashley! If she\u2019d been alone, and come upon him, he could have handled her, of course. Not that she was easy\u2014no, not Ashley. She always had been a fighter.</p><p>Difficult to think of her in a coffin, set in a vault and left to disintegrate into dust and bone fragments.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like to think about Ashley dead, not really.</p><p>But the aspect of killing her was suddenly...so seductive.</p><p>Charles was a big old ugly lug; he hadn\u2019t felt much of anything. Marty Dean was a bitch, pure and simple, fake breasts, fake hair, fake smile. He\u2019d felt a pleasure in killing her that he hadn\u2019t felt with old Charles.</p><p>If he had to kill Ashley...</p><p>He would definitely want her drugged. He would want to see her die without a crease in her beautiful face, without a cry of pain. She would be his then, if just briefly.</p><p>Ashley was special. She would fit the bill as no other could, and she would also fulfill something in him, some need he hadn\u2019t known he had....</p><p>Well, not really.</p><p>He broke out suddenly in a cold sweat.</p><p>Tonight...</p><p>Tonight he had almost been caught.</p><p>No.</p><p>He was getting better and better at what he did.</p><p>And they never would catch him.</p><p>10</p><p>Ashley awoke alone.</p><p>She was in the Jeb Stuart room, so she hadn\u2019t imagined a wild and passionate sexual experience.</p><p>In her mind, she had to admit, the fear had existed that she had dreamed the whole thing.</p><p>But, no, she had been with Jake through the night, and that made her wake with a smile. She rose, found her clothing, slipped into it and nearly opened the door to the hall. Remembering that her house was now riddled with cameras, she decided to reach her own room through the wraparound porch.</p><p>She showered quickly and headed downstairs. It was late; it seemed that breakfast was long over; there was no one in the kitchen or dining room, but Beth always had coffee on, so she quickly poured herself a cup and decided to start looking for the others.</p><p>Walking into the roadside parlor, she discovered that Whitney was in front of the bank of screens, comfortably curled into one of the wingback chairs.</p><p>The coffee cup nearly fell from her hands as she realized that one of the screens showed the back of the house\u2014and the wraparound porch.</p><p>Whitney heard her there and turned around. Ashley\u2019s horror must have been clear on her face, because Whitney smiled. \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry! I\u2019m the only one on now. And if there\u2019s anyone in this world who can\u2019t look at the two of you and know that something is going on, that person is certainly blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit stuttering!\u201d Whitney said, laughing. \u201cSit\u2014join me.\u201d</p><p>Ashley sat in the chair next to her. It was amazing\u2014the young woman, and Will, she presumed, had managed to place the cameras so strategically that the whole of the house was covered.</p><p>The outside and the public rooms.</p><p>There were no screens that covered the bedrooms, just as Whitney had said.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson and Jake have gone to the sugar mill, and then they\u2019re going to stop in on Hank Trebly,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cAngela is upstairs with a few folks from the police forensics team\u2014they\u2019re trying to discover anything they can about who might have stolen the Enfield. Will has gone to get Jenna. You haven\u2019t met her yet, but you\u2019ll love her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth? My grandfather?\u201d Ashley asked.</p><p>\u201cJackson and Jake are dropping them off at a diner down the street\u2014they needed to get out for a bit,\u201d Whitney explained. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014they\u2019ll get them on the way back. Beth suggested that they wait for you, but your grandfather was insistent that you get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was good to sleep,\u201d Ashley admitted. \u201cSo, what have you seen on the screens? Anything\u2014besides me sneaking back into my own bedroom by way of the balcony?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whitney smiled at that. It was an honest smile. Ashley thought that she and Jake really were just friends. Caring friends, but no more. And it was easy to understand. Whitney was impossible not to like.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll roll some tape. It\u2019s interesting,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>She hit a button on her remote and directed Ashley to watch the top screen. She did so. The screen captured the area between the stables and the cemetery.</p> <p>Shadows seemed to undulate on the screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ashley asked her.</p><p>\u201cThe past?\u201d Whitney queried in return. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Skeptics would swear that you\u2019re seeing movement because of clouds and the moon. I think it may well be the movement of ghosts.\u201d Whitney looked at her; she wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cIt seems that sometimes energy remains\u2014energy from a particularly traumatic event, such as men dying in battle. Some people believe that such hauntings are repetitious\u2014it\u2019s just the energy, running in the same pattern over and over again. Then, of course, there\u2019s what they call an intelligent, or active, haunting. That refers to a ghost or ghosts who still have their wits about them. And they don\u2019t repeat an action over and over. They move about and watch the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ashley said simply.</p><p>Whitney smiled again. \u201cSo, what kind of haunting do you know best? I have a feeling about you. You\u2019re like Angela\u2014you just don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is afraid at first,\u201d Whitney told her.</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf ghosts, of course,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Ashley just stared at her.</p><p>Whitney continued. \u201cThe thing is, most of the time, they just want to help. They\u2019ve made their mistakes. They want to keep others\u2014especially their descendants\u2014from making the same mistakes. I know that this house is haunted, but ghosts, in my experience, don\u2019t want to meet everyone. I believe, though, that the ghosts very much want to meet you. They love you. They want to shield you from all danger, and they want to preserve Donegal Plantation, too, because it carries an important lesson. The place is all about the path that we\u2019ve taken as Americans, the good things and the bad. The sane among us don\u2019t want to repeat mistakes of misunderstanding, cruelty to our fellows or war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe we do a good job with education here,\u201d Ashley said. She realized that her voice sounded raspy. She took a long swallow of her coffee, afraid to say anything else.</p><p>Whitney smiled and shrugged. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s what I believe,\u201d she said softly. Then she added, \u201cHey, that was great last night\u2014the music, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake and I played together...before,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cThat was obvious. You\u2019re really good together,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cIn many ways.\u201d She set the remote down, stood and stretched. \u201cHey, want to introduce me to the horses? I love horses, and I never get to ride. I\u2019d love to meet them. We\u2019re certainly safe enough\u2014the place is surrounded by cops at this moment, and besides, Angela is here. She made some of the best scores ever at the target range back when she was a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe Angela was a cop,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s like a fairy-tale princess in a patrol car, huh? But, hey, even Disney princesses are toughening up these days. We\u2019re all capable of many things, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I like to believe,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cIs it all right to leave the screens unattended?\u201d</p><p>Whitney nodded. \u201cEverything is taping.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cOkay, so half my job today is to make sure you\u2019re safe. We might as well enjoy it, right?\u201d</p> <p>Ashley smiled. \u201cYes, and I love our horses, too. Come on out and meet them.\u201d</p><p>It was obvious Hank Trebly wasn\u2019t pleased to see Jake and Jackson\u2014he left them sitting patiently in his waiting room for an hour.</p><p>He nodded curtly to them after emerging from his office and motioned to them to follow. He didn\u2019t shake their hands, even though he\u2019d known Jake before, just as Toby Keaton had known him, from the days when he had been at Donegal Plantation constantly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think I can tell you,\u201d Hank said, pulling out the chair behind his desk in his office and taking a seat. \u201cI was there, yes, of course. But I didn\u2019t see anything. And I told that to the police. They sent a man around right after, you know\u2014right after they found the poor bugger\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t particularly fond of him, were you?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Trebly immediately took a defensive tone. \u201cWhat was to like or dislike? He was O\u2019Reilly\u2019s stepson, and he didn\u2019t really belong. I mean, he never even took his stepfather\u2019s name. He was...just this big nothing, always there, always wanting to be a part of it all. He didn\u2019t have anything to add to any of our conversations in a roundtable. It was his place to play a Yankee, but he whined so much Ramsay gave him the role of Marshall Donegal. But I didn\u2019t hate him. And, sweet Jesus, I could never do that to another human being! I mean, why in hell would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jake said, \u201cthere\u2019s that bid you made to take over the Donegal property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Trebly said, sitting up straight. His eyes narrowed. \u201cFrazier Donegal told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, Frazier didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Jake said. \u201cIt\u2019s public record. Right after Frazier\u2019s son, Patrick, died, the property fell into bankruptcy. You went to the bank, trying to coerce a sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014well, that\u2019s just pure bull!\u201d Trebly said, but his face had gone pale. \u201cLook, I was willing to help Frazier out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThere were also plans on file to expand the sugar mill and the sugar fields.\u201d</p><p>Trebly sat back and stared at them hard. Then he dug around in his desk for a business card and tossed it over to Jackson. \u201cI\u2019m done speaking with you. If you need anything else from me, you can call my attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jackson said, rising. \u201cWe\u2019ll do so.\u201d</p><p>Jake stood behind him. Trebly didn\u2019t rise; he looked like he was going to explode.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back here, Jake Mallory.\u201d His voice broke. \u201cYou\u2019re not wanted in the area. That was obvious after Patrick died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what I do,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back,\u201d Trebly repeated.</p><p>Jake shrugged and started out. He was surprised when Jackson lingered. \u201cIs that a threat, Mr. Trebly? Because if so, you just threatened a government agent. I could actually have you brought in for that.\u201d</p><p>Trebly rose at last. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, damn you, and I don\u2019t know anything about who did. I didn\u2019t like Charles Osgood, but Ashley was probably the only person who felt sorry for him\u2014or even felt genuinely bad that he was dead. Hell, yes, we could have used that land, but I didn\u2019t force the issue. Old Frazier pulled it together. We aren\u2019t expanding, and I didn\u2019t kill Charles Osgood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your time, Mr. Trebly,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cJackson?\u201d</p><p>Jackson turned around at last and they left the offices and the mill building.</p><p>\u201cThe man is an ass!\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But I believe him. I don\u2019t think that he did it.\u201d</p><p>Jackson shrugged. \u201cRight now, I can\u2019t really tell. He was shaking, and he looks as if he might have really high blood pressure. He\u2019s not in the best physical shape, and we are looking for someone with strength and dexterity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move on to Beaumont,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick up Frazier and Beth, drop them back at the plantation. I don\u2019t want them deciding to get back some other way.\u201d</p><p>Jake didn\u2019t reply. Jackson was worried about the plantation household.</p><p>So was Jake.</p><p>As long as the cops were still on duty, treating the entire plantation as a crime scene, the plantation itself seemed safe.</p><p>But that\u2019s where Charles Osgood had been found. Safe was the last word he\u2019d use.</p><p>\u201cThis is my favorite, my mare\u2014even though she gave me a toss last night!\u201d Ashley said, stroking Varina\u2019s soft nuzzle. \u201cOn this side, next to Varina, you have Jeff\u2014after Jeff Davis, of course\u2014and at the end, down there, Bobby\u2014for Robert E. Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA true Southern stable!\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cNot really. Across there you have Abe\u2014for Abraham Lincoln\u2014and then Nellie and Tigger. Go figure. We just weren\u2019t consistent, I\u2019m afraid. Actually, Jeff is Nellie\u2019s offspring, so we did name him, but we named him Jeff because we already had a Varina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI wish we could go riding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go riding,\u201d Ashley said. She saw Whitney\u2019s face. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m not allowed to go riding. It\u2019s light out, though. So can I go with you?\u201d</p><p>Whitney was thoughtful for a minute. \u201cI\u2019ll give Jake a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Jackson was the head of the unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake gave me the order.\u201d Whitney grimaced.</p><p>\u201cLook, I went out late yesterday afternoon, and I shouldn\u2019t have, but honestly, I didn\u2019t think Varina would throw me. And nothing happened, really. We just all scared each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Toby Keaton showed up, and no one trusts the man at the moment,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Cliff,\u201d Ashley added.</p><p>Whitney watched her, nodded, and slowly smiled. \u201cYou think we\u2019re full of it for suspecting Cliff, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. He is a suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, so I\u2019ve been told\u2014because he has access, he has motive,\u201d Ashley finished.</p><p>Whitney drew out her cell phone. She turned away from Ashley, putting through her call. Ashley could hear Jake\u2019s voice on the other end of the line, but she couldn\u2019t make out his words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Whitney was smiling when she hung up.</p><p>\u201cWe have permission? I\u2019m shocked,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to protect you, you know,\u201d Whitney said.</p> <p>Ashley smiled. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said quietly. He was trying to protect her. \u201cBut you know what? I may not have been a cop like Angela, and I may not be a crack shot\u2014but I did grow up here, and I do know how to use a shotgun. Guess I\u2019ll go drag mine out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Angela. Jackson and Jake are almost back with your grandfather and Beth. If you get the horses saddled\u2014and I\u2019m a decent rider, not great\u2014we can head out as soon as they drop off Frazier and Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014they have another stop to make. They\u2019re going to have a talk with Toby Keaton,\u201d Whitney explained.</p><p>Whitney headed back to the house, her dark curls bouncing as she walked. Ashley was about to knock on Cliff\u2019s door and find out if he\u2019d mind helping her saddle up the horses, when he walked out.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re expecting a load of hay,\u201d he told her. \u201cI imagine the cops will let that through. Seems like they\u2019ve been doing a good job, though. I haven\u2019t seen any reporters around for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019ve decided that peering in from the road just isn\u2019t that exciting,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cApparently, they\u2019ve got something going with the police. I think that a police spokesperson has been handling news on the investigation. Well, actually, what do I know? We\u2019re all at the house having the same experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCops are supposed to come out\u2014or forensic people, whatever they are\u2014and go over my apartment,\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Ashley asked him.</p><p>\u201cI want to be cleared,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re clear in my book.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, and that\u2019s what counts to me. But I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life with people glaring at me if they don\u2019t catch the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll catch him,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake said so,\u201d Ashley told him.</p><p>Cliff nodded. \u201cWell, God knows\u2014I hope so. I pray so, Ashley, I really do.\u201d</p><p>They looked at one another as they heard tires on the gravel near the front. Walking around, they saw that a white minivan had just pulled into the front. Will Chan emerged, followed by a tall, slim, red haired woman.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d she called out, seeing them watching her from a distance.</p><p>She said something to Will, who nodded and grinned. He went for the bags at the back of the car while she walked over to them.</p> <p>Her brilliant green eyes shone out over her easy smile. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Jenna,\u201d she said, offering her hand.</p><p>\u201cJenna, lovely to meet you. We\u2019ve been expecting you, of course,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cWelcome to Donegal Plantation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant,\u201d she said. There was a lilt to her voice, very soft, and yet it spoke of an Irish background.</p><p>Jenna looked at Cliff and seemed to assess him quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff. Cliff Boudreaux. Suspect,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, we\u2019re all suspect at one time or another, aren\u2019t we, then?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, Jenna,\u201d Cliff said. He was grinning; the two were looking at one another with amusement and something like an instant rapport. Ashley found herself amused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you into the house, Jenna, and show you to a room. There are a few left to choose from\u2014\u201d Ashley began.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014and have\u2014slept on many a floor. Put me wherever you would like, and I\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d Jenna assured her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cliff, would you saddle Varina, Nellie and Tigger for me? Whitney wants to go riding, and Angela is going to come, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiding?\u201d Jenna\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cCliff, add Jeff to the horse list, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think she\u2019d do well on Bobby. You\u2019re a rider, aren\u2019t you, Jenna?\u201d Cliff asked.</p><p>\u201cI like to think so,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cBobby, then. Bobby it is!\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>\u201cAre you joining us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a delivery. But hopefully we\u2019ll get a chance somewhere along the line to head out together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>Bemused, Ashley led their new guest to the house.</p><p>Frazier and Beth were still sipping coffee when Jake and Jackson went in to pick them up for the ride back to the house.</p><p>They both looked a little brighter for having escaped the house for a while, but Beth was grave.</p><p>\u201cWe have another missing person,\u201d Beth said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jake asked her.</p><p>She lifted her coffee cup and indicated the television above the diner\u2019s counter.</p><p>\u201cThe news just had a thing about it. That reporter\u2014I think you knew her?\u2014Marty. Marty Dean. She didn\u2019t show up for work today, and her station has plastered her picture on the news a dozen times. See\u2014it\u2019s who you know,\u201d Beth commented to Frazier. \u201cThis woman was a newscaster\u2014people saw her every day. So they ignored us when Charles disappeared, but they\u2019re all over it now because she\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cHer coworkers believe she wouldn\u2019t miss work. Ashley was upset about Charles. She knew him. She knew something bad was going on when he turned up missing. But Charles didn\u2019t work for a news program, and neither did Ashley. If I hadn\u2019t known Adam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about the people who don\u2019t know Adam, either,\u201d Beth pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThey might have found Charles alive if anybody had really been looking,\u201d Frazier said.</p><p>Jake stared at the television. An old Western rerun was playing.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say about Marty Dean?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe rushed out on a tip yesterday afternoon, said she\u2019d be back for the eleven-o\u2019clock news, but she didn\u2019t make it,\u201d Beth said. \u201cShe still hasn\u2019t shown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was in New Orleans, right?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Beth nodded. \u201cYes, she disappeared from New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>Jake looked at Jackson. He had a bad feeling\u2014a really bad feeling.</p><p>But the police in New Orleans would certainly be on the disappearance. Forty-eight hours or not, the media would be forcing them into action.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get them back and look in on Toby Keaton,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>It was nice, riding with the other women, even if their previous acquaintance made her the odd man out.</p><p>Jenna was a welcome addition. She was sweet and energetic, but it was really the accent, Ashley decided. Americans loved accents from the British Isles, English or any variety, whether Irish, Scottish or Welsh.</p><p>And Jenna oohed and aahed over the river, over the cemetery, over the horses, over everything. She seemed to love Donegal Plantation, and as they rode, she told Ashley that her expertise was in nursing.</p><p>\u201cA federal agent\u2014in nursing?\u201d Ashley asked.</p><p>Jenna waved a hand in the air. \u201cI have other talents,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as good as Angela,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cBut I speak with the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little subtlety might be in order!\u201d Whitney called out.</p><p>Ashley twisted around in the saddle to see Angela, who was also rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe cameras, the shadows, Jake...is this a paranormal unit?\u201d Ashley asked.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014we\u2019re a regular unit,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a special one,\u201d Whitney told her.</p><p>\u201cWe look for what\u2019s real,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cBut we may be able to find what everyone can see by seeing what everyone can\u2019t. There, does that clear it all up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like Mississippi mud,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cJackson came from a regular behavioral-sciences unit,\u201d Angela said. \u201cThen Adam Harrison formed a team when Senator Holloway\u2019s wife, Regina, died. Jackson knew all about forming a team and learning each member\u2019s specialty, but Adam had done the legwork already, finding those he wanted.\u201d</p><p>Ashley studied them all. \u201cI know the case, of course. But people were saying that ghosts had killed Regina Holloway. I suppose we\u2019re in much the same position here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Here\u2019s the thing. Jackson knows that things happen out of the norm, but he\u2019s also aware that living people usually prove to be behind it,\u201d Angela explained. \u201cHe\u2019s a true skeptic\u2014a prove-it-to-me man. The thing is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts do exist,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cAnd no one sees them more clearly than Angela.\u201d</p><p>Ashley looked ahead as they rode on.</p><p>Had Angela seen Marshall Donegal yet? She hadn\u2019t seen him herself today. Maybe he had decided he might find a more intelligent life force in someone else?</p><p>Angela smiled. \u201cWell, I also believe there has to be human evil involved. But...Whitney is telling you the truth. We investigate for ghosts. Not because they\u2019re evil, though, honestly, evil men make evil ghosts. They\u2019ll encroach on someone\u2019s mind, but they can\u2019t carry out evil deeds. It\u2019s like hypnotism. If it\u2019s something you won\u2019t do, you still won\u2019t do it, no matter how a ghost tries to play with your imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. It sounds like you\u2019re saying \u2018The ghost made me do it!\u2019\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Angela said gravely. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that...well, if the evil in a man\u2019s soul or spirit remains behind, it can act as fuel to someone who is already a madman. But most of the time, those souls that linger are yearning only to bring something to right, to protect those they might have loved. To bring about some kind of resolution or conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. What about a ghost who lingers over a hundred and fifty years?\u201d Ashley asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that ghosts have lingered much longer,\u201d Angela said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re just waiting to be freed. And, I imagine, sometimes they like being ghosts and doing what they can for the living. God knows, I don\u2019t have all the answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014you talk to ghosts!\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>Angela smiled. \u201cYes, but you see\u2014they don\u2019t have all the answers, either. This direction we\u2019re riding in\u2014it\u2019s toward the bayou and the plantation next door?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, our best trails are out this way toward the bayou. Just past the outbuildings on the other side, it all turns into barbed wire for the sugar fields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere have to be gators out here,\u201d Whitney commented.</p><p>\u201cThere are. We leave them alone, they leave us alone,\u201d Ashley told her. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll only see them when we\u2019re right on the bayou. They seldom venture as far as the riding trails. They like their watery habitat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlligators. Ugh,\u201d Jenna said, shuddering.</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, we worry more about the snakes,\u201d Ashley told her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, great! It might be about time to head back, eh, friends?\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cJust a bit farther, please,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI want to see the Creole plantation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bayou is between our property and Beaumont,\u201d Ashley told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I just want to see it from here,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just up ahead. There\u2019s a twist in the trail that goes right down by the bayou,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see it from across the water there.\u201d</p> <p>Jake parked in front of Beaumont.</p><p>It was an entirely different place from Donegal Plantation, not as grand, and there was no canopy of oaks along a sweeping front drive. By car, the house was reached by a massive gravel parking lot in front. Wooden fencing surrounded the residence itself, which was only two stories. Jake had been in Beaumont himself, and he found it as fascinating as Donegal, just different. Here workrooms and space for the animals had once taken up the first floor, or raised basement, while the household had always lived in the second floor. Like many of the other plantations, Beaumont had been a working sugarcane farm, and the outbuildings remained as they had been, important parts of the tours that were given here. The Creole way of life, rather than that of the English planter, held sway here.</p><p>Toby Keaton had inherited the house through his mother\u2019s side of the family. She had been a Thibadeux, from an old French family. His father, whose family line also went back for generations, had hailed from the English who had settled in the Garden District of New Orleans. Toby had been divorced for years; his one son, now in college, was being groomed to take over the family business when Toby grew weary of it...or willing to give up being the one in charge. Jake could remember meeting Josiah Keaton; he had been a handsome yet solemn young teen when he had last seen him, aware of the responsibility that would one day be his.</p><p>\u201cIntriguing place,\u201d Jackson said, sliding his sunglasses down on his nose as they emerged from the car.</p><p>\u201cToby runs a good business,\u201d Jake said. \u201cHe and Frazier have always supported one another.\u201d</p><p>Jackson looked at him. \u201cBut Donegal Plantation has become a bed-and-breakfast. Beaumont has to be doing better.\u201d</p><p>Jake shrugged. \u201cIt pulls in a higher gross, yes. But the expenses are higher, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, Toby Keaton could want Donegal to go down. And last night, when you went after Ashley, the man made an appearance in the dark\u2014on the other side of the bayou.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Before the path that led to the house there was a little kiosk where tickets could be bought. A woman wearing French Creole Empire\u2013style clothing, circa 1820, was behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Jake said. He flashed his badge; he didn\u2019t know her. She was young and had probably taken work here to get through school herself. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for Mr. Keaton. Can you tell me where to find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish!\u201d she said irritably. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been around this morning\u2014and he\u2019s supposed to be handing out paychecks. His car is here, but he is not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives here,\u201d Jake said politely. \u201cHe has to be somewhere.\u201d He pointed to an overhang in the parking area; there was a shiny new Honda parked there. \u201cIs that his car?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She flushed, looking at Jake. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Officer. I just don\u2019t know where he is. I\u2019ve tried his cell phone, but he wasn\u2019t answering. I opened the sales window at ten, just as I\u2019m supposed to do. Everyone who is supposed to be here working is\u2014you can ask Dan out by the field, or Martha, who gives the tours up at the house. Maybe one of them has seen him.\u201d</p><p>Jake glanced at Jackson and thanked the girl. They walked up to the house, where a costumed interpreter\u2014Martha, he assumed\u2014met them at the door. \u201cThe next tour starts in thirty minutes,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to explore the grounds while you wait.\u201d</p><p>Once again, they produced their badges.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear!\u201d Martha said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Oh, is this about poor Mr. Osgood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak with Mr. Keaton,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could help you, sir. Mr. Keaton hasn\u2019t checked in with any of us this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that unusual?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, of course. He is a hands-on man where business is concerned,\u201d she said. She was thoughtful. \u201cWell, of course, there was the morning after he\u2019d met with a few of his cronies, and we found him passed out in one of the rooms we show. It was rather frightening. We have mannequins in that room to add to the historical setting, and there was the monsieur, the madame, the jeune fille\u2014and Mr. Keaton, all messed up and on the bed between them all! My poor guests\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not there now, you\u2019re certain, is he?\u201d Jake interrupted.</p><p>\u201cOh, no! I\u2019ve had several tours through the house already today!\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t suppose that anyone has searched all the outbuildings. There isn\u2019t a guide stationed in every one. We have a girl who comes in at ten\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. I understand there\u2019s someone in the field we might talk to?\u201d Jake interrupted again.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, silly me, I do go on. I can see Dan now\u2014he\u2019s in the straw hat, over down by that wheelbarrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jake told her.</p><p>He felt a growing concern as he and Jake walked down the expanse of sloping lawn to find Dan, a tall, muscular, African-American man sorting through an enormous pile of produce.</p><p>Jake remembered Dan, though he doubted that Dan would recognize him.</p><p>But Dan did.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Jake Mallory? Sad things going on, sad things! Why, I remember you riding like wildfire all over that big plantation next door,\u201d the man said to him, giving Jake a brief hug.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again,\u201d Jake said. \u201cWe\u2019re here looking for Mr. Keaton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Dan said. \u201cPaychecks are due today, and if you don\u2019t remind that man, he doesn\u2019t remember to pay us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we start searching for him? Have you been in all the outbuildings today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave tours in the old kitchen and the smokehouse. I have been in all the slave quarters. They should be open, though. Martha walked around and unlocked them as soon as we came in and saw that Toby wasn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hand, if you need,\u201d Dan offered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Dan. It won\u2019t take us long,\u201d Jake assured him. \u201cYou seem busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get these to the kitchen, but if you need me, just holler.\u201d</p><p>They started for the row of old wooden slave quarters. But before they reached the first, a bloodcurdling scream stopped them in their tracks. It came from the other side of the bayou.</p><p>The scream was followed by a volley of gunshots.</p><p>11</p><p>Ashley had heard the grunting long before they\u2019d reached the bayou.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the Lord\u2019s name is that?\u201d Angela demanded.</p><p>\u201cGator,\u201d Ashley told her. \u201cSometimes it sounds like you stumbled upon an entire pig farm. That\u2019s the noise alligators make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we come any closer?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine. We just stay on the road and make sure that we don\u2019t bother them. Remember, we don\u2019t bother them, and they don\u2019t bother us. They\u2019re really not insane predators chasing everything that moves,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cThey can move on land, and move fast, but, usually, they hunt in the water. They wait for their opportunity, and they snap, and then twist and turn in the water, drowning their prey. They\u2019re as instinctive as other predators\u2014they don\u2019t want an eye gouged out by a flailing claw or the like. If you go to any of the gator parks, you\u2019ll hear them sound like that when it\u2019s mating season, or when an employee is about to hand out the chickens\u2014dead, of course.\u201d</p><p>She was in the lead, but Whitney was right behind her. Ashley had twisted in her saddle to speak, and so she didn\u2019t know what Whitney saw when her eyes suddenly went wide and a scream escaped her lips.</p><p>Ashley turned back; she didn\u2019t scream. She let out a gasp of horror and pulled out the shotgun she had opted to bring along on the trail.</p><p>She could see why the gators were going crazy.</p><p>They had been fed.</p><p>Some were on the embankment; some thrashed in the water, adolescents and adults, maybe eight to ten in total. It was difficult to tell, because they were snapping at one another, the large ones going after the smaller ones. But they were all hungry for human flesh.</p><p>A number of the beasts had already started in on the bodies; it almost appeared that they had been playing with mannequins. The two bodies in the water were muddied and mangled beyond description, certainly, at this point, past any sense of pain or horror. It was impossible to tell if they\u2019d been dead when they\u2019d been discovered by the alligators, or if the gators had gone entirely mad and attacked two human beings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Usually, upon discovering large dead prey, an alligator would drag it around until decomposition and the water softened down the bones, but when they started fighting over prey, it was like a scene out of a horror movie. The bodies might have been toys being ripped apart by children; the snapping jaws landed on limbs, and they were ripped cleanly away.</p><p>Ashley took aim at the head of a large adult, aiming right between the eyes. Her shot was true; the jaws clamped shut, but then the gator began to sink. Behind her, Angela was taking aim with her pistol. Ashley shouted, \u201cThe eyes! Strike between the eyes!\u201d Luckily, the horses had grown up around hunters, and though Varina had thrown her before, the sound of the gun didn\u2019t bother any of the horses.</p><p>Ashley emptied the second barrel of her shotgun, horrified at what she was seeing and equally horrified that she was killing so many of the beasts who were only acting as nature intended; she felt a sinking certainty that the alligators hadn\u2019t attacked standing adults. They wouldn\u2019t have needed to, and they wouldn\u2019t have attacked unless an idiot had gone with food and become part of it. They would, as they were doing, go for a tasty morsel of meat that was dead and decomposing.</p> <p>Angela was shooting with a pistol, and her shots riddled the air as Ashley reloaded.</p><p>The scent of dead alligators mingled with that of ripped flesh\u2014and more fights erupted, but the sound of the shots was finally entering into their lima-bean-sized brains, and they began to move off at last. Ashley and Angela stopped shooting.</p><p>Whitney, as stunned and shaken as the rest of them by the bizarre and horrible spectacle, fumbled for her cell phone. But before she could dial with her trembling fingers, they heard shouts.</p><p>Across the bayou, men burst through the trees. Jake and Jackson were followed by Dan, Toby Keaton\u2019s manager. He was armed with a shotgun, while Jake and Jackson had drawn pistols.</p><p>They didn\u2019t need to fire; they clearly saw the carnage, and it was evident that they were equally stunned and appalled by the sight.</p> <p>\u201cAshley! I\u2019m getting the bodies out. Cover me,\u201d Jake shouted, his voice stretching across the thirty feet of muck and water. He stared at the women on the horses, and back to the water, at the gators now whipping their tails to escape, and back to the dead creatures, floating absurdly between what remained of the human corpses.</p><p>He started into the water.</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d Jackson roared.</p><p>Jake looked up. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, Jackson. Aim for the head, the eyes if you can, if anything starts to come near me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, don\u2019t!\u201d Ashley screamed.</p><p>But even Jackson seemed to know that Jake was right and motioned him forward. To discover anything\u2014who the mangled bodies had been\u2014they had to get them out of the bayou. Now.</p> <p>Jake, maintaining a grasp on his pistol, walked carefully into the slick muddy water of the bayou, and seemed to sink into it slowly. The deepest water here was about five feet; his head was still above water when he pushed his way past a dead alligator and reached the first body. Grasping it around the shoulder with his one hand, still watchful of any movement near him, he eased back to the bank with it. Watching, Ashley still couldn\u2019t tell if the mud encrusted pile of death was male or female. She could see that it was missing limbs.</p><p>She wiped sweat from her brow, barely blinking, watching the water for any sign of movement. An alligator could have been lurking below and heading out to strike beneath the surface, but there was no way for the great jaws to snap shut on a standing man unless the beast twisted and turned, and she would see that motion.</p><p>She heard Whitney chanting behind her.</p><p>\u201cJake, come on, Jake, Jake, Jake....\u201d</p><p>He went back for the second body while Jackson and Dan pulled the first up the bank. Dan was already on the phone, Ashley saw out of the corner of her eye. Help would be coming soon.</p><p>Not soon enough for those being dragged from the bayou....</p><p>She saw a ripple in the water twenty feet from Jake. There was no way to take aim between the eyes, so she calculated a few feet before the ripple and shot, and then shot again. Willing herself not to fumble, she tore at the packaging of a cartridge and loaded again.</p><p>But the ripple bobbed to the surface; she\u2019d made a clean kill, and Jake grasped the remains of the second body and dragged it to the embankment. As he crawled out, Jackson reached down to drag him from the water and up the slick, muddy embankment.</p> <p>He stood up; his eyes met hers across the water, but he wasn\u2019t smiling. He was grim.</p><p>\u201cWe found Toby Keaton,\u201d he said dully, his voice barely carrying across the water.</p><p>\u201cGod in Heaven! God in his Heaven!\u201d Augie breathed, looking at the corpses. Jake knew, of course, that finding a corpse in situ was the best possible place for a medical pathologist to first encounter a murder victim, but if they hadn\u2019t intervened, there might not have been actual body parts to be discovered. Toby Keaton was already missing a lower leg and his left arm, and the woman\u2014Marty Dean, of all people\u2014had lost her right arm to the shoulder and was missing a calf and foot on the opposite leg. Lain out, high on the grassy embankment of Beaumont, they formed pieces of a grisly human puzzle. Ashley, Angela, Jenna and Whitney had described their discovery of the bodies\u2014and the gators\u2014once the authorities had arrived and ridden back to Donegal Plantation.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me how they died?\u201d Jackson asked Augie.</p><p>Augie, down on his knees near the heads, looked up at Jackson. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they were killed by the gators,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI agree, but I\u2019m going to have to get them back to the office to determine an exact cause.\u201d He indicated the places where flesh had been torn away. \u201cThese pieces have most probably been consumed, but I\u2019m not seeing a blood flow on the bodies or in the water that would indicate that their hearts were still pumping when the alligators attacked, and liver temperature suggests that they\u2019ve been dead for hours\u2014twelve to twenty-four\u2014but they\u2019ve been in the bayou, so that can mess with temperature. I\u2019m not seeing any gunshot wounds or slashes that look as if they were made by anything but giant snapping jaws. Frankly, I wouldn\u2019t trust any of my own findings in these circumstances until I\u2019ve had time at autopsy. Jesus! Jesus, Mary and Joseph!\u201d Augie finished, crossing himself.</p><p>\u201cMight be the same, though,\u201d Augie added after a moment.</p><p>\u201cSame as what?\u201d Jackson asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cI found massive doses of benzodiazepine\u2014a sedative\u2014along with chlorzoxazone\u2014a muscle relaxant\u2014in Charles Osgood\u2019s body. I believe that Charles was held unconscious and controlled by the two drugs until he was taken, still unconscious, to be killed at the site in the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>Jake looked at Jackson; they both held silent. Drugs were involved. Either they might start looking at M.D.s or pharmacists\u2014or at robberies of pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices.</p><p>Such as the offices of Dr. Ben Austin?</p><p>Jake decided to see what else Augie could tell them before assuming that these two had been killed the same way.</p><p>Mack Colby arrived. Both Jackson and Jake stared at him across the gruesome display of the bodies.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc, help me out here!\u201d the detective protested. \u201cWe just received the reports when we were called out here. Throw us a bone, here, please. Help in any way you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my best\u2014with what I\u2019ve got,\u201d Augie said. \u201cThose reports were sent to you, too, Mr. Crow,\u201d he said. \u201cI emailed you a copy of my findings just about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Jackson nodded. Jake said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Mack Colby asked.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t death by drowning, and it\u2019s no damned accident, I\u2019m certain,\u201d Colby said. \u201cSo, do we proceed with this as a dual investigation as well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe would certainly appreciate continuing so, since Mr. Keaton has been a suspect in our existing joint investigation,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>They heard a shout from one of the uniformed officers who had been searching the surroundings on the Donegal side of the bayou.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a shotgun here,\u201d the officer cried.</p><p>He was down near the water and holding up the weapon with a gloved hand.</p><p>\u201cProbably Toby\u2019s,\u201d Dan offered. His dark eyes were red-rimmed; he might have had a few arguments with his employer, but it was obvious he had cared. \u201cHow the damned hell did someone get to Toby when he always went out with his shotgun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he saw someone he thought was a friend,\u201d Jackson suggested.</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stand here seeing this anymore,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just waiting for gator season,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame a wild creature for acting like a wild creature,\u201d Augie said, standing and placing a hand on Dan\u2019s arm. \u201cThere was most certainly a human monster involved in this, and rest assured, the law will take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t stop,\u201d Jake said as Dan looked at him.</p><p>\u201cHope you find him first,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Jake hoped they did, too; the man was extremely tall, but he was pure muscle. And that kind of muscle combined with pain and fury could be dangerous.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man. Don\u2019t go trying to solve this yourself. There is no such thing as a righteous kill. You\u2019ll wind up in prison,\u201d Jake told him.</p><p>Dan lifted his hands. \u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou keep the place running for Toby\u2019s son,\u201d Jake told him.</p><p>\u201cClose her down for a few days. We have to get to the bottom of this,\u201d barked Colby.</p><p>\u201cI live here, too, in one of the old smokehouses,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. You stay on. But we\u2019ll need a few days of traipsing around here,\u201d Colby told him. He shook his head in disgust. \u201cA bayou. A damned bayou filled with snakes and gators. Not easy to find much around here.\u201d He looked at Jake and Jackson. \u201cHell, boys, you are truly welcome to this mess!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time they returned to Donegal Plantation, it was already late afternoon. The officer had brought the shotgun over to Beaumont, and Dan had positively identified it as belonging to Toby. Toby\u2019s little bayou-crossing aluminum boat was still on the bank on the Donegal side of the water as well; he had never made it back to his own property the night before.</p><p>Jake described his last meeting with Toby in the woods, repeating information he had already given Jackson to Mack Colby.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell does the reporter woman fit into it all? What was she doing out there? High-heeled type out by the bayou\u2014makes no sense!\u201d Mack said.</p> <p>\u201cShe was lured,\u201d Jake said slowly. \u201cSomeone lured her out on purpose.\u201d He paused, remembering what Ashley had told him the night before. She\u2019d been frightened; she\u2019d been up a tree. And she had seen someone below her. Toby\u2014they had all assumed.</p><p>It had been the killer.</p><p>He felt an inner trembling and became anxious to return to the house and to the rest of the group. There hadn\u2019t been much for the women to explain at the scene. They had come upon the feeding frenzy and shot at the alligators to get the creatures away from the bodies. Not even Colby had seen a reason to make them linger with the corpses.</p><p>Back at the house, he quickly sought out Ashley\u2014even before heading to the shower.</p><p>Ashley, however, was showing her mettle. He found her sitting at the dining-room table with Angela, going over everything that had happened on the day of the reenactment. When Jake and Jackson came in, both women looked at them gravely.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know Toby was your neighbor and a friend,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Ashley nodded. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry about your friend. The reporter\u2014I didn\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry, too, but we weren\u2019t actually friends. She was in my high school class.\u201d</p><p>Jackson and Angela were both there, and Jake held his reserve. But he asked softly, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m angry. Someone is trying to destroy all of us,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>Her eyes were level with his. She was just fine. She hadn\u2019t lost her cool for a minute when he had gone into the water, and though Angela was a crack shot, he had depended on Ashley; she knew the terrain and the ancient beasts better than anyone.</p> <p>She was going to do all right.</p><p>Jake grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis certainly sounds strange after...today,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cBut...it\u2019s almost dinner. We\u2019re having a vegetarian pasta dish, Beth decided.\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded and left the room, going upstairs.</p><p>He was surprised, yet not really, when Ashley appeared ten minutes later; she slipped into the shower behind him and wrapped her arms around his waist, resting her head against his back. He set his hands on hers, and they listened to the beat of the water and felt the steam around them for a minute. Then he turned and took her into his arms.</p><p>He kissed her; they touched and kissed in the hard spray for a long time.</p><p>\u201cIs this horrible?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s life-affirming,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>They made love quietly, and then more passionately, beginning in the heat and steam of the clear, clean water and ending up on the softness of the bed, entwined in one another\u2019s arms.</p><p>When they were done, her eyes were closed, and he leaned on an elbow looking down at her. She smiled slowly, a little wistfully, somehow feeling his gaze.</p><p>Her eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cYou used to do that all the time,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me. It\u2019s a bit unnerving, you know.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips lightly. \u201cI used to watch you and wonder that you were with me.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet, not meeting his eyes, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. It was a wonder that you were with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who ended it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was...scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what you seemed to know,\u201d she said.</p><p>He pulled her to him. \u201cAnd are you still scared? Nothing about me has changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut something about me has.\u201d She rolled away from him and rose. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be time to eat, and as awful as it seems after today, my stomach is beginning to growl fiercely.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just biology.\u201d</p><p>She reached for her jeans, closing her eyes briefly. He could clearly imagine the pictures in her mind; he had seen them, too.</p><p>She looked at him and tried to smile. \u201cGet up! They\u2019ll all know where we are and what we\u2019re doing, but I\u2019d just as soon they don\u2019t have to come find us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know?\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cCameras, remember?\u201d</p><p>He groaned softly; he hadn\u2019t thought of that aspect.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019ll know we\u2019re safe together, and these days, that\u2019s a good thing. I just feel a little guilty....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Frazier.\u201d</p><p>Her grin turned real. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t in the middle of a horrible mystery, I\u2019d even suspect that Frazier knew exactly what you were doing and who you were working for\u2014and called Adam just to get you back here.\u201d She paused and kissed him lightly on the lips. \u201cCome on down, Mr. Mallory, please.\u201d</p><p>Buttoning her blouse, she headed for the door.</p><p>He watched her go, worried. Images flashed through his mind.</p><p>Charles Osgood, hanging from the statue.</p><p>Toby Keaton and Marty Dean...what was left of them.</p><p>He stared at the ceiling, trying to let the logic in his mind take over. Toxicology reports would affirm, he was certain, that both victims had received a similar cocktail to that which had been given to Charles Osgood to keep him compliant until the time of his death.</p><p>This time, though, it seemed that the killer hadn\u2019t had any intention of keeping his victims alive for long. He had probably discovered that a good shot of his drug cocktail immediately disabled his victims.</p><p>He knew, just as predatory alligators did, that he could be hurt himself in a fight. That was why alligators drowned their prey; they disabled them before they could be attacked in turn.</p><p>The killer was basically a coward. But he was changing his method, like a man with an agenda. He didn\u2019t fit the profile of a killer who sought out a certain type of victim; he didn\u2019t molest his victims. He was there for the kill itself, and it was beginning to look like the kill itself was the goal.</p><p>Jake\u2019s head jerked up. A killer who had started with an agenda, and now had discovered how much he liked killing.</p><p>He would hunger for more and would strike again. Eventually, his need would make him careless. Eventually\u2014but how many would have to die first?</p><p>Downstairs, Ashley found Will and Whitney speaking quietly to one another as they watched the monitors. Jackson, Angela and Jenna were holed up in the study with Frazier. Cliff hadn\u2019t come in yet, and Beth was watching her marinara sauce simmer.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Beth told her. She shivered, looking back at the stove.</p><p>Ashley decided that she\u2019d take a walk up to the attic.</p><p>There, she looked around. They were definitely going to need all their household help back when the killer was caught, she decided. Black dust covered just about everything; all the cases that held family bibles, period weapons, jewelry, buttons and other odd objects that had been owned by the family over the years.</p><p>She walked over to the empty case, wondering whether they would get the Enfield back, and then wondering if she wanted it back.</p><p>She felt someone behind her and turned quickly, but there was no one there.</p><p>\u201cMarshall?\u201d she asked.</p><p>But her ancestor didn\u2019t appear. A sense of discomfort and aloneness filled her. She had never felt so in her own house. She hurried back out to the small attic hallways and made her way down the narrow wooden stairs.</p><p>As she walked toward the grand staircase that led to both parlors, she paused. She saw that her ghost was now making an appearance before her on the landing.</p><p>There was no one on the second floor then; Jake\u2019s door\u2014the door to the Jeb Stuart room\u2014was open, but no one was inside.</p><p>She walked up to Marshall, who looked tormented.</p><p>\u201cWere you just in that room behind me, trying to scare me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would I try to scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. You led me out last night to show me the gravestone, and I might have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, I didn\u2019t know anyone was in the woods. And what descendant of mine would fall off a horse? You should be a better rider, young woman,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything last night?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed you when I heard the thud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard what happened today, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m damned good at being a ghost. My senses are highly attuned,\u201d he informed her indignantly.</p><p>\u201cI might have been killed!\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. So you must cease behaving so senselessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you led me out! What good are you doing me?\u201d she asked him. \u201cOther than making me talk to myself\u2014or my imagination, or whatever is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will protect you\u2014even from yourself!\u201d he vowed valiantly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t behind me in the attic?\u201d she demanded again.</p><p>He looked toward the stairs. She was startled by the look of agony that seemed to come over his misty countenance.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2014I can\u2019t go in the attic,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go in the attic!\u201d he repeated. \u201cLeave it be, damn you. I can\u2019t go in the attic!\u201d</p><p>He must have been really angry with her; he disappeared in a blink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sane, and I have a ghost,\u201d she mused. \u201cOr I\u2019m totally insane. Or my mind is trying to make me recall something.\u201d</p><p>As she walked down the stairs, she wondered if she had ever heard a story about Emma having had an affair with an ex-slave and producing the child who would be one of Cliff\u2019s ancestors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the life of her, she was certain that she\u2019d never heard such a story before.</p><p>Dinner was a solemn affair. When it was over, Jackson called Jake into the study, and they took out their list once again; they were down a suspect.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Hank Trebly? He did want to buy the property when the Donegal family was down,\u201d Jackson suggested. \u201cAnd, he\u2019s one rude ass.\u201d</p> <p>Jake said, \u201cYes, but being a rude ass doesn\u2019t make a man a killer. Maybe the forensics lab will give us something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlligator saliva,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Jake smiled tightly. \u201cWe\u2019ll know if they were drugged, the same as Charles Osgood.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cYou know, though, I don\u2019t think that Toby was the intended victim. He was in the woods with his shotgun when we saw him, and I was pretty damned skeptical of him then. But he said he was over to check out noises he had heard. His dog had been going crazy. I believe Marty Dean was the intended victim, lured out because the killer wanted her dead for some reason in his head, and Toby stumbled on her killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, that means Toby Keaton is cleared,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAll right. So...we have Ramsay Clayton, Griffin Grant, Cliff. The one remaining \u2018Yankee\u2019 who hasn\u2019t been cleared, Justin Binder. Justin was here for the reenactment, and he stayed at the plantation after.\u201d He ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cWhat the hell am I missing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor and the sutler,\u201d Jake reminded him.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll interview those two tomorrow,\u201d Jackson said. He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m still not seeing a clear motive. The killer went after Charles\u2014but was Charles the victim because he was Charles, or because he was playing Marshall Donegal? Why go after Marty Dean either way?\u201d</p><p>Jake thought for a moment. \u201cHe wanted another kill. I think that he felt compelled to create a real reenactment of the death at Donegal Plantation. But then, maybe, in his head, Marty posed a danger. He needed that first kill associated with Donegal, but he\u2019s smart enough to know that the grounds here are being watched. He killed Marty Dean because she would do anything for a story. He lured her out to a place where he could kill her and where her body might not have been found for ages\u2014if ever. I\u2019ve seen what alligators can do with prey. In three months, someone might have stumbled upon a foot bone.\u201d</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cBut if the body wasn\u2019t found, how would that have hurt Donegal Plantation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a news anchor. People would definitely have gone insane looking for her. Somewhere nearby, the police are going to find her car. They\u2019re checking the switchboard, so they may even be able to trace the call that led her out here. They might have looked forever, and it would have just added to the sensationalism and mystery regarding Charles. But I think he killed her because he had to kill her. And I think that Toby just stumbled upon him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that this killer either called from a pay phone or from a prepaid cell that can\u2019t be traced. He would have purchased it with cash,\u201d Jackson reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes, but they may be able to find a satellite locator\u2014at least tell us where the call originated,\u201d Jake said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible,\u201d Jackson agreed. \u201cAll right. Will and Jenna will head out and speak with the sutler and his wife, John and Matty Martin. We can\u2019t afford to wait on the reports. Tonight, you need to get going on the computer again\u2014find out who might have access to those drugs\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was thinking that earlier,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWell, he was already on the list.\u201d</p><p>Ashley played chess with Frazier for a while, worried about how her grandfather was bearing up under the strain.</p><p>But though Frazier was grave and obviously thinking about their problems, he appeared strong\u2014and was delighted when he beat her.</p><p>She watched the screens off and on with Whitney, Will and Jenna. Frazier tired and went to bed, and Ashley walked over to sit with Beth as she leafed through magazines. Beth set hers down. \u201cAshley.\u201d</p><p>Ashley looked up at her. Beth\u2019s large dark eyes were sorrowful. \u201cAshley, I\u2014forgive me. I can\u2019t stand this. I have to go. I\u2019m not quitting, mind you. I love this place. I love you and Frazier, and I love Cliff\u2014 I don\u2019t believe for a second that he did it\u2014and I\u2019ve tried, honestly, I\u2019ve tried, but...oh, God, bodies consumed by alligators? I have to leave\u2014just for a while. There\u2019s a crash course in vegetarian entrees being taught next week at a cooking school in New York City, and I thought I\u2019d run up and spend a week learning something that will help us in the future. You could go with me, you know. You and Frazier!\u201d Beth added excitedly.</p> <p>Ashley thought about the dwindling coffers that held the plantation together.</p><p>And she thought about Jake. She was safe here; she had a government team living at her house.</p><p>And it was her home. She just might be part of the answer, when they kept digging to find the twists and turns of the great riddle.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want you to go, and learn well, and we\u2019ll get the restaurant back up and running. God knows, once we do, we can hire a full-time security guard. People will flock back.\u201d</p><p>Beth kissed her on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll probably leave tomorrow. I\u2019ll have to see what kind of a flight I can get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night\u2014and it\u2019s all right, Beth. It\u2019s really all right.\u201d</p><p>Beth left her. She hadn\u2019t realized that Angela had been curled in one of the wingback chairs near them, reading as well.</p><p>When Beth had gone, Angela walked over to Ashley. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI love Beth. I\u2019m happy that she\u2019s going to leave and do something useful,\u201d Ashley assured her.</p><p>\u201cWhat a cook we\u2019re losing,\u201d Angela said lightly.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019re actually pretty good in the kitchen as a team,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Ashley tried to smile. The effort fell flat.</p><p>Angela took Beth\u2019s chair and spoke to Ashley seriously. \u201cAshley, the answer here may really lie in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Do you think the four dead Yanks are rising to get revenge on the South? Or are my Southern ancestors getting revenge\u2014on themselves?\u201d Ashley knew she sounded skeptical, but it was just too much!</p><p>Angela shook her head. \u201cNo, there\u2019s a flesh-and-blood killer out there. But he has something on his mind. Something he plotted out for years, maybe. And it just may have something to do with the past. You need to start thinking about that. Go back and trace the ancestry of everyone involved and see if we\u2019ve missed anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be easier said than done. You want me to trace the lives of nine men and their offspring through over a hundred and fifty years?\u201d Ashley asked. \u201cWe have records on the men who fought, and Daughters of the Confederacy probably has similar records on their lineage, but you\u2019re talking about a number of offspring through the centuries!\u201d</p><p>Angela stood. \u201cYes. And if anyone can do it, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She bid her good-night and started for the stairs, then paused, looking back. \u201cI believe that both Emma and Marshall Donegal are trapped here. Their souls are trapped. For some reason, they are unable to communicate with one another. If we can find out why, perhaps we can find out the truth.\u201d</p><p>Ashley nodded, feeling a pang in her heart.</p><p>The door to the study was still closed. Will and Whitney still watched the screens, while Jenna had gone up to catch a few hours of sleep before taking over for the pair. Cliff had long ago returned to his apartment in the stables.</p><p>Ashley stood and stretched; she was about to say good-night to Will and Whitney but she saw that they were resting themselves: open-eyed, but resting. Apparently, they were accustomed to watching the screens, and after today, they weren\u2019t going to rely on tapes\u2014they were going to watch every movement on the property by night.</p><p>She didn\u2019t make it to her room; she stopped in front of Jake\u2019s. She smiled. The hell with the screens. She waved to Will and Whitney and went into Jake\u2019s room to wait.</p><p>He arrived an hour later.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak; neither did he. She curled into his arms, and they started to kiss.</p><p>It was definitely life-affirming.</p><p>Interlude</p><p>He watched the news. Of course, a different newscaster talked about the grisly discovery of the two bodies in the bayou separating Beaumont and Donegal Plantations.</p><p>Viewers would recall, of course, that police and the FBI still had an open investigation on the case of Charles Osgood, so recently murdered in the old cemetery at Donegal.</p><p>Ah, yes, despite the fact that the murders had occurred in plantation country, it was important that viewers take extreme care in the days to come, since police and marine biologists alike thought it unlikely that the newscaster and the plantation owner found dead in the bayou had been killed by the alligators; the alligators had more likely been attracted by the scent of the deceased.</p><p>An animal expert came on for a minute to talk about alligators, and the unlikelihood of viewers being attacked by one.</p><p>Then the anchor was back on.</p><p>Handsome man\u2014as plastic as the woman. Frankly, he liked the other channel better.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t take his eyes from the newscast. The anchor was now talking about the extreme loss the station was feeling, and that in their pain, they were proud, certain that Marty Dean had died in the pursuit of answers, as a good investigative reporter. Funeral arrangements were pending the arrival of family members and the release of the remains.</p><p>\u201cGood investigative reporter, my ass!\u201d he said aloud, and it made him laugh.</p><p>Oh, what a lovely kill!</p><p>He wished he could have stayed. He hadn\u2019t even thought about the gators; he had simply left the bodies facedown in the water, caught on straggling branches from a fallen old oak. He had never really imagined that his crimes would be so delightfully...mutated, mauled\u2014dissected! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More clever than he himself had known. They\u2019d just never get it. They\u2019d never really appreciated his amazing ability to move quickly and decisively!</p><p>He leaned back, swallowing down a delightful sip of hundred-year-old cognac.</p><p>His phone rang; regretfully, he answered it.</p> <p>A problem at work. With his crisp voice, he quickly barked out commands, changing gears as cleanly and swiftly as the transmission of a Rolls-Royce.</p><p>When he hung up, he smiled. He looked at himself in the mirror.</p><p>Down, down, down, everybody was going down, down, down.</p><p>He had his next move to plan, of course. But he would do so, easily and well.</p><p>As he walked to his bedroom, he noted one of the pictures on his wall. A picture taken nearly a decade ago after a reenactment.</p> <p>He paused to look at it. Patrick Donegal, Ashley\u2019s father, had still been alive. He\u2019d been playing the role of Marshall Donegal that day.</p><p>Too bad he hadn\u2019t been so clever back then! Taking down Patrick Donegal would have been a coup! But now...</p><p>There she was. Ashley. Beautiful as a teenager, not quite as refined as she was now, but beautiful, even in a quick snapshot.</p><p>The boy was in the picture, too. Jake. Jake Mallory. Hell, he\u2019d heard the damned name so much he was sick. He was a savior. A tireless benefactor to the city. So damned good, the feds had wanted him, and he\u2019d gone to them and brought down the mighty. Staring at the photo, he frowned.</p><p>Jake really needed to go down, too.</p><p>Really.</p> <p>Pleased that he had a list of victims together, he walked on past the picture and headed to bed.</p><p>Tonight, he would rest.</p><p>Tomorrow would be his next kill.</p><p>12</p><p>\u201cOkay, look\u2014you can see, I\u2019m coming right back!\u201d Beth said. She pointed to the overnight bag she had packed. \u201cOne week of clothing, and that\u2019s with doing a load of wash sometime in between. Oh, Ashley, come with me!\u201d she pleaded, standing by the front door.</p><p>Ashley hugged her best friend tightly. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you come back,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cFrazier!\u201d Beth said, and turned to hug Frazier as well. \u201cNow, you really should come with me!\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cTo a vegetarian cooking class? Perish the thought. I was born right here, my dear. I\u2019m not going anywhere else in my dotage\u2014not until they drag me out.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cCome back soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get moving. We have to stop by Benjamin Austin\u2019s office, and then it\u2019s a bit of a drive into New Orleans,\u201d Jackson said politely.</p><p>Beth hugged Ashley once again.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is your plane?\u201d Ashley asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet which I\u2019m taking. The boys are going to drop me in the city, and I\u2019ll stow my bags at one of the hotels while I take a look around. I love NOLA\u2014I\u2019m going to miss it, even if I only go away for a week...\u201d Her voice trailed. \u201cTake care of yourself. Ashley, damn it, I mean it. Take care of yourself!\u201d</p><p>Ashley smiled. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>Jake turned to Ashley as Beth said a swift goodbye and good luck to the others.</p><p>\u201cStick close to the house today. Please?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m delving into the past, per Angela\u2019s orders,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll be a good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will!\u201d Frazier assured him, setting his hands on Ashley\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Beth saved her last goodbye for Cliff, giving him a big kiss right on the lips. \u201cAnd you hang in, mister, you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll miss you,\u201d Cliff told Beth.</p><p>Then, finally, the three were gone.</p><p>\u201cI have some feed bills to finesse,\u201d Cliff said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my apartment if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the study, playing with bills myself,\u201d Frazier said.</p><p>\u201cGrampa, I can do that!\u201d Ashley chided.</p><p>Frazier shook his head. \u201cNo, thank you. Let me be useful. The old need to be useful, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one more necessary,\u201d Ashley told him.</p><p>He grinned, kissed her cheek, and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out for a walk by the cemetery,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cWill and I are supposed to go down the road and check out your sutler friend, John Martin, but that won\u2019t take long, I don\u2019t think. It\u2019s a formality. They don\u2019t really suspect him. We\u2019ve got some time. Where was it that the three Yankees died? In front of the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the family tomb, actually,\u201d Ashley told her.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be out there alone,\u201d Will said. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I\u2019ll keep quiet so you can commune, Jenna, but you\u2019re not going out there alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA team member is always welcome,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, back to the monitors,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you seen lately in the screens?\u201d Ashley asked. Whitney looked at her, and she blushed. \u201cI mean, besides our movements\u2014and those shadows you\u2019ve shown me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great deal actually,\u201d Whitney told her. She studied Ashley for a minute and glanced at Angela. \u201cCome on over,\u201d she said to Ashley, as if Angela had given her a silent accord.</p><p>The three women went back to the screens. On one, Ashley could see Jenna and Will walking toward the cemetery.</p><p>On other screens, she could see empty rooms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rolling back tape,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cThis is from yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Ashley saw herself heading into the attic, walking around thoughtfully\u2014and making a face at the mess of black fingerprint powder that was in the room.</p><p>Then, she saw something else. Something that seemed to form out of thin air. It wasn\u2019t dark, like a shadow. It was something light\u2014benign, in a sense. The light seemed to reach out and nearly touch her shoulder.</p><p>But then she spun around, and the vision of light faded.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Ashley asked, her throat tight.</p><p>\u201cNothing bad\u2014certainly nothing bad or evil!\u201d</p><p>Angela assured her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this...how?\u201d Ashley asked her.</p><p>\u201cI know because I\u2019ve met many entities now, and even when they\u2019re hiding, keeping themselves from me, I can tell when something is there that means nothing but kindness and love,\u201d Angela said. \u201cThere are many spirits, ghosts, or whatever you want to call them here. Energy, as some believe. I haven\u2019t encountered anything evil here at all. Neither have the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014you were expecting something evil?\u201d Ashley asked.</p><p>Angela was thoughtful for a minute. \u201cEvil can remain. As I told you. Someone out there\u2014a living someone\u2014seems to feel that this place is calling out to them, demanding some kind of vengeance. The good revenants that are here are reaching out to you, trying to help you. And you\u2019ve seen one of them\u2014you just don\u2019t want to admit it. Did you meet the spirit in the attic?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>Ashley shook her head. But tension, fear and then trust in Angela filled her. She spilled out the truth. \u201cNo, but I have an ancestor here that I have seen. He talks to me as clearly as you do.\u201d</p><p>Whitney smiled. \u201cMarshall Donegal?\u201d</p><p>Ashley nodded.</p><p>\u201cCan you talk to him now?\u201d Angela asked. \u201cHe\u2019s here. I can feel him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see him right now,\u201d Ashley told her. She shook her head. \u201cI mean, did you want to have a s\u00e9ance or something? Would you act as a medium?\u201d</p><p>Angela smiled. \u201cHe isn\u2019t interested in speaking with me. Just you. When did you first see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go lie down. Let him enter your dreams. Let him walk you through the original battle,\u201d Angela told her. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be afraid. We\u2019re all nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it really help?\u201d Ashley whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know until you try,\u201d Angela told her.</p><p>Ashley nodded. She walked up the stairs and into her own room.</p><p>That was where Marshall Donegal had found her first. In her dreams.</p><p>Dr. Benjamin Austin\u2019s office was a busy place; the receptionist looked at them as if they were crazy when they asked to speak with him. She indicated the waiting room. There were four rambunctious children running back and forth to their mother with magazines. There were several elderly patients waiting, and two young women and two young men besides.</p><p>\u201cYou have to see him now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt will just take a moment,\u201d Jackson said, producing his badge.</p><p>The receptionist quickly ushered them into an office.</p><p>A few minutes later, the doctor hurried in with two of his patients\u2019 charts in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, trying to juggle the charts and shake their hands. \u201cJake, I heard you were with the government now. Good to see you. We get all the New Orleans news out here. Your name was involved with the Holloway case. This is about Charles Osgood, isn\u2019t it? You know, the police were already here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know that,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cAnd we appreciate your time. We can see that you\u2019re extremely busy.\u201d</p><p>Benjamin Austin nodded, but said, \u201cThat\u2019s all right. Anything I can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is confidential information right now,\u201d Jake said. \u201cBut we know what drugs the killer used to subdue Charles Osgood, and the coroner\u2019s office is testing to see if the same drugs were used on the latest victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatest victims?\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cOh, God, yes, they\u2019re thinking that alligators didn\u2019t kill Marty Dean and Toby Keaton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Where were you the night before last, Dr. Austin? Forgive the question\u2014it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>He stiffened but eased quickly; he seemed to understand. \u201cWell, that I can tell you exactly, and you can verify the information without leaving this office. I gave a speech at eight at a meeting at the Best Western down the road, had dinner at twelve\u2014and stayed at the hotel. I didn\u2019t sleep alone. You met my girlfriend\u2014the receptionist who led you here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe will verify, of course,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have another question,\u201d Jake told him.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jackson pulled out his organizer and said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking to find someone who might have gotten hold of these two drugs. Can you help us?\u201d He handed the organizer to Benjamin Austin so that he could read benzodiazepine and chlorzoxazone himself.</p><p>To Jake\u2019s surprise, the man seemed stunned. His face became white.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, doctor?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cI had a robbery\u2014but it was more than a year ago,\u201d Austin said, swallowing. \u201cI have a nurse anesthetist on my staff, and I do some minor surgery right here in the office. Our nearest hospital is a bit of a trek,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe muscle relaxants are more common, but...this office was sacked. We were missing a lot of drugs.\u201d</p> <p>He saw the way they were looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI filed a police report\u2014you can check on that, too,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, God...this killer might be using drugs he stole from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it appears, Dr. Austin. So it appears,\u201d Jackson said. On that slightly ominous note, they bid him farewell.</p><p>Beth had chosen to wait for them in the car. \u201cAnything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jake said. She stared at him with such concern that he sighed. \u201cDrugs were used on the victims\u2014you\u2019ve been around everything going on; you probably know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014oh, my God, it was him? The doctor?\u201d Beth asked.</p> <p>Jake shook his head. \u201cHe said that his office was broken into\u2014over a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m checking on that,\u201d Jackson said, and Jake knew that he was dialing Detective Colby.</p><p>Jake, driving, tried to listen, but he couldn\u2019t hear Mack.</p><p>Jackson hung up. \u201cGood Dr. Austin seems to be telling the truth. He reported the drugs stolen, and he did give a speech at the Best Western. Mack is checking with the hotel to find out if he had room service or anything else\u2014if he was seen. I believe the man was telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone out there is lying, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Ashley didn\u2019t know if her eyes were just closed, or if she had dozed. She heard her own words from the recesses of her mind.</p><p>Help me.</p><p>I\u2019m here, he told her.</p> <p>I need to see the battle.</p><p>No, you don\u2019t. Battle is ugly and horrible, and no one should see it.</p><p>I need to see, please.</p><p>Somehow, in the dream, she was Emma again. Marshall Donegal was in front of her, shouting at her, telling her to get the children and get them up to the attic. His voice was rough, commanding, and she was shocked, because he didn\u2019t speak to her like that.</p><p>But then he paused. She felt his passionate kiss on her lips, and then he held her away, torment in his eyes. \u201cThe children, Emma, please\u2014protect our children.\u201d</p><p>She turned as he\u2019d ordered and hurried the children up the stairs. When she reached the attic, she made the little ones hunch down by the wall.</p><p>And she went to the garret window to watch.</p><p>First she saw the black powder; it exploded and filled the day. The howitzer managed to put holes in the ground, but it didn\u2019t hit the buildings.</p><p>No matter; the Yankees were coming.</p><p>She heard the squeal of the horses. Shouts came from the area of the stables; then she saw the defenders rush out and head toward the cemetery walls.</p><p>Rifles flared, and flared again. She saw Marshall retreat behind the walls, calling his men around them, but they weren\u2019t all there; they were engaged closer to the house. The men in blue began to enter the cemetery.</p><p>From her vantage point, high above the roofs of their family \u201ccity of the dead,\u201d she could see as they began to surround her husband. He brought one down with a direct hit from his rifle; then the fighting was too close. They were going after one another with bayonets. Marshall was a fighter. Two more died at his feet. And then, with one of his men shouting a warning and rushing in, Marshall was stabbed himself. She saw her husband\u2019s eyes as he returned the blow. The last of the men in the cemetery was dead. Two more rushed in but saw the three dead in their own colors. They turned and fled, and in seconds she heard the sounds of horses\u2019 hooves as they rode away. Six Yankees altogether; four dead and two running.</p><p>\u201cNancy, stay with the children!\u201d she pleaded, calling to her housemaid and then rushing down the attic stairs and out to the cemetery. She pushed by her husband\u2019s men, who were at his side, and fell down beside him, taking his head onto her lap. He opened his eyes once. He mouthed the words, \u201cI love you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>And then he died.</p><p>They came around her, her husband\u2019s men. One of them pulled her gently to her feet. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, now, Emma. We\u2019ll see to him. He\u2019s gone, please....\u201d</p><p>She was blinded by her tears. She was barely aware as she was led into her house, led to her room. \u201cDrink this. Drink this, Emma\u2014it will steady your nerves.\u201d</p><p>She had no nerves; she had nothing. Marshall was dead.</p><p>Four days later, Marshall was laid to rest in the family vault. He was there; he told her he\u2019d be back; he\u2019d help her until it was time for him to ride to war.</p><p>And then he came back again.</p><p>To help her, so he said.</p><p>And he was kind at first. He helped her haul in some water. He made her sit by the fire, and he poured her a whiskey, telling her that she needed whiskey. She drank it. She would have enjoyed the entire bottle. It warmed her. It numbed her. She could barely hear what he was saying, and she didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>But then he knelt by her feet and started to rub them, and she was instantly alarmed.</p><p>\u201cEmma...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband is barely dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a harsh world, Emma. It will only get worse with the war. You know you need me; you need help through this, and by God, if I\u2019m to be a man for you, you will be a woman for me.\u201d</p><p>She was shocked.</p><p>But when she tried to stand, she began to teeter. She fell, and fell into his arms. He kept speaking, words that made no sense. The world began spinning, but it was still full of agony.</p><p>Then she felt him.</p><p>Felt him on her. Felt his hands on her, ripping at her clothing.</p><p>No!</p><p>But his hand fell over her mouth; he was strong and brutal, and her clothing was being ripped from her. She couldn\u2019t believe it. This was a friend....</p><p>No...</p><p>She was powerless.</p><p>Help...</p><p>The word escaped her.</p><p>And she still felt him, the bastard on top of her, felt her flesh, his flesh, but it wasn\u2019t her; no one could really touch her anymore.</p><p>Then help came at last, and he was ripped from her. She tried to stumble up, tried to call out....</p><p>Ashley jerked up.</p><p>Tears were streaming down her cheeks. Her body felt bruised\u2014and violated.</p><p>But nothing had happened. She was in her own bedroom. Her clothing was intact. She hadn\u2019t been touched.</p><p>Not in this world, not in this time.</p><p>Marshall Donegal stood by the window. He was looking out at the cemetery where he had died.</p><p>She realized that he had led her to the battle, but that something else had happened in her dream. She had seen what he had never seen.</p><p>One of his own men had betrayed him after his death and violated his wife.</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cBattle is ugly. It is blood and slashed limbs and smashed brains. It\u2019s horrible, and it\u2019s ugly, and perhaps we all sin when we take up arms against one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome battles have to be fought,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He came to her, and she thought she felt his hands on her shoulders. \u201cYes, battles must be fought for defense of all that is right and holy. But we need to be sure of what is right and holy before going to war.\u201d He winced. \u201cThose men who fight demons in their own mind, or join with demons to fight, they must be stopped. Because they are the transgressors.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her against him. She was certain that she could actually feel the strength of his chest, and of his mind, and all that he had managed to learn\u2014in his afterlife. She felt tears on her cheeks again, and she heard him whisper, \u201cI\u2019m here to try again to defend you. I failed my family once. I cannot do so again.\u201d</p><p>Jake was surprised at how emotional it was to drop Beth off in the French Quarter. They were on Royal Street, in front of the hotel where they had stayed after the Holloway murder, and they knew that Beth would be able to stow her luggage easily for the day.</p><p>\u201cYou go on and solve this thing so that I can come back!\u201d Beth told them. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m just doing a little shopping. I\u2019m going to indulge in a sugar-swamped beignet at Caf\u00e9 du Monde, and then I\u2019ll be on my way. You gentlemen get busy.\u201d</p><p>And so they did, leaving the car at street parking on Decatur Street and starting off on foot. As they walked, Jackson made the necessary phone calls.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Justin Binder met them in front of the square as he was crawling down from a carriage ride with his family. He kissed his daughters and told them he\u2019d meet up with them for dinner as they went off with his mother-in-law to view a Mardi Gras exhibit.</p><p>\u201cWe can go to my hotel room and talk there,\u201d Justin told them.</p><p>Jake hoped immediately that Justin was all that he seemed: a family man who respected his mother-in-law and loved his children.</p><p>His hotel room was a little suite with a bedroom area where, apparently, his mother-in-law had been sleeping with the children while Justin took the couch in the parlor area. He apologized; the housekeeping staff hadn\u2019t been up yet, and Justin closed the couch quickly so that they could sit.</p><p>\u201cI heard about the latest,\u201d Justin said, sitting. \u201cThe newscaster and Toby Keaton. He was all right. I was so sorry to hear about him. Eaten by gators. Well, hell, that\u2019s just sad. The man grew up with the creatures, spent his life around them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t believe he was killed by the gators,\u201d Jackson said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNeither does the media,\u201d Justin said.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re back to the usual question. Where were you night before last?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>\u201cHere. I took the girls to a live theater experience at Le Petit Theatre, and we and my mother-in-law went to dinner at Muriel\u2019s. Then we were back at the hotel\u2014and I had a stomach ache. I called down to room service for warm milk around one in the morning. I was seen by the waiter, and my mother-in-law will assure you I was with my family all night. Thank God I can prove that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat can\u2019t you prove?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>Justin met his gaze openly. \u201cWhen the battle ended, I \u2018skedaddled\u2019 with Ramsay Clayton. That means we rode hard to the sugar-mill fences, up to the road and then back. Ramsay was with me\u2014he kept telling me it was okay to play a Yankee. He liked being on the winning side. We rode back in time for the singing. When it first happened, I kept thinking that Ramsay had to be involved somehow\u2014he was supposed to have been Marshall Donegal\u2014but he was with me, then, and I could swear that I did see him in the crowd before we finally all wound up in the parlor at the house. And I was scared as hell, too, that I would be a suspect because we were staying at the plantation. I searched high and low with the others that night and wound up on a ride all the way over to Beaumont the next day. It was a nice ride\u2014my girls loved it. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cThere was something strange about Ashley that day. Once we could see Beaumont across the bayou, she kept looking up at the windows. And she seemed to be afraid of something. She pretended it was nothing, but I\u2019ve been thinking about it ever since. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014Ashley sure as hell isn\u2019t guilty of anything. She was just about in tears about Charles being missing the day before, and she really came on the ride to keep searching the property. But\u2014she saw something. She saw something that day at Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>Ashley\u2019s legs wobbled as she descended the stairs. Angela ran up to her quickly, frowning and setting a supporting arm around her shoulders. Whitney came over to her as well, her face a mask of concern.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Angela asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see who did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did what?\u201d</p><p>Ashley looked at Angela. \u201cI saw Marshall Donegal. He didn\u2019t want to let me see the battle with him, but I insisted. Then\u2014it was as if I lost him. I became Emma. She was raped, Angela\u2014just days after her husband was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the enemy? But I thought\u2014\u201d Whitney began.</p><p>\u201cNot by the enemy! By one of her husband\u2019s men.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho? Which one?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t see, Angela. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cI think that Harold Boudreaux came to her rescue. I think that he pulled the rapist off of Emma, and that\u2019s when they formed their real bond. I think that we never see Marshall and Emma together be cause he doesn\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t her fault, but she\u2019s ashamed, and she can\u2019t go to Marshall or be with him because of what happened.\u201d</p><p>Angela was thoughtful. \u201cMaybe we can help them. First, however, we have to find out who the man was. We have to find out what happened to him and figure out why one of his descendants would be after revenge now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do next?\u201d Ashley asked.</p><p>\u201cRecords!\u201d Angela turned to Ashley. \u201cCan you get those accounts of the battle we were wondering about earlier? We\u2019ll start on one of the ancestry sites and see what we can dig up on these men by name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d Whitney said.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I should be doing this,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cLater. Let Whitney get started,\u201d Angela said. \u201cYou come with me and find Jenna. She is in the cemetery. She\u2019s\u2014communing.\u201d Angela looked at her and apparently decided that Ashley had figured out that Jenna did, indeed, see ghosts. \u201cJenna was meditating, in a way. She gets into a state, and if there are spirits around, even if they won\u2019t communicate with her, she can usually see them, and we may see more clearly through her.\u201d She took Ashley\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d she asked her softly. \u201cEveryone is afraid at first\u2014it\u2019s having to believe the unbelievable. It\u2019s accepting that there is a greater power.\u201d</p><p>Ashley shook her head firmly. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not afraid anymore. I want the truth.\u201d</p><p>Griffin Grant\u2019s office was in a massive building in the Central Business District, all beautiful glass and chrome. It was furnished with ultramodern pieces\u2014but a picture of a Civil War cavalryman hung on a far wall of the reception area, with a pair of crossed swords above it. \u201cMust be his ancestor,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Jake walked over to the painting. The man had one hand behind his back in the painting; he held his sword in front of him. There was something a little bit odd about him.</p><p>\u201cHenry Hilton!\u201d Griffin\u2019s secretary told them. \u201cInteresting painting, isn\u2019t it? Well, it should be. It was done from a death likeness. Creepy, if you ask me, but these boys do enjoy their reenactments and their roundtables. Henry was killed at Manassas, but he was already wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014he was\u2014an admirable soldier,\u201d Jake said. As he spoke, Griffin came out of his office.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, it\u2019s a strange painting, but it\u2019s a family heirloom,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cPlease, come in.\u201d Griffin ushered them into his office, quickly dismissing his secretary and offering them coffee or drinks from the handsome marble wet bar set to the far left of his desk. \u201cSoda, whiskey, water\u2014anything?\u201d</p><p>Jackson declined. Jake accepted a bottle of water, thanking him and taking a seat in one of the executive chairs in front of the desk.</p><p>\u201cI heard about Toby,\u201d Griffin said gravely. \u201cDo you know anything about funeral arrangements? Had his son been told about his death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective Mack Colby was notifying the family,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cAnd they won\u2019t release the body until a full autopsy has been done.\u201d</p><p>Griffin nodded and frowned. \u201cThey believe that these murders were related to Charles Osgood\u2019s death? But...well, a man in a cemetery in full uniform and two people killed after a strange assignation near the bayou? Seems a stretch, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Toby Keaton took part in the reenactment. Marty Dean wanted news on it so desperately I think she would have met anyone anywhere,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cOh. I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d Griffin drummed his fingers on his desk. \u201cI wish I could help you. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything at all I could tell you about the newscaster. I didn\u2019t know her. I knew Toby well, of course. We\u2019ve all been friends forever. But I keep thinking that I should have remembered something about the night Charles disappeared. I mean, I was right there! Right there, in the midst of those rushing forward when we heard that Marshall Donegal was being beset in the cemetery\u2014outside the cemetery for the reenactment, of course. I think I saw...maybe it was John Ashton? Helping him to his feet. But we were all there standing around when it ended. Charles was so proud! He wore his battle wounds and fake blood with such pleasure. I kept thinking that Ramsay had done him a real favor, helping him out that day. He made something of a man out of him, if only for a few hours. I swear, I keep trying to remember,\u201d he said. He leaned forward. \u201cIt haunts me, you know? Thinking about it. First Charles, now Toby...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think might have done it? Any idea of anyone with a grudge?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>Griffin Grant shook his head. \u201cWe all had opinions, spats, disagreements, but they were all good guys.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cEven the Yankees. I mean, we do seriously like to argue tactics, but that\u2019s not even a matter of sides. We\u2019ve all done this so many times, with changes here and there through the years. The Yanks are good guys. I can\u2019t imagine that any one of us would have ever done such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s the usual\u2014where were you the night before last?\u201d Jake asked him.</p><p>He seemed surprised. \u201cRight here. You can ask my secretary. I worked forever\u2014we have a new lineup coming out, and it\u2019s a bitch, making sure your shows and your sponsors are all aligned just so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jackson said, rising. He offered Griffin his hand. \u201cThank you for your time and your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do more if I could,\u201d Griffin told them.</p><p>They left his office and stopped by his secretary\u2019s desk. \u201cMiss Tierney\u201d read the nameplate in front of her. \u201cMiss Tierney,\u201d Jackson said politely, \u201ccan you verify that Mr. Grant was in his office late the night before last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d she said. \u201cWhy, that poor man has just been working all hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow late were you here?\u201d Jake asked her.</p><p>\u201cLate\u2014seven,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cSo much for nine to five. And when I left, I could still hear him on the phone in there, placating a diaper company!\u201d</p><p>Jackson thanked her.</p><p>Out on the street, Jake sighed wearily. \u201cTime to find Ramsay Clayton,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ramsay wasn\u2019t in his hotel room. The desk clerk told them that they could probably locate him on the square, displaying his art.</p><p>Jenna sat on one of the few individual white sarcophagi in the cemetery; it belonged to the Donegal brother-in-law who had been killed during World War I.</p><p>At first, walking toward her with Angela, Ashley saw nothing. Will was leaning against her family tomb, and he spoke gently to Ashley. \u201cShe has brought them out. Sit quietly, and you will see them.\u201d</p><p>No longer hesitant, Ashley took a seat next to Jenna. Jenna took her hand and gripped it tightly.</p><p>And in a minute, they began to appear to her as well.</p><p>There were four of them there, soldiers in blue. They walked in a procession, pacing the cemetery right in front of the family tomb. She could see clearly through them, and then she could not. They began to form something that appeared of real substance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey are illusions,\u201d Will said quietly, \u201cbut illusions of the mind. That is the place where we know another sense: of the living, and of the dead.\u201d</p><p>As she sat there, Marshall Donegal appeared as well. She tensed, thinking that there would be some kind of a confrontation.</p><p>But though they recognized one another, acknowledged one another, it was merely with sorrow.</p> <p>\u201cTalk to them,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cThey will hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need help,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Marshall walked to one. \u201cWe were sad enemies. No more. We are united in death, and the country is united now, through our deaths. We have made peace. Help my girl, please. Help her.\u201d</p><p>The one who seemed to be a captain turned from Marshall to Ashley.</p><p>\u201cI would help you, if I could. What do you need?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to know...Emma came to her husband as he lay dying. She was dragged away, taken to the house. Who took her? Which soldier? Please, it\u2019s so important to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was dying then,\u201d he said. \u201cI was dying then myself. But, I saw her. I saw her tears. I saw the uniform. I saw...the man was blond. He had blond curls.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan anyone help?\u201d Marshall called out.</p><p>One of them stopped by him, setting a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI was gone, Marshall. I was gone when she came to the cemetery. We were hotheaded as were you\u2014we\u2019d never have hurt your wife or your children. What man would do so?\u201d</p><p>Not a man, a monster, Ashley thought. She wasn\u2019t afraid of ghosts, she realized. She had learned to fear monsters instead.</p> <p>The captain spoke softly. \u201cOne will know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Marshall asked.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d the captain said.</p><p>Marshall shook his head. \u201cShe is gone,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the captain said. \u201cI see her at the attic window.\u201d</p><p>The ghost of Marshall Donegal fell to his knees in the cemetery and wept.</p><p>\u201cWhy, hey, you!\u201d Beth said, surprised to see the man who was looking into the shop window along with her.</p><p>\u201cBeth!\u201d he said, equally surprised. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeaving,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get away for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonegal Plantation will be missing the world\u2019s finest chef,\u201d he said gallantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve got some time. Do you need a ride to the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that would be great. But I can just take a cab\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I\u2019ve got a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy things are at the hotel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop and get them. Come on, no big deal, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a half hour drive there, and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth it, if I can imagine you\u2019ll return and cook again!\u201d</p><p>As the breeze moved her hair and she pulled a strand from her face, she remembered that he had been on the original suspect list. But that had been before.</p><p>\u201cSure, thanks.\u201d</p><p>They were going to get in a car; they were going to get coffee. No danger in that. Besides, she didn\u2019t believe it. She just didn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>They walked to his car. She noted, as she started to get in, that he had a little case, like the kind kept by a diabetic. Was he diabetic? She couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>He shut the door as she sat.</p><p>He came around and got in beside her.</p><p>And then, of course, she realized.</p><p>She put her hand on the door; she opened her mouth to scream.</p><p>He slammed her head against the car window as he picked up a needle; she felt it piercing through her skin, and then she felt no more.</p><p>13</p><p>Jackson and Jake walked the square over and over looking for Ramsay Clayton.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t to be found.</p><p>\u201cStrange. The bastard answered me this morning when I called him and said we\u2019d find him at his hotel,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Jake stopped to ask a young woman selling paintings of the square if she had seen Ramsay Clayton that morning.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, he was here for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said that he had to get back to his hotel room to meet some friends. I haven\u2019t seen him since, but he is usually right here. Says lately he likes to be where there are lots and lots of people! The guy is as nice as can be, and darned good-looking, too, but he\u2019s sure gotten strange, always looking as if he\u2019s about to run! Such a scaredy-cat.\u201d</p><p>Jake thanked her for the information.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s either scared\u2014or guilty,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll head to the hotel again,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut first I\u2019m going to buy a couple of Lucky Dogs and some sodas. I\u2019m starving. We\u2019ll get the car and head to the hotel. I have a feeling we\u2019re not going to find Ramsay, though. Where the hell did he go? If he\u2019s such a damned scaredy-cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s not\u2014maybe it\u2019s all an act, down to his kindness,\u201d Jake suggested.</p><p>\u201cJustin said that Ramsay was with him, and that Ramsay said that he had fun playing a Yankee,\u201d Jackson reminded him.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not here,\u201d Jake said. He walked back to the woman. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you again,\u201d he told her. \u201cDid you see Ramsay Clayton here the day before yesterday?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, going into deep thought. He thought she might have smoked a little bit too much weed in her teen years. Her mind seemed a little misty.</p><p>\u201cThe day before yesterday... Oh, yes! He was here. He was here. In fact, we were both here until dusk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you both left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I left. I think he left soon after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBecause I was gone. I told you\u2014he likes to be around people. Some of the artists stay out late in the night, but by then people really want music and tarot readings. So he must have left. He\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized that his Glock, a standard FBI issue\u2014he knew how to shoot, but he wasn\u2019t fond of guns\u2014was visible since his hand was on his hip, pushing his jacket back and exposing the belt holster.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he should carry a gun, too. Are you a cop? Is he in trouble?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI just need to speak with him, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can give him some courage!\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you,\u201d Jake said, striding back to Jackson, frustrated. \u201cHe was here until dusk the day that Marty and Toby died. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure she knows what day it is today,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get food and try the hotel. Then we can head back. I\u2019ll get the dogs, you get the car.\u201d</p><p>Jackson stopped at a cart and bought them both a soda and a couple of hot dogs while Jake walked down to the car. He had just eased it out of their parking spot when Jackson caught up with him. He reached for the food; Jackson slid into his seat, a Lucky Dog halfway in his mouth. \u201cSorry\u2014I\u2019m really hungry. We\u2019re all going to miss Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she wanted to be away\u2014maybe needed to be away,\u201d Jake said. He found that he felt oddly uncomfortable once he had spoken.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think we should have taken her straight to the airport in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall her.\u201d</p><p>Jake did. He got her voice mail right away.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably on an airplane,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Jake agreed.</p><p>A feeling of unease had begun in him; it wasn\u2019t lessened any when they reached the hotel and found no sign of Ramsay Clayton.</p><p>They sat around in the roadside parlor. Ashley was on the registration-desk computer, and Will was working with her. Angela and Whitney were poring through content files on Whitney\u2019s laptop.</p><p>Jenna was in the attic, hoping that she could reach Emma Donegal.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Confederates,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cMarshall Donegal, of course. O\u2019Reilly, Charles\u2019s stepfather\u2019s ancestor. We know that he survived the war\u2014he came back and saw Emma. He probably had a guilt complex about causing the whole skirmish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two down. Now the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne was actually a Clayton; I know that,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cRamsay is a direct descendant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind out what happened to his ancestor,\u201d Angela said, looking up. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to trace a fellow named Pierre Lamont\u2014one of the Confederates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was Toby Keaton\u2019s great-great-whatever,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cToby comes down through the maternal line. It\u2019s a good thing they named it Beaumont, Beaumont\u2014beautiful mountain,\u201d she said with a grimace. \u201cNot that it\u2019s exactly on a mountain, but there is a little rise in the terrain. The family name changed many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we can let Toby go on this one,\u201d Angela said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Ashley agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Griffin Grant?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cFamily name change, too. His ancestor was... Hilton. Henry James Hilton. And he was killed in the war\u20141862, the Second Battle of Bull Run, or Manassas. We can do more research on Hilton.\u201d</p><p>Ashley stared at the screen, searching site after site for the Ramsay Clayton who had fought in the Confederate cavalry during the Civil War. She found him at last and turned to look at the two of them. \u201cRamsay Clayton\u2014the one our Ramsay is named for\u2014was killed at Gettysburg,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, he was already a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so...nothing dastardly happened to him?\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cNot other than a grisly death on a battlefield,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cAnd that would mean a half a million men who died might be vengeful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like something that would bring about revenge or a sick sense that you needed revenge in a future generation,\u201d Will said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for something that might have come about because of what happened at Donegal that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Hank Trebly?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cTrebly\u2014that was his ancestor\u2019s name, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee what you can find on him.\u201d</p><p>They all worked in silence for a while.</p><p>Whitney sighed as one site after another came up blank. \u201cNot found,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry. We need Jake. He\u2019s the one who can find anything on a computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you take over for a few minutes, Will? My back is killing me!\u201d Ashley pushed away from the desk. Will stepped back, looking at her.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSure. Why don\u2019t you go and try the attic with Jenna? See if you can sense, or even find, anything there?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m just going to grab some water first. And a cheese stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood!\u201d Will said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t eaten since break fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, everybody, meal break,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cEvery man for himself. There\u2019s no Beth to feed us delicious delicacies today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make a real dinner,\u201d Whitney said, yawning. Then she leapt up. \u201cAngela is right! Every man\u2014and woman\u2014for themselves! And dibs on the crab cakes!\u201d</p><p>As they started for the kitchen in a sudden mad hurry, they nearly collided with Jenna, who was coming down the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Angela asked her.</p><p>Jenna shook her head, frustrated. \u201cI can feel her, and I\u2019ve talked myself blue. But she won\u2019t appear for me, or she can\u2019t appear for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cI know who can reach her. She\u2019s been trying to reach him,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>They all stared at her.</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cBefore we even knew about Charles being missing, I think he saw her. I was kind of ignoring him, because he was just talking about someone he thought was about to lead a tour. But then we couldn\u2019t find her. The way he described her, she was a Southern white woman. He saw her coming through a crowd when we were at Caf\u00e9 du Monde. He told me that she had been trying to talk to him, and I said that was rather ridiculous, because she was across Decatur Street, and there was a lot going on, and unless she had been shouting, he couldn\u2019t have possibly heard her. But now, I think it all makes sense. It\u2019s Emma, and she\u2019s decided that if she\u2019s going to communicate with the living, it\u2019s going to be Jake.\u201d</p><p>Angela was thoughtful for a minute. \u201cAll right, then. We\u2019ll all get back on the computers after our very late lunch, and when Jake gets back, we\u2019ll just lock him in the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a plan,\u201d Ashley agreed. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my grandfather out of the study; he\u2019s been poring over bills long enough.\u201d</p> <p>Frazier wasn\u2019t sorting through their bills. He was seated there thoughtfully, staring down at his hands.</p><p>\u201cGrampa?\u201d Ashley asked him.</p><p>\u201cAshley,\u201d he said, looking up and giving her a brilliant smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get some lunch. Would you like to eat here, or in the dining room?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her right away.</p><p>\u201cGrampa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my dear.\u201d He let out a soft sigh. \u201cAshley, I can\u2019t help being afraid that if this drags on, we\u2019re going to lose the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen!\u201d she promised him. \u201cI swear, I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a house, Ashley. It is built of brick and mortar and stone. Life is what\u2019s important. I\u2019m thinking that Beth was right, that we should just leave. People are important, Ashley. You and I are important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut we have the best of the best on this. They will find the killer. They will find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat right here, Ashley. Then I\u2019ll drag my old bones up for a nap. Heaven knows, maybe we can get one of those reality programs to pay us the big bucks to come in and do a ghost documentary!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cThough I shudder! But I\u2019ll shudder away, if it helps us keep Donegal Plantation.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, she headed into the kitchen. Even with Beth gone, it didn\u2019t have to be every man for himself. There was plenty of food for everyone; Beth kept her leftovers well-packaged and dated.</p><p>Ashley found gumbo and heated it up for whoever might want it when they came down. She brought Frazier lunch on a tray, and then realized that it was late afternoon. It would be late when they were hungry again; they\u2019d call out for pizza, maybe.</p><p>\u201cAngela,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the cops who were always outside?\u201d Her grandfather\u2019s concern remained in her mind.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing patrols now, since they found the new bodies in the bayou. The logic is that this house is filled with agents\u2014and since others were killed at the bayou, the cops are more useful elsewhere. And we do have cameras going all over the property. Are you all right with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019d rather have a houseful of agents anytime,\u201d she assured her.</p><p>When she had finished her own bowl, she walked out to the back porch. She shouldn\u2019t call Jake; he was busy, but she decided to call him anyway; she could just let him know that they were all fine.</p><p>He answered on the first ring. \u201cAshley? Everything is all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine. I just thought that I would call and tell you so. Is, uh, is everything all right with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t find Ramsay Clayton, and I\u2019m sitting in front of a hotel, waiting for Jackson to see if anyone can tell us where he might have gone,\u201d Jake said. \u201cIs there anything new?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cActually, yes,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve been on the computer all day and tearing through the household records and accounts of the battle,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, I think that, after the battle, Emma was raped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014by whom? The enemy didn\u2019t take the house. Four were killed and two disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy one of her husband\u2019s supposed friends. One of the Confederate soldiers. And...and I think that he was attacked by someone else while he was raping her, and I think that person might have been Cliff\u2019s ancestor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was in the household records? That\u2019s surprising,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was silent a second.</p><p>\u201cAshley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know this, Jake.\u201d She was silent again for a minute; then words rushed from her. \u201cI pushed you away once, Jake. I thought I was afraid of you, but I was afraid because I was terrified my father would appear before me, too, or that there was always something there that I didn\u2019t see and didn\u2019t want to see, but I do see. My ancestor is here. I can reach him, Jake, I can reach Marshall Donegal. He\u2019s trying to help. We need you here, when you can come. I think\u2014and the others agree\u2014that whoever attacked Emma Donegal was the ancestor of the man who attacked Charles Osgood, and then Toby Keaton and Marty Dean.\u201d</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>\u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI guess it falls in. We\u2019ve known it was someone close who had to be the murderer. I didn\u2019t know that Emma had been attacked\u2014until you told me. Are you certain about that? Wouldn\u2019t it have shown up in the records somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, only a small percentage of women report a rape now. Back then, Emma Donegal would have never breathed a word of it\u2014any more than she would have mentioned she\u2019d taken on an ex-slave as a lover and borne a child of his. He brought me\u2014he brought me back there. In a dream, Jake. I\u2014I saw it. I saw it all. And it was real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you. You know I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOnly Emma can tell us. And Whitney says that you\u2019re the one who can reach her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen her,\u201d he admitted. \u201cShe brought me to you when you were out riding. But...I can\u2019t seem to get her to talk, to stay. Maybe she\u2019s ashamed, even though nothing was her fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, she trusts you. She at least shows herself to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back soon. Take care until then, huh? Wait, hold on a minute!\u201d The line fell silent and she frowned with concern. \u201cJake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here\u2014Jackson just had a conversation with Detective Mack Colby. Seems that the remains of Toby and Marty yielded the same drugs\u2014they were able to push the toxicology reports to the top level. You all be careful there, swear it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she promised him. \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re together, and we don\u2019t intend to let anything happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best intentions,\u201d Jake murmured.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStick together. I think that this killer is basically a coward\u2014that\u2019s why he has to attack with a drug cocktail that\u2019s so potent it immediately renders his victims powerless. If you remain en masse, you\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said softly. \u201cJake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I was only afraid of you. I never stopped loving you.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a minute; she wondered if she had spoken those words aloud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved you forever,\u201d he said and hung up.</p><p>Ashley looked at the phone and smiled. Walking back in, she found that Angela was washing dishes at the sink. \u201cHey,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI was going to bring some tea up to Frazier, but I thought that you might want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. I should sit with him for a few minutes. This has to be taking a terrible toll on him. Not because he isn\u2019t strong at heart, but just because\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his eighties. The body wears down, and that\u2019s the way it is,\u201d Angela said. \u201cThe water is just whistling now. You go on up. We\u2019ll keep at it on the computer.\u201d</p><p>Ashley poured hot water over the leaves in the pot, turned off the stove and added a cup, sugar and milk to her tray. She started through the parlor; Whitney was sitting at the screens again, watching to see if there was any activity in the key areas.</p><p>\u201cHey, you know anything about this?\u201d she called to Ashley.</p> <p>Ashley walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cAmundsen\u2019s Hay\u2014Finest Feed. That\u2019s what that truck says,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cIs that a usual delivery?\u201d</p><p>Ashley shrugged. \u201cYes, that\u2019s our feed store. When were they here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few minutes ago. I think the trunk\u2014yep, there it goes, out the drive now.\u201d</p><p>Ashley balanced the tray in one hand and dug her phone from her jeans pocket with the other. She speed-dialed Cliff\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, relieved when he answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hey\u2014as in hay for horses. We just got a delivery? I thought it was due yesterday,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cIt was, and it came. Seemed we had some kind of a double order. Amundsen\u2019s kid was driving the truck, and somehow it wound up on his books two days in a row. Rather than take back the order, they gave me a fifty-percent discount. I took it. Seemed like the thing to do right now,\u201d Cliff said to her. \u201cThat all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. That\u2019s always your decision. Those poor creatures would probably die if they had to depend on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Ashley. Our four-legged creatures love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust checking that everything is fine,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cYep. And I\u2019m a big old dude, Ashley. Don\u2019t be worrying about me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re not old, and every female who comes out this way winds up with a crush on you. Don\u2019t go fishing for compliments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m just not feeling as if the love is going to come pouring in right now,\u201d he said. \u201cSeriously, all is good. I\u2019m working in the stables. My eyes are open. I\u2019ll holler if I need anything.\u201d</p><p>She hung up. The tea tray was starting to get heavy in her one hand. She shoved her phone back into her pocket and grasped the tray with both hands. \u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d she told Whitney.</p><p>Whitney nodded and gave her attention back to the screens.</p><p>Ashley walked up the stairs to her grandfather\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ashley,\u201d he said, opening his eyes when she entered. He\u2019d been lying back on his pillow with his eyes closed. \u201cI told Angela you all didn\u2019t have to bother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly so many names for so many of us to try to track,\u201d Ashley said cheerfully.</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cWe think that it all stretches back to something that might have happened with one of the soldiers here linked to the original fight. Something that this latter-day idiot may see as a perceived slight that needs to be rectified.\u201d</p><p>Frazier closed his eyes again. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that anyone would actually be after Charles Osgood,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPoor Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Frazier told her, opening his eyes and plumping his pillow to rise against it for his tea, \u201cI can say this. Charles was happy. We can be glad we gave him his moment in the sun, brief though it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, Ramsay gave him his moment in the sun,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>Frazier smiled and nodded. \u201cI never saw him happy, though. Never until that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Ashley said. She was silent for a minute.</p><p>\u201cGrampa, have you ever managed to talk with a ghost?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>His lashes flickered over his eyes, and he was silent for a minute. \u201cGhosts\u2014are they memories? My life is now filled them, and when we are accustomed to sorrow or loss, we learn to appreciate what shining moments we had. Your father! God, how he loved your mother. Well, you knew that. He\u2019d have never have left you on purpose, but...I try to think that death for him was being with her. And that\u2019s how I find my peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful, Grampa.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her wryly. \u201cWell, it\u2019s all right. In all actuality, I wish we\u2019d known that she was allergic to bees, and that it hadn\u2019t taken such a toll on your dad, and that they were still here with us. I ache a little every day. But I watch you\u2014and I thank God for what I have.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and kissed his forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He sipped his tea. \u201cGrampa.\u201d</p><p>He set the cup down on his bedside table and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGrampa?\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand in the air. \u201cGhosts exist. There. If they can reach you, you are among the lucky. I want there to be ghosts. I want to talk to my son again. I\u2019d love a chance to tell my own father what a good man he was and what a rebellious rotten kid I was. But they\u2019re gone. And if they\u2019re not, they don\u2019t reach out to me. So, I carry on conversations daily in my head. I tell your mother how beautiful you are and how good you are to your old grandfather. I tell your dad how proud he\u2019d be of you. Do they hear me? God knows.</p><p>\u201cCherish your ghosts, child. Real or in your head. Cherish them. Now, go work with those young people below, and let me get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and sat in the chair at his bedside.</p><p>He opened his eyes again. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI just want to be near you for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. She grasped his.</p><p>She sat with him in silence, and in time, she heard his even breathing. He was napping.</p><p>She almost dozed with him herself. Then her cell phone buzzed, and she jumped up quickly, hurrying out to the hall to answer it.</p><p>When she answered it, there was no one there.</p><p>She looked at the caller ID. Beth.</p><p>She dialed back, feeling a sense of relief. Beth had already made it to New York.</p><p>Once again, she got nothing but voice mail.</p><p>She left a message. \u201cBeth! It\u2019s Ashley. I think you\u2019re there, because you called me. But now you\u2019re not answering. Call me. Now you got me worried.\u201d</p><p>She hung up. She found herself looking at the attic stairs. Tempted, she walked up and stood in the room again.</p><p>\u201cYou were with me this morning!\u201d she said. \u201cMarshall started my dream, but you were with me this morning. You made me see\u2014but not clearly enough. Please, help me.\u201d</p><p>She realized that dusk was coming, falling softly and surely beyond the garret window, the window from which Emma had watched her beloved Marshall fall in a bayonet attack.</p><p>But Emma was not going to appear for her, or so it seemed. Sighing, she flicked on one of the small lights over a display cabinet containing family letters and other artifacts. She slid open the case, thankful now that the cases were never locked\u2014which, of course, had made it easy for the killer to take the Enfield and the bayonet.</p><p>She picked up a letter and began to read it. She couldn\u2019t make out who it had been written to; the script was all but illegible. She\u2019d catalogued everything in the room, and had reviewed them recently for the team, but she\u2019d never read this one in depth. It was too difficult to decipher. She narrowed her eyes, hoping that swirly cursive would become easier to read, but she couldn\u2019t really tell. She saw that it was signed on the bottom\u2014twice. Ramsay Clayton...and there was another name. The letter, she finally realized, had been written to Ginnie. Ginnie H. And it had been signed by Ramsay Clayton\u2014and someone else. Either someone had written the letter for Ramsay Clayton, or Ramsay Clayton had written it for someone else. She thought that she saw an oddly shaped 4 beneath the name Ramsay Clayton. \u201cMy dear wife,\u201d she read aloud. \u201cForgive that this is not my hand; it has been broken in a ski...ski accident?\u201d she said, and almost laughed at herself. \u201cSkirmish! It says skirmish.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her own words faded away. She turned and saw her.</p><p>Emma was pale and almost a shadow against the far wall, where she had once urged her children to gather.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d Ashley whispered. \u201cPlease, only you know!\u201d</p><p>The phantom figure of Emma started to move toward her. She was going to speak. She seemed to be pointing toward the letter.</p><p>Ashley\u2019s phone began to ring again. She cursed the sound; the phantom figure coming toward her evaporated into thin air. She set the letter down in the case as she answered the phone.</p><p>She answered tersely. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>The line went dead again. She muted the phone and tried calling back quickly, but she got her friend\u2019s voice mail again. At least she was able to call. She looked around, but saw nothing but the shadows of the darkening day fill the room. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said softly, \u201cPlease, come back.\u201d</p><p>Cliff stopped raking hay off the main floor and looked up. Varina was whinnying loudly, as if she was in distress.</p><p>Once Varina started up, Jeff decided he was going to make some noise, too.</p><p>\u201cHey, girl, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d he asked. He walked over to pat the horse, gentle as he stroked the softness of her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, girl, it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>She tossed her head back, unappeased by his words.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, girl. You\u2019re the one they all look to here, just like your mistress, you know. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>The horse let him soothe her. Then the mare gave another toss of her head again, letting out another loud whinny.</p><p>On the other side of the stables, Tigger grew restless. Cliff heard something like a bang from his stall, and he walked over to soothe the young gelding. \u201cTigger, don\u2019t you go getting feisty on me, now. These are tiring days, boy.\u201d</p><p>He hoped that kick hadn\u2019t broken off part of the stall\u2019s side. He couldn\u2019t see. It was getting dark. He cursed and went to flick on the overhead bulb that would light up the entire stables.</p><p>Though the light banished the shadows, he was still uneasy. He stepped back into his apartment for his shotgun and came out again, looking around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The horses were still restless.</p><p>Ashley stood in the near darkness when she felt the tremor of her phone. She had just about thought that she had seen a figure growing from the shadows.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d she swore. She glanced at the caller ID. \u201cBeth!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, where the hell are you that this number keeps going dead?\u201d she said aloud. She punched the return key.</p><p>This time, there was a click.</p><p>\u201cBeth, damn! This has been driving me crazy. Where are you? Are you having fun in the city?\u201d she said, realizing she was speaking in a rush.</p><p>There was silence at the other end, and then the sound of breathing.</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d</p> <p>A throaty, masculine voice came to her\u2014not Beth\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAshley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this? Where is Beth?\u201d</p><p>The chuckle that sounded in her ears seemed barely human. She shook her head. There was no devil on the other end of the line. There was a human monster, and she had to be very careful now.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want? Who is this? Where is Beth?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cBeth is still alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI can see you,\u201d the voice said.</p><p>She froze. \u201cIf you can see me, where am I?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Her heart was racing; she wanted to find Angela and the others, but she was afraid that he really did see her.</p><p>And that he really had Beth.</p><p>The chuckle came to her again; the chuckle that seemed to make her heart stop and her blood turn to ice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the attic,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was dark here; he couldn\u2019t possibly see her now.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Actually, I\u2019m in the parlor, and everyone around me can hear the call,\u201d she said.</p><p>The laugh\u2014more irritated now. \u201cYou\u2019re in the attic, and if you talk to any of the people in that house with you, Beth is going to die. You know that I\u2019ll do it. And you know that I don\u2019t care how. I can cut her, I can shoot her...drown her. She\u2019s going to die, and it will be all your fault.\u201d</p><p>She tried to control her sense of raw panic and fear. She had to be sensible. There was a chance that Beth was already dead.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I have her. I have her phone,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t know what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want? Well, at this point, that should be obvious, Ashley. I want you. So listen to me, and listen to me good. Do exactly as I say. If you come out, I\u2019ll let Beth go. Even trade. You for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know that you\u2019ll let her live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t exactly sign a contract, can I? What if I were to swear to God? Hmm, I don\u2019t believe in any God, other than myself, really. So, here it is. You meet me in the cemetery, or I kill Beth. I\u2019ll string her up on a tomb, just like good old Charles Osgood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cemetery?\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that the group inside is watching screens. They\u2019ll see what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will, but they won\u2019t think anything of it, because you\u2019re going to bring a dish of food out to Cliff.\u201d He started to laugh. \u201cOh, yeah, you\u2019re going to bring a bowl of food out to Cliff! And then, Ashley, I\u2019ll take it from there. I see you heading across the yard to the stables in three minutes precisely, or Beth dies.\u201d</p><p>The phone line died in her hand.</p><p>Interlude</p><p>Good God, who had ever expected such a windfall to come directly into his hands?</p><p>This was it\u2014the pinnacle!</p><p>He frowned for a minute; it had actually come so quickly and so easily.</p><p>To really savor this, he had to take his time.</p><p>How much time did he have? He had to make sure that they all wound up shooting one another when the going got rough. But he knew how to do that; he knew how to accomplish exactly what he wanted. Ashley wasn\u2019t stupid; she would know that he meant to kill her.</p><p>But she was too good a person to risk the life of a friend when she just might save it.</p><p>She would come; she would come.</p><p>And when she did, he was prepared.</p><p>Truly, tonight could be a wonderful bloodbath.</p><p>14</p><p>Jake chafed, growing restless. They\u2019d had to make a detour to the coroner\u2019s office; Augie had called Jackson.</p><p>The facilities here were state-of-the-art. He\u2019d been to the morgues plenty of times before\u2014just the way that his life had gone\u2014and he was impressed with the shiny steel gurneys and sinks and equipment, and the sterility of the place.</p><p>Too many times when he had been involved with death, the morgue had been an empty building somewhere, and the rats had already become kings.</p><p>Bright lights were now on over the bodies of Marty Dean and Toby Keaton; they had been cleaned up, and with the sheets partially covering their torsos, they looked far better than they had when he had last seen them.</p><p>Augie, in green scrubs, a cap and mask, held a chart in front of him and rattled off the amount of drugs that had been found in both bodies.</p><p>Jake wanted to grab the chart; it didn\u2019t matter how much\u2014the drugs had been present. And the two on the tables, though looking better, were still corpses.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s interesting,\u201d Augie said, using a gloved finger to point out Marty Dean\u2019s lips. \u201cMarty was drowned. Her lungs were full of water, and you can see the blue coloration around her neck. Toby Keaton, on the other hand, was strangled.\u201d He looked at them over his mask. \u201cDespite the fact that they were drugged, I think you\u2019ll realize what this means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to change tactics?\u201d Jake asked. \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks as if the two struggled. There were tufts of some kind of black material, which I\u2019ve sent to the lab, caught up in Toby Keaton\u2019s clothing\u2014hard to find, I assure you, when everything is the color black,\u201d Augie told him. He smiled grimly. \u201cOur lab is good. The tufts are not the same fabric as the jacket Toby was wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley did see someone else that night. She climbed up that tree to escape him,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>His feeling of urgency and restlessness was growing. He needed to escape the morgue. He didn\u2019t give a damn how many times he had been in one. There was still the smell. The smell of chemicals. And death.</p><p>\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve narrowed the field to three suspects,\u201d Jake said. \u201cRamsay Clayton, Griffin Grant and Hank Trebly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cliff Boudreaux,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe can\u2019t eliminate him yet. He\u2019s had access, he\u2019s on the property\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was at the stables when I rushed out to find Ashley,\u201d Jake reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes, and he could have circled those woods around just about anyone. He has lived on that property all his life,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cThe police searched his apartment with his full cooperation,\u201d Jake said, stating the fact.</p><p>\u201cWe still can\u2019t eliminate him\u2014he knows the property like the back of his hand,\u201d Jackson reminded him.</p><p>Jake didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u201cWell, gentlemen, here\u2019s why I brought you in here,\u201d Augie said. \u201cLook at Toby\u2019s neck there.\u201d</p><p>They both studied the neck. There was heavy bruising and signs of fingers having pressed in.</p><p>\u201cHe was strangled by hand, wouldn\u2019t you agree?</p><p>There are no ligature marks,\u201d Augie said.</p><p>They both looked at him.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, exasperated. \u201cI can guarantee you, you\u2019re down one suspect. Hank Trebly didn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had surgery in his left wrist about six months ago. I know, because we discussed it at an Elks meeting the other month. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to use both hands as they were used on this victim. So, you see, if you\u2019re right, you are down to three men\u2014Ramsay Clayton, Griffin Grant, or Cliff Boudreaux.\u201d</p><p>When they left the morgue, they were no more than a twenty-minute ride away from the house, but the compulsion Jake felt\u2014the mounting pressure\u2014did not let up. He called Ashley; when he got her voice mail, he nearly drove off the road.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not answering!\u201d he told Jackson.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Angela,\u201d Jackson said calmly.</p><p>He smiled at Jake when Angela answered her phone. \u201cJake is in a dither. He just called Ashley, and she didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. No, we\u2019re almost there,\u201d he said. \u201cFifteen minutes or so.\u201d</p><p>He hung up.</p><p>\u201cSo, where\u2019s Ashley?\u201d Jake demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Angela said that she\u2019s up with Frazier. She just brought him some tea, and she was sitting with him. She said that they\u2019ve been following computer trails all day, but that going from site to site is about to make them all buggy. They\u2019re anxious to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m anxious to see them,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>He stepped on the gas.</p><p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s arrive alive!\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cCall Angela back,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease, have her get Ashley to her phone.\u201d</p><p>Jackson sighed, and called back.</p><p>This time, there was no answer on Angela\u2019s phone.</p><p>Ashley carried a big bowl of gumbo in her hand. She looked up to see that Angela had followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cCliff just called. He\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should come to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no bother, and he knows you all are watching the grounds,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cJake called a few minutes ago. Hon, where did I leave my phone after that? Oh, hell, I have no idea. Anyway, they\u2019re almost back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll reserve one camera to watch you walk over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Really, please.\u201d</p><p>Angela wasn\u2019t stupid. She could see something in Ashley\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Ashley let out a sigh. She wasn\u2019t alone; Ashley knew that she didn\u2019t dare do anything other than what she was doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walked out of the house, relieved, knowing that someone would follow, someone would carefully follow, and stop whatever terrible thing was being planned.</p><p>She felt ill; now her stomach was churning, too.</p><p>Cliff!</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t forget the voice. Cliff is hungry. Cliff wants food.</p><p>And then the laughter.</p><p>She walked toward the stables; she hadn\u2019t come unprepared.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she expected. She saw Cliff standing in front of Tigger\u2019s stall, his shotgun in his hand.</p> <p>Where had he stashed Beth?</p><p>He turned to look at her and frowned. She hurried toward him, pretty certain that she was going to have only one chance.</p><p>\u201cHere. Take it,\u201d she said, thrusting the bowl of cold gumbo toward him.</p><p>Human instinct. He went to grasp the bowl; his shotgun was loose in his hand.</p><p>She dropped the bowl into his hands and grabbed the shotgun from him; before he could utter a word, she slammed the butt of it against his head as hard as she could.</p><p>He looked at her in disbelief as he fell back against the gate to Tigger\u2019s stall and slumped to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cAshley,\u201d he said.</p><p>And then the lights on the property went out. Someone had hit the breaker.</p><p>Jake drove the car down the long, oak-lined path to the house. Just when he reached the drive in front, the lights went out. All of them.</p><p>The world became a misty shade of gray; dusk was upon them.</p><p>Jackson swore; Jake set a hand on his arm. \u201cThe generators will kick in!\u201d he said.</p><p>But the generators didn\u2019t kick in.</p><p>Jackson took off for the house; Jake started to follow him, but he stopped.</p><p>She was there.</p> <p>Emma Donegal was there, and she was standing on the path by the side of the house. She beckoned to him.</p><p>He followed her. She led him around to the stables. He could barely see in the near dark. The moon was rising, not quite full, but it lent an eerie glow to his surroundings.</p><p>\u201cWhere, Emma, where?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>He heard a groan. He hurried over to the sound. Cliff Boudreaux was down on the ground, holding the side of his head.</p><p>\u201cCliff, what the hell happened?\u201d Jake demanded.</p><p>\u201cAshley...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley did this to you?\u201d Jake demanded.</p><p>\u201cBehind her...someone behind her.\u201d Cliff grasped his arm. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see...couldn\u2019t tell...it went dark so fast. But I saw her face. He had to have called her out here. I didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on...the horses...I\u2019ll help you....\u201d</p><p>Cliff caught his arm and tried to struggle to his feet.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make it. He slipped back down to the ground. His head slumped to the side.</p><p>Ashley was out there. The killer had her.</p><p>Where?</p><p>Ashley didn\u2019t know what in the hell had hit her; she\u2019d felt a sting, and then nothing more.</p><p>And now, she didn\u2019t know where she was.</p><p>Her eyes were open, she thought. But the world was still dark.</p><p>She tried to blink; even blinking seemed an in credible effort.</p><p>Then she felt...something. She realized that she was being carried. Her head bobbed and smacked against a man\u2019s shoulders, and she had absolutely no control over it. She tried to focus, and she realized that she couldn\u2019t see because there were no lights. Struggling to regain some clarity, she decided that he must be carrying her away from the stables.</p><p>She blinked and she could begin to see shapes around her; the moon was rising against the swiftly falling twilight. Her focus was bad, but she could try to see. She felt the man\u2019s exertion as she was hefted over some obstacle in his path.</p><p>Cliff!</p><p>She had practically shattered his skull, thinking that he was the one who had called. That he was the one who had somehow managed to kidnap Beth.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Cliff; she had just left him behind, staring at her as if she were the worst traitor known to man, which, of course, she was....</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, Cliff! she thought. But what was that going to matter now?</p><p>Thump, thump, grind...</p><p>Her chin fell against the man\u2019s back. He was a big man. Strong, powerful in the chest and shoulders.</p><p>She heard a creaking sound. They were back in the cemetery, she realized. She was surrounded by the towering white architecture of her ancestral city of the dead. The tombs seemed to glisten a silvery white against the dusky sky.</p><p>She\u2019d always been meant for the Donegal tomb eventually.</p><p>It seemed that time was now.</p><p>She could barely see; barely think, barely function. But she was aware! Was this how it had been for Charles Osgood, Marty Dean and Toby Keaton?</p><p>Had they known they were about to die but been unable to respond, to react in any way? Maybe not. Maybe the dosage of the drugs they had received had been stronger. Maybe...</p><p>Hope swelled, just the tiniest bit. She needed to do something, or she was going to die.</p><p>No, Angela thought that she was with Cliff.</p><p>And Angela was trapped in the dark. Angela wouldn\u2019t know until...</p><p>Suddenly, she saw Marshall Donegal at her side. He drew his phantom sword and swiped at her carrier\u2019s neck. The sword slashed right through it. Ashley tried to smile. She felt her lips move. She did have some...some...no... She tried to lift her head, but she could not.</p><p>But a real-life rock in front of the man nearly tripped him; he stumbled. She was a deadweight, she remembered, even if she wasn\u2019t near the weight he must have struggled with when he attacked Charles Osgood.</p><p>She heard the faint sound of a creaking once again, and she realized that she was being brought into her family tomb; the temple tomb.</p><p>She felt it! She felt pain when her body was slammed down on the central altar in the tomb. Pain meant life. The still rising moon shed an eerie yellow illumination into the tomb through the grate in the far wall.</p><p>She heard her attacker working quickly, lifting the heavy marble siding from one of the shelf tombs nearby.</p><p>Marshall Donegal\u2019s tomb.</p><p>He turned to her, smiling.</p><p>She knew him before she saw his face. HJH. His wife had been Ginnie. Ginnie Hilton. And Ramsay Clayton had written a letter to her for her husband, Henry James Hilton, because Hilton\u2019s hand had been broken. It hadn\u2019t been broken in the skirmish; it had been broken when he had attacked Emma Donegal and Harold Boudreaux had set upon him, dragging him off the woman he had so brutally attacked.</p><p>\u201cAshley, you see me! I should have known that you would see me. You were always so special. So precious. And now...\u201d</p><p>He paused, listening. There was commotion going on; people shouting. She couldn\u2019t understand them, but she knew that they were searching the grounds. Angela had known where she was going, and by now they had surely found Cliff, and they would be looking for her.</p><p>She twitched her lips and managed to smile at him in return. She couldn\u2019t speak. She willed him to understand her thoughts.</p><p>They\u2019ll know that it was you. Angela will be reading those old letters, and they\u2019ll figure it out faster than I did. They\u2019ll know. They already know that it\u2019s a sick grudge you have against my family. So, your ancestor died in the war\u2014because his hand was broken. No one blamed Harold Boudreaux for what he did to your ancestor, because his fellow rebels knew what had happened when they saw Henry\u2019s broken hand; they were appalled that he\u2019d attacked Emma. They didn\u2019t string up Harold Boudreaux, but they didn\u2019t speak about any of it, either. All for honor! Well, the honor here died with Marshall Donegal, didn\u2019t it? And you can\u2019t stand that. Well, I may die, but you will, too. They\u2019ll catch you, and you\u2019ll rot in prison until they stick a needle in your arm, and that will be fitting, won\u2019t it?</p><p>He stared at her, his face growing mottled, as if he could hear her thoughts. Of course, he couldn\u2019t\u2014he just saw that she had figured out the truth.</p><p>He slapped her, and she felt the sting again. Had he attacked so many people now that he was running out of his drug cocktail?</p><p>Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be so happy to feel. She didn\u2019t know how he intended for her to die. And they were in the vault now with the gate locked. Even if they searched the cemetery, they wouldn\u2019t think to look in the vault. The gates hadn\u2019t been opened since her father had died; the tomb was sealed after every interment.</p><p>Yes, they had. Sometime while he\u2019d been on the property, Griffin Grant had unlocked the iron gates and unsealed the tomb entrance. He had planned for a very long time to see that she came here.</p><p>The iron gates were closed, as if they\u2019d never been open. The concrete sliding door behind the ornamental iron gates was barely ajar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back and see you, my dear Ashley,\u201d he promised. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t try to enter my mind, then. You\u2019ll be dead. Everyone pays, Ashley. It\u2019s your turn to pay for the sins of your fathers. You have it all wrong. I know, because Henry talks to me. He told me that he needed to be avenged. He died at Manassas, but he died because he couldn\u2019t shoot. He died\u2014because of Emma, and she was a filthy whore who teased and tormented him. Ashley, I saw the letter years ago, and then I could hear him\u2014I could hear him crying out to me. Someone had to avenge what had happened.\u201d</p><p>She tried to move her lips. Emma was not a whore. She was a grieving widow.</p><p>\u201cHe came to see her, to take care of her. She led him on, Ashley. I\u2019ve seen you do it, too. So many of your kind do it. You\u2019re like her. Everyone just thinks that you\u2019re honest and caring. But, you see, she didn\u2019t pay. You will. I thought it might be hard, Ashley. Do you realize that? I thought it might be hard to kill. Ramsay would have done just as well as Charles. That didn\u2019t matter. The newswoman, well, she was like a rabid dog. And that ridiculous Toby huffing on over...he wasn\u2019t quite so easy. But you know what, Ashley?\u201d</p><p>His face came close to hers, and he smiled. She loathed him; she wanted to back away from him. She couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cKilling is fun. I found out I like it. But this may be the finale. Ashley, beautiful blonde Ashley, the last of the true Donegals\u2014dead with her ancestors. Oh, watching you, Ashley. My ancestor never told me it would feel so good!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifted her again. To her horror, she realized that one of the heavy slabs had been removed from the shelves on each side of the tomb.</p><p>He rolled her into one of them.</p><p>It was dark in the burial ledge within the tomb, and she couldn\u2019t see. Somehow, she knew that she was nestled against the disintegrating fragments of Marshall Donegal\u2019s skull.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so it is done!\u201d</p><p>She heard the faint sound of scraping as the side slab was lifted and slid back into place.

Running in a thousand different directions wouldn\u2019t serve him well.</p> <p>Where could the killer have taken her so quickly?</p><p>\u201cWhitney, mount up with Will\u2014take the woods toward the bayou, look around for freshly disturbed dirt or a stone in the ground, a grave site. Angela, I\u2019m going into the cemetery\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just ran through the cemetery. There\u2019s no one there,\u201d Angela said, disheartened. \u201cI ran through every row of tombs, Jake, I swear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need an ambulance for Cliff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalled already,\u201d Angela assured him.</p><p>\u201cIs she in the house? Could she have gone back into the house?\u201d Jake demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014I\u2019ll check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go\u2014stick with Jackson!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Jake tore through the back door. He sped through the ground floor, shouting her name. He hurried to the second floor, nearly wrenching doors from their handles.</p><p>He burst in on Frazier, who was just rising. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t heard the commotion, and, sleeping, hadn\u2019t realized that they\u2019d lost power.</p><p>\u201cJake? What is it?\u201d he demanded. Then with some innate instinct, he cried out, \u201cAshley\u2014something has happened to Ashley!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s missing, but I\u2019ll find her\u2014I swear, I\u2019ll find her,\u201d Jake said and tore out of the room. He looked at the attic stairs, and he raced up to the attic.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t there. He started to turn. But then he stopped, seeing someone else.</p><p>Emma Donegal. She was pointing at an open cabinet. He stared at her, not understanding. She pointed straight to a letter in the cabinet. \u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d he whispered desperately. But he picked up the paper, and heard her voice. \u201cRead it!\u201d So he did, squinting.</p> <p>And as he read, he saw the painting in the office-reception area of the Southern cavalry man\u2014who had died at Manassas. Who had been injured before he\u2019d gotten to Manassas.</p><p>They\u2019d been so close...</p><p>And now it was so clear. Ramsay was just afraid.</p><p>And Griffin was a practiced liar, a totally functioning sociopath.</p><p>He dropped the letter, and went racing out of the house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Grant!\u201d he roared as he hurried out. \u201cGriffin Grant! He\u2019s out there, and he\u2019s got Ashley!\u201d</p><p>Jackson gripped his arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her. How do you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis ancestor was a Hilton. Hilton died at Manassas. He died because his hand never healed correctly\u2014at least that\u2019s what Grant must think... He\u2019s got Ashley out there somewhere. We have to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did he get on the property unseen?\u201d Jackson demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe hay truck! He must have sent that extra delivery of hay. He got on the hay truck,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Jake saw that Cliff was on the ground, but Jenna, always the caregiver, was down at his side taking his pulse. She looked up at Jake. \u201cHis pulse is steady, and his breathing isn\u2019t affected. He\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Cliff lifted a hand. He was trying to indicate something. The stall! Jake realized. Tigger\u2019s stall.</p><p>He burst into the stall. The horse was nervous. He soothed it, quickly casting his gaze around the floor.</p><p>He saw the body bundled beneath hay in the corner and ran to it. He dug away the hay like a maddened dog.</p><p>He let out a cry. It wasn\u2019t Ashley.</p><p>It was Beth.</p><p>He lifted her quickly. Her head lolled. \u201cJenna!\u201dhe shouted, bringing Beth\u2019s limp body from the stall. \u201cJenna!\u201d</p><p>Jenna left Cliff\u2019s side. She flashed a light in Beth\u2019s eyes; he noted that the pupils dilated.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive. There\u2019s an ambulance on the way. He might have overdosed her badly\u2014thank God help is nearly here. The detective has been called as well.\u201d</p><p>Help was nearly there. But there was no sign of Ashley.</p><p>Jake started. This time, he saw a man.</p><p>A man in full Confederate dress; his sword in a hilt at his side, secured by a butternut-colored sash. The man beckoned to him with hands encased in cavalry gloves.</p><p>Jake started walking.</p><p>A frown knit his brow. Angela had just said that she\u2019d searched the cemetery. Angela was thorough, and she didn\u2019t lie.</p><p>But the ghost wanted him to follow.</p><p>The ghost of Marshall Donegal.</p><p>And so he did.</p><p>He was dimly aware of the sounds behind him as he walked forward. Jenna was dealing with both her patients; Whitney and Will were mounting up to search the woods before the bayou; Jackson and Angela were hurrying out to search the guest building, empty now for days.</p><p>He walked to the gate, and it swung out slightly as if to invite him. He walked through the gate, and he drew the gun that he wore in his belt holster when he was on official business. He moved through the cemetery; like Angela, he saw nothing.</p><p>He started to hurry, making his way to the chapel in the back, and he nearly tore the door from its hinges there; he shined his light into every corner, but there was no sign of Ashley.</p><p>He turned around, and the ghost was there again, beckoning him\u2014and showing him the way.</p><p>He ran through the trails of the small city of the dead, through temple tombs, through step tombs, pyramid tombs and every manner of tomb that had been built through the centuries.</p><p>He knew where he would end.</p><p>The ghost stood before the Donegal vault. The slab was in place; the wrought-iron gate was closed. The ghost stared at him with aggravation and turned and tugged at the gate.</p><p>Jake burst forward and tugged at the wrought iron himself; it swung open far too easily. He pushed at the concrete barrier that was usually resealed after every interment.</p><p>And it, too, gave.</p><p>The ghost was trying to speak to him; he had no time to listen. He shoved at the thin sealing slab again, and it fell backward, bursting into a million pieces in a cloud of concrete dust.</p><p>\u201cAshley!\u201d He screamed her name.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The moon cast a yellow glow through the grating, and he blinked, adjusting his eyes to the more muted light. He moved to the altar and saw that something had lain there. The dust was disturbed. He turned...</p><p>Not quickly enough. Someone slammed into him hard; his gun went flying from his hand as he staggered for balance.</p><p>Griffin!</p><p>The man was using himself as a ram against Jake and trying to stab him at the same time. Jake saw his arm rise, and he saw the needle coming at him, and he, in turn, used his body and slammed back against his attacker with all his weight.</p><p>Griffin fell back a foot.</p><p>Jake caught his attacker\u2019s wrist, squeezed with all of his strength, and the needle went flying across the tomb.</p><p>But his attacker made a dive for Jake\u2019s gun. In the murky light of the tomb, he struggled desperately to keep his attacker from twisting the barrel of the gun toward his head or chest. He roundhouse-kicked his opponent, keeping a desperate and rigid hold on the gun, and the man grunted and gave slightly, but when Jake tried to use the advantage to wrest the gun fully from him, the fellow came at him, biting like a dog.</p><p>Jake shoved him off when he came straight for his throat. The gun went flying across the room.</p><p>He set at his attacker with his bare hands, but Griffin Grant had now pulled a knife from a sheath at his ankle. They were fighting blindly, but he still felt the man, felt the movement in the air, and he ducked the man\u2019s wild swing.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fight any better than your scumbag rapist of an ancestor, Grant!\u201d Jake taunted him. He needed to get the knife; he\u2019d never find the gun in the darkness.</p><p>Provoking him worked. Grant let out a roar and came crashing across the tomb.</p><p>That time, he nicked Jake\u2019s arm. But Jake heard the knife slide against marble and concrete and made a dash across the tomb, pinning the man there.</p><p>The knife went clattering to the floor, and the two of them fell along with it, engaged in a wrestling match that would surely leave one dead. Jake struggled for the top spot; Grant locked his legs around him in a vise, twisting him beneath. His hands came around Jake\u2019s throat, but Jake caught him with a double-fisted slam against the head.</p><p>Grant teetered.</p><p>And then the side of the one of the tombs slammed against him, throwing him off. Ashley, covered in bone and ash, emerged. Jake leapt to his feet, reaching for her swiftly and drawing her to her feet.</p><p>Grant came at his back, slamming his fists hard against him, sending Jake staggering forward, his arms enveloping Ashley lest she crash against something again. She was slipping and falling; she had no strength in her legs. He had to help her, had to protect her...</p><p>He turned his back to her, ready to withstand Grant\u2019s next massive lunge. Grant was ready to make another ram against Jake, but suddenly an ear splitting roar seemed to echo through the tomb, and Grant dropped to the ground; his body shuddered mightily once and then didn\u2019t move again.</p><p>Jake blinked.</p><p>Frazier was standing at the entrance to the tomb, the lost gun still smoking in his hands.</p><p>\u201cGrampa!\u201d Ashley said. \u201cYou go, Grampa!\u201d</p><p>Then she collapsed in Jake\u2019s arms.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t really fathom how a mind can become so unhinged. I mean, seriously, how do you carry hatred through this many generations?\u201d Ashley asked Jake. \u201cHe told me that he heard his ancestor, Henry Hilton, telling him that he had to avenge his family against the Donegal family. His ancestor told him to do it! And I don\u2019t know what to believe because...my own ancestor saved me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were in the backyard, five days after the event in which Ashley had briefly joined her ancestors in death, convalescing in one of the giant swinging hammocks Cliff had just erected in the back. They could look out on the river as the cool breezes soothed them. It was a pleasant place to let the days go by while they were both \u201cin recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very sad truth about humanity is that we\u2019ve always known how to carry hatred through time immortal, so it seems,\u201d Jake said. He gnawed on a piece of grass, just as he had when they were teens. \u201cIn Griffin\u2019s case, I don\u2019t believe that he really had any kind of gift. He would have grown up knowing more about his family\u2019s history than anyone else\u2014we all know the little secrets of our own lives better than others. I think he was crazy, that he did just hear voices in his head. He may well have been schizophrenic. He probably showed all the signs when he was younger. It\u2019s just that he was so functional, no one saw it. He learned all the tricks.\u201d He rolled slightly to look at her. \u201cHis secretary said that she heard him in his office talking the day that Marty and Toby were killed. She did, too. When the police went into his office, they found out that he had a recording to play that went on for various lengths of time. That way, people would always swear that he\u2019d been in his office because they\u2019d heard him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a CEO of a major company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHighly functioning. Ashley, the past didn\u2019t make him bad. The past made him self-righteous. He did believe that he was like a god, or an avenging angel, to take what he wanted because of the perceived ill that had been done to him.\u201d Jake smoothed back a piece of her hair.</p><p>\u201cI walloped Cliff,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s forgiven you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014I really love him. He\u2019s family. How could I have been so easily fooled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear\u2014for someone else you love. That\u2019s a pretty strong motive, Ashley. Honestly, I\u2019m getting to know Cliff really well again, and he has forgiven you.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cSo has Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth didn\u2019t need to forgive you. She knew that what happened wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened if she hadn\u2019t been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s life. The good with the bad,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cAnd, hey! You know, of course, that the cops found Ramsay. He wasn\u2019t doing anything evil\u2014he was just trying to find courage in a bottle down on Bourbon Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Ramsay. He might have been the victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have been. But, sadly, what happened worked well into Griffin\u2019s hands. Ramsay he\u2019d have had to have coaxed. He knew that Charles would be lured by the promise of a beautiful woman. Ram say\u2014well, until he went through this period of trauma\u2014Ramsay was a good-looking fellow. I\u2019m glad you turned him down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe feeling just wasn\u2019t there,\u201d she said. She shuddered. \u201cI turned Griffin down once, years ago. He\u2019d asked me to be his escort to some kind of advertisers\u2019 function.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you turned them both down,\u201d he said, his tone husky. He pulled her closer and faced her. \u201cBeth is well, and Cliff is well, and I\u2019m the one in the worst shape\u2014feel sorry for me!\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She laughed. He didn\u2019t mean it. He was full of bruises and cuts, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind them.</p><p>Nor did he seem to mind that others were handling the press, the paperwork and all other pieces of business that had to do with the case being over. He didn\u2019t seem to hurt too badly when they were alone at night making love, and he didn\u2019t wince at all when she kissed his bruises.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thoughtful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe still have one more piece of business,\u201d he told her. He rolled off the hammock, drawing her with him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cemetery,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>She pulled back at that, but just for a minute.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to... Oh! I see!\u201d</p><p>They followed the path to the Donegal tomb, but they didn\u2019t stand in front of it. Jake led Ashley to the tomb of the long-dead World War I hero, and he and Ashley sat.</p><p>\u201cEmma, your husband loves you,\u201d he said. \u201cHe loves you desperately. He loved Harold as well, and he\u2019s grateful that Harold was there to rescue you. He knows that you held your love for him in your heart all of your life, and he knows that you were treated cruelly. He just wants to love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d he told Ashley.</p><p>\u201cMarshall Donegal, you get your little ethereal backside out here! You\u2019re afraid to face your wife. You\u2019re afraid that she grew beyond her love for you, because life became so hard once you were gone. Come on, you two kids\u2014I think this is it. Your chance at...your chance at eternal happiness,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>At first, nothing.</p><p>And then slowly, very slowly, and like pale illusions in the bright daylight, they both began to appear. She walked slowly from the path; he emerged from the side of the tomb.</p><p>She eased out to him.</p><p>He took a step.</p><p>They ran into one another\u2019s arms.</p><p>In the daylight, so locked together, they faded into the sunlight.</p><p>There were tears on Ashley\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>Jake smoothed them away. \u201cHey, they\u2019ve found their eternal happiness,\u201d he told her, lifting her chin and dusting her lips with a gentle kiss.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve found mine,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Yet, as the kiss grew passionate, it was suddenly disrupted.</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d Jackson called from the house. The tone of his voice was urgent.</p><p>Jake sighed. \u201cWell, that\u2019s my world now, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t release him; she held him close for another minute.</p><p>\u201cJake, your world is now my world, in so many ways.\u201d</p><p>They kissed again.</p><p>Jackson shouted again.</p><p>But...</p><p>Jackson was a decent fellow. He\u2019d just have to wait. </p> </body></html>"]
