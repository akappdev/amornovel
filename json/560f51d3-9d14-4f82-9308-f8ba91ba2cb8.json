The frequent spring rainstorms meant that the beautiful wildflowers\u2014the best in the country\u2014were on their way. Hank Cooper sat out on the deck of Ben &amp; Cooper\u2019s Bar in his white T-shirt and jeans, his feet propped up on the deck rail. Hamlet, Sarah\u2019s harlequin Great Dane, sat beside him, watching the sea, his ears perking up when a person, a boat or bird caught his eye. Cooper was enjoying a heavily creamed coffee and watching his lovely Sarah Dupre paddleboarding out on the bay. She wore the wet suit\u2014short sleeves, knee-length\u2014he\u2019d given her for Christmas. It kept her warm even though the water hadn\u2019t warmed up yet; it was icy cold. The Pacific was always cold, except maybe down San Diego way. But Sarah was an expert; she rarely got her feet wet.</p><p>The way that wet suit hugged her body\u2014it was like art. She had incredibly strong legs, a perfect round tush, breasts about the size of his palms. She\u2019d been born in a coastal town and was probably as comfortable on the water as she was on the land or in the sky\u2014diver, swimmer, surfer, helicopter pilot.</p><p>Cooper and Ham had been watching Sarah for an hour; she\u2019d gone all the way out to the mouth of the bay and back. She was finally coming in, just ahead of the fishing boats headed home to the marina.</p> <p>This life was the furthest thing from what Cooper had ever envisioned for himself. He had come to Thunder Point last October to look into the death of a good friend, Ben Bailey. To his surprise he had inherited what was Ben\u2019s falling-down bait shop and bar. For lack of a better idea he renovated the place, turning it into a first-class beach bar, and had found himself a new home. He also found a woman in Thunder Point, another surprise he hadn\u2019t been looking for. After all the women in his life, short- or long-term, Sarah was everything he\u2019d been waiting for.</p><p>He had officially opened the beach bar\u2014minus the bait\u2014in late February. Now, as the proprietor, there was plenty of time to visit with folks from town, let the gentle lapping of the bay soothe him, watch his woman on her board, gently gliding across the calm water between the huge offshore boulders in the bay. Cooper had a farmer\u2019s tan, stronger shoulders from lifting and hauling bar supplies and a lot of new friends when he\u2019d always considered himself a solitary kind of guy.</p><p>Sarah leaned her board and paddle against the dock and came up the stairs. When she reached the deck, Cooper tossed her a towel and she dried off her feet, glad of the warm sunshine.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been up to?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing. Just watching my mermaid.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cDid Hamlet behave himself?\u201d Hearing his name, the huge dog got up and walked over to Sarah.</p><p>Cooper nodded. \u201cHe said he\u2019d prefer to live here, with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he now?\u201d she asked with a laugh, giving Ham a gentle pat. \u201cGet your own dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t room for another dog around here. Come here,\u201d Cooper said, pulling her onto his lap.</p><p>She went to him, sat down, picked up his coffee and helped herself to a sip.</p><p>\u201cWant me to make you a hot cup?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou cold?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s nice out there. Breeze gets a little chilly sometimes, but the sun is so wonderful. You start to crave sun around here after all the winter rains and winds.\u201d</p><p>Her cell phone rang. She\u2019d left it on the deck with Cooper when she took her board out. She picked it up and looked at the caller ID then said, \u201cYes, little brother?\u201d She listened intently and then laughed. \u201cI\u2019m at Cooper\u2019s. I just took my board out\u2014the bay is beautiful. I have the Razor and the dog. Then yes, have fun and I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>She clicked off.</p><p>\u201cHow many times a day do you talk to Landon?\u201d Cooper asked. Sarah and sixteen-year-old Landon were a family of two and they kept pretty tight tabs on each other. And with Sarah being a Coast Guard search-and-rescue pilot who worked out of the North Bend station, sometimes it wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>\u201cAs many as it takes. Now that he\u2019s dating Deputy Yummy Pants\u2019s daughter, I don\u2019t worry so much. Well, I worry that Mac might shoot him if he gets too frisky with Eve, but I figure that\u2019s a long shot, forgive the pun. I think we check in three or four times a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cDid I interpret that last call to mean you\u2019re now free for dinner?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cIs the chef preparing something special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be busy here tonight, at least after seven\u2014it\u2019s a weeknight and by then the sunset will be over. I have some steaks in the freezer, potatoes in the cooler....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have anything green?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s bar menu was based on deli items purchased from Carrie\u2019s deli in town\u2014simple things from pizzas to sandwiches as well as some desserts, things that could be served cold or warmed. His place was not a restaurant per se. Cooper bought himself a grill for his own use, but it was never used to prepare food for the patrons.</p><p>Cooper had also inherited a helper, Rawley Goode, a Vietnam vet who was not overly comfortable dealing with the public. While he was a good cook, he was needed for other things\u2014maintenance, cleaning, running errands to the big box stores like Costco. Cooper had to admit that between Rawley and himself personal groceries were often in short supply.</p><p>\u201cI bet you have something green,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cI live on green things,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you eat like a fourteen-year-old boy. You\u2019d live on steak, hamburgers and home fries if it weren\u2019t for me. If I go home to shower and change and bring a salad or a vegetable back with me, will you clean your plate?\u201d</p><p>He loved her. He was frequently shaken by the intensity of his passion for her. He\u2019d clean his plate and then he\u2019d tune her up for good measure. He knew his eyes glowed and knew she interpreted him correctly. When the closed sign was on the front door and the doors were locked, they\u2019d eat steak in front of the fire and then retire to the playpen, his large bed upstairs. \u201cTake my truck and leave the Razor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You can take my truck and your dog home later. Much later. Then I\u2019ll drive your Razor across the beach and trade vehicles tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>That night Sarah was home in bed before eleven. Not only did she have an early start the next day, but she also wanted to be home because of her brother, Landon. Landon wouldn\u2019t be either shocked or disapproving about the fact she and Cooper were sleeping together\u2014in fact, he had met Cooper first and they were pals. If Sarah wasn\u2019t mistaken, Landon would consider it a personal favor if Sarah and Cooper somehow made a lasting commitment. That might be a possibility in the future but there were complications, not the least of which was Sarah\u2019s recent brief, disastrous marriage. She was understandably gun-shy and she had Landon to think about. He was just finishing up his junior year in high school and was headed for a fantastic senior year\u2014his athletic prowess and academic performance would undoubtedly land him a scholarship. And they needed that scholarship. Sarah did all right financially but sending someone to college for four years would be a big challenge.</p><p>The next morning Sarah was finished in the bathroom and on her way out the door before Landon had even stirred for school. She left him a note and twenty dollars for gas or lunch or incidentals. She headed off to work feeling fit and fresh after her day off on the bay yesterday. A nice dinner with Cooper, followed by a couple of hours of recreation under the sheets\u2014something Cooper had a particular talent for\u2014helped make her feel brand-new and full of energy.</p><p>The Coast Guard station was getting ready for a big inspection in the next couple of weeks and there was plenty to do, from preparing for check rides to auditing maintenance records. They\u2019d have to show the command they were one of the best air stations in the Coast Guard, and they\u2019d have to get ready for this inspection while continuing to perform business as usual. Given that Sarah\u2014Lieutenant Commander Dupre\u2014was second in command of the flying operation at the station, her role in this prep would not be small. It was no surprise that when she turned on her computer she found a note from her immediate boss, Buzz Bachman, asking her to come to his office ASAP. She was sure, if she knew the man at all, he had a long list of things for her to do.</p><p>She made herself a cup of coffee on the way, stirring in some cream and sweetener. \u201cMorning, boss,\u201d she said, entering his small office.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Dupre. Shut the door, okay?\u201d</p><p>She turned to close the door and thought, Uh-oh, someone\u2019s in trouble. The commander\u2019s door was seldom closed and when it was someone would generally say, \u201cThe spanking light has been lit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a busy week and an inspection team en route the end of the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready,\u201d she said, sipping her coffee.</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you something I\u2019m not supposed to know,\u201d Buzz said. \u201cHow\u2019s your poker face?\u201d</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhen has my poker face ever let you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis could be tough. It affects you directly.\u201d</p><p>The eyebrow dropped. \u201cMake it fast,\u201d she said. \u201cRip that Band-Aid off.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cI have a mole in HR,\u201d Buzz said. \u201cI\u2019ve been cultivating him for a long time. I want as much warning as possible for my next change of assignment. What I didn\u2019t expect was to learn that one of my \u2018men\u2019 was being looked at for a reassignment. An early reassignment because of compelling need. This means you, Dupre.\u201d</p><p>Sarah was stunned into silence. Her mouth hung open slightly. She forcibly closed her mouth. \u201cI get an automatic refusal if they don\u2019t know I\u2019m a woman. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish. I shouldn\u2019t say anything. It could all go in another direction. Between now and notification, someone could put in for those air stations and this could all go away. But I wanted you to have as much time to think about this as possible\u2014we have two retiring commanders and a compelling need with no outstanding applications for those locations and they\u2019re both...\u201d He paused to cough lightly. \u201cThey\u2019re both on the east coast. Maine and south Florida. As you might surmise, you\u2019re probably going to be awarded a promotion to commander within the year. I suspect this makes you a better than prime candidate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not due for either,\u201d she said, sliding forward on her chair a little bit.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no surprise here, Dupre. You\u2019re good at your job. You\u2019ve had a successful Coast Guard career. You\u2019d make an excellent boss. You\u2019re an excellent leader now.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him earnestly, humbly. \u201cI need another year here. Landon...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know your situation and I sympathize. That\u2019s why I\u2019m breaking protocol and leaking this. So help me, you let on and we\u2019ll have a real issue....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap, there\u2019s gotta be some wiggle room in here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just gave it to you. I think you\u2019ll be notified by June and then you will have a couple of months to make the move.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis plays hell on my family...Landon is prime scholarship material, but not if I move him. That\u2019s saying nothing of the trauma of moving a kid right before his senior year in high school, moving him away from his football team, his friends, his school, his town. He\u2019s done so well here, you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have every idea,\u201d Buzz said. \u201cI know exactly how you feel\u2014I\u2019ve gone through two divorces, proof of how the pressures weigh down the family. At least you\u2019re not married.\u201d</p><p>But there\u2019s someone I can\u2019t bear the thought of leaving, she thought. \u201cDamn it, I love my job. But I don\u2019t love this part of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cAnd the Coast Guard loves you, Dupre. I thought you deserved time to think of your options. Aren\u2019t you from Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong ago and far away. I grew up in Boca, practically on the water, but I\u2019ve been north for most of my Coast Guard career. And there\u2019s no family left in Florida\u2014it\u2019s just me and Landon. And I only have one more year with him before he goes off to college, and starts a new phase of his life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always have that option we\u2019re not talking about, even if you can\u2019t retire yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResign my commission? I have no idea what I\u2019d do outside of the Coast Guard,\u201d she muttered, looking into her coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know that feeling, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked up and made eye contact with him. She gave a half smile\u2014small wonder he\u2019d been married twice, he was a good-looking man. Blond, expressive brown eyebrows, strong, smart and a set of choppers that would put Donny Osmond to shame. All this had earned him the nickname Buzz Lightyear. \u201cWhy do you have a mole in HR?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI can retire,\u201d he said. \u201cI want plenty of notice on the next assignment, which should be coming down the pipeline in about six months. I don\u2019t want a new location or a promotion. I\u2019d like to fly forever, I love helicopters and I love the C-130 even more. Being a captain means more desk time than flying time and I have kids in California and Alaska. I\u2019m moving on, Dupre. In probably a year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on that. But I\u2019ve been down this road and I have done twenty years of service. My decision is made. You\u2019re the one who has decisions to make. Maybe there\u2019s some family friends around who can keep Landon in this school for one more year?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood friends?\u201d</p><p>The only ones who came to mind were Gina and Cooper. Her friend Gina was trying to develop a new life with Mac\u2014aka Deputy Yummy Pants\u2014and she had a small house crowded with her mother and her sixteen-year-old daughter. And Cooper? Oh, as great a pal as he was for Landon, he wasn\u2019t in the market for instant guardianship. She couldn\u2019t ask either of them for a favor this big. \u201cThe Coast Guard has always been inconvenient,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cNot a lot of stability. But the job itself made up for that most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does Landon stay when you sit alert overnight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty much okay on his own, as long as he has his phone and my contact numbers. If I have a temporary assignment out of town, like simulator training or something, there\u2019s this guy I\u2019ve been seeing...local guy, civilian. He doesn\u2019t mind Landon duty for a few days or a week, but trust me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuy?\u201d Buzz said. \u201cGuy? Why don\u2019t I know about this guy?\u201d</p><p>Sarah smiled in spite of herself.</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Buzz asked.</p><p>She gave a shrug. \u201cSix months or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never bring him around. You protecting us from him or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be protecting him from you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well bring him around sometime. Happy hour or something.</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted you to have a heads-up on the assignments,\u201d he said. \u201cWith any luck someone could request a relocation in the next couple of months\u2014maybe just the right person will come along and take these potential east coast assignments off your hands....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of them?\u201d she asked cynically.</p><p>\u201cThere are people who would kill for a chance like you have,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. She could go far in the Coast Guard; Commander was a prestigious rank in a demanding service and she\u2019d earned it. She was only thirty-three. \u201cI could quit, but I can\u2019t retire....\u201d Quit and do what? There was the little matter of paying rent, buying food, making car and insurance payments...tuition. She stood up. \u201cWell, thanks, boss. I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d Buzz said. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>Sarah wasn\u2019t one to panic, unless her career was about to turn everyone she loved upside down once again. She could tell Landon, give him time to adjust to the possibility and come up with his own coping options, but she wouldn\u2019t do that\u2014not yet, anyway. She wasn\u2019t afraid he\u2019d balk and sulk, she was afraid he\u2019d say, \u201cWhatever, Sarah. Just let me know.\u201d He was that kind of kid, that kind of brother. He wasn\u2019t a typical sixteen-year-old boy, probably because of how challenging his life had been. She often worried about how much disappointment he was holding inside to spare her feelings.</p><p>Landon was only five when their parents were killed in an accident and he spent one horrifying year with their mean spinster aunt and then had spent the past ten years as her responsibility. She\u2019d moved him five times, put him through a divorce from a man he\u2019d grown attached to and now, just when he was happiest... No, she couldn\u2019t talk to him yet, not until she had time to think things through.</p><p>She could tell Cooper. He loved her; he was proud of her. But he\u2019d just put all his time and energy into setting up his new local business and she couldn\u2019t put him in the position of choosing between breaking it off with her or leaving behind everything to follow her. She could tell that his new lifestyle not only suited him, but he was also very happy. Relaxed.</p><p>That afternoon she hadn\u2019t even made it home after work before Landon called her cell. \u201cYou going out to Cooper\u2019s tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cI have things to prepare for for our inspection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Eve comes over to do homework tonight, will it bother you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019ll take my paperwork to my bedroom. What are you cooking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He laughed at the joke. \u201cWant me to pick up a pizza? I still have that twenty you left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sloppy joes. Save the pizza money\u2014I sit alert tomorrow night and you\u2019re on your own. And before you even ask, no, Eve cannot spend the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said, making her laugh.</p><p>She made the same excuse to Cooper, though he didn\u2019t buy it as quickly. \u201cCan\u2019t you do your paperwork tomorrow night while you sit alert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have enough work for both nights. We\u2019re gearing up for a big inspection. I\u2019ll see you in a couple of days. I mean, we\u2019ll talk, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>But I have to work on my poker face.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I have the day off after my twenty-four at the station and I\u2019ll come out to your place. If the sun\u2019s shining, maybe I\u2019ll take out my board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love to watch you on the water,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ocean is more beautiful when you\u2019re out there.\u201d</p><p>Sarah hadn\u2019t seen Cooper in a couple of days and she could\u2019ve taken the Razor\u2014the all-terrain vehicle\u2014across the beach with Hamlet, but they both needed some exercise. She\u2019d just had two long nights and now she was stiff and groggy and Hamlet was restless.</p><p>Rather than getting right to their walk across the beach to Cooper\u2019s, Sarah stopped at the diner to say hello to Gina. Hamlet enjoyed that part of his walk almost as much as being on the beach. He didn\u2019t mind being hitched to the lamppost with a bowl of water and treated to pats and pets from every passerby.</p><p>Mac McCain was sitting at the counter in the diner. Gina was on the other side and they were holding hands across the counter. Sarah realized she\u2019d been so self-involved she hadn\u2019t even remembered that almost every midmorning around this time the diner was usually empty and Mac took his coffee break with Gina. They were so focused on each other, Sarah was impressed that they looked up and smiled at her. \u201cHey,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself. I hear you\u2019ve been putting in a lot of hours,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cA lot of hours, but I\u2019m off today.\u201d</p><p>Gina and Mac might be the cutest couple in Thunder Point. They\u2019d been best friends for years. Both single parents, their sixteen-year-old daughters were also best friends. Just a couple of months ago, they came out as a couple. A real couple, not just a couple of good friends, and ever since that had happened, they\u2019d been staring soulfully into each other\u2019s eyes when they weren\u2019t stealing the occasional kiss. For a brief moment Sarah turned cynical and almost said, \u201cLook out\u2014when you think you\u2019re staring happily ever after in the face is when the fates get jealous and pounce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn your way to Cooper\u2019s?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. I think I\u2019m going to take my board out for a while. There\u2019s sun today and I could use some exercise.\u201d And alone time, think time. Not that she hadn\u2019t had enough of that over the past day or two. \u201cAnd Cooper always needs quality time with Ham.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIf we ever break up, I\u2019ll have to share custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never break up,\u201d Gina said. \u201cYou\u2019re down for the count.\u201d</p><p>No, she thought. Just down...</p><p>Two</p><p>Mac and Gina might be enjoying new love, but that didn\u2019t keep them from spending plenty of time talking about their families. While Gina only had one child, sixteen-year-old Ashley, Mac had three kids. His oldest, Eve, also sixteen, his son, Ryan, was twelve and another daughter, Dee Dee, was ten. Recently, their sixteen-year-old daughters seemed to take up most of their conversations about kids\u2014Eve was a little too in love with Landon, sometimes worrying Mac, and while Ash had had a steady boyfriend for the past year, she had seemed a little out of sorts lately. Ashley was sulky and down in the dumps.</p><p>\u201cThings haven\u2019t been what you\u2019d call hearts and flowers between Ashley and Downy lately,\u201d Gina said, wiping down the counter. \u201cAll Ashley will say about it is that Downy seems to be too busy to take her calls or return them, something that hasn\u2019t happened before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got nothing but hearts and flowers between Eve and Landon,\u201d Mac said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t help me sleep at night, either.\u201d</p><p>Since teenage girls can fluctuate between true love and moodiness with regularity, Gina didn\u2019t worry overmuch about Ashley\u2019s sulk.</p><p>After work, Gina walked home to find a message from the high school on her answering machine. The school had resorted to leaving recorded messages that informed parents if their child had been absent. Ashley had missed her last two classes. Since she\u2019d borrowed Gina\u2019s Jeep for cheerleading practice after school, Gina wondered what was going on. She immediately called her daughter, but Ashley didn\u2019t answer her cell phone. Gina then called Eve, who answered right away. \u201cShe skipped practice,\u201d Eve said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why\u2014she didn\u2019t say anything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where she could be? She\u2019s not answering her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Eve said. \u201cIf she calls or shows up, I\u2019ll be sure she calls you.\u201d</p><p>Gina\u2019s mom, Carrie, had just returned home herself, and hearing Gina\u2019s story she said, \u201cYou know how these girls can get distracted. You left her a message, right?\u201d</p><p>Of course she had. And Gina was not typically a worrier, but Ashley had been in a real funk for the past week, complaining that Downy was acting weird, as if he couldn\u2019t be bothered with her. After a year-long, intense romance, one in which the phone calls and texting seemed annoyingly constant, even Gina wondered what was up. But Downy was a college freshman now and baseball was in full swing. He was attending Oregon State on an athletic scholarship; he was a baseball star. Maybe he just had a lot going on.</p><p>A couple of hours later, just as the sun was going down, Gina called Downy\u2019s cell phone. He didn\u2019t answer, either, and she left yet another message. \u201cDowny, it\u2019s Gina. I don\u2019t know where Ashley is and I\u2019m really worried. Have you heard from her? Call me please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>A half hour later Carrie said, \u201cYou\u2019re pacing, Gina. Call Mac. Maybe he\u2019ll have some advice.\u201d</p><p>Gina sat at the kitchen table and punched in his numbers. \u201cMac, I have a problem. As far as I know, no one has seen or heard from Ashley since about one o\u2019clock this afternoon. She skipped her last two classes, didn\u2019t go to cheer practice, isn\u2019t taking or returning calls. Eve hasn\u2019t seen or heard from her and Downy isn\u2019t picking up.\u201d She felt her voice go all warbly. \u201cI\u2019m worried. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019d go look for her, but I don\u2019t know where to look. Could Downy be playing ball? Maybe that\u2019s why he isn\u2019t picking up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStand by, let me check,\u201d Mac said. A moment later he said, \u201cNo game today. The next game is in three days and it\u2019s a home game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, where could she be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave another message for Downy. Maybe call some of her other girlfriends?\u201d Mac suggested.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see what I can find out.\u201d Gina disconnected and placed another call to Downy. This time she used her mother voice. \u201cCrawford Downy, I can\u2019t find my daughter. If I don\u2019t hear from you in five minutes, I\u2019m going to call the police.\u201d Then she clicked off.</p><p>\u201cYou did call the police,\u201d her mother said, placing a glass of wine in front of Gina. \u201cCalm down. What are you so afraid of?\u201d</p> <p>She looked at Carrie imploringly. \u201cThat she\u2019s in some kind of trouble. That she\u2019s missing. That she ran off with Downy or something...I don\u2019t know. This really isn\u2019t like...\u201d Her phone twittered. \u201cDowny,\u201d she said to her mother. She picked up the call immediately. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ashley!\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Gina,\u201d Downy said smoothly. He\u2019d grown up in Thunder Point, just like Ashley had. He\u2019d known Gina and her mother since he was a little kid. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way home. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn her way home from where?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe came here, to State, to Corvallis.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cShe wanted to talk about our...ah...situation. I was going to talk to her in person after our weekend game\u2014I was coming home mostly to talk to Ash. But she couldn\u2019t wait and drove up here.\u201d</p><p>Gina sank weakly onto a kitchen chair.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be home in a couple of hours or less,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cShe drove all the way to Corvallis to ask you why you don\u2019t pick up or return her calls and you say she\u2019s fine? Downy, what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you just ask Ash about that, okay? Because it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my daughter pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She felt rather than saw her mother sit straighter, even more alert. Gina had been an unmarried teenage mother.</p><p>\u201cNo! God, no!\u201d Downy nearly yelled into the phone. \u201cListen, really, if you\u2019d just talk to Ashley about this when she gets home...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me right this second, Crawford Downy! My daughter has been upset about your relationship and she lied to me to take my car, drove three hours to Corvallis to talk to you and she\u2019s just now on her way home? Tell me right now or I\u2019ll call your mother!\u201d</p><p>The young man took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you this, Gina. It\u2019s really between us, but...I felt like we might be getting too serious. I thought we should take a breather, maybe date around a little, you know.\u201d</p><p>Gina felt her stomach tie itself in a tight knot. Oh, God, her poor girl. No one could know better than Gina how something like that felt.</p> <p>\u201cLet me guess, there\u2019s someone at State you\u2019ve started dating a little?\u201d she asked acidly.</p><p>\u201cCome on, hey. I\u2019m all the way up here, only see Ash a couple of weekends a month at the most. It got kind of old, sitting around my room alone twenty-six days of the month. She should be getting out more, too. It\u2019s not that big a deal. We just need to lighten up a little, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell her this before she drove all the way to Corvallis to find out what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to say it over the phone! I wanted to be decent about it!\u201d</p><p>And he hung up on her.</p><p>It was just as well. She was going to have to kill him, anyway. Downy was eighteen. His behavior was hardly odd for a boy his age. Still...</p><p>Gina looked at her mother. \u201cI would not have let her drive all the way to Corvallis alone. Driving home alone. At night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But she\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cShe\u2019s a bright girl. There\u2019s no rain tonight. She knows the way as well as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope she\u2019s okay,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>There was a knock at the door. \u201cMac!\u201d</p><p>Carrie got up from the table and let him in. \u201cHey, Mac,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Carrie. What do we know?\u201d</p><p>Carrie just inclined her head toward Gina.</p><p>\u201cShe drove to Corvallis to talk to Downy, who, I gather, dumped her and sent her back home.\u201d</p><p>Mac lowered his gaze and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be home in a couple of hours,\u201d Gina said. \u201cBut what if she\u2019s so upset she\u2019s not safe and something happens?\u201d</p><p>Mac walked into the kitchen, slipped a strong arm around Gina\u2019s waist and pulled her against him just briefly. He put a finger under her chin and looked into her eyes. \u201cNever a good idea to drive when upset, but try to be realistic\u2014if teenagers who just had a breakup had accidents, the accident rate would be too shocking to imagine. The road is good, the weather is good, she\u2019ll get here. And she\u2019ll need some comforting, I imagine.\u201d He lifted one of her hands, which was trembling. \u201cI think the wine is a good idea. Just calm down and be ready to be wise and understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I have to go get her or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. Or Carrie will. Gina, honey, stuff like this happens. It\u2019s not deadly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure feels that way,\u201d she said in a small voice.</p><p>Gina and her mom sat at the kitchen table together talking quietly, waiting for Ashley to arrive, while Gina sipped on a glass of wine. They were two women who knew how deeply a girl of sixteen would feel the trauma of a breakup. Leaving the two of them to talk, Mac stepped away, into the living room, where he used his phone.</p><p>When Ashley started dating Downy, Gina was brutally honest with her about the possible consequences of too much love too fast. She tried to discourage the dating, but there was little she could do\u2014they saw each other at school every day and it was a match made in heaven. Gina had worried about what would happen when Downy moved on to college, leaving Ashley\u2014who was two years younger\u2014behind. But they had managed to make it work. Downy was back in Thunder Point most weekends, especially during football season and for holidays, and they talked and texted every day, many times a day.</p><p>And then, in the peak of spring, with love all around, suddenly and without warning, Ashley said, \u201cSomething is wrong. Downy sends me right to voice mail and he doesn\u2019t call me back. Mom, something is wrong.\u201d</p><p>Gina had said, \u201cHe\u2019s probably overwhelmed. He\u2019s got baseball and, academically, he sometimes struggles. Try to be patient.\u201d Downy was a jock, but not a strong student, which presented problems for some college athletes.</p><p>\u201cIt never happened like this before,\u201d Ashley wailed. \u201cHe\u2019s said about ten words to me in a week. He\u2019s busy, he says. He\u2019s studying, he says. He doesn\u2019t call me back because he doesn\u2019t have time. He doesn\u2019t answer my texts. He always texted more than me\u2014right during class. I think he might be with someone new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! He said no! But he\u2019s lying. I can tell he\u2019s lying. And he\u2019s never lied to me before!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh, he\u2019s only eighteen. You\u2019re only sixteen. Let\u2019s try not to go crazy here. Maybe this is a little adjustment of some\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he loved me! What am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>The poor darling, Gina thought. Shattered and helpless. She took another sip of wine. Glancing at her glass she said to her mom, \u201cGood suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always more dramatic when it\u2019s your daughter. It cuts deeper,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to ever hurt.\u201d Gina whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d</p><p>Gina hadn\u2019t taken Ashley\u2019s pout over Downy too seriously. After all, he was the scholarship kid with the atomic arm, gone to State to play ball and it was spring\u2014baseball was the game of the day and Downy, a freshman, was starting pitcher. He was busy with practices and games, maybe too busy now to text and call Ashley all day. But Gina\u2019s attention was definitely snagged by Ashley\u2019s flight to Corvallis and Downy\u2019s explanation that, stated simply, he was done with her. There was not a woman on the planet who didn\u2019t know how much getting dumped could hurt. And as for mothers? It hurt more when your little girl suffered than when you suffered yourself.</p><p>Mac came into the kitchen, poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down with Gina and Carrie. \u201cI called my aunt Lou and told her what was going on and that I\u2019d be staying with you until we knew a little more. Lou will manage the family while I\u2019m here. And I talked to Eve. She knew Ashley was all sideways about Downy and she was worried about her, but she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d driven to Corvallis. I find that strange\u2014they usually know everything the other is doing. Eve thought Ashley just skipped out on practice. So I\u2019ll stay with you until she\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get home to your own family, Mac,\u201d Gina said, but inside she thought if he left her now, she\u2019d collapse. \u201cIt\u2019s just a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as just a broken heart,\u201d he said.</p><p>And he should know, Gina thought. His young wife left him with three little kids when he was twenty-six years old and even though Gina hadn\u2019t known him then, she knew him now and knew he hadn\u2019t been with a woman in the ten years since. Until Gina. They were two single parents who had waited a long time to find each other.</p><p>Mac muttered something about how, given a choice, he would never want to go back to those youthful days\u2014those young years are so serious and painful. Gina said even more painful was when your kids hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget when Ash wasn\u2019t invited to the very first boy-girl party ever because the mother of the little girl throwing the party didn\u2019t approve of me, a never-married single mother. Ash didn\u2019t understand that, but she was devastated by being excluded and I had at least six months of guilt and pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Eve was six,\u201d Mac said, \u201cafter Cee Jay left us, she didn\u2019t want to go to school. She was afraid her mother might come home during the day and Eve didn\u2019t want to miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a young mother,\u201d Gina said, \u201cthere were very few other young mothers with small children who were friendly toward me. Certainly none who were sixteen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall towns are brutal,\u201d Mac said. \u201cThe best thing about Thunder Point was leaving Coquille, where I made all my mistakes. Of course, they followed me\u2014my kids were soon known as the kids of the deputy and the woman who abandoned them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any way to keep them from paying for our mistakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019ll eventually make enough of their own to take the heat off. Meanwhile, we just have to stay strong and know we are doing the best we can.\u201d</p><p>Carrie got up from the table and started rummaging around in the refrigerator. Being the owner of a deli and catering service, she always had special meals on hand. She did a little slicing and scooping, microwaved a couple of plates\u2014tri-tip, red potatoes, Broccolini spears, a little dark au jus. She made a large helping for Mac, smaller ones for Gina and herself and the three of them ate, though not with big appetites. Everyone at the small kitchen table had personal experience with this kind of heartache. Then Carrie cleaned up and put a pan of her healing chicken soup on the stove. \u201cShe might not want anything to eat, but if she does at least it\u2019ll be something soothing,\u201d Carrie said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>It was eight-thirty when they heard the car. Everyone stood expectantly, fearful of what they would see walking in the door. And then Ashley came into the kitchen through the back door.</p><p>She was messy; there was evidence of crying in her puffy eyes and pink cheeks. Her beautiful red hair was flat and slack and her clothes wrinkled, but otherwise she looked normal. Except for the expression on her face, which was one of pure agony.</p> <p>\u201cI had to do it, I had to go to State,\u201d she said. \u201cI sent him two hundred texts and voice mails that he ignored, so I went to face him. I\u2019m sorry I lied and took your Jeep. I promise, I\u2019ll never do it again.\u201d</p><p>Carrie took a step toward her. \u201cI made you some soup, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gram, but I don\u2019t want any....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going. Now that you\u2019re home safe,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go, Mac,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need to talk, Ashley,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say,\u201d she said, walking through the house toward her room, her head down, dragging her backpack behind her.</p><p>\u201cAshley,\u201d Gina said, following her. \u201cAsh, I really want to talk to you. Please.\u201d</p><p>She turned sharply to face Gina. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me anymore,\u201d she said coldly, tears gathering in her eyes. \u201cI gave him everything he wanted and now he\u2019s done with me. The guy I saw today? I don\u2019t even know that guy. That was not my Downy.\u201d Then she went into her room and closed the door.</p><p>Gina turned back to face Mac and her mother. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she said. And then the only thing she could think of. \u201cThank God there were no cell phones when my heart was being ripped out.\u201d</p><p>Ashley laid down on her bed in her clothes. In fact, she laid there for a while before sitting up and throwing off her jacket.</p> <p>She was probably about six years old when she first noticed Crawford Downy Junior. Everyone had always called him Downy; only his mother called him Crawford. Ashley went to school with his younger brother Frank. There was a third brother two years younger than Frank\u2014Lee.</p><p>That was back when Ashley\u2019s mother or grandmother wrestled her naturally curly red hair into braids in the morning. Downy called her twerp or carrot top or pesky pants. She alternately crushed on him or thought he was a giant turd. She liked him when he said things like, \u201cGood catch, CT,\u201d instead of carrot top. She hated him when he said, \u201cStand back, she\u2019s going to let down her hair!\u201d and put out his arms as if her curly mane would be bigger than the Goodyear Blimp. Right up to junior high she had those ridiculous red ringlets and thick glasses. Frank had thick glasses, too, so Downy never teased her about the glasses. Then when she\u2019d barely figured out how to control her wild hair, she had braces. \u201cWhen you getting the tin out of your mouth, CT?\u201d he\u2019d ask her.</p><p>Ashley and Eve McCain met in seventh grade and spent the next two years studying teen magazines for trending clothes, makeup and hairstyles. Eve was always naturally beautiful with thick dark hair, bright blue eyes, but she also had braces. It was one of the first things that had bonded them. That and the fact that they had single parents and neither had much money to spend on clothes\u2014so they improvised and shared.</p><p>Sometime in ninth grade, Ashley made peace with her hair. She discovered the magic of detangler, the circular brush, a blow dryer. Her thick crazy hair became soft waves. Some of the orange of her youth was replaced by a darker, copper-red. The braces came off, she got contacts and she made the junior varsity cheerleading squad. And one day in the spring of her sophomore year, when she was wearing her short, pleated cheerleader skirt, Downy said, \u201cHey, Ashley.\u201d He actually used her name!</p><p>And she said, \u201cHey, Downy.\u201d</p><p>He was a senior then and the toast of Thunder Point athletics. He played football, hockey and baseball. Frank was more academic and Lee was still too young to be taken seriously.</p><p>And Downy said to her, \u201cWe should go out sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He laughed and said, \u201cYou know. On a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he repeated. \u201cIs that a yes or a no?\u201d</p><p>She nearly died. But before she died she said yes. But she was fifteen and Gina would only let her go if they double-dated. He took her to a movie in Bandon along with two other couples. But the other couples went in one car and she was alone with Downy so all the way there they talked and laughed. After the movie they went to a pizza place. She was the only sophomore\u2014the rest of them were all seniors. After pizza they went to a pretty secluded outlook facing the ocean and made out. Downy kept trying to get under her shirt and she kept slapping his hand away. At some point he said, \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t be messing with a fifteen-year-old. You\u2019re just too young.\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cFine. We won\u2019t go out again. But don\u2019t think you\u2019re all that and I\u2019m going to just give it up because you\u2019re good at sports and kinda cute.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and said, \u201cYou think I\u2019m cute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that cute,\u201d she said.</p><p>But he walked her to every class, held her hand, leaned into her at her locker to kiss her, asked her repeatedly if she\u2019d be at his game. They talked on the phone every night when they weren\u2019t together, texted all day until Downy had his phone confiscated by a teacher for two weeks. Then, at assembly, his full ride scholarship to State was announced. At the end of summer, he\u2019d be gone to football camp and then to school, three hours away. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll just break up with me now,\u201d she said.</p><p>With a look of serious misery he said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out how to take you with me. I think I love you.\u201d</p><p>So she let him touch her breasts. And said, \u201cI think I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Before summer was very old, Ashley was on the pill. Surprisingly, college had not seemed to be the barrier Ashley had feared. They talked and texted constantly, Downy came home to Thunder Point as often as possible if he didn\u2019t have a football game or practice and since he was a freshman, he wasn\u2019t first string, so he had a little freedom, though he practiced hard all week. \u201cAnd by the time I\u2019m playing a lot, you\u2019ll be at State and we\u2019ll be together,\u201d he told her.</p><p>And then in one week in March, almost exactly a year since they started dating, it all fell apart without warning. The calls dwindled to nothing; the texts weren\u2019t answered. He didn\u2019t come home on the weekend and knowing\u2014knowing\u2014something was terribly wrong, she drove to Corvallis. She went to his frat house. He was sitting on the porch with a girl, his arm around her shoulders, leaning close to her like he was finished kissing her or just about to start.</p><p>\u201cDowny!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cAsh!\u201d he shouted back, backing off the girl like she was on fire.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d the girl with him asked.</p><p>He stumbled and blubbered for a moment before he said, \u201cThe girl I dated back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, take care of the child and call me later,\u201d she said, getting up and walking away. Gliding away, full of confidence, not the least bit intimidated by Ashley.</p><p>To Ashley, the girl looked like a sophisticated runway model, full of poise and beauty and maturity, all the things she didn\u2019t feel she had.</p><p>The next two hours were a blur. He wouldn\u2019t talk to her at his frat house within hearing of his fraternity brothers. They went to Gina\u2019s Jeep, sat in it and Ashley sobbed and fought and yelled while Downy just shrugged and shook his head. He said he worried they\u2019d been getting too serious, needed a little space, a little freedom, a little dating experience. \u201cHave you slept with her?\u201d Ashley demanded. \u201cAre you doing her, Downy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different in college, Ash. People don\u2019t make such a big deal about sex in college.\u201d</p><p>So of course he had.</p><p>He finally insisted she go home. She wasn\u2019t done with him but he was clearly done with her. \u201cI care about you, Ash,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to cool things down a little right now. I can\u2019t get home every weekend during baseball\u2014I\u2019m playing every game. It\u2019s not like football where I\u2019m the junior player and mostly warm the bench. I\u2019m starting. In fact, the baseball coach will probably make me quit football\u2014we can\u2019t start the season with injuries. We should use this time to...you know...branch out. Date around, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd summer? What about summer?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou just plan to get back together again in summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m thinking about staying up here. Taking some classes, getting a job...I\u2019ll play ball all summer if we make finals and it\u2019s too far to commute. Then football camp is in August. If I\u2019m still playing football then.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed so hard all the way back to Thunder Point she could hardly breathe. She had to pull over once because her chest started hurting. She knew her mother was going to be furious that she\u2019d taken the Jeep but she didn\u2019t care. There were moments on the drive home that she wondered if life wouldn\u2019t be easier if she just went off the road at one of the high-cliff curves, but something kept her going.</p><p>When she was alone in her room, she called Eve\u2019s cell phone. She could barely tell her story, the sobs came so hard. And Eve was outraged. \u201cWant me to call him, Ash? Give him a piece of my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter\u2014it wouldn\u2019t help. He dumped me for a college girl. And she\u2019s beautiful, Eve. She owns him. You could tell in one second!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s slime. He\u2019s scum. I will never forgive him for this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...what do I do without him?\u201d Ashley had cried.</p><p>After they hung up, Ashley just cried for another hour. There was a light knocking on her door and she knew it was her mother. She didn\u2019t answer or say \u201ccome in.\u201d She laid there, her head on her pillow, leaking tears, gripping her cell phone in case Downy called her to say he\u2019d made a terrible mistake.</p><p>Gina came into the room and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cI brought you some tea,\u201d she said, her hand on Ashley\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Ashley said thickly.</p><p>\u201cAsh, I\u2019m sorry this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I can\u2019t talk about it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little, please? So I can understand where you are right now? Emotionally.\u201d</p><p>Ash rolled onto her back, her wet eyes red and swollen. \u201cHe has another girl. A beautiful, snotty college girl who he\u2019s screwing because he says it\u2019s not that big a deal. And right now I just don\u2019t want to even live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley, please, don\u2019t say that. Don\u2019t ever say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to school tomorrow. Maybe not the next day, either. Maybe never.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Cooper noticed Sarah had been preoccupied over the past couple of days. Quiet and maybe a bit sullen. She said the inspection was going to be hell and while she might not be worried about her team, a strong leader always worried about the inspectors. They had to be ready for anything.</p><p>All Cooper could do was be available, support her in any way he could. He found himself fighting the worry that Sarah had changed her mind, that something had caused her to reconsider those three little words. I love you. Yet when he possessed her, when she was joined to him, her passion for him drove worry from his mind. During those times she was one hundred percent his and he was completely hers.</p><p>In the meantime, he had a business to learn. This beach bar was unlike anything he had ever done before. Ben\u2019s old helper, Rawley Goode, old being the operative word, might be a little on the strange side, but he had turned out to be a damned good assistant. Rawley was somewhere in his sixties and he\u2019d been ridden hard. Rawley told Cooper that Ben used to only be open in the mornings and evenings. Ben had put in his longest days during summer, and he bumped up the schedule with the help of part-time teenage help. Rawley said, \u201cI clean and get supplies. I can work in the kitchen or behind the bar, but I ain\u2019t social. You give me a list and cash. I go to Costco and other stores. But in summer, you have to stay open late. The sunset over the bay is better \u2019n football on HD.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>During his first week of operation Cooper noticed that the bulk of his traffic was between seven and ten in the morning and four and seven in the afternoon. There were stragglers here and there at other times. Those patrons were almost exclusively Thunder Point residents. But on the weekends, particularly in good weather, there was heavy traffic all day and into the evening\u2014bikers, cyclists, pleasure boaters, sport fishermen, folks traveling on Highway 101 in want of a meal. He did an impressive business on bottled water alone, not to mention the other things he was able to offer. When he inherited this place, it had been a run-down shack with a homemade sign on the road that said Cheap Drinks. Now it was upgraded and classy and he was damn proud of it. Cooper put a decent sign on his property at the turnoff from highway 101. Ben &amp; Cooper\u2019s. And beneath that, Food and Drink. He stocked liquor and non-alcoholic beverages and had a contract with Carrie James, owner of the town\u2019s deli, for prepared and wrapped food items. The reopening of the bar benefited both of them.</p><p>A lot of his first patrons from out of town wanted to know what had happened to Ben. Well, it was a sad story and he didn\u2019t like to dwell on it, but the fact was that Ben had been found at the bottom of the cellar stairs and at first it was thought to be an accident. But, since then, there had been evidence to suggest he\u2019d been killed by a blow to the head that caused the fall. The suspect\u2014a seventeen-year-old kid from town\u2014was out on bail awaiting trial. That still blew Cooper\u2019s mind\u2014a seventeen-year-old kid. The kid, Jag Morrison, had been trying to convince Ben to sell the beach and adjacent property to his father, a local developer.</p> <p>Cooper had been just going through the motions\u2014renovating and opening for business. He didn\u2019t think he was a shopkeeper or bar-owner kind of guy. He had been a pilot for fifteen years\u2014helicopters. But the more he got to know the town, the people and the many moods of the Pacific Ocean, the more the place grew on him. After just a short period of time instead of moving on, he was considering making even more improvements to the property. After watching Sarah on the water, he thought renting kayaks and paddleboards would be an excellent idea.</p><p>None of it came naturally, however. Cooper bought himself a new laptop with a decent accounting spreadsheet program and was still figuring it out. Rawley wasn\u2019t able to help him out with this part of the business. It was during his weekday midmorning downtime that he sat at his own bar and was plugging numbers from bills and receipts into his spreadsheet that the door opened and Mac McCain walked in. With relief, he closed the laptop. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cAren\u2019t you usually at the diner about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually,\u201d Mac said. \u201cGina\u2019s daughter stayed home from school. She went home to check on her and I didn\u2019t feel like having coffee with the cook. Stu just isn\u2019t as pretty no matter which way you cut it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed that. How\u2019s everything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d he said. Mac went right behind the bar and helped himself to a cup of coffee. \u201cYou? Business shaping up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, I don\u2019t know. I mean, business is good. There are people in here all the time. But I\u2019m not real clear on the accounting and that sort of thing. Kind of makes me wonder how Ben managed. He was a genius with a wrench but he didn\u2019t seem to take to paperwork and numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone wondered that same thing,\u201d Mac said, sipping his coffee.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tedious, that\u2019s for sure. Say, something\u2019s been weighing on my mind a little bit. Been a long time since I had a girlfriend, you know? You ever wonder what the hell\u2019s going on in Gina\u2019s head?\u201d</p><p>Mac broke into a huge grin. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no? Because Sarah\u2014she\u2019s got a lot on her mind, I know that. But man, she\u2019s on another planet sometimes. Makes me wonder if anything is wrong. But then she\u2019s back and I wonder why I wondered....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoop, you remember how many women I live with, right? There\u2019s Lou, Eve and Dee Dee at home, but then there\u2019s Gina and all her women\u2014her mother and her daughter, who at the moment is a mess over some boyfriend issue. Half the time I don\u2019t have any idea what\u2019s going on in any of their heads!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see me handling anything? I pretty much just duck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a big help....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, man. I just do as I\u2019m told most of the time,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Cooper just stared at him. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you completely bald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder, isn\u2019t it? Lou says there\u2019s something in the male hormone that prevents me from getting it. She\u2019s probably right.\u201d</p> <p>Gina went home during the midmorning slow time at the diner to check on Ashley, as she\u2019d done the two previous days. This was her third day of grieving and Ashley just lay in her bed, clutching her phone. Gina had tried prying it out of her fingers once but her daughter tearfully whimpered, \u201cBut what if he calls me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would probably be best if you just turned the phone off,\u201d Gina said. \u201cIf he calls you, let him find you\u2019re over him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so not over him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t go on, Ash,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to get a grip. You have to get up, get cleaned up, go to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re saying,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I? Ashley, my boyfriend left me pregnant at fifteen. When I told him, he ran far and fast and never looked back! Ashley, I know how this hurts, believe me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over, her red hair everywhere, and tearfully said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind that, you know. At least you still had a part of him to live for. What do I have?\u201d</p><p>Gina wanted to shake her. \u201cYour dignity! He cheated on you\u2014you should kick him to the curb, not suffer in rejection. Get mad! I hope the sorry bastard gets a disease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d she cried, fresh tears spilling all over her face. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, Mama. You love Downy. And my heart hurts....\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t love Downy anymore. How could he take her little girl\u2019s innocence and then dismiss her so cruelly? Describe her as \u201cthe girl I dated back home\u201d like she was history? He should be brutally punished. How could he?</p><p>Because he\u2019s an eighteen-year-old boy, her wiser self said. He did what most eighteen-year-old boys do. And Ash is just a sixteen-year-old girl, doing what comes naturally\u2014grieving her loss. It could just as easily have gone the other way\u2014Ashley could have become bored with her absent boyfriend and found someone new at school, some current popular jock who had time to date, to take her to the dances and games. This could be Downy wallowing in depression because his girlfriend had dumped him.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t it be that way, huh? she asked herself. She didn\u2019t want her daughter to be mean and insensitive, but she also didn\u2019t want this\u2014this sobbing, broken mess who wouldn\u2019t get out of bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to work,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I get home later I want you up. I want you showered, doing your best to get on with life because you can\u2019t fix this, Ashley. I\u2019m not going to let you shrivel up and waste away just because Downy was an unfaithful ass. Do you hear me? Tomorrow you go to school, no excuses.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over and looked at her through wet eyes. \u201cI loved him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI loved him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t make a person love you back,\u201d Gina whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because somehow I made him love me once.\u201d</p><p>Gina smoothed her crazy red hair back off her brow. \u201cI know, baby. Someday you\u2019re going to understand that you dodged a bullet here. You don\u2019t want a boyfriend who can\u2019t be faithful, who can\u2019t keep his promises. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Ashley just shook her head. She rolled over and, gripping her phone, as she had been for days, she gently wept.</p><p>Gina got away from the house. She walked down the hill to the diner before pulling out her own phone. She stared at it for a moment. She sat down on one of the benches outside the diner\u2019s front door and clicked on Marjorie Downy\u2019s number. When the woman answered she said, \u201cMarjorie, hi. It\u2019s Gina James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, Gina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if you know\u2014Downy and Ashley broke up.\u201d</p><p>There was a heavy sigh from Marjorie. \u201cI did hear that. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. I thought that when they were apart for a while, at different schools, it might end up like this. That\u2019s too bad for Ashley, Gina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s devastated. She said Downy has a new girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Marjorie sighed again. \u201cWell, look, Crawford is in a new place now, a different place. Their worlds...you know what I mean. Their worlds are now orbiting different suns. There\u2019s college and there\u2019s high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe promised to take her to her prom,\u201d Gina said because she just couldn\u2019t help it, though she didn\u2019t have any intention of Marjorie helping with that problem.</p><p>\u201cI know. I have to be honest with you, Gina\u2014I never approved of that idea. Crawford should be spending what little money he has for dating on college events, fraternity events, not on high school dances.\u201d</p><p>Gina stiffened. \u201cWell, then, perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have promised,\u201d she said. \u201cPoor Ashley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gina, I do feel sorry for Ashley, I do. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not all right at the moment. She\u2019s shattered. Heartbroken. Downy wasn\u2019t very nice to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing. But I worried about this from the start. Crawford is quite the catch at State\u2014handsome, athletic, fun, smart. I knew it was only a matter of time before some pretty college girl caused him to forget the girl back home. Ashley really shouldn\u2019t have pinned her hopes on him.\u201d</p><p>Gina felt her heart squeeze. \u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said weakly. For a moment she felt as though she should have found a way to prevent this romance, a way to keep Ashley from being hurt.</p><p>\u201cDespite what Crawford and Ashley might\u2019ve thought, I knew this wasn\u2019t a lasting thing. The age difference...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Downy told me you knew they were sexually active. Involved. Committed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found packages of condoms. It broke my heart. I was extremely disappointed by that. In my day young ladies were much more cautious with their bodies, with their virtue.\u201d</p><p>Gina\u2019s eyes grew round and her neck nearly snapped from straightening so fast. She was instantly on her feet. \u201cAnd in your day, were young men also cautious?\u201d</p><p>Marjorie actually laughed. \u201cI wish I could say they were. You\u2019d understand if you were the mother of sons. Boys\u2014a different animal entirely. Which is why it\u2019s important to raise young ladies with strict standards. You know what I mean, Gina.\u201d</p><p>She hoped she wouldn\u2019t break a molar, clenching her teeth so hard. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have no idea what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that invariably it\u2019s up to the girl.\u201d</p><p>Gina was speechless. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more serious!\u201d Marjorie insisted. \u201cMen are men\u2014they\u2019re single-minded and a little crazy. But my boys were raised proper\u2014if the girl says no, the answer is no. They\u2019re not villains, they\u2019re just men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cGina, perhaps Ashley thought there wouldn\u2019t be any consequences for having sexual relations at the tender age of sixteen. And as you can see from your poor darling\u2019s broken heart, having a baby out of wedlock isn\u2019t the only consequence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Gina felt her face burn. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just say that to me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gina, please! I meant no offense, it\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what you teach your sons, Marjorie? That if they can pressure a girl into giving it up, all\u2019s fair? It\u2019s not the boy\u2019s fault or responsibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Oh, God, no!\u201d Then she was quiet for a second before she muttered, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t teach them such a thing. I\u2019m not surprised that they think that way, however. I live in a house full of males. For all I know, my husband could have conveyed the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he did, he should be hung up by his balls!\u201d Gina snapped, disconnecting the call. She sank to the bench once more. She leaned over, elbows on her knees, her head resting in her hands. She couldn\u2019t believe comments like that could still be so painful. And she knew that wasn\u2019t how she was commonly regarded in this town\u2014the unwed mother. She knew she and her mother were both respected citizens here. Ashley, a lovely girl and good student, was thought of highly.</p><p>But there were still a few, like Marjorie, who put it all on the woman. As if a girl gets pregnant all alone.</p><p>For a moment, she felt hot and damp at the same time. Mortified. Humiliated, as if it had been yesterday that she\u2019d said to Carrie, Oh, Mama, I\u2019m pregnant! And I don\u2019t know what to do!</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d a familiar deep male voice said.</p><p>She looked up to see Mac standing in front of her. Looking down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She let out a breath and stood. \u201cI called Marjorie Downy. Stupid thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom her perspective, Ashley held him down and forced herself on him and he is completely blameless in this situation. Kind of a boys-will-be-boys attitude. And she couldn\u2019t convey that without a dig or two at me for bearing a child out of wedlock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she actually say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. In her day girls were held to a higher standard and her boys were raised to understand that if a girl says no, it\u2019s no. And having a child out of wedlock isn\u2019t the only consequence of being sexually involved. In other words\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s as stupid as she is ugly.\u201d</p><p>That almost made Gina smile. \u201cI should never have called her. I knew Marjorie and I weren\u2019t on the same wavelength. I always liked Downy, even before he started dating Ash. I think he\u2019s basically a good kid. I want to think this just went the predictable course\u2014he grew away from her when he went to college and they broke up. And yes, it hurts her terribly, but she\u2019ll have more than one boyfriend before all is said and done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDowny\u2019s not a bad kid. But his mother is as dumb as a box full of hammers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Downy\u2019s all right, even if he did upset my girl. And I bet in a few weeks I\u2019ll stop hoping he gets a disease and his dick falls off.\u201d</p><p>Mac smiled at her. \u201cI need to take you somewhere. Dinner, maybe. Or just out of town for a few hours. Or maybe to some sleazy motel with mirrors on the ceiling\u2014but if you say no, hey, nothing will ever happen....\u201d</p><p>She put a grateful hand on his arm. \u201cI gotta get my girl out of bed first, Mac. She\u2019s a mess. Then I\u2019ll be ready for a dinner out of town and some time alone with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know all you have to do is snap your fingers.\u201d</p><p>Lou McCain had raised her nephew since his parents\u2014her brother and sister-in-law\u2014were killed in an accident. He had been only ten years old at the time and lived with her until he married. And for about the past ten years she had lived with him to help him raise his three children. They had moved to Thunder Point from Coquille four years ago when Mac had been given the Thunder Point substation to manage for the Sheriff\u2019s Department. When they first discussed the possible move, Lou hadn\u2019t been very keen on it\u2014she\u2019d lived in Coquille her whole life. She had a good teaching job and friends there. She suggested he commute to Thunder Point instead of moving there, which is what other deputies tended to do.</p><p>But the move had turned out to be a good idea on many levels. Lou was able to get a teaching job at the middle school right away\u2014eighth grade English. She liked the town and the people. Eve\u2019s instant friendship with Ashley had resulted in Lou\u2019s friendship with Carrie and Gina, two women she\u2019d grown very close to. And of course, there was the simple fact that in a little town like Thunder Point, a place with only a small fishing industry, she and Mac could pool their resources and afford a home large enough for himself, three kids, two dogs and an aunt.</p><p>Lou knew a lot about kids. She was working on raising a second generation of them, for one thing. She was a very intuitive teacher, for another. Mac\u2019s kids, her nieces and nephew, hadn\u2019t presented too many challenges yet. But they were definitely getting there. Eve was pretty serious about Landon Dupre. There hadn\u2019t been too much drama yet, but as Lou knew only too well, that was probably coming\u2014teenage love could be complicated. In fact, Eve\u2019s best friend was going through it right now; Ashley was devastated by her breakup and was acting out in bizarre and frightening ways. Ashley needed an intervention.</p><p>To that end, Lou grabbed ten-year-old Dee Dee and twelve-year-old Ryan after school and took them with her to the diner. This wasn\u2019t exactly rare for Lou\u2014she enjoyed stopping off there for a cup of coffee on the way home from school at least once a week on days the kids didn\u2019t have lessons or practices of some sort.</p><p>Ryan and Dee Dee ran straight to their favorite booth. \u201cCan you get those hellions a couple of colas and an order of fries?\u201d she asked Gina.</p><p>\u201cComing right up,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>Gina went to the kitchen herself to serve up a plate of fries. She made two trips with the sodas and fries and then, back behind the counter, poured coffee for herself and Lou.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d Gina asked.</p><p>\u201cSome days you\u2019re the bug and some days you\u2019re the windshield,\u201d Lou said. \u201cGina, do you know where Ashley is?\u201d</p><p>Gina instantly got a frightened look in her eyes. \u201cSchool?\u201d</p><p>Lou shook her head. \u201cEve, Landon and Ashley cut out of school. Just the last class. Landon drove them to Corvallis to watch a baseball game. Ashley promised to tell you, but I knew she wouldn\u2019t. Listen, the girl could use some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Gina said weakly, looking down. \u201cYou knew they were going? Doing that?\u201d</p><p>Lou nodded. \u201cAshley wanted Landon to take her because she promised you she wouldn\u2019t take your Jeep again, like she did before. Eve insisted on going along, I suspect to keep Ashley from throwing herself at Downy. I think it\u2019s good that Eve went. Landon, God love him, would be like a deer caught in the headlights if Ashley had a meltdown.\u201d</p><p>Gina took a breath. \u201cWhat did Mac say about this excursion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him at dinner. I made a management decision. It\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t gone to Oregon State for a ball game or two\u2014it wasn\u2019t a ridiculous request. Kids from Thunder Point go to State all the time to watch their old classmates play college ball. But I don\u2019t want either of our girls wandering around alone up there. Landon might not be much good in a romantic crisis, but I trust he\u2019d never let anyone give our girls trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cAfter not seeing her for a couple of weeks, she finally came to dinner at our house last night. I suspect she came because she had a special request\u2014a trip to Corvallis. She doesn\u2019t look good, Gina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gina said in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lost weight, I can tell she\u2019s not eating or sleeping,\u201d Lou said. \u201cI\u2019m used to the girls never shutting their mouths at the dinner table, and now... She\u2019s really despondent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you make a person eat and sleep? Or stop crying every night, for that matter? I can hear her and if I go to her room, she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Lou opened her purse and took out a slip of paper. \u201cThis is the name of a counselor. Her practice is in Bandon, so it\u2019s a ride. I\u2019m told she has a sliding scale if your income isn\u2019t high. Or maybe your benefits cover counseling\u2014you\u2019re the one to know. A friend of mine\u2014a teacher\u2014recommended her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a counselor at the high school....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarvey,\u201d Lou said sourly. \u201cHe\u2019s a horse\u2019s ass. Based on some of his comments, he thinks girls are stupid ninnies\u2014a running bone of contention between us. One of my girls from eighth grade English had him as a guidance counselor her junior year and he told her and her parents that she wasn\u2019t college material. She\u2019s one of the smartest girls I\u2019ve taught. I\u2019ve seen him at school board and PTA meetings. I think he has seaweed between his ears. I think Cliff gives better advice at the Cliffhanger\u2019s bar than Garvey does.\u201d</p><p>Gina just kept staring at the slip of paper. \u201cYou think she needs counseling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be a mistake to take a chance. Gina, I know we all want to say it\u2019s just a teen romance, but teenagers feel things so deeply, so intensely. They\u2019re years away from realizing how minor this is in the grand scheme of things, how much more manageable life will be when they\u2019re just a little more mature. They can get very sick, make some very stupid mistakes, do crazy things that can\u2019t be undone. They sometimes have suicidal thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Gina gasped.</p><p>\u201cYes, they do. Sometimes it\u2019s self-image problems, sometimes their home life is totally horrible or they\u2019re relentlessly picked on at school, sometimes it\u2019s depression, which can present in adolescence. And sometimes it\u2019s love gone sour. Sometimes, sweetheart, it\u2019s a desperate, emotional act that can\u2019t be reversed. Take her to this woman,\u201d Lou said, pointing at the paper. \u201cThis Simone Ross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t want to go?\u201d Gina said softly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d Lou said. \u201cTake her.\u201d</p><p>And then Gina\u2019s eyes misted over. \u201cI think this has been as hard on me as it\u2019s been on her. My heart aches for her. I think it\u2019s harder when your kids hurt than when you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, it\u2019s harder when it\u2019s your kids. When Cee Jay walked out on Mac and the kids, he really took a dive. And being a man, expressing his feelings was like torture, so he sulked and got angry a lot. But I know him, I knew he was in terrible pain. I\u2019ve been dumped a time or two, I\u2019ve done the dumping a time or two, but watching my family go through it was worse than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. He was too old to take to a counselor but he took my advice and got Eve in counseling when Cee Jay left and he did go with her. Thank God we got through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if her office is still open,\u201d Gina said. \u201cThree weeks ago, when she realized Downy was with another girl, she said she didn\u2019t want to live.\u201d</p><p>Lou leaned forward, nearly glaring at Gina. \u201cTell them this could be urgent. Tell the counselor\u2019s office that your daughter has made suicidal statements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t that be an exaggeration? I\u2019m not sure she really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGina James, would you rather be guilty of overdramatizing or lack of action? Jesus. Do as I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right,\u201d Gina said. \u201cWhy do we do that? Fear being an inconvenience? I\u2019m stronger than that!\u201d She pulled her cell phone out of her pocket and punched in the numbers.</p><p>It was the only thing Ashley could think of to do\u2014go to one of Downy\u2019s games. When they were in high school together, that was the most important thing to him. He believed he couldn\u2019t play well if she wasn\u2019t there. Even though Eve thought it was a terrible idea when Ashley said she\u2019d take her mother\u2019s car again, she finally relented and said they could all go together. And Ashley hoped, hoped so much, that Downy would know she was there, know how much she loved him, and this whole nightmare would be turned around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Landon, Eve and Ashley got to the game in the fourth inning. Downy was playing first base, a change from his usual position as pitcher but just as natural for him. He played four more innings and was up to bat four times\u2014two base hits, a double and a home run just while the Thunder Point contingent was there. He was magnificent; he had the stadium on their feet. Then the game ended and Oregon State had shut out Arizona. Ashley was on her feet, screaming herself hoarse for Downy and the team at every play. The stands were full and the sun was setting, the stadium lights coming on before all was said and done.</p><p>People were streaming out of the stadium when Ashley said, \u201cI want to see him.\u201d</p> <p>Eve stopped short. \u201cWhat for? Ashley, what for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to tell him, good game. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ash. I don\u2019t think you should,\u201d Eve said.</p><p>\u201cWhat can it hurt? Landon? What can it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Eve shook her head. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t called you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not,\u201d Ashley said, stalking off toward the exit. But rather than heading for Landon\u2019s car in the parking lot, she walked around the stadium. She looked over her shoulder at Landon and Eve. \u201cI know where the locker room and exit is\u2014back here,\u201d she said. She put a little skip in her step as she headed down the walk toward the back.</p><p>She had good instincts\u2014she found what she was looking for. It wasn\u2019t exactly an original idea. There were quite a few students waiting back there. Also, a player\u2019s bus was parked off to the side\u2014probably for the Arizona team, taking them either to a hotel or the airport, or perhaps even home.</p><p>People were loitering, standing around and leaning against cars, waiting for the players to come out. The first couple of guys came out and were greeted by friends and girlfriends with whoops, cheers, high fives and kisses. A few more emerged and got into the Arizona bus. Ashley stood back, waiting. She couldn\u2019t help it, she twisted her hands a little bit. All she wanted in life was for Downy to see her and be as thrilled as he had been in the old days.</p><p>More players came out\u2014a big rush of them, duffels in hand, shoes dangling by the laces\u2014all of them still pumped from the game.</p><p>\u201cDupre?\u201d Downy shouted, noticing Landon and rushing over to him, hand outstretched. \u201cWhat are you doing here, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Landon took the hand. \u201cWe came up to see you play. Great game.\u201d Then he inclined his head toward Ashley.</p> <p>And Downy frowned. \u201cOh, man. This isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to see you play,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ash.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward, smiling, still holding her hands together, trying to keep them still, praying. A few weeks ago she would have thrown herself into his arms and he would have lifted her and kissed her silly. \u201cDowny,\u201d she said smiling tremulously. \u201cGood game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You used to love it when I came to your games.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his duffel and looked at her harshly and she felt her lips quiver. \u201cI\u2019m sorry things didn\u2019t work out. You have to stop now. Stop calling and texting all the time. Don\u2019t come to the games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we be friends?\u201d she asked, her eyes tearing. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other since we were about five.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled his phone out of his pocket, clicked a little and held it toward her so she could see the million texts and pictures she\u2019d sent him. \u201cThis is not friendly. This is just about harassment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, forgive me for living,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI thought you might appreciate some friends coming to your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDowny!\u201d a female yelled. \u201cBaby!\u201d And the tall, slim, dark-haired girl from the frat house threw herself on him, wrapping her legs around his waist and hugging his neck. \u201cYou are such a stud!\u201d she yelled against his shoulder.</p><p>Her, Ashley thought. It\u2019s still her.</p><p>\u201cSelena,\u201d he said, gently putting her on her feet. She looked a little confused when he put her down. \u201cSome of my friends from home,\u201d he said. \u201cLandon, Eve and Ashley.\u201d</p><p>At first Selena smiled, but then she glowered. She turned her attention toward Downy. \u201cIs this the little psycho who keeps calling you and sexting you, day and night?\u201d</p><p>Ashley felt the growl come out of her before she realized what was happening. Little psycho? She put up her hands in the shape of claws, nails bared, and took two giant steps toward the girl named Selena. She was going to claw her face and rip her hair out. But as fast as a lightning bolt, Downy put Selena behind him and Landon jumped between them. He grabbed Ashley\u2019s wrists.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>And Downy yelled, \u201cWhat the hell, Ashley! Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re outta here,\u201d Landon said. \u201cGood seeing you, Downy.\u201d He looped his hand through Ashley\u2019s arm and gripped her tightly. She pulled against him and snarled, but he held on. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it or I\u2019ll throw you over my shoulder,\u201d he muttered. \u201cCome on, Eve. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Landon made pretty fast tracks around the building to the parking lot. Eve was scrambling to keep up behind them while he was dragging Ashley.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. I don\u2019t want to have to tackle you.\u201d Then he laughed without humor. \u201cSeriously? A cat fight? Have you totally lost it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hurt me,\u201d she said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cAnd so you were going to scratch her eyes out?\u201d he asked, marching her along.</p><p>\u201cShe called me a little psycho!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were going to prove it?\u201d</p><p>She groaned and kept up with him somehow. But by the time they got to the SUV, Ashley was softly crying. \u201cYou just don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said softly, pitifully. \u201cHe said he loved me, that he\u2019d love me forever....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Landon said. He turned her toward him and gripped her upper arms. Eve caught up to them. \u201cI get it. You were serious. You were a couple. And you broke up. I\u2019m sorry, Ash. You think you\u2019re going to get him back by acting like a psycho and beating up his new girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, knowing the truth and wisdom in what he was saying, but it somehow didn\u2019t help her at all. She could feel her face contort, then crumble as a fresh flood of tears ran down her cheeks. \u201cIt can\u2019t be over,\u201d she whispered, sobbing and gasping softly. \u201cIt can\u2019t. It can\u2019t. It can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gina made the appointment for Ashley. No discussion. She tried to channel Aunt Lou and merely announced to Ashley that she was going, then drove her to Bandon. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy!\u201d Ashley railed at Gina.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not\u2014you\u2019re upset, that\u2019s what you are. And you have good reason to be upset and brokenhearted and angry. Counselors have helped people get through all kinds of emotional situations and crises. Just talk with her. It certainly can\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling her my personal business!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure she\u2019s been through plenty of that before, too,\u201d Gina muttered.</p><p>The ride to Bandon to the counselor\u2019s office was quiet and sulky. Every now and then Ashley muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not telling her anything.\u201d</p><p>The office of Simone Ross was small, nondescriptly furnished in what resembled cheap, old apartment furniture, maybe dating back to the I Love Lucy show. There was no one in the waiting room, however there was a desk with a clipboard, piece of paper, pen and at the top of the page it said, Please Sign In. There was a door, presumably to an interior office. After sitting in the waiting room for ten minutes, the interior door opened and a grandmotherly woman with an ample bosom, pink cheeks, short silver hair and wide hips smiled. \u201cAshley?\u201d</p><p>Ashley nodded nervously and stood.</p><p>\u201cHello. I\u2019m Simone. Why don\u2019t you go inside.\u201d Then she turned to Gina. \u201cMs. James? We\u2019ll be about forty minutes. You can wait here or step out for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll...ah...wait.\u201d</p><p>Simone gave a nod and immediately closed herself in with Ashley.</p><p>Gina sat on one of the uncomfortable chairs, alone in the reception area, listening. She didn\u2019t hear a murmur from that inner office and she was aching to know what was happening in there.</p><p>Support like this was relatively new and many people relied on the right insurance coverage. When Ashley was born, Gina\u2019s mom had been working at the diner for Stu. It was that event, the cost of the birth, that caused Stu to amp up his coverage for his full-time employees, of which there were two besides himself and his wife. It had been enormously expensive. It hadn\u2019t gotten any less so, but Stu had gotten used to it. The coverage included some counseling.</p><p>This was what Gina would like to do one day, once she completed her master\u2019s degree in counseling\u2014help people through crises just like this. She had two reasons for this pursuit\u2014she knew that things like this didn\u2019t kill you and with the right kind of support, you grew stronger and wiser. Truthfully, since the moment Ashley and Downy started dating, Gina had feared the extremes\u2014that they would marry young before ever experiencing life or finishing their educations, or that it might end disastrously, leaving her beautiful girl brokenhearted.</p><p>Ashley so needed this objective assistance. Gina would remember to thank Lou for insisting on something Gina should have thought of herself.</p><p>She leaned back and closed her eyes. Wasn\u2019t this just the rule rather than the exception...? Just when you thought things had fallen so sweetly into place\u2014Carrie\u2019s business was good, Ashley had been happy, Gina had finally come together with Mac\u2014some life event shook everything up. Right now all Carrie and Gina could think about was Ashley, suffering in sadness and depression, losing weight just as efficiently as any divorce diet, weeping into her pillow at night.</p><p>It was a long forty minutes before Simone opened the door to the reception room and Gina shot to her feet, betraying her anxiety.</p><p>\u201cWill you join us for a few minutes, Ms. James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGina,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease, just call me Gina.\u201d And then she followed the older woman into the office.</p><p>Ashley held a wadded-up tissue in her grip and it was obvious\u2014she\u2019d done a little crying for the counselor. This suggested she had shared her personal business. Gina tried not to smile. The counselor indicated a chair and Gina took it expectantly.</p><p>\u201cAshley and I have talked about things and I\u2019ve asked her to come back in two weeks for another talk. But in the meantime I\u2019d like her to try a teen group that meets here, in this office. Their issues run the gamut\u2014a little of everything\u2014but they seem to be very helpful to each other. That group meets Tuesdays and Thursdays here\u2014my associate moderates the group and he\u2019s terrific. Ashley is willing to give that a try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Gina said. Why did she think this one counseling session would provide a cure? She knew better. And why did she fear group therapy? Ashley had a broken heart\u2014almost a rite of passage. She feared hooking her up with a bunch of troubled teens, some possibly there by court order. \u201cYou\u2019re good with that idea, Ash?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy first choice is to go home and just sit in the closet for a year,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cThus the counseling, group and individual,\u201d Simone said. \u201cThe closet is not a good idea. Not designed for recovery. You move at your own speed in group,\u201d she went on. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to hold you down and make you talk\u2014that\u2019s entirely up to you. And if it\u2019s not right for you, well, we\u2019ll just try something else. In the meantime, please call me if you\u2019re having a hard time.\u201d She looked at Gina. \u201cAshley has my cell number and I\u2019ll take her call if I\u2019m not in session. If I\u2019m in session, I\u2019ll return the call as soon as I can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Four</p><p>Cooper had driven to North Bend a few times to meet Sarah, twice for lunch and twice for dinner when she was sitting alert and stuck at the air station. But she\u2019d never invited him inside to pet the helicopters or meet her colleagues or crews. When she invited him to join her at the end of inspection blowout at a local pub, his face lit up like a beacon. They were even arriving and leaving together.</p> <p>As they were driving from Thunder Point to North Bend he said, \u201cYou\u2019re bringing me out of the closet,\u201d he teased, obviously incredibly pleased.</p><p>\u201cI try to keep my professional life and my personal life separate,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting the guys know you have a boyfriend,\u201d he said, laughter in his voice.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t just need a designated driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if you planned to get wasted,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been really stressed out over this inspection. Maybe now you can relax a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>But it was not the inspection, Sarah thought. The inspection was a lot of work, but her team was outstanding and she never worried for a second\u2014she knew they\u2019d come out smelling like roses. It was that other matter\u2014facing a potential reassignment in the near future and having no idea which way to turn.</p><p>Note to self, she thought, I need a better cover! I can\u2019t let it show! Not until I\u2019m ready to talk about it and I can\u2019t talk about it until I know what the hell to do!</p><p>When she told Buzz she was bringing a date, she emphasized, \u201cNo one knows about your little HR bombshell so don\u2019t breathe a word at the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I swore you to secrecy, no one better know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI mean, not even Cooper. Especially not Cooper. So don\u2019t take him out by the keg for a private little chat.\u201d</p><p>And then Buzz had lifted his blond eyebrows and said, \u201cYou know, when stuff like this came up, even if it\u2019s secret stuff, if it affects the family, I would always talk to my wife,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And she said, \u201cAnd now? Twice divorced? Who do you talk to now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cGot me there. I wouldn\u2019t talk to a girlfriend. If I had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she had said.</p><p>And to Cooper she said, \u201cListen, do me a favor. Don\u2019t mention to anyone at this party that I\u2019ve been stressed out. I wouldn\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m anything but cool and calm. When women get command positions and act like nervous girls, it really plays hell on the leadership role. Got that?\u201d</p><p>He just grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to get wasted and you better not, either.\u201d</p><p>He grinned bigger.</p><p>\u201cIf they start to get a little nuts or start doing shots, walk away,\u201d she ordered.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d he teased.</p><p>She reached across the cab of his truck and squeezed his thigh. \u201cIf you ever want to have sex again, you\u2019ll behave.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and said, \u201cNow you\u2019re speaking my language. And boy, am I glad you\u2019ve got this inspection behind you!\u201d</p><p>I need another kind of inspection, she thought. Something to keep his mind off my mood.</p><p>Most things about the party were entirely predictable\u2014like the fact that everyone was loose and happy and got the biggest kick out of Sarah bringing a man, as if she were a nun or the resident lesbian. The fact that he was a helicopter pilot really charged them up and there were lots of questions about his civilian jobs. Cooper had worked for private contractors who provided the military with services from flying Blackhawks in foreign countries, to years working for oil companies in the Gulf of Mexico. There were many toasts to the XO and CO for the winning performance in the inspection and before long there were toasts for just about anything\u2014for taking a breath, for standing after a couple of hours of steady drinking. And when the captain and XO left the party, they got louder and started doing shots.</p><p>Cooper was having a good time and, as ordered, did not do shots. But Sarah got pulled into the fray and threw back at least a couple, and she didn\u2019t miss the twinkle in Cooper\u2019s highly entertained eyes. She received many slaps on the back, many high fives, and it was confirmed that she was a lot more fun when she had a boyfriend. But when her face became flushed, Cooper said, \u201cOkay, missy, that should do it for you. Let\u2019s take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a bucket for the truck, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d she said, eyes at half mast. \u201cI can hold my liquor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re doing great,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s ten o\u2019clock.\u201d Sarah wasn\u2019t sure they had cleared the parking lot before she was asleep. She had vague memories of being half carried, half dragged into the house.</p><p>In what seemed like three seconds later she groaned and muttered, \u201cTurn off the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have enough cosmic power to turn off the light,\u201d Cooper replied. \u201cIt\u2019s morning.\u201d</p><p>She sat up as though a cattle prod had assisted her. The second she was upright, she groaned and grabbed her head. Slowly, very slowly, she opened one eye and looked at him. He was lying beside her on her bed in his jeans and stocking feet. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands behind his head. \u201cWell, by the time I put you to bed, let out the dog and filled his water dish, Landon still wasn\u2019t home. So\u2014I turned on the TV, laid back down and fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>She gingerly lifted the covers. She was wearing her shirt and panties. \u201cGreat,\u201d she said. \u201cMy brother knows you undressed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore important than that, he knows you were toasted. By the way, you sure talk a lot in your sleep when you\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t drunk, I was just...\u201d He was smiling at her. \u201cOkay, I was drunk. Remind me that tequila shots on top of beer is not recommended. Why did you stay the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was tired,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, Landon knows there was no nookie. Are you going to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s questionable.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one eyebrow. \u201cLittle hair of the dog?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. It could get messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lightweight, Dupre.\u201d He sat up. \u201cI should get out to the bar before Rawley shows up and reports me missing. You coming out later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe after I get a new head.\u201d</p><p>Cooper suspected Sarah had gone back to sleep. It was nearly noon by the time she showed up with Ham\u2014they\u2019d walked across the beach. And she looked both rested and recovered. \u201cI was afraid to call you. Afraid you might be sleeping it off.\u201d</p><p>Right at that moment, her cell chirped. \u201cLandon has felt no such restraint,\u201d she said. \u201cHe made as much noise as possible getting ready for school and he thinks it\u2019s extremely funny that I\u2019m hungover.\u201d Then into the phone she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>A few moments later Cooper said, \u201cThat can\u2019t be the first time he\u2019s seen you a little tiddly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, I was not tiddly. I was wasted. And yes, that probably was the first time he\u2019s seen that. You\u2019re right, I\u2019m a lightweight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s punishing you with phone calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s between classes, calling from the men\u2019s room\u2014I heard flushing. They\u2019re not supposed to make calls during school hours. So, he wants to go over to Eve\u2019s house. And I\u2019ll be more than happy if he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fine to me. Jeez, I have to get a better system around here. I\u2019d buy Rawley a cell phone, but he probably wouldn\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Rawley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk to me unless he has to. He didn\u2019t show up today. He pretty much makes his own hours, which is fine. Everything we have to do gets done. But if he\u2019s not coming at all, he should let me know. That way when he doesn\u2019t let me know, like today, I know he\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s not all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo telling. I\u2019ve been thinking about driving over to Elmore to check on him, but there\u2019s no one to watch the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, I\u2019ll keep an eye on things. How long could it take?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAlmost a half hour each way, then seeing if he\u2019s around. He takes care of his father, who is an invalid. When Rawley works, a neighbor lady who\u2019s a nurse\u2019s aid in a nursing home looks in on him. If I can\u2019t find Rawley anywhere, I\u2019ll need to call hospitals or something. Rawley is strange, but he\u2019s pretty reliable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just go. Will you make me dinner for me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, pulling her in for a kiss. \u201cI\u2019d rather lock the doors and take you upstairs for a while. You were less than romantic last night.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cBut I should make sure Rawley is okay. I don\u2019t know how old he is, but older than dirt, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go. Ease your mind. Then if there aren\u2019t a lot of people around later, we can make out awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we make out naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cWhat if my brother popped in for some reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother. You know, I like Landon, but is it too late to put him up for adoption? We could get visitation a couple of days a week....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest of the week?\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her neck. \u201cI think you know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll check out the freezer and decide what I want for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Cooper found Rawley\u2019s red truck in the driveway at his house, indicating he was at home, but there was a for sale sign in the back window of the truck. Maybe he\u2019d decided to work on restoring Ben\u2019s old truck and drive it at the same time. When Cooper found all the stuff in Ben\u2019s old storage shed\u2014truck, Razor, tools, etc.\u2014he\u2019d given Ben\u2019s truck to Rawley and invited him to use any tools he needed to work on it. He gave the Razor to Sarah and Landon since he had a Rhino for himself.</p><p>Cooper parked on the street, walked up the brick steps and knocked on the door. He knocked again before Rawley opened the door. Rawley was wearing a white dress shirt with his jeans\u2014a new look for him. There was no bandana tied around his head, either. And his hair\u2014extremely thin on top and usually long\u2014had been trimmed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Rawley?\u201d Cooper asked. And Rawley just held open the door so Cooper could step inside. \u201cYou\u2019re selling the truck?\u201d he asked as he entered. And then he saw the empty wheelchair sitting in front of the fireplace. \u201cRawley...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe passed real quiet,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cIn his sleep. I found him this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Rawley. I\u2019m sorry, man. You should have called me.\u201d</p><p>Rawley just shook his head. \u201cI knew what to do.\u201d</p><p>Cooper reached out and put a strong hand on his shoulder. \u201cI could\u2019ve helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a business to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also have commitments to friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI would\u2019ve put the big thermos on the porch, some doughnuts on a plate under the glass so the birds wouldn\u2019t get in \u2019em. There\u2019s just the two of us out there on the beach. There\u2019s gonna be times we have to be somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Rawley, so unexpressive, looked surprised by that. \u201cJust figured I\u2019d get \u2019er done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re selling the truck?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMy dad, he had himself a plot, paid for, but that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s either sell the house or the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo pay for the funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be no funeral, there\u2019s just us. But he needs a box.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Cooper stood uncertainly for a moment. \u201cCould we sit down in the kitchen and have a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>Without answering, Rawley turned and headed toward the kitchen. Once there he brought a fresh cup out of the cupboard and filled it for Cooper. Then he filled his own cup. Then, to Cooper\u2019s surprise, he put cream and sugar on the table, along with a spoon. And he sat down.</p> <p>Cooper didn\u2019t really know where to begin. \u201cMac said you\u2019ve been hanging around the bait shop for a few years now.\u201d</p><p>Rawley nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you work before that, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdd jobs. Here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd lived here with your dad?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI just got reconnected with my dad four years ago. Ben forced that issue,\u201d he said, naming their late friend.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you living before that?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cHere and there.\u201d Cooper decided to wait him out. He sipped his coffee, excellent coffee, and just didn\u2019t speak for a couple of the longest minutes of his life. \u201cI didn\u2019t get on with people so much after the war,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like now\u2014folks didn\u2019t celebrate Vietnam soldiers too much. Made a person want to disappear. That, and bombs going off while you sleep\u2014makes a man just want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>PTSD issues, Mac had said. \u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cI stopped by to see my dad sometimes. Just for a day or so, every few years or so, but not for long. I had burdens. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cooper said. And he thought, there are so many of us. Men without strong attachments who just wander. Cooper didn\u2019t have PTSD issues that he was aware of, but he still felt like a loner often enough. And, like Rawley, after leaving the service he hadn\u2019t gone home to his family. He\u2019d kept moving.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad used to fish off Ben\u2019s dock,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cHe\u2019d have a shot of Wild Turkey sometimes before heading home. Ben found me. I hung out with a couple of vets around Eureka, not too far from the VA. Sometimes if we needed something, like food or money to eat, the VA was as good a place as any. Used clothes, too. Then Ben said my dad was doing poorly. He hadn\u2019t been fishing in so long, Ben checked on him and my dad couldn\u2019t get himself upstairs to go to bed most nights so he slept in the chair. Ben said my dad needed help. He said he\u2019d give me a part-time job if it could be worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came home to help your dad,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different coming home because you\u2019re needed than coming home because you\u2019re needy,\u201d Rawley said.</p><p>Cooper lifted his coffee cup to his lips. \u201cExactly right,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>They drank their coffee in silence for a while.</p><p>\u201cSo, you have a house here,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cPlace to live and a job. I guess that means you\u2019ll be staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost habit now,\u201d Rawley said.</p><p>\u201cYou keep this place real nice, Rawley,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt must have made your dad real proud to leave it to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s just us. Buried my mother some thirty-eight years ago. The Red Cross brought me home from Vietnam. Since I was an only son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you went back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But that was okay at the time. I knew how to act over there. I wasn\u2019t real sure over here. Times were different. Soldiers weren\u2019t heroes back in those days. It was hard times here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you told me this, Rawley,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to work side by side with a man you don\u2019t know anything about,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI realize sometimes a man\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t all that private,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you get to know a person and you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cI guess that\u2019s true, too.\u201d He drained his cup and stood up. \u201cYou order a box for your old man yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Rawley said, standing.</p><p>\u201cNo funeral, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA graveside prayer. A prayer for soldiers, that\u2019s all he wanted. He was real specific. He was in the Army, too. But I think he ordered it up more for me. He was that kind of man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the service?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my friend.\u201d Cooper remembered the day Rawley handed him the envelope with Ben\u2019s will and a key without a word and then just high-tailed it out of there. \u201cIn fact, one of my first friends since I\u2019ve been here, even if you did leave me to deal with that shithole of a befouled bait shop alone.\u201d</p><p>And at that, Rawley grinned. He had a good pair of dentures. \u201cStank up real bad, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal bad,\u201d Cooper agreed. \u201cBut that\u2019s rotten septic over the dam. Now, I\u2019d like to take care of that casket for you, Rawley. I think if Ben were alive, he\u2019d want to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharity don\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSure it does. You took all Ben\u2019s old clothes and stuff to the VA. The washers and dryers, dishes, glassware and flatware went to some church group you knew about. You could\u2019ve kept it and had a garage sale, but you didn\u2019t. I have no doubt you\u2019d give the shirt off your back if someone needed it. Now take the sign out of your truck, tell me what funeral parlor is taking care of the box, what time to be at the cemetery and where. Let\u2019s not argue. I wouldn\u2019t offer if I didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>So Rawley told him where to be at 10:00 a.m. on Thursday.</p><p>\u201cYou have a suit?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a suit. My dad might not even recognize me in a suit.\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cMy brother-in-law is some big-shot executive, but he got fat. My sister sent me a few of his suits. I\u2019ll be here at eight on Thursday morning with one of my hand-me-down suits that I never wear, anyway. If you don\u2019t drown in it, it\u2019s yours. With any luck, you\u2019ll wear it exactly once. Unless you get married or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoop,\u201d he said, using a name on him for maybe the first time. \u201cBen was right about you. You\u2019re a kick in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me. Flattery will get you nowhere.\u201d</p><p>Rawley filled out the suit pretty well. There was more to him than met the eye. In his old worn-out jeans and shirts, with his thin hair and drawn face, he looked scrawny, like a skinny old guy, but in fact he was sixty-three, long-legged and had some strong arms on him. Cooper should\u2019ve guessed; Rawley worked pretty hard at the bar, especially buying and delivering large boxes of supplies. And now that he thought about it, there had been no wheelchair lift in their house. Rawley had probably been carrying his father to bed. If he had a run-down look about him it probably had more to do with living an unstable life for forty years or so.</p><p>He had shaved, something Rawley didn\u2019t do every day. His hair was slicked back, his nails clipped, his best shoes cleaned and polished. And he was very somber.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThis is a tough day for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s resting now. The last few years were hard on the old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. At least he had his son with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever had a son, Cooper?\u201d Rawley asked.</p><p>Cooper shook his head. \u201cNo son, no wife. We\u2019re a lot alike, Rawley. Couple of guys just moving where the wind blows us. Drifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s set to change,\u201d Rawley said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the cemetery and say a last goodbye.\u201d</p><p>There was no more talking until Cooper had driven them almost to the cemetery gates. Then Rawley said, \u201cHe was a real good father when I was a kid. When I was growing up. He was a better father than I was a son.\u201d</p><p>After a moment of respectful silence Cooper said, \u201cI think maybe a lot of us feel that way about our dads, Rawley.\u201d</p><p>The cemetery appeared to be crowded for a Thursday morning\u2014plenty of cars parked along the winding roadway. And then Cooper saw the Sheriff\u2019s Department SUV and Gina\u2019s old Jeep. And there sat the van from Carrie\u2019s Deli. But Rawley was the one to speak first.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did you do, Coop?\u201d</p><p>Cooper shook his head and looked for a place to park. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. I only told Sarah and Mac, that\u2019s all. And I only told them so they\u2019d know why I wasn\u2019t going to be around this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jesus,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cLookit those people. Must be twenty or thirty of \u2019em. They didn\u2019t know my dad.\u201d</p><p>Cooper pulled along the side of the road and killed the engine. \u201cThey\u2019re here for you, Rawley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know me, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure they do, Rawley. Maybe you don\u2019t chew the fat a lot, but most of those folks see you all the time. You\u2019re one of them. By the way, was there anyone you talked to regularly?\u201d</p><p>Rawley shrugged and made to get out of the big truck. \u201cBen. Just Ben. Till you came around. Am I gonna have to make conversation with all of them now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they expect that,\u201d Cooper said with a laugh. \u201cIf the spirit moves you, you might thank them for the effort.\u201d They walked toward the casket. \u201cIt must be a comfort to know Ben will be holding the door open for your dad.\u201d</p><p>The casket was covered with an elaborate spray of white flowers.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy no flowers,\u201d Rawley said.</p><p>Cooper said, \u201cI just took care of that one bouquet at the end there. It\u2019ll sit on the grave site after we\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>Rawley and Cooper stood on one side of the casket opposite the minister, who could only be identified by the fact that he held a bible. Mac and Gina and the others stood respectfully around the grave and waited for the minister to start the service.</p><p>\u201cShall we begin? Just a few words before we lay our friend William Goode to his final resting place\u2014William was a kind and patient man. It was about a year ago when he told me he was tired, that he was ready to go, that he had no regrets about his life and hoped that when he met his maker it would be a joyful reunion. His wife departed long ago and he had missed her every day but was confident he\u2019d see her again. And I thought to myself\u2014I hope I face my final days with that peace and tranquility. Bill, as he liked to be called, was difficult to understand since his stroke a year ago, but I asked him if he\u2019d made his peace with God and he nodded and said, \u2018My staying any longer is a waste of time and medicine. This is enough.\u2019</p><p>\u201cHe wanted one prayer. He wanted to honor our military and chose the veteran\u2019s prayer. He was very clear\u2014no elaborate fuss\u2014just a prayer to \u2018launch him\u2019 as he put it. He said a toast now and again wouldn\u2019t offend him. William Goode is right with God and on his way home. Here\u2019s to you, William Goode.</p><p>\u201cAnd William wanted a poem written by a soldier to be read at his burial. This poem\u2014\u2018Final Inspection\u2019\u2014was written by Sergeant Joshua Helterbran.</p><p>The soldier stood and faced God</p><p>Which must always come to pass</p><p>He hoped his shoes were shining</p><p>Just as brightly as his brass.</p><p>Step forward now, you soldier,</p><p>How shall I deal with you?</p><p>Have you always turned the other cheek?</p><p>To My Church have you been true?</p><p>The soldier squared his shoulders and said,</p><p>No, Lord, I guess I ain\u2019t</p><p>Because those of us who carry guns</p><p>Can\u2019t always be a saint.</p><p>I\u2019ve had to work most Sundays</p><p>And at times my talk was tough,</p><p>And sometimes I\u2019ve been violent,</p><p>Because the world is awfully rough.</p><p>But, I never took a penny </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>That wasn\u2019t mine to keep...</p><p>Though I worked a lot of overtime</p> <p>When the bills got just too steep,</p><p>And I never passed a cry for help,</p><p>Though at times I shook with fear,</p><p>And sometimes, God forgive me,</p><p>I\u2019ve wept unmanly tears.</p> <p>I know I don\u2019t deserve a place</p><p>Among the people here,</p><p>They never wanted me around</p><p>Except to calm their fears.</p><p>If you\u2019ve a place for me here, Lord,</p><p>It needn\u2019t be so grand,</p> <p>I never expected or had too much,</p><p>But if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll understand.</p><p>There was a silence all around the throne</p><p>Where the saints had often trod</p><p>As the soldier waited quietly,</p><p>For the judgment of his God,</p><p>Step forward now, you soldier,</p><p>You\u2019ve borne your burdens well,</p> <p>Walk peacefully on Heaven\u2019s streets,</p><p>You\u2019ve done your time in Hell.</p><p>After a brief prayer, the crowd began to disperse. Carrie James approached Rawley. \u201cMy condolences, Rawley. I have a couple of platters and a casserole for you. I could bring them by your house or you could take them now. I have them in the van.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his brows. \u201cYou know I did all the meals for my dad, right? He was infirm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you might not feel like it right now. And it\u2019s important you eat.\u201d</p><p>Cooper could tell he was speechless. It took a while but finally Rawley said, \u201cI could make coffee.\u201d</p><p>Carrie smiled and said, \u201cThat would be nice, Rawley. We\u2019ll follow you home.\u201d</p><p>It was a very brief open house at Rawley\u2019s place\u2014the folks had to return to work. But there were twenty of them including Cliff from Cliffhanger\u2019s and his wife, Aunt Lou, Ray Anne, Stu from the diner and his wife, Belinda. Landon got a pass from school to represent Sarah, who had to work. A few of Rawley\u2019s neighbors showed up. Carrie and Gina brought a couple of big trays of cold cuts, cheeses, olives, pickles, sliced tomatoes, lettuce and red onion. Some of Carrie\u2019s small sandwich loaves and condiments were placed on the table. There were seven covered dishes that could be frozen\u2014each one bearing the name of the contributor so the dishes could be returned. \u201cIf you just bring them by the diner whenever it\u2019s convenient, Gina will see they get back where they belong,\u201d Carrie suggested.</p><p>Rawley showed up at the beach bar first thing the next morning and his whole face looked different. He had not expected this kind of outpouring from folks he felt he knew only in passing. \u201cAin\u2019t this place something?\u201d he asked Cooper.</p><p>Cooper shook his head in wonder. \u201cIt really is something,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou okay on your own for a while? Like a few hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a day off if you want,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cI got things covered.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Another April day had dawned bright and clear. Four days after the funeral, Sarah finally had a day off. Leaving Rawley in charge, Cooper got out the Harley and took it to Highway 101 and drove the five miles to the exit to Thunder Point and to Sarah\u2019s house. When she opened the door, she was just drying her hair, fresh out of the shower. She wore jeans and a T-shirt and her feet were bare\u2014she was barely dressed and that made him smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. Cooper, this is a surprise,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t usually see you this early unless I walk across the beach with Hamlet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d take you into the hills to see the wildflowers\u2014all that rain was good for something. I thought we\u2019d just get out of town. But, seeing you, I\u2019m having some second thoughts....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you now?\u201d she asked with a laugh.</p><p>Cooper stepped inside, slipped his hand around to the back of her neck and pulled her lips onto his. She parted her lips for him, embraced him and he gave the inside of her mouth a healthy taste. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made love in a while,\u201d he pointed out to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a few days,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I want to see the flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. You will. But first I want to strip you naked, kiss every inch of your body, turn you on, stir you up, make you scream my name...at least twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly twice?\u201d she whispered, breathless already.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to put you on the back of that Harley and take you to see the flowers on the hillsides. And vibrate all your tender lady parts so you\u2019ll want me again.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cCooper, you are such a sweet talker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk right now,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk after.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand to lead him to her bedroom. The bed hadn\u2019t even been made yet. She stood beside the bed and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to seduce me, you have to undress me.\u201d Then she slid a hand over the crotch of his jeans and said, \u201cQuickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have to be quick today,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we can be slow and easy and\u2014\u201d</p><p>And she laughed. He loved the sound of her laughter and hadn\u2019t heard enough of it lately. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried that,\u201d she said. He lifted the T-shirt over her head and her hands went to the snap on his jeans. \u201cIt takes about three minutes for me to start begging and you to start delivering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit, I do like that part.\u201d</p><p>Lately he\u2019d been concerned; Sarah had been quiet. Too many times he\u2019d looked at her and found her staring off at nothing, distracted by some deep thought. Or he might say something and she\u2019d miss it, her mind wandering. He knew something had been bothering her and now he knew it was not the inspection at the Coast Guard station.</p><p>And yet, when they were like this, falling into each other, she was entirely his, there was no question about it. You don\u2019t fake this. Her body responded and her thoughts only wandered to him.</p><p>She shoved down her jeans, kicked them off, flopped back on the bed and waited for him to dispense with boots, socks, jeans, shirt. And then he just looked at her because, God, she was so beautiful to him. \u201cYou\u2019re staring, Cooper,\u201d she said.</p><p>He knelt gently beside her, laid down next to her, pulled her into his arms and while one hand cradled her jaw for a deep kiss, the other went roaming, immediately sliding into her most erogenous parts. She moaned and he smiled against her lips. He had been with too many women and yet, had never had a woman like this, a woman who wanted him as much as he wanted her. She wanted him as quickly, as powerfully, as completely as he wanted her.</p><p>He spent a few minutes kissing her neck, ear lobes, breasts, nipples, and then he was sliding into her. \u201cHave I thanked you for coming into my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver and over,\u201d she said a bit breathlessly. Then she moved his fingers back to that special place, the place that brought it all together.</p><p>\u201cI love it like this\u2014skin on skin. When you come...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. But he didn\u2019t move. He held her still, savoring the connection. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in this place, Sarah, I feel like I\u2019m completely yours and you\u2019re completely mine. I love you, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, let\u2019s say we love each other after...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou in a hurry, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was, but I guess\u2014yes. Do what you do so well.\u201d She opened her legs wider, grabbed him with her legs to pull him deeper. \u201cOhhh, Cooper....\u201d And he could feel her building to it. He took turns on her mouth, her nipple, moving in and out of her, massaging her, listening to the tempo of her sounds rising, increasing, and these were the sounds he loved. And when that great sound came...Cooper! He held her still and deep, his hands on her head holding her for his kiss. He felt her close around him, pulsing, and he really had no choice. He let it go with a loud hum, a long and low groan, a few moments later followed by many small, loving kisses and murmurs about how amazing she was, how beautiful, how erotic.</p><p>\u201cSarah, what you do to me...\u201d he said. And then slowly, without letting go of her, he rolled onto his side, pulling her near, and just held her.</p><p>\u201cSo much for slow....\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He chuckled and squeezed her. \u201cWe get the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d she replied, curling up next to him. \u201cAm I going to see the flowers today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. When I can let go of you. I can\u2019t yet,\u201d he said. \u201cGod, what you do to me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that already.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand down her body, over a plump breast and down to the apex of her thighs. \u201cI told my parents and sisters I was dating a helicopter pilot and my youngest sister asked me if I was gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need a letter of affirmation for the family? Because that\u2019s one thing you are not.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI just need you to be my girl, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it make you nervous to love a commitment-phobe?\u201d</p><p>Was that what was bothering her? Her avowed fear of commitment after a disastrous, brief marriage? \u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m patient. And as long as you love me, I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid I\u2019m going to get scared any second and run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>She propped up on one elbow so she could look into his eyes. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t disappoint you, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t yet,\u201d he said. Then he grabbed her, rolled with her and looked down into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re everything I want, Sarah. When I said I loved you, it wasn\u2019t conditional. And it wasn\u2019t temporary. And it\u2019s not something you have to live up to or down to\u2014it just is. If you think I\u2019m going to quit early, you\u2019re crazy. See, the truth is, I could disappoint you. I might not be enough for you to stick it out. But I\u2019m going to die trying. Now do you want to see those flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted me to scream your name at least twice....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day\u2019s not over yet, Sarah.\u201d And then he kissed her as convincingly as he could.</p><p>While she showered a second time, Cooper let out the dog and refilled his water bowl.</p><p>Women, he thought. They always had some mysterious list of requirements. They were famous for accusing men of not being committed enough or intimate enough but the evidence was in, sometimes there was no such thing as enough. And Cooper had been around the block\u2014he was only capable of feeling his feelings. He wasn\u2019t the best at expressing them, but he had gotten damn good at feeling them since he found Sarah. He felt them down to his toes. He wanted her forever. He\u2019d love it if she wanted him right back, also forever, but the ball was in her court now. She had issues and he had plenty of time. He would concentrate on making her happy. For as long as it took. He was confident he could outlast her.</p><p>The flowers were just getting started in the foothills, but the ride was still fantastic for Sarah. Cooper took her into the foothills south of Thunder Point, getting off Highway 101 at Port Orford and traveling east into the Pacific Coast Ranges. They traveled down a couple of unmarked roads back into the wilderness and it seemed as though every ten minutes they were crossing a river. He drove them up mountain roads, then down again. It was fairly deserted out there, just the occasional house or vehicle, and the air was cool. They passed a sign for Wild Rogue Wilderness and Sarah thought that name suited Cooper perfectly. Along the side of the road the new spring growth bloomed in orange, white, purple and yellow. There were big orange flowers that looked like small sunflowers or large daisies, some that looked like pansies in pastels, little purple puffs and large white blossoms mixed with the green. Spattered among the pine were trees laden with new buds. They drove through a myrtle grove and up along a ridge where they could stop and look down a couple thousand feet to a rushing river that had a few fishermen along the banks.</p><p>They found a good spot to stop and Cooper helped her off the Harley. He found a big rock that overlooked the river and sat on it and she came to him, ruffling her hair to get rid of the helmet head. She pushed his knees apart and sat between them and his arms went around her, holding her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cLot\u2019s more than just flowers out here,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been here. It just looked like an interesting road.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed deeply. \u201cI stay too busy with work, chores and Landon. I haven\u2019t been exploring enough around here. I\u2019m glad we did this today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there was that divorce last year,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cThat probably took up some free time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d she said with a rueful laugh. \u201cThe lawyers were very efficient. Most of my time was spent licking my wounds, then looking for a place to settle with Landon. I couldn\u2019t stay in that house and I couldn\u2019t afford it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo support?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I make a little more than Derek, my ex. I have more time in the Coast Guard. And Landon was my responsibility, not his and mine. I never would have accepted support payments, but I would have liked it if Derek had called Landon, acted like there was some loss there, even if it was only a phone call.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to ask you something about that,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou know, the divorce and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d she said, caressing the arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s over, right? Not just on paper, but in your head?\u201d</p><p>She turned slightly to look at him over her shoulder. \u201cOf course it\u2019s over. What are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in a real mood lately,\u201d he said, and she turned back, looking down at the river. \u201cDon\u2019t bother denying it, we both know you\u2019re not that great at hiding it. You\u2019re in a real mood, running hot and cold, real distracted. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, I\u2019m sorry about that. Just give me a little time, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s it\u2014time for what? Is your ex giving you trouble? Pressuring you? Telling you he has regrets? Making you have second thoughts about the divorce? About us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked with a laugh, turning again. \u201cReally? Oh, Cooper, I am so over Derek. I thank you for that, by the way. I was not interested in getting involved with a man, but you\u2019re relentless. If there was anything left for Derek, it\u2019s been long gone since the day you first kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it, Sarah? Is it just me? Do the other pilots and crews notice? You\u2019re not acting like yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has noticed anything because they\u2019re almost all men and they think women have two behaviors\u2014having a period or not having one.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cCooper, it\u2019s a work-related issue that I have to handle on my own. Not only is it confidential, you can\u2019t help with this. I need a few more weeks to figure it out. It\u2019s got to do with my Coast Guard career path. I\u2019ve been lucky, I\u2019ve been on the fast track.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arms around her. \u201cI doubt luck had much to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGender might have played a role. I don\u2019t mean that they\u2019d throw me promotions for being female, but the boys upstairs might get a little excited to come across a woman who can pull her weight since there aren\u2019t enough of us\u2014know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you\u2019ve been offered something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cooper. I\u2019m saying I\u2019ll be at a crossroad soon and I\u2019ll have to be ready to decide if I want to make a change in direction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think it would help to talk it out?\u201d he asked.</p><p>And how would that sound? she asked herself. She was a woman with no good options\u2014getting out without means of support or staying in and going to the other coast. Leaving her brother behind or wrenching him out of an ideal situation in Oregon. Would opening up to Cooper sound like, \u201cPlease offer to marry me and support me?\u201d Would it sound like, \u201cHelp me say goodbye, help me to give you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be time for talking it out,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now I have to try to think about the situation without any influence from any quarter. And that\u2019s hard. But it\u2019s what I should do, for now.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a knuckle along her cheek. \u201cNo tempting ex, huh?\u201d</p><p>She gave a little laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s long gone. Rumor has it he\u2019s already found someone to date and cheat on in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>A week later Gina was wiping down counters after the morning rush at the diner, feeling a little better about things. Ashley wasn\u2019t exactly markedly improved after one individual counseling session and one group session, but she seemed slightly better. She loved Simone Ross and said of the group, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know they\u2019re way more screwed up and miserable than I am, and I can\u2019t tell you a single other thing about them. I swore.\u201d And Gina didn\u2019t hear her crying at night as often or for as long.</p><p>Ashley\u2019s thinness wore on Gina. Ashley didn\u2019t look starved, but her weight loss was so obvious. She normally had such lovely, delicious curves and over the past few weeks she\u2019d probably lost a good ten pounds. Young girls seemed to relish that pencil-thin figure, but a mother looking at her daughter wasn\u2019t thrilled by it. Ashley had never wanted to be supermodel thin, but her clothes were hanging on her.</p><p>\u201cEve said she\u2019s thinking of breaking up with Landon just long enough to lose five pounds,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>But all Gina wanted was for her little girl to get her appetite back. And Carrie was working just as hard to help achieve that, preparing all of Ashley\u2019s favorite and most desired meals every evening. Ashley was still slim as a straw, but Gina and Carrie had each put on a few pounds on her behalf.</p><p>Gina filled the scrub bucket and pulled on her rubber gloves. It was her curse that when she had a lot on her mind, she cleaned. She was just about to get on her hands and knees behind the counter to give the floor a good scouring when the door to the diner opened. She looked up to see a woman come in. In fact, the woman nearly took her breath away, she was so stunning. She had thick raven hair that fell to her shoulders in those soft Hollywood curls, shining blue eyes, ivory skin, pink cheeks and luscious lips. She looked familiar and Gina wondered if she\u2019d seen her in a movie. She wore very expensive clothes as only a woman like herself, who bought discount whenever possible, would know. Designer slacks, shiny pumps with very high heels, a leather blazer with a designer logo on the breast pocket. And her purse was worth at least a week of Gina\u2019s tips\u2014a Dooney &amp; Bourke.</p><p>Gina pulled off her gloves and smiled. \u201cHi,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d the woman said, smiling with straight, white teeth. \u201cI wonder if you know\u2014will the Sheriff\u2019s office across the street be closed all day, since it\u2019s Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but since they usually have only one of the deputies in on the weekends, he\u2019s in and out. Do you need the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI just wanted to see Deputy McCain. I wonder if he\u2019s going to be around today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you might just have stumbled into the right place.\u201d Gina looked at her watch. \u201cHe\u2019s working today and in about an hour, he\u2019ll probably be stopping by for his morning coffee. Unless he\u2019s tied up somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll stick around. See if he comes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call him for you, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>Gina laughed. \u201cEveryone knows everyone here. Plus, their office being across the street from the diner means we see each other almost every day. I\u2019ll check and make sure he\u2019s coming by this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, digging into her expensive purse for her cell phone. \u201cI should return a couple of calls while I wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Can I get you a cup of coffee? Anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be great. And how about a slice of that pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing up. I\u2019ll get that for you before I call him.\u201d While the woman went to a booth in the rear of the diner, presumably so that Gina wouldn\u2019t overhear her talking to her good friend George Clooney, Gina served up a cup of coffee and slice of pie. She took it back to the incognito movie star. Since she wasn\u2019t talking on the phone yet, Gina asked, \u201cCan I tell him who\u2019s waiting for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted to surprise him, but go ahead. Tell him it\u2019s his wife. I\u2019m Cee Jay McCain.\u201d And she flashed that glorious smile.</p><p>Gina was frozen. Stunned. The coffee and pie were suspended in midair. \u201cWife?\u201d she asked weakly. \u201cI thought Mac was divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Ex-wife,\u201d she amended. \u201cWe\u2019ve been out of touch and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing him.\u201d</p><p>Gina put down the pie and coffee. \u201cLet me make that call,\u201d she said, scooting back behind the counter.</p><p>Gina\u2019s hands actually trembled as she fished her phone out of her pocket. She had a lot of bizarre and random thoughts as she punched in Mac\u2019s number. I should get my teeth whitened, she thought. Underwire, I need more underwire....</p><p>Glancing over, she could see that Cee Jay was chatting and laughing into her phone. Gina turned away so that her back was facing Cee Jay.</p><p>\u201cMcCain,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cMac, I think you\u2019d better come to the diner if you can. There\u2019s someone here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGina? You all right?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cMmm. Yeah, fine. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac, you\u2019re not driving, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to drive up a pole....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pulled over. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cee Jay, Mac. She\u2019s here. To see you.\u201d</p><p>Dead silence answered her. And it stretched out.</p><p>\u201cMac?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGood thing I was pulled over. Listen, try to keep this quiet. I have to know what she wants and I don\u2019t want the whole town to know before I have a chance to talk to my kids. And to Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Fine. Drive carefully.\u201d</p><p>Gina disconnected. She looked down at herself. Cheap black pants that were no longer as black as they had once been, checkered blouse, name tag.... Why did she always wear that stupid name tag? There had been about four people she didn\u2019t know in the diner in the past month. God, the woman was so beautiful. And no wonder she seemed familiar\u2014Eve was a younger version of her mother.</p><p>Gina felt a devastation come over her. Grief. After four years of devoted friendship she and Mac had finally become lovers. They tried to be discreet since their sixteen-year-old daughters were best friends, but at long last they could hold hands, embrace, even a chaste kiss was appropriate. Privately, there was more, so much more. Passion so rich, her whole life had been changed by it. They loved each other, they\u2019d said so.</p><p>But now? What would he do after seeing Cee Jay? Would everything change? Even if Cee Jay hadn\u2019t come back to reclaim her ex-husband, would Mac take one look at her and fall in love all over again? How could he not?</p><p>Gina poured herself a cup of coffee. She wasn\u2019t much of a drinker but she sure wished she had a shot of something to jack up that coffee. Her hands trembled as she lifted the cup to her lips. And while Cee Jay laughed and chatted into the phone, taking petite bites of her apple pie, she appeared so carefree. So animated. How do you leave your three children, not see them for ten years, then stroll back into their lives all happy-go-lucky? How do you do that?</p><p>Gina had the sense that the world she knew was changing, and she had no idea what the outcome might be, but she was suddenly afraid.</p><p>The Sheriff\u2019s Department SUV rolled down the street, parked in front of the deputy\u2019s office and Mac strode purposefully across the street, hitching up his heavy gun belt as he walked. He came into the diner, gave a nod to Gina, walked right past her and stood at the booth, looking down at his ex-wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Cee Jay looked up at him, smiling. She disconnected from her call and stood from the booth. Gina could see the happy expression on her face, and then it fell into a serious look as she listened to Mac.</p><p>And then they walked out of the diner, Mac striding in front of his ex-wife and leaving her to follow. He walked across the street to his department vehicle while Cee Jay momentarily disappeared. And then Gina saw her drive by, following Mac in a shiny sports car convertible. Her car wasn\u2019t white, it wasn\u2019t beige or soft gold. It was pearl.</p> <p>Then Gina had to sit down. Her legs would no longer hold her up.</p><p>Six</p><p>Mac called Deputy Steve Pritkus at home. \u201cSteve, can you cover the town for a few hours? I have a family emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, Mac?\u201d</p><p>Far from all right. Far! \u201cNo injuries, Steve. Just a situation that has to be dealt with immediately. I can explain more later. It\u2019s sensitive. Should I call Charlie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope, I got it. I\u2019ll be parked in front of the office in ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>Mac then drove to a Denny\u2019s restaurant on the outskirts of Bandon, parked and went inside. Cee Jay pulled up right beside him but he didn\u2019t wait for her; he just walked straight into the restaurant. When he faced the hostess holding her menus, he pointed to the booth he wanted, far to the rear of the restaurant. \u201cJust two coffees,\u201d he said. \u201cNo menus today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, Officer,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>Mac took a seat in the booth with his back to the wall, facing the restaurant. Cops never sat with their back to the crowd. A few moments later Cee Jay came in and, seeing her, he scowled. Well, she\u2019d done all right for herself. She probably thought herself tempting, looking so fetching and sophisticated. Well, hell, Cee Jay had always been pretty. But now she looked elegant, as well, and it pissed him off. Here he\u2019d been scrimping, saving, trying to inch by on a deputy\u2019s paycheck with three kids and she was driving a brand-new Lexus coup convertible. He hated her.</p><p>She slid into the booth. Her smile was a little subdued. The waitress was immediately there with two coffees, then departed just as quickly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want, Cecilia Jayne?\u201d</p><p>She was a bit taken aback by the formal use of her name. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very long time. I wanted to see how you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine. That it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we could talk. How are the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine. And I don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac, look, I know what I did was wrong. I\u2019m sorry. It took a lot of time to work up the courage to come here, and to apologize. I know there\u2019s no way I can make it up to you. I was a screwed-up abused foster kid and shouldn\u2019t have gotten married at the age of sixteen. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a nice family,\u201d he said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cShows what you know,\u201d she said, her eyes narrowing. \u201cThey weren\u2019t my family, they were about the eighth one and they were only nice in public. It was awful. I suffered. I was messed up and was trying to escape.\u201d</p> <p>Mac\u2019s eyes narrowed, as well. Being in law enforcement, he wasn\u2019t easily duped by how people appeared on the outside. Just a couple of months ago he\u2019d arrested a seventeen-year-old for battery, for beating up his elderly father, and he came from the richest, snootiest family in town. The kid had everything, and it still wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>He was trying to remember Cee Jay at sixteen\u2014she was a cheerleader, in lots of school clubs, always looked well-heeled, had a curfew that was too liberal and could borrow the family car often. They let her talk on the phone till all hours. He\u2019d been to her house many times. There were a lot of kids in that house, but he\u2019d grown up with Aunt Lou. Hell, Lou did more yelling and disciplining than Mac had ever seen at Cee Jay\u2019s foster home.</p><p>He had been silent too long. Since she\u2019d said \u201cI...was trying to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you did,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we done here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac, I want to see my kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou signed away custodial guardianship and visitation, Cee Jay. I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d just leave now. Leave town, leave the area, like you did before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please listen to me? Mac, I made a terrible mistake, but I was twenty-three and had three kids. I was half-nuts. I just about had my life together, my mental health straightened out, when you sent the divorce and custody papers. It was very clear\u2014you were done waiting around for me and you didn\u2019t want me near our kids. I was devastated, but I was also feeling terribly guilty. I couldn\u2019t blame you\u2014so I just signed. That was almost five years ago and I regretted it almost immediately. I want a second chance. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>He rested one forearm on the table. \u201cDo you have any idea what you did to our children? The babies cried day and night. Ryan wandered aimlessly around the house calling out for you. Dee Dee was so screwed up\u2014she stopped sleeping, napping, just couldn\u2019t get comfortable, couldn\u2019t be soothed. But that\u2019s nothing to what it did to Eve! We could hardly get her to go to school, she was so afraid you\u2019d come home and she wouldn\u2019t be there. She wet the bed, threw up, cried herself to sleep, wouldn\u2019t socialize with the kids at school. I had at least two kids in my bed every night for a year, usually three. Cee Jay! You fucked up the whole family because you couldn\u2019t take it! Because getting laid by some golf pro looked better to you than bottles and diapers! No, you are not coming back into their lives now! Keep me posted on your location and when they\u2019re over eighteen, I\u2019ll tell them where they can find you if they want to see you or talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned, her nose grew pink and a couple of fat tears rolled down her cheeks. Her voice was a whisper. \u201cI want to make amends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this year, Cee Jay. Is this part of some program? Because the rule is\u2014make amends where it doesn\u2019t cause any harm. This\u2014this would cause harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no, I don\u2019t want to cause any pain. I just want to know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe. Can\u2019t. Trust. You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give you my word!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour word isn\u2019t worth shit around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how unforgiving you are,\u201d she murmured, wiping her eyes. \u201cYou were never like this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been burned real good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a big boy, I can take it. But my kids are vulnerable. You mess with my kids and you\u2019re going to see how unforgiving I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac, they\u2019re not just yours....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are. Because their mother abandoned them and then signed them away. Don\u2019t you dare screw them up and hurt them now. Don\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cI\u2019m going to file to amend the custody agreement. You\u2019ll hear from my lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said smoothly. He pulled a notepad out of his pocket. \u201cYou can have your lawyer call my lawyer.\u201d He scribbled down a name and city\u2014he hadn\u2019t talked to Sidney Mikowski in almost five years. \u201cUntil you get a ruling from a judge, stay out of Thunder Point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me where I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can. I\u2019ll have a restraining order before close of business today and it will be my absolute pleasure to arrest you. And, if you sue for custody I think you\u2019ll find that I\u2019ll be suing for back support. That car out there\u2014the price tag on that should help with tuitions and braces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so hostile! I never expected this rage from you!\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cDo you have any idea how long I hoped you\u2019d think of your children, even if you didn\u2019t think about what you\u2019d done to me? Do you have any idea? I prayed for a phone call! For years I waited, hoping you\u2019d send one of them a fucking birthday card, but there was nothing! I even decided that for the sake of the kids I wouldn\u2019t make you grovel too much, if you\u2019d just promise not to stray again.\u201d He sat back. \u201cCecilia Jayne, I\u2019m afraid I got over that little fantasy quite a while ago. You can\u2019t just stroll into town and pick up where you left off. It\u2019s over. There are consequences\u2014you\u2019ll just have to live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am living with it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave, Cee Jay. Leave and don\u2019t look back. This meeting is over.\u201d Mac stood and fished out his wallet, throwing a ten on the table for the coffee, extreme overpayment. Her clothing, jewelry and car made him act as if he was a rich man when in fact he\u2019d struggled with money every day for the past ten years. He was going to struggle for the next ten. Probably twenty.</p><p>\u201cWho are you with now, Mac? I know you\u2019re not remarried\u2014I checked. Gotta love that internet. So, who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done talking,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot that washed-out little blonde at the diner, is it?\u201d A fierce look must have come into his eyes because she laughed.</p><p>Ah, there was the true Cee Jay. One minute crying, the next laughing, always manipulating. \u201cWhat are you really after?\u201d he asked. \u201cTell me now because I\u2019m going to find out. Are you looking for money? Because I don\u2019t have any. If I did, I\u2019d give it to you to make you go away, but it\u2019s been a real challenge holding it together. What do you really want? You\u2019re not exactly dressed for Little League or soccer practices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a chance to reconnect,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stared down at her. \u201cNot gonna happen. Drive carefully.\u201d And he walked out of the restaurant.</p><p>Mac sat in the Denny\u2019s parking lot. No judge would give him a restraining order, not even a judge who was his biggest fan. Cee Jay hadn\u2019t threatened any of them. That was just all talk and, by now, if Cee Jay had called her lawyer, she probably knew that. He dialed Lou\u2019s cell phone. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cGrocery store. You have some special request?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee Dee\u2019s at gymnastics, Ryan is at soccer, Eve is at cheer practice. Or maybe that\u2019s over and she\u2019s with Ashley\u2014Ashley drove today and gave Eve a ride. Why?\u201d</p><p>God, he thought. Did Cee Jay have any idea what these lessons, teams and activities cost? Just the sign-ups alone without factoring in uniforms, gear and associated costs were a strain. Twenty dollars for this gymnastics meet, twenty bucks for the bus for that soccer tournament out of town. Just to get your kid in the parks-and-rec soccer league was over fifty bucks. Then there were uniforms, shoes, your turn supplying sports drinks and bottled water and snacks, then there were regular pizza parties and barbeques to celebrate wins and season close. Piano, gymnastics, dance and cheerleading\u2014those were expensive teams, lessons and uniforms. It never stopped. More than the money, which was always tight, the emotional and time investment could be exhausting. It took more than bread and water to raise a family. If he hadn\u2019t had Lou the past ten years, he\u2019d have been completely lost.</p><p>\u201cI need a couple of things, Lou. I need you to gather up the kids and get them all home. And I need you to stay cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are we under nuclear attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCee Jay\u2019s in town. She wants to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Lou shrieked.</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to the kids before they hear from some other source that their mother is around. And, Lou, Cee Jay rules apply. Do not lose your cool. Do not. I already lost mine a little....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you strangle her?\u201d Lou asked with a shaky voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an underachiever. Oh, God,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, dear God.\u201d</p><p>Cee Jay rules actually had been Lou\u2019s suggestion, but in the end it was harder for Lou than it was for Mac. They never said nasty things about Cee Jay in front of the kids\u2014it simply wouldn\u2019t serve any purpose to trash their mother. Wasn\u2019t it hard enough on them to know she left them? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cLou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. We\u2019ll hold it together. Where is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow? I met her for a cup of coffee at Denny\u2019s just off the highway in Bandon and I asked her to leave. I told her she couldn\u2019t see the kids and that I wanted her to go away and leave us alone. And she said I\u2019d hear from her lawyer. We have to be ready, Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t do anything, can she, Mac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. One thing at a time. I\u2019ll see you at home.\u201d</p><p>He signed off and then just sat in the Sheriff\u2019s Department vehicle. He could barely remember when he was eighteen, nineteen. He was a freshman at Oregon State, boinking his high school girlfriend wherever they could find a time and place to be alone. She was on the pill; they were supposed to be safe. Now he wondered, of course, if she hadn\u2019t maneuvered that like everything else. For his part, he had such passion for her he could hardly think straight. So when the pregnancy came, they got married immediately, running off to Idaho to a justice of the peace and spending one night in a cheap roadside motel.</p><p>He had believed he loved her. He held back her hair while she was sick during her pregnancy; he rubbed her back, worked two jobs, did everything he could think of to make her happy. And after Eve was born, Cee Jay organized a big fancy white wedding and reception they couldn\u2019t afford, just so all her friends could fuss over her and party with her.</p> <p>Lou had been appalled. But she\u2019d been there, holding Eve most of the time so Cee Jay could party.</p><p>After that, Mac couldn\u2019t remember them ever being happy. Maybe he\u2019d just been too goddamned tired.</p><p>Before leaving the Denny\u2019s parking lot, Mac drove by the side of the restaurant to look at the booth where he had just been sitting. He could see Cee Jay sitting in the same booth, laughing animatedly into her cell phone. How could she do that\u2014laugh and joke after a meeting like that with her ex? After tears and begging and anger, how could she switch it all off?</p><p>Lou felt as if her face was on fire. Her heart was pounding and she put a hand to her solar plexus. She realized she was standing in the frozen food section, nearly yelling into the phone. A couple of people were looking at her\u2014thankfully not people she knew. A man in his seventies dipped his chin and said, \u201cYou okay, miss?\u201d</p><p>Miss? Lou was sixty! \u201cFine. Thanks, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>And then she wondered if she should leave her cart and run. Instead, she shoved her list in her pocket, ignoring what was left on it, and made a mad run through the frozen foods, throwing pizzas, casseroles, burritos, fried chicken and various other frozen meals in her cart. In went French fries, Tater Tots, garlic toast, peas, beans, cheesecake, cookie dough. She rushed to the dairy aisle and grabbed milk, cheese, cold cuts, sour cream, yogurt. She found the spaghetti sauce and pasta and loaded up. On her way to the checkout, her cart heaped with a mountain of food, she grabbed bread, chips and pretzels, two bottles of wine and a two six-packs each of soda and beer. It was like stocking for a hurricane. Yes. Hurricane Cee Jay.</p> <p>\u201cWhoa, Lou,\u201d the cashier said. \u201cHaving a party?\u201d</p><p>She was stunned by her mania. \u201cAh...just some friends.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to take the kids home and bar the door. She had enough food to keep them going for more than a week. Maybe during that time they could figure out what to do about Cee Jay. Oh, God, she\u2019s going to take them away from me, Lou thought in near despair.</p><p>She had to have help to load the groceries in the minivan and she rushed to get the kids.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you take me out of practice?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cYour dad asked me to round up you kids and bring you home. He wants to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ryan asked, pulling off his shoes in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not completely sure,\u201d she said, because she wasn\u2019t. What was Mac going to say to them? Your mother is back\u2014be nice to her?</p> <p>While she was waiting for Dee Dee to load up her backpack from gymnastics, she dialed Eve\u2019s cell phone. Eve was just leaving cheer practice and was going to go to Ashley\u2019s house for a while. \u201cI need you home\u2014I have something I need help with. Stay at school, I\u2019ll pick you up in about five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Eve asked when she got in the front seat next to Lou.</p><p>The whole car smelled gamey, filled with the wild scent of sweaty kids. Lou had been doing this since before Dee Dee was walking\u2014shuffling them to school, games, lessons, everything. The weekends were jam-packed, as well, they had so many things to attend to\u2014housecleaning, laundry and general chores. They had a list\u2014assignments for everyone. Seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day, Mac and Lou operated a split shift, making sure that everyone was covered and that everyone felt they were getting an equal amount of adult time and love.</p><p>Oh, God, she\u2019s going to take them away from us and hurt them!</p><p>\u201cAunt Lou? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Eve asked.</p><p>\u201cYour dad just asked me to round you up and bring you home\u2014family meeting I guess. But hey\u2014I bought a ton of food that\u2019s extremely bad for you, so before we give him the podium, I\u2019m going to need every hand to get this stuff in the refrigerator and freezer. Pizzas, lasagna, Stouffer\u2019s mac and cheese, the really good stuff. And I didn\u2019t even buy lettuce\u2014we can work on our cholesterol later. We all on board here? Let\u2019s get this stuff put away before we hunker down with your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he was working today?\u201d Eve said.</p><p>\u201cHe is. I\u2019m sure he allotted fifteen minutes for this family meeting. Try not to insult him with boredom.\u201d</p><p>But Lou was secretly terrified and Lou was strong\u2014it took a lot to terrify her. When she pulled in to the garage, she yelled, \u201cEveryone, grab at least two bags!\u201d When they all walked in, heavily laden, Mac was standing in the kitchen waiting for them. He looked at them. \u201cThere are a few more in the car,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lou. Was there a sale or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d she said, beginning to shove things into the freezer, her head down. \u201cLet\u2019s not let it spoil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Mac ordered. \u201cLet\u2019s put all this stuff away. Then we\u2019re going to sit down for a talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in trouble?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>They sat at the dining room table. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to sneak up on this, kids. I had the shock of my life today. I saw your mother.\u201d</p><p>He was faced with three astonished faces. Big eyes. Open mouths. It was Eve who asked, \u201cYou just saw her?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe came to town looking for me. We had a cup of coffee together. We talked.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cIt seems she realizes it was a mistake, leaving our family as she did.\u201d</p><p>A bark of laughter came out of Eve and the look on her face was downright evil. \u201cA mistake?\u201d</p><p>He took a breath and noticed that Lou had her hands folded on the table and was staring down at them. Probably trying to keep herself from screaming. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty normal to be angry about that,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cI was very angry for a long time, but at some point I decided it wasn\u2019t good for us. It wasn\u2019t good for me or for you. And at the time we got married, at the time your mom left, she was too young to make good decisions. She was only sixteen when we got married. I know every sixteen-year-old thinks they\u2019re brilliant and wise and capable of making big life-altering decisions, but I\u2019ve got news for you\u2014in fact, when your mom left, she was still very young. She\u2019d been thrust into adulthood, had never really lived, was so overwhelmed by responsibility...\u201d</p><p>Eve leaned toward him. \u201cIt didn\u2019t overwhelm you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it did, Eve. I couldn\u2019t manage. I had to ask Aunt Lou for help. And believe me, I was too young, too. So I did everything your Aunt Lou told me to do.\u201d</p><p>Lou lifted her eyes. A very small half smile played on her lips and she gave a slight nod. Because, yes, he had. He was drowning and terrified and so angry. Lou, a savvy woman, mature with a lot of experience, talked him through it and helped take care of the kids.</p><p>\u201cEve, we\u2019ve talked about this before and you\u2019ve talked with your aunt Lou about this\u2014this is the kind of hardship young families run into when they\u2019re not grown up enough, not really ready to take on the world before they have the experience. That\u2019s why I hope you graduate from college and have a handle on what you want out of life before you make the kind of promises and commitments your mother and I made. Promises and commitments we weren\u2019t prepared for and didn\u2019t know how to keep. I\u2019m sorry, Eve. It\u2019s as much my fault as anyone\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not! You didn\u2019t leave us!\u201d</p><p>I got her pregnant, he thought. \u201cEveryone has their own way of handling stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you pissed?\u201d Eve fired back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to let that run my life. I don\u2019t have to let anger control me and I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, she left you! She signed us away!\u201d</p><p>He so could use a drink right now. Not a beer, but a shot of something strong. \u201cThere are times I regret being so honest with you. Maybe it\u2019s the cop in me\u2014I always start with the truth. I just can\u2019t keep track of a lot of lies. Listen, when I sent your mother those divorce and custody papers, I had absolutely no idea what her life was like. She could\u2019ve been living in her car for all I know. I had to locate her and all I got was an address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo maybe she signed the papers as a favor to you. To me. To get it over with so she wasn\u2019t a burden on anyone, I don\u2019t know. And maybe she came back to say she was sorry because it\u2019s taken her this long to get her life together\u2014I honestly don\u2019t know. All I know is\u2014it\u2019s not our problem. We have a pretty solid family and we\u2019re going to keep our family solid. We\u2019re strong, Eve. We can afford to be calm and kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I might be solid, but I\u2019m still pissed,\u201d she said, giving the table a thump with her fist.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s normal. Your life has been tough enough with only a dad and aunt\u2014try not to let this event and your anger make your life any tougher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so surprised to see her, I forgot to ask. But I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll contact me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you letting her back with us?\u201d Eve asked. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Mac was shocked by the question. He shook his head and frowned. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, confused. \u201cEve, my marriage with your mother ended ten years ago, years before our divorce was final. I haven\u2019t said this to you kids, but I know you realize it\u2014I love Gina. We\u2019ve been best friends for years and I trust her and care about her. And I love her. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re getting married or moving in together or changing our families right now\u2014but it\u2019s a fact. And no other woman, not even my ex-wife, is going to change that.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cShe will always be your mother, but she hasn\u2019t been my wife in a very long time\u2014so no, I am not inviting her to come home to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she calls you again, tell her I want to see her,\u201d Eve said angrily.</p><p>Everyone turned shocked faces toward her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all. I want to see her. That\u2019s all.\u201d And then Eve got up from the table and left the kitchen. Momentarily her bedroom door slammed. There was silence around the table.</p><p>\u201cIs she pretty?\u201d Dee Dee finally asked, her voice a little smaller than usual.</p><p>They had pictures. There weren\u2019t any pictures of Cee Jay displayed in their house, but the kids each had an album of photos taken during early childhood, pictures they could look at if they wanted to. That was Lou\u2019s doing. Remarkable, given Lou was probably even more angry at Cee Jay than Mac was, if that was possible. But no one could make Cee Jay disappear and the kids were curious, naturally. For years Eve was obsessed with why her mother had left her but the younger kids just wanted to know who she was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very pretty,\u201d Mac said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably where you kids got your good looks. She looks like the pictures you have. Hasn\u2019t changed a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see her, too,\u201d Dee Dee said.</p> <p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThink she\u2019d maybe come to a soccer game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, son. I guess anything is possible. But I think it\u2019s pretty likely she\u2019s just visiting around here. I wouldn\u2019t count on her staying long. To be honest, I don\u2019t know what her plans are. I\u2019ve never known. I think she\u2019ll get in touch with me again, but I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere we too much? Is that why she went away?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>They\u2019d been over this a hundred times. That question always came out of the blue at odd times. The answer was always the same. \u201cEverything was too much, son. I worked all the time, there wasn\u2019t enough money, the house was falling apart, your mom was so young and lonely and felt cheated by life. We argued too much. It was just too hard for her, I guess. And I\u2019ve asked myself a thousand times what I could have done to make it better. Easier. And I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish\u2019t I could just see what she looks like for real,\u201d Dee Dee said.</p> <p>Mac reached across the table and squeezed his baby girl\u2019s hand. \u201cI hope she calls, punkin. I\u2019ll sure tell her you want to see her.\u201d</p><p>Dee Dee grinned. \u201cI\u2019m going to practice piano,\u201d she said, scraping back her chair and heading for the basement stairs.</p><p>\u201cCan I get on the computer?\u201d Ryan wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be checking your Facebook stuff, so no funny business,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d he replied, following his younger sister to the basement. All the kid stuff was down there.</p><p>And then they were alone, Lou and Mac.</p> <p>\u201cEve\u2019s pissed,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI should go talk to her....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lou said, shaking her head. \u201cNot so fast. Let her simmer, I\u2019ll talk to her in an hour or two. And the younger ones? They took in your shocking news, blew it off after a minute and headed for their favorite toys.\u201d She shook her head and laughed. \u201cTo them, Cee Jay is a myth. Kids. Don\u2019t try to guess what they\u2019ll do next\u2014it\u2019s exhausting. Are you going back to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor at least a couple of hours. I\u2019ll try to come home early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle Eve. This is a huge event in her young life,\u201d Lou said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Eve didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever see her mother again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019d better hide all the sharp objects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very selfish of me, but I\u2019m glad she\u2019s angry,\u201d Lou said. \u201cI think I had a panic attack at the grocery store, afraid Cee Jay would take the kids away from us. I bought everything I could fit in a cart in about three minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to take the kids away from us,\u201d Mac said. \u201cWorst case, she\u2019ll see them. No, that\u2019s not the worst case\u2014worst case is she\u2019ll hurt them emotionally. Build up their hopes, let them down, reject them all over again. I\u2019m going to try to head that off if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Lou asked.</p> <p>\u201cHell if I know.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Gina was beginning to relate to Ashley\u2014she had been gripping her phone ever since Mac walked out of the diner that morning, followed by Cee Jay. In her most rational musings she saw him dealing with the many questions his kids must have had about their mother. Ryan and Dee Dee couldn\u2019t even remember her, but Mac had told her how traumatized Eve had been, still was on some days. In her most irrational fantasies, Cee Jay was moving her beautiful wardrobe into Mac\u2019s house, into his closet, curling up with him while the children welcomed her with tears of joy.</p><p>When there was a soft knock at the door at 9:00 p.m. she jerked it open. There he stood, holding two bottles of beer by their necks. \u201cWhat a day,\u201d he said.</p><p>She let out such a sigh of relief she almost collapsed. \u201cYou might\u2019ve called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, there was no time. Well, I could have sent you a text, but I really wanted to see you, to tell you about it. I couldn\u2019t figure out a text or voice mail short enough to send that would also explain everything. Grab a sweater or shawl\u2014come out on the porch with me.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed Carrie\u2019s wrap off the hook by the front door. Her house was quiet. Carrie had gone to bed, exhausted from the hard day of running a deli and Ashley had retreated to the solitude of her room. She sat down with Mac on the porch step.</p><p>\u201cExpecting a call?\u201d he asked with a slight smile, glancing at her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s attached itself to the palm of my hand....\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and opened a beer for her. She finally let go of the cell, laying it on the porch, wiping her sweating palm on her pant leg.</p><p>\u201cMy kids are doing better than I dared hope. Well, Eve\u2019s acting out\u2014completely expected. She wants to see her mother, but I suspect it\u2019s not to welcome her home. She\u2019s outraged, which she\u2019s entitled to be. But Lou? She\u2019s over-the-top\u2014I left her with a bottle of wine that was slowly disappearing.\u201d</p><p>Gina laughed. \u201cTaking it hard, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s afraid Cee Jay is back to wrestle the kids away from her. That\u2019s not going to happen, but Lou\u2019s what I would call overwrought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Lou seen her yet? Cee Jay?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI believe you alone have had the honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve mentioned that this illusive ex of yours is drop-dead gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, she\u2019s always been pretty. Now she appears to be pretty and rich. I\u2019m going to have to do some digging, see what she\u2019s been up to. See if I can figure out what she wants. I find it hard to believe that after ten years she wants her family back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac, she\u2019s not pretty. She\u2019s probably the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen. She literally took my breath away. Before I knew who she was, I thought a famous actress whose name I couldn\u2019t remember had stopped into the diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. I\u2019ve been having really awful wide-awake nightmares all day. There\u2019s this one very bad scenario I\u2019ve been playing over and over where you take one look at her and start peeling her clothes off and begging her to come back to you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow, then took a slug of his beer. \u201cWell, you were there when I took my first look at her. Is that what you saw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you looked very pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo put it mildly. What nerve. She\u2019s been gone since Dee Dee was nine months old\u2014ten years ago now. She hasn\u2019t called or sent a birthday card or Christmas present in ten years and then, without any warning, she sashays into town in a sixty-thousand-dollar car, looking as if she just stepped out of a fashion magazine. And she wants to know her kids? Maybe she\u2019d like to start by getting to know their orthodontist bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say, Mac?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and told her parts of their conversation. \u201cI told her to just leave town. I threatened her with a restraining order\u2014a completely empty threat\u2014and she said she was going to legally challenge the custody agreement. I told her to have her lawyer call my lawyer. I haven\u2019t talked to my lawyer since he gave me a very nice discount to file the divorce and custody papers for me five years ago. Papers she signed without a question, a call or a visit, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell the kids this?\u201d Gina asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m real careful about what I tell them. I try to tell them the truth without telling them that their mother, half of their gene pool, is a selfish unfaithful bitch who left them as babies without looking back. It\u2019s not easy. But she\u2019s done enough to them. I don\u2019t need their self-esteems attached to her irresponsible and cruel choices. They\u2019re innocent, after all.\u201d He put an arm around her, pulling her closer. \u201cBesides, who\u2019s the genius that knocked up a sixteen-year-old? I have to own my part in all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I do know how you feel,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you have similar issues with Ashley\u2019s father,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot so much, no. He was the new kid in town for a year or so, dropped out of high school but we hung around the football games and beach parties, and when I told him I was pregnant, he ran for his life. I don\u2019t know if he was running from the responsibility or the fact that I was fifteen and he was eighteen\u2014it could\u2019ve been that. But I was thinking of my own father. He left us when I was five. They never got divorced, but five years later he died and guess what? He had a new family\u2014and a will. He didn\u2019t leave us any of his insurance money or pension\u2014signed it all over to his new family even though my mom was the official widow. Now, how do you get past that? Maybe that had something to do with my own teenage issues, huh? Maybe I had abandonment issues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s what scares me more than anything\u2014Eve being like her mother. Ryan being as stupid as his father....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a hard day for you today,\u201d she said. \u201cRevisiting the past is always so scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you something, Gina,\u201d Mac said, pulling her closer. \u201cIt would have been a lot worse if I didn\u2019t have you. Here I was, so freaking scared to get involved again because of what happened in the past, yet today I found out what it means to have a solid relationship when the shit hits the fan. I told them today. I told the family. I told them about us. Eve was a little panicked, asked if I was going to let her mother come back and it just came out\u2014I said their mother left our marriage a very long time ago and I love Gina. There\u2019s no coming back, there\u2019s only moving forward.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him. \u201cGod,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBeing in love with you can be stressful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot being in love with you can be more stressful. If we ever get our families under control, we\u2019re going away. Just for a weekend, maybe, but away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll all know we\u2019re having sex,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, what the hell! They\u2019ve all been having sex!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of them,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cIn fact, I think Lou\u2019s the only one in that boat at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Eve is there yet\u2014Lou promised me she\u2019s got that covered. Eve\u2019s more comfortable talking to her about that part of her life. And Ashley\u2019s in a bad place right now, but she\u2019ll recover and move on and...I don\u2019t care, Gina\u2014I don\u2019t know how we can blend these two crazy families into one circus yet, but we deserve a little break. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She kissed his cheek. \u201cYes, I think so. Maybe when Ash is better and the most beautiful woman in the world has left town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most stupid woman in the world is more like it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to understand how much advantage she would have if she took things slow. A few cards, phone calls, maybe a lunch or trip to a pizza parlor before she sics the lawyer on us.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cShe might come up against their anger and find out she\u2019s not snuggling up to some precious little babies who long for her. She\u2019s facing off with some kids who were dumped on a very hurt, very angry father\u2014and they\u2019re not willing to suffer fools gladly. They might rip her apart. A part of me hopes they would.\u201d</p><p>He put down his beer and pulled her into his arms, covering her mouth in a deep kiss. \u201cNever be afraid again, Gina. Don\u2019t be afraid of some mean woman just because she has a good haircut and fancy clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ve had such a hard time getting this romance off the ground....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d he said.</p><p>Just then Gina\u2019s cell phone rang. She picked it up and saw that it was Ashley calling from inside the house. \u201cHi, Ash,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d her daughter asked through tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the front porch, having a beer with Mac. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you! Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Gina said to her lover. \u201cMy daughter, calling from her bedroom, having another meltdown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis happen a lot?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cLately? Regularly. Want to wait for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to wait, but I should go home, scrape poor old Lou off the floor and pour her into bed. Her worst nightmare came to town today\u2014by now she\u2019s probably drunk. I\u2019ll call you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. And listen, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo bottles of beer and a little reinforcement. I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. \u201cWe got the shaft,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got together when our baggage was so heavy. I\u2019m going to make this up to you somehow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. This is good. I like you this way. Once I got over the first guy, I got really hot for responsible men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s sexy?\u201d he asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI am so sure.\u201d</p><p>Gina went into Ashley\u2019s room and saw her sitting cross-legged on the bed, her laptop perched on her knees, her phone clutched in her hand, tears streaming down her red face. \u201cMom!\u201d she shrieked, holding the phone toward her.</p><p>Gina looked at the text message including photo and there was her daughter, eyes seductive slits, mouth open in a very sexy pose, breasts bared. For a moment she was completely confused. The message read, Say hi to Downy\u2019s ex psycho slut.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>\u201cHer! It\u2019s her! Downy\u2019s new girlfriend! She sent it out to everyone in Downy\u2019s phone directory! Oh, my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley?\u201d Gina asked, still not believing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fake, Mom,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI would never let anyone take a picture of my boobs! Those aren\u2019t my boobs! Oh, God.\u201d</p><p>Gina felt her knees go weak. She sank onto the bed, staring at the grotesque photo on the phone.</p><p>\u201cAnd on Facebook! She put it on Facebook! I saw it because she\u2019s Downy\u2019s friend and Downy\u2019s my friend! Oh, God, people are going to think it\u2019s me\u2014that I posed for that picture and sent it to Downy or something. Oh Mom, I\u2019ve never been so...embarrassed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is she doing this?\u201d Gina asked. \u201cAshley, have you been calling and texting Downy a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cNot in a long time. Not since I started counseling and group. I agreed to stop reaching out to him. Why is she doing this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m not up on this internet stuff like I should be\u2014but isn\u2019t this against the law? Isn\u2019t it harassment or something?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone ever gets caught. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you called Downy? Could he have done this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd called me \u2018Downy\u2019s ex psycho slut\u2019? Wouldn\u2019t he have said \u2018My ex psycho\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley, this is almost the nastiest, meanest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Can Downy really be okay with this? Have you called him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t take my calls. I called Landon. He\u2019d already seen it\u2014that\u2019s how fast this stuff moves. It came over his texts. He said he\u2019s going to call Downy and tell him to shut it down. But Mom, it\u2019s too late!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, listen. You just laugh if you can and say, no one in their right mind would ever believe that\u2019s me. Like those are my boobs? Gimme a break! His new girlfriend is obviously very threatened and has gone to a lot of trouble to try to make me look bad! Can you do that, Ash? Because it\u2019s not you! It\u2019s not! It\u2019s her!\u201d</p><p>Ashley looked straight at Gina, tears pouring down her cheeks. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m ever going to school again, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d she said in a whisper.</p><p>Landon called Downy the minute he hung up from talking to Eve. Downy answered, \u201cDupre! \u2019Sup, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really have to ask, Downy?\u201d Landon countered. \u201cAshley\u2019s pretty much destroyed! What the hell, Downy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I didn\u2019t do that. That was Selena, just screwing around, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all? She sent it to everyone! Everyone on your phone directory and posted it on Facebook! A picture of Ashley looking like she just had the sex of her life, her naked boobs hanging out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mother got that,\u201d Downy said. \u201cI had to tell her it was a practical joke\u2014that someone on the team did it. I texted everyone and said it was just a bad joke and I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And before anyone got that text, I\u2019m sure they forwarded the picture to everyone they knew....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut man, it wasn\u2019t me! And Selena said she\u2019s sorry. So tell Ash, we\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, see, we had a little fight. She wanted me to get all my old pictures of Ash off my phone and I just didn\u2019t do it fast enough and it pissed her off and... Listen, it\u2019s no big deal. Everyone knows it\u2019s just a crank, it\u2019s not real....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you brain-dead?\u201d Landon said. \u201cJesus, Downy, you\u2019re killing the girl! As it is, Deputy McCain saw it when Eve asked him if it was against the law, if it was something you could be sued for! I think he\u2019s gonna call your dean, your coach!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man, why\u2019d you do that? Why\u2019d you show him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you\u2019d done that to Eve, I\u2019d be on my way up there to beat the shit outta you, you stupid asshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that to Eve?\u201d Downy asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t even do it to Ashley! But come on, I told her we broke up and she wouldn\u2019t let it go and Selena\u2014she doesn\u2019t like seeing another girl on my phone, you know? But she\u2019s over it and she said she won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Landon was stunned quiet. \u201cLet me see if I have this right,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou asked Ash to go with you, right? To be your steady girl. To take off her clothes for you, to do private things with you, and you promised to respect her. Promised to take her to her prom, promised to be faithful, said you loved her, and now because you fucked some girl at State, now you want her to just go away quietly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woudn\u2019t\u2019ve put it exactly like that, but I guess that\u2019s sort of right. Look, we grew apart....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrew apart? One week you spend nine hours on the phone with her and the next week you grew apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDupre! Back off. It didn\u2019t work, okay? And it\u2019s not that big a deal\u2014everyone knows that picture was doctored! Everyone knows it\u2019s not real! Lighten the fuck up!\u201d</p><p>Landon just shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what you are, Downy? You\u2019re a prick, that\u2019s what you are. A stupid prick with his brain in his dick. I hope Selena dumps your sorry ass!\u201d</p><p>Landon hung up. Then he called Eve. He could hear the tears in her voice when she answered, but this was not just about Ashley. She was having her own terrible day\u2014her long-lost mother had suddenly reappeared and she was struggling with that.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re not in good shape right now, but would you do something for me? Would you show your dad that picture, tell him Downy admits it\u2019s faked and ask him if there\u2019s anything he can do? Like, I don\u2019t know...I suppose life in prison is a little harsh... Could he call the dean or the coach or something...? Because Downy\u2019s girlfriend got her hands on his phone and did that. And that is just wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Downy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice full of disgust. \u201cHe said it was no big deal and Selena did it, but she said she wouldn\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s comforting,\u201d Eve said. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling Ashley. She won\u2019t even answer my call,\u201d Eve said. \u201cOh, Landon, I think everything is falling apart all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ask your dad, okay? That\u2019s all. He\u2019s probably going to say it\u2019s just one of those ugly things, but ask, anyway, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask. But don\u2019t get your hopes up. I\u2019ve seen this stuff happen before. Really mean stuff. And no one ever does anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. Because Landon had seen it before, too. If he\u2019d done something like that and the school called his sister, she\u2019d tie him up and work him over with a baseball bat. Sarah didn\u2019t stand for that kind of nasty stuff. \u201cYou doing okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. I\u2019m a little shook up, can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m going to throw things at my mother or hug her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in between?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out. A little coffee talk? \u2018So, how\u2019ve you been? What kind of interesting things have you been up to for ten years while I was growing up?\u2019\u201d</p><p>He laughed in spite of himself. \u201cHave I told you lately how awesome you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me again if you want,\u201d she said. \u201cListen, would you do something for me? I\u2019m kind of caught up in the mother drama here\u2014everyone in the family is all upside down. Will you help me try to take care of Ash? Because this has got to be like the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to her and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check on her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe asked me to call Downy so maybe she\u2019ll take my call. I just don\u2019t want to tell her what he said. I\u2019ll tell her about your mom, tell her you\u2019re worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Landon, you\u2019re awesome, too. And I always loved Downy...I never would\u2019ve believed he\u2019d let something like this happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s smokin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Gina thought it was reasonable to allow Ashley to stay home from school the day after the sexting incident, but it was difficult to bear. It was as if they were back at square one, if not worse. She\u2019d slept or sobbed on and off all day. Gina went home from the diner several times during the day to check on her and found no improvement.</p><p>So Gina took Ashley\u2019s phone, turned it off and slipped it into her apron pocket. This was a very bad time for her daughter to be making or taking calls. She could hardly blame her\u2014it was tempting even to Gina to check the phone for inbound calls. But she resisted.</p><p>She had not confiscated the laptop. When she got home from work that day she asked Ashley if the Facebook debacle had been dealt with.</p><p>\u201cThe picture was taken down,\u201d she said morosely. \u201cBut there\u2019s lots of talk\u2014people arguing back and forth about whether it was faked by a mean girl or the real deal...my desperate attempt to lure Downy back. I threw up four times today.\u201d</p><p>Gina sat down on the edge of the bed. \u201cWe have to pull it together, Ash. The sooner you face it, the sooner it will fade away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? I\u2019m never facing this. Never! It\u2019s just too cruel!\u201d</p><p>Gina gave her a second day to sulk and work it like a hangnail because the following day was her group therapy. Gina had high hopes for that group. Before leaving Ashley in bed, she returned the phone. When she got home to check on her, she found the phone on the kitchen table, shattered to bits. Beside the wreckage was a hammer.</p><p>In a panic, Gina ran to Ashley\u2019s bedroom. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked. With a hand on her shoulder, she rolled her daughter onto her back. \u201cAshley, what happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI turned it on,\u201d she said on a sob. \u201cThere were so many messages, the mailbox was full. I listened to about four and they were mean. \u2018You\u2019re a slut, Ashley! You\u2019ll never get him back, Ashley\u2014not even with your pathetic tits!\u2019 There was even a guy\u2014I don\u2019t know who\u2014who called me a whore.\u201d She rolled back and sobbed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you have to get up,\u201d Gina said. \u201cYou\u2019ll share this in your group, get some advice. Kids go through terrible bullying ordeals and survive. Not just survive but get stronger. Look what happened to Landon last fall, getting beat up by the likes of Jag Morrison! You have to stand up to this, Ash!\u201d</p> <p>Ashley rolled back. Her eyes were so red they were nearly crusty. Her whole face was swollen. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m ever going anywhere, you\u2019re crazy. I just want to die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ash. You have to fight back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! There are too many of them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have Eve, Landon and your friends!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even see them in the crowd!\u201d Ashley whimpered. And then she pulled the covers over her head.</p> <p>Gina left Ashley\u2019s bedroom because she was beginning to shake. She didn\u2019t know how to pull her girl out of this. She went to the kitchen and wondered who to call. Carrie? The useless Mrs. Downy? Finally, desperate, she got out her phone and dialed up the counselor, where she was forced to leave a message, which she left in low tones. \u201cMrs. Ross, it\u2019s Gina James and I have a crisis\u2014Ashley has been dealt another terrible blow. Her ex-boyfriend\u2019s new girlfriend used Photoshop to create a naked picture of Ashley and texted it to the boy\u2019s entire directory and launched it on Facebook. Ashley has been sobbing for over two days, refuses to get out of bed and I found she smashed her phone with a hammer. She says she wants to die. I don\u2019t know what to do. Please help.\u201d And she left her number, which Simone Ross undoubtedly already had.</p><p>Then she sat at the table, where she was determined to wait for a return call, no matter how long it took.</p><p>Tears ran down her cheeks. She\u2019d read about teen suicide and wondered if those kids had said to their parents, \u201cI just want to die!\u201d Young girls harassed on social media sites or in chat rooms, escaping the pain through self-destruction? Young boys picked on so relentlessly they felt they couldn\u2019t go on? Who put a stop to it all? Who intervened before it was too late?</p><p>The phone finally rang and she saw it was Simone Ross.</p><p>\u201cI want you to bring her in,\u201d Simone said. \u201cI\u2019ll see her in my office in one hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t want to?\u201d Gina asked.</p> <p>\u201cBring her. Get help if you need help, but bring her. Let\u2019s not play around with this. She\u2019s had a bad experience, is experiencing feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness and I don\u2019t want it to escalate.\u201d</p><p>And so that\u2019s what Gina did. She told Ashley she was taking her to the counselor and when Ashley refused, Gina threatened to call Mac to help get her in the car. And Gina reluctantly watched as Ashley threw on a wrinkled and smelly sweat suit from the bottom of the laundry pile. She just wanted her in the car; she wasn\u2019t going to fuss about her wild hair, her sloppy appearance, nothing.</p><p>Once they were underway, Ashley said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why we bother. She can\u2019t fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe bother because you could use the support,\u201d Gina said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get through stuff like this alone. You need a team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need to go away....\u201d</p><p>This was their first trip to Simone Ross\u2019s office during regular business hours and there was actually a receptionist behind the desk, a young woman with green hair and eyebrow and lip piercings. She didn\u2019t even ask who they were\u2014she used the intercom to buzz Simone, who came out immediately.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Simone and Ashley were behind closed doors that Gina realized she hadn\u2019t called Stu! Her boss had no idea she wasn\u2019t coming back to work and by now the lunch crowd was beginning to arrive. When he answered she said, \u201cStu, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d And then she burst into tears.</p><p>Eight</p> <p>\u201cDo you feel like telling me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Simone asked Ashley.</p><p>Looking down into her lap, Ashley said, \u201cDidn\u2019t my mom tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBits and pieces, but I\u2019m interested in your version. Your mother is afraid, Ashley. She cares about you so much. Seems you\u2019re getting picked on. Exploited. Or something.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyes. \u201cPicked on?\u201d she asked, her eyes nothing more than swollen slits. She told her about the picture. \u201cDowny\u2019s girlfriend sent it to everyone in the world! Including all the kids at school and half the adults in town including the football coach. She put it up on Facebook. It was taken down, but not before the whole world saw it and shared it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this is bothering you the most?\u201d Simone asked.</p><p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHelp me out with some feelings here,\u201d Simone entreated. \u201cHurt? Embarrassed? Angry? Sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that,\u201d she said. \u201cTotally humiliated. And they believe it. People believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014your response to that is to do what?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment that stretched out. \u201cI called Downy to tell him how mean that was, but he didn\u2019t pick up. He won\u2019t answer my calls or texts. Not for any reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do next?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cCried. Fell asleep. Woke up and cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you gone to school? Talked to friends?\u201d</p><p>Ashley shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Her voice was so small.</p><p>\u201cHas it occurred to you that you\u2019re grieving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I was, so yes. I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been angry?\u201d Simone asked. \u201cHave you felt like this can\u2019t be true?\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cWhen you see it, you know it\u2019s true. If I hadn\u2019t smashed my phone, I could show you. It\u2019s horrible. I know Downy wants to break up, I get it. But why would he let someone do this to me? Even if he hates me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Ashley. Are you going to lay in bed forever? Are you going to get up at some point? Put on clean clothes? Call your friends? Go to school? Maybe go to a party or dance, like you used to?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head dismally. \u201cNone of that stuff matters anymore....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold out your arm, like this,\u201d Simone said, demonstrating. \u201cI\u2019m going to pinch you a little bit\u2014just to look at the elasticity of your skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ashley asked even as she held up her arm.</p><p>\u201cJust to check something. I can see from your eyes that your face is swollen and... Ah, you\u2019ve been crying so much and refusing food and drink so much that you\u2019re dehydrated. I\u2019m going to get you a bottled water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want anything,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cMy stomach has been upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Simone said, but she got up, anyway. She went to the cupboard behind her desk and brought Ashley some water. \u201cTry a few sips, please. I need to talk to your mother for just a minute. You\u2019ll be all right here for a few minutes, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ashley shrugged before she nodded. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain. Just give me a second and try to get some of that water down. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I just throw up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrash can, darling. It\u2019s right there. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Simone went into the outer office and Gina was immediately on her feet. \u201cSit down, Gina.\u201d Simone took the chair beside her. \u201cAshley is showing symptoms of depression and I think she needs medication. If she were older, I\u2019d just get her a script, but given her age and the severity of her symptoms, I want to admit her under the care of a psychiatrist. She\u2019s dehydrated and despondent. I gave her a bottle of water, but she\u2019s uncertain she can keep it down. She might need an IV, which I can\u2019t administer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepression? How bad do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s isolating, not eating, sleeping all the time. She hasn\u2019t bathed. She\u2019s dirty and doesn\u2019t care. This isn\u2019t like her, is it?\u201d</p><p>Gina shook her head. Her lips quivered. \u201cThat damn Downy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I want to admit her, Gina\u2014this could be an emotional reaction to a bad breakup or it could be classic depression, which usually presents between the ages of fifteen and thirty. Is there depression in your family? In the extended family?\u201d</p><p>Gina looked down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ll ask my mother, but we\u2019ve been a family of women. My dad left when I was just five. I was pregnant at fifteen, delivered Ashley at sixteen and my boyfriend...\u201d Tears came to her eyes for the first time in so many years. \u201cLong gone,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cIt does run in families sometimes. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s suffering from clinical depression but it\u2019s entirely possible. If you can check with your mother and even Ashley\u2019s paternal biological family, it would give us more information. Meanwhile, I want to take her to city hospital in North Bend. We can take her together, check her in. She\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d Simone reached for Gina\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take any risks here. She could be a danger to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019d kill herself?\u201d Gina asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I worry that she might let herself die if there\u2019s not an intervention. There\u2019s really no point in risking this. Come with me to explain all this to Ashley. Then I should make a couple of calls.\u201d</p><p>And Simone went back to Ashley without another word.</p><p>Gina followed. She listened numbly while Simone explained to Ashley\u2014depression, dehydration, isolation, risk. Ashley merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay at least overnight in the hospital, Ashley, so we can give you an antidepressant and monitor the way you respond. It might be for a few days, but I\u2019m fairly sure it won\u2019t be long-term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong-term?\u201d Ash asked.</p><p>\u201cSome patients are critical and really need hospitalization for a couple of weeks, maybe a month. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, but you need medical intervention\u2014you\u2019re sick to your stomach, dehydrated, can\u2019t get out of bed. Let\u2019s take care of this.\u201d</p><p>She nodded weakly. \u201cNo matter what you do, I\u2019m not going back to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Simone said.</p><p>And Gina thought, Please God, let me be as sharp as she is when I finally achieve my degree.</p><p>Tears were wetting Gina\u2019s cheeks. She\u2019d sacrificed everything to keep this girl healthy, safe and well-adjusted, yet one eighteen-year-old boy had just about ruined them all!</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she heard Simone say into her cell phone. \u201cYes, her mother will handle the forms and we\u2019ll be there within the hour. I\u2019d rather not go through admitting. Oh, thank you\u2014we\u2019ll meet you on the third floor.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected and stood from her chair. \u201cLet\u2019s go get this difficulty taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Mac was surprised to see an Oregon State Police Trooper vehicle pull into town. Mac had been standing outside his office, chatting with old Sam Connie about the weather when Joe Metcalf parked and got out. He was more than just another officer to Mac. He was the man his aunt Lou had been seeing for the past year and a half, though she\u2019d done her level best to keep him secret until six months ago.</p><p>Joe gave a nod to Sam then shook Mac\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cLooks mighty official,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d And off he wandered, using a cane as leverage.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cI should probably ask you,\u201d Joe responded. \u201cLou says the place is falling apart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cNot the town, thank God. Just a few people in it. But they\u2019re all real important to me.\u201d Then Mac held open the door to the office so they could go inside. \u201cI guess Lou told you about Cee Jay coming to town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s pretty sideways about that. And now I hear Gina\u2019s daughter is in the hospital?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she tell you about it?\u201d Mac asked. \u201cThat sexting business?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd the amount of bullying on social networks is out of control\u2014everyone from vulnerable young teens to rich and famous stars... Too many victims. Lou said there\u2019s some question about Ashley\u2019s stability....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in the hospital for three days, but it appears she\u2019s going to be all right. She\u2019s a lot better in three days. Lots. She\u2019s depressed, but not clinically depressed. I have to admit, if someone sent a naked picture of me to all my friends, I might get a little whacked out of joint. I worry about Gina. Her only child. I wish I could get her away from all that, but I worry about leaving Lou and the kids. The second I leave the house, Cee Jay could decide on a surprise visit.\u201d</p><p>Joe tilted his head and smiled slyly. \u201cI might be able to help out with this situation,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gina went to visit Ashley in the hospital. Many of the patients in her ward at the hospital were being evaluated for long-term care. Some were there by court order and some were either drugged and hazy and others looked, on the surface at least, like perfectly normal young people between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five, their issues secret from Gina. Not all of them were allowed visitors.</p> <p>Ashley embraced Gina. \u201cI\u2019m better,\u201d she said. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Gina asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked about it a lot\u2014the whole thing, from breaking up to the mean sexting. Did you know that\u2019s what it\u2019s called and it happens a lot? I can\u2019t think of one time that\u2019s happened at my school. I mean, there were mean rumor things, but nothing like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t think it ever would,\u201d Gina said. She looked around. \u201cThere seem to be just a few young people here. Lots of older people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll ages,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cThere are a couple of old people who hurt themselves by accident and they\u2019re going to go to a home where they\u2019ll be safe and cared for\u2014they\u2019re sometimes completely normal and sometimes in some time warp.\u201d And she smiled.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel safe here, Ash?\u201d Gina asked.</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t like is that they lock the ward doors at night\u2014that bothers me a lot. Like what if I need to get out for some reason, like a fire or something? But there\u2019s a button to push\u2014a bell and a light. Besides that, I feel okay.\u201d</p><p>A young girl in a hospital gown over scrubs walked past them and lifted a hand to Ashley. Her wrists were bandaged. Ashley looked at Gina. \u201cThat is what you think it is. Not the first try, either. Look, I know I was pretty bad, but no matter how bad I looked, I wasn\u2019t that bad. I wanted to disappear, I didn\u2019t want to do anything to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ash,\u201d she said, hugging her again. \u201cWhat turned you around? You\u2019re so much more like yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing how far down the hill you can roll, for one thing. But the nurse in charge keeps reminding me that sometimes what a person needs most is medicine. I had an IV for a whole day\u2014that made me feel a lot better. And this medicine? It\u2019s not supposed to really kick in for a few weeks, so I doubt it\u2019s really the medicine, but if Simone insists I try it, I guess I will. Do you think it\u2019s normal that I still want to kill Downy?\u201d</p><p>Gina couldn\u2019t help but smile. In fact, she liked the sound of that so much better than \u201cI just don\u2019t want to live.\u201d But she did know Ashley would never hurt anyone. She was kind to the core of her being.</p><p>\u201cIs Gram okay?\u201d Ashley asked. \u201cShe\u2019s not all worked up about this, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was very worried. She\u2019s relieved you\u2019re under a doctor\u2019s care. When I tell her how great you look and sound, she\u2019ll be more relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor, phhhhttt. I saw the doctor for three minutes. The nurse is running this show. Her name is Judy. She has zero patience, but I can see where some of the patients would push her around if she gave them an inch. I stay out of her way. She doesn\u2019t like anyone. I told Simone she was mean as a snake and hated everyone and Simone smiled so big I thought her ears would fall off. Think that means Simone isn\u2019t crazy about the nurse?\u201d</p> <p>Gina felt her eyes well with tears and she squeezed Ashley\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mom? Why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d never be a smart-ass again, never make me laugh again....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Simone today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today. Why?\u201d Gina answered.</p><p>\u201cShe asked if I\u2019d stay three more days. She said it\u2019s up to me. I said I didn\u2019t want to and she said I\u2019ve gotten so much better in just a couple of days, she\u2019d really like me to stay a little longer. I said okay. But not any more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up the first second you can leave,\u201d Gina said. \u201cYou sure about this decision?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd when I bring you home, you\u2019re going back to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI can\u2019t exactly quit school. It\u2019ll be awful, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, Ash. You have good friends there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also have some jerks there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it is in the world,\u201d Gina said. \u201cGood people and jerks and millions you haven\u2019t met yet. I\u2019m so relieved you\u2019re stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I gave up and hit the bottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just so glad we found the right support,\u201d Gina said. \u201cBecause I love you so much. You\u2019re my life, you know.\u201d</p><p>Mac had convinced Gina they had earned a night away from Thunder Point and with Ashley in safe hands, they should take their chance. Once Ashley came home, he knew Gina would want to be on hand. But, with Carrie\u2019s approval, they packed overnight bags and left town around two that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cExactly where are we going?\u201d Gina asked Mac. \u201cI really don\u2019t like being away from my phone. Just in case Ashley needs me. She was fine yesterday. In fact, she was better than she\u2019s been in a month, but you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, reaching for her hand, giving it a squeeze. \u201cCarrie promises to keep your phone close all night in case anyone calls about Ashley and she has my cell number. I had a break today\u2014I was talking to Joe, telling him how ripped up our families are, how much you and I needed a little break, but neither of us felt like we dared get away. And he said he had this little one room fishing cabin on Lawrence Lake\u2014close by but not too close. When I told him I\u2019d love to borrow it but didn\u2019t want to leave the family with Cee Jay lurking, he offered to spend the night at my house. If Lou needs anything or anyone, he\u2019s right there. He\u2019s savvy\u2014he wouldn\u2019t let Cee Jay get by him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did just tell you,\u201d he said, smiling at her. His cell phone chirped and he glanced at the caller ID. \u201cIt\u2019s Carrie,\u201d he said, passing it to her.</p><p>She grabbed it. \u201cHello?\u201d she answered urgently. Then she visibly relaxed, listening. \u201cReally?\u201d she said. \u201cOh, God, Mom, that\u2019s such good news.\u201d She thanked Carrie for calling her and ended the call. She looked at Mac. \u201cAshley called my phone\u2014she had a nice talk with my mom. She\u2019s feeling good, looking forward to coming home in a couple of days and asked my mom to call Eve, tell Eve she\u2019ll talk to her as soon as she gets home. Just that little thing makes me feel so much better. Now maybe I can feel a little less guilty about escaping for a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to heat up a casserole and some of your mom\u2019s fresh bread I found in our freezer, we\u2019re going to build a fire and drink a couple of glasses of wine, get naked if you want to or we can talk\u2014unload some of that worry you\u2019ve had the past few weeks....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your worry?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat I really want to do is just hold you. God, Gina, there have been times I\u2019ve wondered if we\u2019d ever catch a break.\u201d</p><p>Gina seemed to sink into the passenger seat of his truck. She leaned her head back and sighed. Then she slowly lifted his hand to her lips, kissing his palm, then each of his fingertips. \u201cHow far?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI might have to pull over,\u201d he said, his voice husky.</p><p>The late-April sun was going down later each day so they had some daylight left by the time the reached the cabin. The afternoon sun was casting long shadows from the pines surrounding the lake. It wasn\u2019t quite four when Mac pulled up to the cabin. There was a long lawn down to a dock, a bass boat lying facedown on the grass. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said.</p><p>He pulled a cooler and a canvas bag out of the truck bed, carrying it to the cabin. He unlocked the door and let Gina step inside. He followed her and they both just stood inside the door, taking it in.</p><p>Mac wished he had asked Joe how long he\u2019d had this place because it wasn\u2019t what he expected at all. It was much too nice to be a bachelor\u2019s fishing cabin. On one wall there was an efficiency kitchen with a small stovetop and oven, a few cupboards but a full-size refrigerator/freezer. A small table for four sat in the corner. Along another wall were a sofa and recliner along with a couple of accent tables. On the third wall, a bed and small chest of drawers and on the fourth, a fireplace and set of double French\u2013style doors on one side of the hearth and a single door on the other. The single door stood ajar and inside appeared to be a very upscale and large bathroom. Now that had to be a woman\u2019s touch; bathrooms are very important to women. For men, not so much. He briefly wondered what history Lou had with this place, then put that thought from his mind.</p><p>Mac put down the cooler and bag and opened the doors to a small covered porch that looked out onto the lake. There were two chairs facing the lake and a small table\u2014a nice summer retreat, but not exactly for a solitary man. The chairs and table were covered with weather-proof drapes.</p><p>While he was checking out the deck and lake, Gina had taken the cooler and canvas bag to the kitchen. He wondered if this place would be available to borrow in summer; he wouldn\u2019t mind getting her out there in that bass boat, rocking with the waves.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she called. \u201cLook what I found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me start this fire first,\u201d he said, closing the doors and checking out the fireplace. He should\u2019ve known\u2014there was a switch. It was gas. Up here in the forest, logs and floating ash were a risk. Wildfire wasn\u2019t out of the question. Joe was a practical man. And as the shadows lengthened, the late afternoon grew cool and the night would be wonderfully cold, just right for holding someone close.</p><p>When he joined her in the small galley kitchen, she was holding a container of vanilla ice cream, spoon in hand. She scooped some out and held it toward his lips.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t old, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the daughter of a cook, Mac. I know how to read the expiration date.\u201d She spooned it into his mouth and he took it in.</p><p>And his eyes, locked on hers, heated. Bright blue turned to hot, dark blue. He leaned toward her and touched her lips with his. His hand found her waist and he leaned into her, parting her lips with an icy tongue, kissing her, sharing the ice cream, causing her to moan and lick his mouth. The moan turned into a groan and she tipped back her head, letting him take her mouth. His hand was in her soft golden hair, cradling the back of her head, keeping her mouth under his. He pulled her against him and he was instantly hard. It was a long moment before the ice cream matched the temperature of their mouths. Their lips were sticky and she stood on her toes to lick them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cCold,\u201d she whispered against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHot,\u201d he said. \u201cReal hot.\u201d</p> <p>She put the container on the table and fed him another spoonful, immediately offering her mouth, which he took, letting her lick the ice cream from him.</p><p>And he got harder.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d make it till sunset,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDessert first?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDessert all night, maybe. Want to play a little ice cream game?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. I bet we get the hang of it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been this alone with you before,\u201d she reminded him. It was always catch as catch can at either her house or his, always the possibility someone might come home unexpectedly, a reality that made them far too quick about their lovemaking. But they were alone in the woods, on a lake, doors locked, a carton of ice cream handy. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she said, rubbing up against him.</p><p>He led her the short distance to the bed. The fire was blazing, the room was dim and pleasant, and he put the carton down. He slowly undressed her, intermittently sharing a bite of ice cream with her. When she was naked, he got rid of his clothes as quickly as possible, joining her on the bed. Her hand went to his raging hard-on and he groaned.</p><p>\u201cI better cool you down,\u201d he said hoarsely. He grabbed himself a mouthful of ice cream and kissed her, but before he\u2019d let her scoop it out of his mouth, he covered her erect nipple with the sweet ice cream and she arched against him. Her nipple got harder and he moved to the other one, licking and sucking.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she whispered. He moved back to her mouth, kissing her deeply. She smiled against his lips. \u201cWho knew?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTurn you on, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee for yourself,\u201d she challenged.</p><p>He slid his hand over her flat tummy and with curious fingers, found her ready for him. But he wasn\u2019t done with her.</p><p>He trailed another mouthful of ice cream over her belly button, then down to the apex of her legs, pushing them apart, putting his cold mouth on her soft moist folds, licking her hard. She squirmed under him, pushing herself against his mouth, the sweet noises that came from her making him pleasure her even more. He took another mouthful, just enough to make his tongue cold, then went after her again, holding her hips down while he lapped at her. Her fingers threaded through his hair and wouldn\u2019t release him until he lifted his head, only long enough to grab a little more ice cream, torturing her in the best possible way.</p><p>He went back to her mouth, whispering against her lips. \u201cI have to get in you,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait another second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to cool you down?\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you to come.\u201d And with that he entered, drove deep and hard, one hand on her butt, the other on the back of her head, holding her mouth against his. He growled with the effort it took to hold back long enough for her to make her moment. Thankfully it didn\u2019t take long. He moved a little, deep in her, and she clenched, bit his lip, whimpered, and he felt her wonderful spasms. She held him tight, wrapped her legs around him to hold him and went a little wild with her climax. There was nothing more for him to do but join her and it was shattering. His eyes watered with the intensity and he flew. For a few seconds there he was in another solar system.</p><p>And then, panting, they slowly came back to earth. He lifted his head enough to look down into her eyes. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in you like this, I feel like I could lift the world.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled sleepily. \u201cWe\u2019re all sticky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll shower you,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut I might make you sticky all over again. You make me wild.\u201d He kissed her lightly. \u201cI have to admit, I never looked forward to a shower so much. Or to ice cream. In fact, I don\u2019t think I ever liked ice cream this much before.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever look at a pint of vanilla the same way again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He stroked the hair back from her brow. \u201cGina, I want you to know something. Even though I was married, I never had anything like this. You\u2019re brand-new. And I love you more than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>She put a palm against his cheek. \u201cI know, Mac. Somehow I know. And I\u2019ve never spent the night with a man before....\u201d</p><p>He pulled back in surprise, holding himself up with his arms. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dated, I had a relationship with one guy that included sex, but I had Ashley. I didn\u2019t stay away from her overnight. Besides, I never felt like this before.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a minute, just looking down at her. \u201cYou know what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really have to find a way to get married....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac, our lives are a complete disaster....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll get them straightened out somehow. We have to figure out how we\u2019re going to sleep in the same bed every night. There are lots of things to work out\u2014and we\u2019ll work them out somehow.\u201d Then he frowned. \u201cYou will say yes, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cIf we ever figure it out and get our families on track, I\u2019ll say yes,\u201d she promised. \u201cBut right now I\u2019m hungry....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can warm up that casserole....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can make do on ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Cooper liked the tempo of his life, and this was a first for him. It was almost the end of April, and virtually every other day was sunny. Sometimes they enjoyed the sun all day long. He had something of a schedule going. He liked schedules. He had been in Thunder Point for six months and felt more settled than he had in places he\u2019d lived for much longer. After making sure there was coffee and sweets left for the beachcombers out on the deck, he often went out on the bay on his Jet Ski or paddleboard. Sometimes Sarah came out very early, tying Hamlet up at the dock and going out on the bay with him. He had many chores during the day\u2014fixing things, cleaning things, buying things, taking delivery on things so the bar/deli could run smoothly. Evenings he served drinks and food\u2014deli food\u2014because the sunset was astonishing in its beauty and drew people to the beach and to his deck. And many evenings Sarah was with him, like this evening.</p><p>They\u2019d locked up the bar at about nine, gone upstairs to his room, shared a meal prepared by Carrie, made excellent love and cuddled in front of the fire\u2014a second-floor extension of the hearth he\u2019d had built in the bar\u2014and watched TV.</p><p>The principal people in his life had their issues\u2014Mac\u2019s ex had been around, disrupting his family life, and Gina\u2019s daughter had suffered some sort of emotional problems. Sarah was still troubled on and off about her future with the Coast Guard, except when he was holding her\u2014then she seemed to have no worries. But his little beach bar made a surprising amount of money and he loved it. All things considered, from Cooper\u2019s stand point, life was pretty stable.</p><p>And then the phone rang.</p><p>He looked first at the caller ID\u2014his parents were calling. Then he glanced at his watch\u2014it was 11:00 p.m., 1:00 a.m. in New Mexico. Trying to mask worry he felt given the time of night he answered the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoop,\u201d his father said. \u201cSorry about the time, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up, but it\u2019s the middle of the night there. What\u2019s going on, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got a call from a man named Spencer Lawson, Coop. He\u2019s married to Bridget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who he is,\u201d Cooper said. At one time Cooper had been engaged to Bridget. They parted over ten years ago. First they broke off their engagement because they just weren\u2019t on the same page with all that meant. Then they ended it completely when Bridget stopped seeing him because she\u2019d met someone else, someone she ultimately married. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left a number, said it was urgent that he get in touch with you. I told him I\u2019d call you, but I wouldn\u2019t give him your number.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Cooper had a sinking feeling in his gut. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cooper. Apparently she\u2019s sick or something. I tried to get the details out of him but he said he\u2019d only discuss it with you. I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s the best I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me his number.\u201d</p><p>After Hank Senior reeled off the digits, he added, \u201cHe said to call any time of day, don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s late or early\u2014he\u2019d be there. And, Coop? Let me know what this is all about, will you?\u201d</p><p>He let go a dry laugh. \u201cIf it\u2019s not too embarrassing,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>He hung up and stared at the number. Then he went to his sofa to sit beside Sarah. \u201cVery strange,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I was engaged twice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time was to Bridget Cunningham. We dated for about six months, got engaged, couldn\u2019t agree on anything, broke up pretty soon after. I was doing contract flying for a security company that was outsourced by the Army\u2014I was away a lot. Out of the country most of the time. After breaking up, we were on and off for a while. We were young\u2014we knew pretty quick it wasn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat went wrong, Cooper?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t seem to want the same things. She expected me to find a more stable job, for one thing, so I\u2019d be around all the time and stability was not exactly my middle name. It wasn\u2019t too long before she told me there was someone else, but you know me\u2014I mean the younger me. I didn\u2019t take her too seriously. I hadn\u2019t talked to her for a long time\u2014months\u2014and called her when I was back in the States. She told me she was married. To this guy,\u201d he said, showing her the phone number.</p><p>She ran a finger around his ear. \u201cDid she break your heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI got over that pretty quick. I haven\u2019t even thought about her in a long time. Now her husband needs me to call him\u2014says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, and I see by the area code, they\u2019re still in Texas. He did tell my dad not to worry about the time. Maybe tomorrow...\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cMen and women are so different. Aren\u2019t you curious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be curious until tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cListen, if you don\u2019t want to call him while I\u2019m here, I was planning to go home, anyway,\u201d she said.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cWell, I never thought I\u2019d say this, especially to a woman, but I don\u2019t have any secrets from you.\u201d He punched in the numbers. The call was answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cStand by,\u201d Spencer said rather than \u201chello.\u201d Cooper could hear some moving around; he heard a door close. Then came the hello in a stronger voice.</p><p>\u201cSpencer Lawson?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked my father to forward a message to me? You wanted me to call?\u201d</p><p>Cooper heard him take a deep breath. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to ease you into this, Cooper. Bridget wants to see you. She\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>He sat up straighter. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancer. She\u2019s been fighting it like a trouper, but the days of the fight are over. We suspended chemo, hospice is here, her time is short. And she really needs to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s important. You need money for travel? For time away from work? Whatever it takes, I\u2019ll cover it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpencer, come on\u2014we don\u2019t have any unfinished business. That was all a long time ago. She told me she was happy with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWe had some very good years,\u201d he said. Cooper could hear the emotion in his voice. \u201cThis disease has been hell. Cooper, you have to come. She\u2019s hanging on and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll let go until she sees you. Please. She\u2019s bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you tell me why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has some things to say to you,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wants to talk to you before she dies. And she doesn\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cShe\u2019s not even forty! This isn\u2019t about amends or anything, is it? Because we\u2019re square, me and Bridget. It wasn\u2019t meant to be, all right? There\u2019s nothing to work out\u2014I could tell her that on the phone if it would make things easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, I want her to have whatever she asks for. We\u2019re staying in her parents\u2019 house in San Antonio. All she wants is to talk to you. It might take a couple of hours, that\u2019s all. Where are you? Are you in a foreign country? Can you come, even if it\u2019s a quick trip? I\u2019ll pay the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t like mysteries and secrets, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel ya, pal. We\u2019ve been living with cancer for almost three years now. Talk about mysteries and secrets. I\u2019ll text you the address. You have my cell phone number\u2014let me know when you can come. Hurry, please. And, Cooper? Bring a suit.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper just sat and looked at his phone. He hung his head. He felt Sarah\u2019s hand on his back, gently soothing. He turned to look at her. \u201cShe\u2019s dying. Apparently soon. She wants to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cooper,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cMaybe she wants to clear her conscience about your romantic falling out or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, apparently she thinks she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have this place to run,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help. Rawley can open, I\u2019ll come over after work. I have the weekend off. I\u2019ll let Landon hang out and help\u2014he\u2019ll love that. It\u2019ll be okay. But I can\u2019t be here in the morning to explain things to Rawley\u2014I\u2019m flying tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper gave a half smile and went through his phone directory. He hit the call button.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI bought him a phone. Now let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll answer it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d came Rawley\u2019s gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t throw it in the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear your TV,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t mean I\u2019m awake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, sorry about the time. I just got a call from someone\u2014an old friend is real sick. I have to go pay a visit. I\u2019ll be gone a couple of days and Sarah says she can help out. Can you handle things around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I usually?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think I contribute here and there,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cJust go do it,\u201d Rawley said.</p><p>\u201cListen, if there are complications or schedule problems, just hang a sign on the door\u2014closed for family emergency. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle it,\u201d Rawley said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. Hey, and you kept the phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was inconvenient. But I got games, books and music on this phone. Decent contraption.\u201d And he hung up.</p><p>It was only minutes after Cooper called Rawley that Sarah left, promising to be there to cover for him the next evening. She took the Razor across the beach, going slowly to avoid any people who might be walking or sitting on the sand. When she was leaving him, he was understandably quiet. Melancholy.</p><p>Timing was an interesting phenomenon. She had just been thinking that it was time to let Cooper in on her secret, to talk to him about her pending assignment. But she hadn\u2019t, and then the phone call came. It was funny that Cooper had been anxious to clear the air about any lingering ties she might feel toward her ex-husband, Derek, but she had never considered that there might be relationships in his past that hadn\u2019t been fully dealt with. This woman, this dying woman...was this something that haunted him? Had he, like Sarah, harbored a feeling of failure, of grief? And he had told her, there had been two engagements....</p><p>There were more things to talk about than just her past marriage.</p><p>Sarah didn\u2019t fear having a rebound lover in Cooper, but she did fear leaving her career, putting all her eggs in his basket and then learning that despite all he said, he was the one who couldn\u2019t commit, couldn\u2019t make it last. Where would that leave her?</p><p>Suddenly her options shrank yet again. She tried to envision Cooper\u2019s reaction to her dilemma. He would tell her not to worry, to stay here with him, to enjoy the town, the beach, the business and Landon\u2019s senior year at Thunder Point High. And what if that didn\u2019t work out the way he expected it to, as his two previous attempts had not? And if she had separated from her Coast Guard career and found herself a year later not only alone, but also unable to support herself? Unable to help Landon with college?</p><p>Yes, Cooper had always seemed the transparent one while Sarah thought of herself as complicated. Yet wasn\u2019t it really the other way around? He\u2019d been a loner, a wanderer and had twice tried to settle down with one woman. And had failed both times. Had there been more than two women he\u2019d promised to love forever?</p><p>From the first time since she\u2019d met him, since she\u2019d fallen in love with him, she realized she was probably the better relationship risk. The truth of her situation was not exaggerated\u2014the demise of her short marriage was not her failing. Her ex-husband was a serial cheater and she should have known, but turned a blind eye because she wanted a family life so much.</p><p>She would never do that again. And she would never close her eyes to reality again, either.</p><p>That woman in Texas, that woman who was dying and wanted to see him one last time. There was obviously some unfinished business there, something he had never thought to mention to her.</p><p>Sarah had a feeling she wasn\u2019t going to sleep soundly tonight....</p><p>There were a lot of beautiful cities in Texas, and San Antonio was definitely one of them. Cooper flew into San Antonio, which required two plane changes from Eugene. He put the address Spencer had given him into the GPS on the rental car and drove through the lush rolling hills to the suburb where Bridget\u2019s parents lived. He\u2019d been to their house before, but he\u2019d never have been able to find it on his own this many years later. He retired his torn jeans, T-shirt, leather jacket and boots and wore a white dress shirt, khakis and suede shoes. He felt as if he was going for a job interview.</p><p>He\u2019d met Bridge when he was about twenty-five. Or was that twenty-six? He was at a lake party and, in typical Cooper fashion, he picked out the prettiest girl in sight. Cooper liked beach or lake parties because the girls didn\u2019t wear much. Bridge was blonde, stacked, green-eyed and sexy as all hell.</p><p>He was working for a civilian contractor who supplied helicopters to UN missions and private sectors abroad. They were \u201cwet lease\u201d copters, which meant they came with a crew. He had a high-level security clearance and when he was sent out on a mission, it could be for weeks at a time. At that time he was living near Fort Sam Houston because he liked the San Antonio area. He\u2019d always loved the river walk, the Alamo, in fact the whole city was something special.</p><p>He asked Bridget out. He took her home from the party. And he fell hard and fast. So did she, as far as he could tell. Until he got another assignment a couple of weeks later they spent every minute together at her apartment. For a while it worked. She even asked him if they could get married and he said yes. Why not?</p><p>He bought her a ring on one of his trips home and she loved it. She took him to meet the family\u2014a brother and a sister, parents, grandparents. And then she said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to get married, you have to find something to do for work that doesn\u2019t take you away six months of the year\u2014especially away to scary places you can\u2019t talk about.\u201d</p><p>And then the arguing commenced. He was young; he wasn\u2019t ready to have lead in his shoes, and to put down roots. He was also selfish\u2014he wanted it all. He was still hooked on adventure, but he didn\u2019t want to give up a woman like Bridget. He thought he might be ready for a nice suburban life in a few years. Eventually he came back from a trip to Somalia and she informed him, this just wouldn\u2019t work for her. She wanted a more stable family life. She was the first woman to tell him he had trouble with commitment, with real intimacy. She gave him back the ring, but they got together a few more times when he wasn\u2019t traveling.</p><p>In fact, that was the crux of it\u2014they couldn\u2019t agree on anything out of bed. In the sack, everything worked. All he wanted was for Bridget to put up with his job, his traveling, welcome him home like the hot mama she was. All she wanted was someone she could depend on all the time. And it made her furious that she couldn\u2019t resist him.</p><p>It made him feel just fine, however.</p><p>Eventually, maybe six or eight months after the engagement was off and the back-and-forth had gone on too long she said she\u2019d met someone. He remembered, he tried to cajole her into once more for old time\u2019s sake and she told him he was a pig.</p><p>Well, she was probably right. He was less piggish these days. He was a lot more conscious of the feelings of others. It was something he assumed came with maturity. He hoped so, anyway.</p><p>A few minutes later Cooper pulled up to the well-groomed, large ranch-style home. It was painted light green with white shutters and a dark green front door\u2014the kind of house Bridge had wanted to live in, to raise a family in. There were a lot of cars and he felt his heart clutch. He hoped she hadn\u2019t died. He hoped she wasn\u2019t too near death to say whatever it was she had to say. He hadn\u2019t been a very good boyfriend or fianc\u00e9; maybe she just wanted to ream him out one more time before she crossed over. Who was he to deny her that pleasure?</p><p>He knocked on the front door. He was afraid to ring the bell\u2014what if there was grieving. Mrs. Cunningham answered and God bless her, she had aged far more than ten years. Cooper couldn\u2019t even imagine losing a family member like this\u2014dying by inches. He put out his hand. \u201cMrs. Cunningham, do you remember me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Coop. Thank you for coming. I realize it\u2019s a lot to ask of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs that him?\u201d he heard someone ask. Then the man who must be Spencer came into the foyer. \u201cCooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, putting out his hand again. \u201cSpencer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Cooper. Can I get you a drink or something?\u201d</p><p>In fact, Spencer looked as if he could use a drink. So did Mrs. Cunningham.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. How\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hanging in there. Hospice does a good job of keeping her comfortable. I don\u2019t know how to prepare you, Cooper\u2014she\u2019s not the same girl you dated. Her appearance is\u2014\u201d Then he ran a hand around his sweaty neck. \u201cWe converted the sun porch into a hospital room so she could be here with the family. Our house is smaller and less accessible\u2014two-story and all. I\u2019m sure you want to get on with this. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>In fact, Cooper didn\u2019t want to get on with it. He wanted to bolt. But that ship had sailed and here he was. He walked through a family room. Mr. Cunningham and a couple of younger men were watching TV but the volume was turned low. There were three kids and a teenager playing a board game at the dining room table and two women puttered around the kitchen, whispering. The house had a pall of death over it\u2014all subdued and respectfully quiet.</p><p>He had a sudden and profound understanding of wounded animals sneaking off into the forest to die alone and without an audience. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>The room was large and while the blinds were partially closed, he could see that if opened, it would be a bright and sunny room. It was dominated by a hospital bed, the back raised and the woman in the bed was not his Bridget. This woman looked a hundred years old. She had only yellow fuzz on her head and she was slumped over, her bony arms appearing spidery, her fingers too long. She had an IV hooked up, and a woman who must be a nurse busied herself keeping Bridget comfortable. The accoutrements of illness were present\u2014wheelchair, bedside table holding a couple of glasses of liquid, straws, basin, towels, bedpan. There was a cot beside the bed\u2014someone slept there, close by her side.</p><p>Spencer leaned over her, kissed her forehead and said, \u201cHoney, he\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>Bridget roused slowly. \u201cCooper?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Spencer stroked her naked head and she opened her eyes. They were no longer that bright, fiery green but pale and weak. She tried to sit up in the bed, but Spencer wouldn\u2019t allow her struggle. With strong hands under her armpits, he pulled her up. The nurse left immediately and Spencer backed away from the bed. Bridget patted the bed beside her, indicating Cooper should sit down and Cooper, feeling like the biggest coward alive, hesitated.</p><p>\u201cCooper, I\u2019m sorry for all the secrecy,\u201d she said, her voice much stronger than he expected. \u201cThis is my fault, but I swear to you, I didn\u2019t know. Less than six months ago I learned something you need to know about. We did a lot of tests of everyone in the family and extended family in search of a bone marrow donor\u2014I was too sick for my own bone marrow to be harvested. That was when we discovered something. Cooper, you have a son. My son. Spencer and I always assumed he was ours, but the testing showed... Cooper, I\u2019m sorry. I really didn\u2019t think it was possible.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was stunned. He couldn\u2019t speak. She must be mistaken, surely. He said nothing because in his head he knew these must be the delusional ramblings of a very sick woman.</p><p>\u201cI started seeing Spencer a few months after we ended our engagement but you and I, we always had one last goodbye, didn\u2019t we. We just discovered this and it seemed logical to wait until later, after Austin was older.... But then I decided at the last minute, I couldn\u2019t leave this to them.\u201d She made a sound that was like a chuckle. \u201cLast-minute. That\u2019s putting it mildly. Austin is ten years old and very smart and we explained it to him. I wanted to be the one to tell you. And to plead with you\u2014know him if you want to, but please don\u2019t take him away from his father.\u201d</p> <p>Take him away? Cooper thought. I\u2019m not sure I even want to have a kid. Finally, fighting through the shock, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. There\u2019s no other possibility. But you should have tests\u2014DNA. We\u2019ll cover the costs, of course. I just can\u2019t move on unless my conscience is clear. I didn\u2019t know. I really didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t suspect, after we were together...?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhen I first realized I was pregnant, you\u2019d been gone for a month. Austin was born two weeks early and weighed seven pounds. Possibly he was actually two weeks late, instead. That aside, he doesn\u2019t have Spencer\u2019s DNA. And there is no other possibility.\u201d She reached for Cooper\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I never would have kept something like that from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe knows. We told him Spencer is his father of the heart, but he has someone else\u2019s genes. You and Spencer will have to work things out.\u201d She coughed weakly. \u201cPlease consider their relationship. I\u2019m out of time, Cooper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, sweetheart,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done your part. I\u2019m going to get Cooper here a drink and send Mary Ann back in here to give you something. Sleep a little if you can. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said to her husband.</p><p>But Cooper didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cCooper?\u201d Spencer said. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Cooper followed numbly. He passed the kids at the dining room table\u2014two of them were boys in the right age group and he wondered if one of them was his biological son. Spencer led him into a study and closed them in.</p><p>\u201cMary Ann is going to give her a big load of morphine,\u201d he said, going directly to a small wet bar. \u201cShe\u2019s been holding off today, wanting to be alert when you got here. Scotch? Bourbon? Beer? Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Spencer poured two scotches and handed him one.</p> <p>\u201cAustin?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>Spencer laughed. \u201cI\u2019m from Missouri and was down here for a teaching job. I always expected it to be temporary, but it turned out to be good for me. Bridget and I escaped to Austin sometimes. It\u2019s a pretty town. I always thought she got pregnant there, but...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSorry you were blindsided, Cooper. She wanted to be the one to tell you. She didn\u2019t say so, but I suspect she hoped that her appearance would influence you into letting Austin stay with me, live with me. It\u2019s what he wants, but he\u2019s only ten.\u201d</p><p>Cooper took a sip of his drink and just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking this pretty well....\u201d</p><p>Spencer laughed and shook his head. \u201cYeah, right. Well, I didn\u2019t always take it real well. It took a lot of discussion, a lot of figuring the dates, a lot of jealousy on my part. Try to imagine finding out your son isn\u2019t your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t cheat, Spencer. She told me she\u2019d met someone\u2014she\u2019d just started seeing you. She hoped it would work out better than it had with me. I didn\u2019t even take it seriously. I figured eventually we\u2019d end up together, but the next time I got back to the States, she was getting married. I didn\u2019t know about the baby. She never said anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, Cooper. I was disappointed. Pissed. But I\u2019ve had six months to think about things. Six really tough months\u2014Bridget has been so sick. All I want is to go easy on Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I punish a kid by doing something like taking him away from the only father he knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. That\u2019ll give everyone some peace of mind, his grandparents being here, as well. Especially Bridge\u2014she needs reassurance. And...\u201d He turned away for a second, took a sip of his drink before turning back. \u201cI can\u2019t even think about losing them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know him,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI mean, once we\u2019re sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sure, but I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there more? Kids?\u201d</p><p>Spencer shook his head. \u201cWe tried. We were just starting some fertility workups. That\u2019s how we found out Bridget was sick. We did chemo instead. We thought we were beating the son of a bitch a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of cancer is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarted as colon cancer, but it\u2019s just about everywhere now. Really, Bridget has been on borrowed time for a while. I\u2019m sorry about this, Cooper. This is no way to find out.\u201d</p><p>He just threw back his drink. He believed her\u2014that she didn\u2019t know. And how could he complain in the face of what these people were going through?</p><p>\u201cWould you like to meet him?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>Cooper just nodded. \u201cWhat do I say to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want. Maybe, \u2018Nice to meet you?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we wait until there\u2019s a test to confirm this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get that done, too. We have the supplies\u2014a kit. You could get by with a swab. We\u2019ll send it in for you. It could be as long as six weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBridget isn\u2019t going to make it six weeks, is she?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to make it six days,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cBut she knows how this is going to come out, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I say goodbye?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>Spencer smiled. \u201cI think that would be nice. Let\u2019s go do that before morphine takes over.\u201d As they were leaving the study, Spencer put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a good sport, Cooper. I can\u2019t imagine something like this complicating my life right now.\u201d</p><p>The guy\u2019s going through cancer, losing his wife, and Cooper is a good sport? He was suddenly ashamed. When he got back to Bridget, he could see at once that some of the tension of pain had left her.</p><p>Cooper sat down on the edge of the bed and lifted her hand into his. \u201cBridge,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d She nodded weakly. \u201cBridget, I know I wasn\u2019t a very good boyfriend or fianc\u00e9.\u201d She gave a tiny smile and squeezed his hand. \u201cBut I want you to know something\u2014that time we were together. That was good. I\u2019m sorry it got a little messy, but no regrets from my end. And don\u2019t worry about Austin. I\u2019m not going to interfere in his life. He\u2019ll be okay, Bridge. His needs will come first.\u201d He leaned forward and kissed her forehead. \u201cRest easy.\u201d</p><p>Before he broke down and cried like a girl, he stood up and left the room. He was barely out the door when, standing right in front of him was a handsome little boy. Kind of small for ten, just like Cooper had been.</p><p>\u201cYou him?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou my real dad?\u201d</p><p>Cooper smiled. \u201cNot exactly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of your alternate dad.\u201d Then he ruffled the boy\u2019s hair. \u201cYou have a pretty good dad on stage right now\u2014I wouldn\u2019t want to get in the way of that. But if you need me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a teacher,\u201d Austin said. \u201cAnd a coach, too. He\u2019s good with homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent reason to keep him around,\u201d Cooper said. He looked up. All eyes were on him. Parents, grandparents, siblings, kids.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cooper,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThis will take two seconds, then you can do whatever you want. Stay, go, whatever.\u201d</p><p>He noticed Spencer had a small box in his hand\u2014the kit.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just step back in the study.\u201d</p><p>Spencer gave the inside of his cheek a wipe with a swab, slipped it in a sterile tube and closed the envelope around it.</p><p>\u201cDo you sleep on that cot by the bed?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSometimes she\u2019s needs to be held. Sometimes just the opposite. I\u2019m on a leave from work. I try to be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she found you, Spencer,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019m glad they both did.\u201d</p><p>Cooper got himself a hotel room not too far from the Cunningham household. He went out for some takeout, a bottle of single malt, a bucket of ice and after eating something he made himself a stiff drink and called Sarah. He talked to her for an hour and a half without telling her about Austin. He lied instead\u2014he said that Bridget wanted to talk about their past, make sure he was okay with everything and say goodbye. He had given this decision about five minutes of thought first, deciding that if the DNA test came back pointing to him, that was soon enough to explain. He did say that it made him very sad, that he couldn\u2019t imagine going through something like that. And it was Sarah who had many questions about his relationship with Bridget, how they got along, what their relationship was like before they broke up and he found that reminiscing actually seemed to help. It was late and he might\u2019ve been a little drunk when he fell asleep. His cell phone woke him and the clock said 2:00 a.m.</p><p>\u201cSorry about the time,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cBridget is no longer with us. I thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout four hours ago. It takes a long time to have a body picked up, even when you\u2019re expecting it and all the arrangements are in place. Then there was her mom and Austin....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing? Austin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s finally asleep. I think he\u2019ll be all right. We\u2019re all just glad she can rest now. Rest without pain. She\u2019ll be cremated and we\u2019ll have a service on Monday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI got it, Cooper. If you\u2019re still in the area, you\u2019re welcome to attend. And I understand completely if you\u2019d rather not. It\u2019s entirely up to you. Service at St. Bethel on Anniversary Avenue and at 2:00 p.m. an open house at the Cunninghams\u2019. And of course, I\u2019ll have the test results forwarded to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. And Spencer, I\u2019m sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had some good years,\u201d he said. And then he said goodbye.</p><p>Cooper knocked around for three days. He drove to Ft. Hood and although he wasn\u2019t allowed on the post, he did visit some of his old stomping grounds\u2014bars and restaurants he\u2019d frequented when he was there. He went to the San Antonio River Walk and the Alamo, wishing Sarah was with him. It was no surprise that he remembered being on the walk with Bridget, eating at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, drinking beer or a latte at a small table on the walk, watching people and boats pass by.</p><p>He booked a flight back to Eugene for Tuesday morning, but he didn\u2019t go to the service on Monday. The memorial was for family and close friends; he didn\u2019t want to make anyone uncomfortable. Instead, he pressed his suit and dress shirt and went to the Cunningham house at about two-thirty.</p><p>There were cars parked all the way down the street and he caught sight of a couple entering the house, carrying what appeared to be a covered dish. Sitting on the front step with a baseball and glove was Austin, looking real down in the dumps. He went to the boy, sat down beside him and asked, \u201cHard day, huh?\u201d</p> <p>The boy shrugged. \u201cIt sure ain\u2019t no fun in there.\u201d He looked up. \u201cI\u2019m waitin\u2019 for my dad. I mean, my other dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s kind of busy today.\u201d</p><p>Austin looked up at Cooper and identical brown eyes connected. \u201cDid you ever wish\u2019t you married my mom?\u201d</p><p>Cooper was stunned by the question, then wondered why he\u2019d been surprised. Chances were good there would be lots of questions like that. He decided on honesty. \u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took me a long time to see that Spencer was the better man for her. He was ready to settle down, like your mom was. And I was sorry I wasn\u2019t ready for that kind of responsibility. I might\u2019ve lost out, but at least you didn\u2019t, Austin. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom said you\u2019re a good guy, too.\u201d</p><p>Cooper shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m better now than I was ten years ago. Older. Smarter a little bit. Want me to throw that ball around with you?\u201d he asked, nodding at the ball.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re all dressed up for church.\u201d</p><p>Cooper took off his jacket, tossed it on a bush and rolled up his sleeves. \u201cI can adjust.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d Austin jumped up and ran to the other side of the lawn, throwing Cooper the ball. \u201cWere you mad when my mom told you? About me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Cooper said, throwing it back. \u201cBest news I had all day. All month.\u201d</p><p>Austin grinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t live around here,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNo, I live in Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad says we need to get to know each other. How we gonna do that?\u201d he asked, throwing again.</p><p>\u201cWell, we can talk on the phone. Maybe we can Skype. I can visit sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I visit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me, but we have to go slow. I think your dad is going to want to check me out, make sure I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re not a perv.\u201d</p><p>Cooper smiled, thinking of Landon. \u201cI have friends you\u2019re going to like. My girlfriend\u2019s brother is sixteen, a quarterback, plays some killer football. My girlfriend is a Coast Guard search-and-rescue pilot.\u201d</p><p>That stopped Austin. \u201cShe is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe flies a helicopter. Oh, I live on the ocean. I have a Jet Ski.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Austin said, frozen for a moment.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParents,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cNo wife or ex-wife or kids. Sisters and their kids. And Sarah, my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould they be my family, then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Then he grinned. \u201cIf your dad decides I\u2019m not a perv.\u201d</p><p>That made him laugh. \u201cYour sisters would be my aunts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of those,\u201d he said with a sour face.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d Cooper agreed.</p><p>A man cleared his throat. Spencer was leaning against the side of the house, watching them, a half smile on his face. His sleeves were also rolled up; his tie was loosened.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cLong enough to hear the Jet Ski bribery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since I\u2019m not good at homework, I had to have something in the plus column. I also have a Rhino and a Harley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Harley? Aw, man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty underhanded,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI have a canoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad! A Harley!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard, Austin. Well, I guess if you have to have two dads, at least one of \u2019em has a Harley.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Ashley ended up staying in the hospital for almost a week. Five days, which was three longer than she had planned. The extended stay was largely to regulate her very mild anti-anxiety medication as well as to give her the benefit of inpatient group therapy. The doctor decided she wasn\u2019t suffering from clinical depression, but that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t all worked up about the events in her life. The kids in her group were sympathetic and an odd thing happened\u2014she found out that lots of outcasts had been harassed in this way, through texts, social media, bullied by whatever means available. Before now, Ashley had never considered herself an outcast! The fact that she was considered this way only by Downy and his girlfriend didn\u2019t make it any easier to bear. It was shocking and revealed an entire universe to her that she\u2019d never thought herself vulnerable to.</p><p>Going back to school was scary, even though her mother got her a new cell phone with a secret number and promised to rescue her immediately if there was any trouble. And even though Eve had her own issues with her mother\u2019s surprise return, she was still standing beside Ashley\u2019s locker, ready to be an escort and loyal friend. Landon was with her, of course. They\u2019d brave being late to their classes just to make sure Ashley didn\u2019t have any trouble in the halls.</p><p>To her surprise, Frank Downy appeared after third period one day. \u201cI\u2019ll get you to class whenever I can\u2014we have a couple together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, you don\u2019t have to,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I want to? You shouldn\u2019t have had to put up with any shit because of Downy. Sometimes I just can\u2019t believe him....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything bad about your brother,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Just in case you wonder whose side I\u2019m on, wonder no more. He\u2019s a dick and everyone but Mom is real pissed off at him for what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>At the same time he was talking to her, Ashley wondered when Frank\u2019s complexion had cleared up. When did he start to shave? In fact, hadn\u2019t he been shorter than her? When did all this happen? Because she had known him since they were about five, too.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, grabbing her elbow in a gentle escort. \u201cHistory is next for us.\u201d</p><p>Then she realized he wasn\u2019t wearing his glasses. He\u2019d always worn thick glasses, which had given him such a bookwormish look. She stopped suddenly and looked at his face. \u201cFrank, did you have LASIK surgery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContacts,\u201d he said. He looked down at her. \u201cI\u2019ve had \u2019em about a year.\u201d</p><p>She was completely embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Frank. I didn\u2019t realize...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had other things to think about,\u201d he said, pulling her along to class.</p><p>Indeed. She\u2019d thought of no one but Downy for longer than she could remember. She was confident it hadn\u2019t kept her from being a good friend to Eve, but there was probably a lot going on in school that she had been too distracted to notice.</p><p>They were almost to class when some boy she didn\u2019t even know very well said, \u201cHey, Ash, nice tits!\u201d</p><p>In a flash, Frank was on him like a hound and shoved him against the lockers. Frank\u2019s forearm pushed against the kid\u2019s neck. Frank had muscles on his arms. From the look on the kid\u2019s face, this was a surprise maneuver. \u201cApologize,\u201d Frank ordered.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more kidding,\u201d Frank warned, releasing him.</p><p>Ashley was rooted to her spot, stunned. When had Frank developed shoulders?</p><p>\u201cUm...thanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Let\u2019s go,\u201d he said, steering her down the hall, around the corner to their class.</p><p>When she went to her group therapy later that week, she briefly wondered if all teenage support groups looked the same. Someone was having problems with their parents, there was a substance abuse in someone\u2019s situation, another kept getting in trouble in and out of school and was in danger of being expelled, one was being bullied, another girl\u2019s boyfriend dumped her, rather cruelly. Mostly it was social issues these kids couldn\u2019t cope with any better than she had. But no one in her current outpatient group had spent time in the hospital and they were all anxious to hear everything.</p><p>The one thing she wanted to tell them that seemed even more important was what she discovered when she went back to school. The fact that Downy\u2019s younger brother, so gentlemanly and protective, had been completely invisible to her before her breakdown, and suddenly she saw a new Frank. Somewhere in the past year or two he\u2019d grown up, grown tall and strong. \u201cIf I stop to think about it, Frank has always been a good friend. I\u2019ve had to call him about homework and he talks me through it. He\u2019s so patient and never gets tired of explaining things\u2014he\u2019s nice to everyone. He used to get picked on, but Downy was a great bodyguard so people left him alone. But he\u2019s not one of the jocks\u2014he\u2019s going to be our valedictorian, everyone knows it. He\u2019s the smartest guy in our class. Maybe in the county.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he a nerd?\u201d someone asked. In fact, that was Bradley, who was a thick-glasses nerd.</p><p>\u201cI used to think so, but he\u2019s all grown up now and I think maybe he\u2019s a Bill Gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill Gates is a nerd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but nerd or not, any girl would date Bill Gates because of his huge brain. And Frank is confident. He doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks of him\u2014they\u2019ll all eventually ask him for help on their calculus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s the asshole\u2019s brother!\u201d</p><p>As if she needed reminding. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure he loves his brother, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be a big fan of Downy right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thing is\u2014I still cry. I\u2019m not going to make a fool of myself by calling Downy and I think he\u2019s a total jerk, but if he came crawling back all sweet and sorry, I\u2019d probably give him another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask a question?\u201d Burt, Simone Ross\u2019s associate and the group leader, asked. Burt was a lot younger than Simone, a man in his late twenties or early thirties. Talk about a nerd. He was kind of on the homely side, very thin with heavy dark brows. Ichabod Crane-ish. Aside from keeping them on track and maybe asking a question or two to get them started, he didn\u2019t say much. Sometimes he took notes, but she saw the page of his steno pad once and it was filled with doodles. That gave Ashley more peace of mind\u2014at least he wasn\u2019t writing \u201cthis one is crazy as a loon.\u201d Burt was growing on her. In the same way she finally noticed Frank, she was starting to see handsomeness in kindness and intelligence.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cIf your best friend\u2019s boyfriend did to her what was done to you, would you advise her to take him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I know it\u2019s not smart,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t, but it\u2019s just a fact.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you were his steady girl, he never acted like that, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither did you,\u201d Burt said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a nice person who can think about the feelings of others. Is it possible you want the Downy you once knew to come back? But not the Downy you know now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he came back now, would you worry every time he didn\u2019t take a call or answer a text?\u201d</p> <p>She looked down. \u201cIt\u2019s just that what he did still hurts so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. The pain can feel unbearable and I\u2019m so sorry, Ashley. I say this a lot in our teen groups, but I\u2019ll say it again, anyway. This time in life especially, you\u2019re designed to fall in love. It\u2019s part of your developmental cycle. It\u2019s emotions and hormones and a struggle to create an independent adult life for yourself\u2014one that meets all your needs. Also, this process of falling in and out of love, sometimes very painfully, helps you to identify the kind of life partner you fit with best. Some people never do, I\u2019m sorry to say. Some people will be unsuccessful at relationships with the right people. In fact, some people are inexplicably drawn to people who will hurt them. But others will learn valuable lessons and graduate to positive, long-term relationships with people who won\u2019t let them down or betray them. I\u2019m not saying perfect relationships\u2014I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no such thing. I\u2019m saying positive, growing, healthy relationships that can get back on track after something derails them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt\u2019s a process that\u2019s all about developing maturity and wisdom. And, Ashley, I\u2019m very sorry that it hurts every time it doesn\u2019t go well. Very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you do that? Get your heart broken?\u201d she asked, eying his wedding band.</p><p>Burt, not a member of the group but a facilitator, didn\u2019t usually answer questions, especially about himself. But he smiled and said, \u201cAt least a dozen times.\u201d</p><p>She thought he was wonderful. Tears gathered in her eyes. \u201cThen I probably have eleven to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey won\u2019t always be as dramatic and awful as this was. It depends entirely on the criteria you establish for yourself. I suspect that a few years from now you\u2019ll go out on a date or two and immediately see something in a potential boyfriend that you weren\u2019t able to see at sixteen. And the red flag will wave before your eyes and you\u2019ll say, \u2018No thank you. I deserve better than that.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you, but I need something today,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWho has something to say that might help Ashley today?\u201d Burt asked the group.</p><p>\u201cProtect yourself from people who have the habit of being mean,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cTake a long break from boyfriends until you get past this and can at least understand it,\u201d said someone else.</p><p>\u201cTry to believe the next time will feel better. You don\u2019t have to think this was the first and last time you\u2019ll ever like someone that much.\u201d</p><p>She listened to a number of suggestions from her group. And as usual, when she left that afternoon, she felt so much better.</p><p>Mac\u2019s lawyer, Sidney Mikowski, met with him to discuss a call he\u2019d recently had from Cee Jay\u2019s attorney. Briefly, he explained that she wanted to see her children. She wasn\u2019t asking for any custody or support, just a visit. Sidney informed Mac that it would look good for him to be friendly and cooperative, in the event something legal came along down the road. \u201cWhat she\u2019s asking is reasonable. She doesn\u2019t have a police record or any legal entanglements. It\u2019s just a supervised visit she\u2019s asking for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf she wants visitation, I want child support,\u201d Mac said, feeling surly. \u201cI\u2019ve raised them entirely on my own for ten years. It hasn\u2019t been easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou signed off on support,\u201d Sidney reminded him. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear\u2014you\u2019re not asking to change the settlement at this time. I would advise that you give her an hour of supervised time with the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe signed off on visitation,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMac, reel in that temper. I understand the insult you feel, but her request is logical and rational. It\u2019s also legal\u2014she\u2019s not challenging their custody, just asking for a supervised visit. They\u2019re her children, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would we do this?\u201d he asked, remembering grudgingly that his kids also wanted to see her.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, but I suggest somewhere where you all have privacy, just in case it\u2019s emotional. My office or maybe your home? Oh, and she\u2019s not interested in seeing your aunt. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s bad blood there?\u201d</p><p>Mac laughed. \u201cOh, you could say that. Cee Jay didn\u2019t just leave me. I had to beg Aunt Lou for help. First I had to tell her that I got my teenage girlfriend pregnant, then I had to ask for her help when Cee Jay left me. Now that Lou is completely bonded with the kids, guess who\u2019s back? Lou might find it hard to be welcoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s cutting Lou out of the visit. What we don\u2019t need, Mac, and what will not cast the most positive and convincing light on your efforts to cooperate is a confrontation. Can you convince Lou to excuse herself for an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I can, but it\u2019ll cost me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have the meeting in your living room. I\u2019ll be there as I\u2019m sure her lawyer will be, too. Can you engage the services of an off-duty deputy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have to invite your ex-wife and her attorney to leave, I\u2019d rather you not play the bad guy. This is a supervised visit, off the books so to speak, to show your willingness to be cooperative and compassionate. I recommend it because your children should see their mother and because, if push comes to shove, you\u2019ve been the responsible party. In custody debates, that goes a long way.\u201d</p><p>The visit was set for Wednesday at six-thirty. Mac came home at five and found Lou dishing out pizza slices. The kids were at the table but even though it was their favorite dinner, they weren\u2019t scarfing it down. Ryan was taking small bites and Eve\u2019s was untouched.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be nervous about,\u201d he told them. \u201cI\u2019m sure your mother just wants to see you, find out how you\u2019ve been, that sort of thing. I\u2019d like you to have a nice visit. And I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we have to do this in front of people?\u201d Eve asked.</p><p>Mac had rejected the idea of a deputy on the scene\u2014two lawyers were more than enough of a crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s a legal issue, Eve, there\u2019s just no getting around that. Since your mother\u2019s lawyer will be with her, my lawyer will be present also. That way there shouldn\u2019t be any questions afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Aunt Lou can\u2019t be there, too?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately your mother and Aunt Lou don\u2019t exactly get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better this way,\u201d Lou said. \u201cWe\u2019ll avoid any silly disagreements if I\u2019m just not here. It\u2019s okay\u2014you can tell me all about it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still mad at her?\u201d Ryan wanted to know.</p><p>Lou took a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be and I\u2019m not going to act like I\u2019m mad, but I was angry that she left and didn\u2019t call to check on us. I\u2019m working on being forgiving, but I might be too old and mean.... But until I get to the forgiving part, I intend to act like I\u2019ve forgiven her. And hopefully she\u2019ll act the same way toward me. Just not tonight, apparently. Now eat some pizza.\u201d And with that, she took a big bite herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Eve said, leaving the table without permission.</p><p>\u201cEve,\u201d Mac began.</p><p>Lou held up her hand. \u201cLet it go. Understandably there\u2019s tension. The pizza will keep.\u201d</p><p>Mac had never, in his life, felt an hour and a half stretch interminably. At six he went to his room, showered and put on a fresh shirt. He even splashed a little aftershave on his cheeks. He yelled in the direction of the other bedrooms. \u201cFifteen minutes, kids.\u201d No one answered. He hoped he wouldn\u2019t have to pry them out of their rooms. He got himself a cup of coffee from the kitchen and went to the living room, where his three children were lined up on the couch. They were looking spit and polished even though they were all still wearing their jeans. And they were sitting very close together, Eve in the middle. \u201cHas Lou left?\u201d he asked.</p><p>They nodded in perfect sync and he couldn\u2019t help but laugh at them. \u201cIt\u2019s not an execution! It\u2019s your mother, finally come to visit and see how you are. Try to make this a happy occasion. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not planning to stay long so take this opportunity to ask her anything you\u2019ve wondered about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d Eve asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, honey, she said she\u2019s missed you and wants to make amends,\u201d Mac said. \u201cAll you have to do is be polite. Once she\u2019s gone, I\u2019ll warm up that pizza.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang and all three kids stiffened as if they had heard a gunshot. Mac put down his coffee on the side table. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s just Sidney, our lawyer.\u201d He opened the door to two beautiful, elegant, richly dressed women. Cee Jay\u2019s attorney was a knockout. She was a blonde, a stark contrast to Cee Jay\u2019s dark hair. But here they were, young and beautiful and sexy, looking as if they came from the same world, as if they belonged to the same tennis and golf club.</p><p>The lawyer put out her hand. \u201cHow do you do, Mr. McCain. I\u2019m Antoinette LeClair. Please call me Ann.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. She looked very familiar. \u201cHow do you do. You\u2019re a little early.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and looked at her watch. \u201cMy apologies. Mrs. McCain was, understandably, very anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d he asked, frowning. \u201cDo you practice around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been up here a time or two, but my office is in San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>He leaned a little closer and spoke quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s Deputy McCain. And it\u2019s not \u2018Mrs.\u2019 Cecilia Jayne and I have been divorced a long time and the kids haven\u2019t seen their mother in ten years. Don\u2019t be presumptuous.\u201d And he watched as Cee Jay bit her lip and turned teary eyes away. Sadly, he thought about how jaded he was. He just couldn\u2019t give her the benefit of the doubt. He felt sure her emotions were an act.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he said, standing aside.</p><p>Ann let Cee Jay enter ahead of her. She stepped into the living room, covered her mouth as tears ran down her cheeks and said, \u201cOh, my beautiful babies! Oh, my God! Look at you!\u201d</p><p>Mac winced visibly. This was going to be so confusing to them\u2014their mother gone for so long and then returning with all that gush!</p><p>Cee Jay sat in the chair that Mac usually occupied, his cup of coffee sitting next to her on the side table. Once again, she looked rich...and powerful. She had a large diamond ring on her right hand, a diamond bracelet on her left wrist, diamond stud earrings as big as peas in her ears. And her clothes were chic, no other way to describe her. Elegant. Sitting on the edge of Mac\u2019s old, worn recliner, the contrast couldn\u2019t have been greater. With impressive skill she implored her children, \u201cTell me everything. I want to hear what you\u2019re doing. I bet you\u2019re so smart in school.\u201d</p><p>They were clearly uncomfortable; so stiff and shocked and intimidated. It was a long moment before Ryan said, \u201cI play ball. Baseball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she said excitedly, swiping the tears from her cheeks. \u201cYour daddy played ball in high school!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cAnd football. With Pop Warner,\u201d he added in a quiet voice.</p><p>There was a knock at the door and Mac let Sidney in. \u201cEarly,\u201d Mac explained.</p> <p>Sidney gave a nod and merely stood inside the door as a witness. But what he was seeing was Cee Jay\u2019s passion for her children.</p><p>\u201cI take dance class,\u201d Dee Dee said, so softly she could barely be heard.</p><p>\u201cOh, I knew it! I used to dance! And what else do you do, my darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiano,\u201d she added. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Aunt Lou be here? She\u2019s the one who takes care of us. With Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I was a disappointment to your Aunt Lou,\u201d Cee Jay said smoothly, looking down, looking ashamed. \u201cWe were close once, but not anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Close? Mac thought. When was that?</p><p>\u201cEve, tell me about yourself,\u201d Cee Jay said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eve said. \u201cTell me about yourself. You look pretty good. Jewelry and everything. What kind of job do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um. Well, I\u2019ve been living in Los Angeles so I\u2019ve been doing some modeling, some work as an extra on movie sets, that sort of thing. Nothing very impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must pay very well,\u201d Eve said. Mac thought, That\u2019s my daughter\u2014already investigating. \u201cThe only other thing I want to know is why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy you got up one morning and decided to leave us. Without telling us you were going. Without saying goodbye. Without ever calling or sending a card or visiting.\u201d</p><p>Cee Jay looked shocked. \u201cEve, I\u2019m sure your dad told you about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell me. Why didn\u2019t you at least visit us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father asked me not to,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mac scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned and looked at him. \u201cYou served me with divorce papers that severed my custody and visitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know that, Cee Jay. Five years after you left, I filed for divorce and custody, and you signed off. They know. They\u2019ve always known that we hadn\u2019t had a conversation for ten years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then?\u201d Eve said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re very angry with me, Eve, but I came home to tell you about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Eve said. \u201cI want to know why!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve,\u201d Mac said in a warning tone.</p><p>Her voice was more compliant when she looked at him with pain in her eyes and said, \u201cThat\u2019s all I want from this, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Please, be polite.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at Cee Jay. \u201cI politely request that you tell me why. I don\u2019t want to talk about it, I just want to know.\u201d</p><p>Cee Jay sat a bit straighter and her mouth was not set in a happy line. Her lovely arched brows furrowed unhappily. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand, but I was very young. I had too many small children to care for without any help, without the love of a husband, without enough money to keep the house decent or enough food on the table. I broke, that\u2019s all. I broke and ran, afraid I was losing my mind. I\u2019m sorry. I know it was wrong, but I wasn\u2019t strong. And now I\u2019d like to reconnect and make up for all I missed.\u201d</p><p>Eve stood up. \u201cThank you.\u201d She walked toward her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cEve!\u201d Cee Jay stood. \u201cWon\u2019t you give me another chance?\u201d</p><p>With tears gathering in her eyes, Eve shook her head. Then she proceeded to her room.</p><p>\u201cCan I be excused?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Dee Dee added.</p><p>Mac nodded, knowing they were going to go hide or at least lay low. He was going to have so much to explain to them, damage to try to repair.</p><p>Cee Jay turned blazing blue eyes on him. \u201cWhat have you done to them?\u201d she snapped. \u201cThey hate me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit, I\u2019m surprised,\u201d Mac said, running a big hand down over his jaw. \u201cI knew Eve was angry, but I didn\u2019t realize... Look, Cee Jay, Ryan and Dee Dee were very young when you disappeared, and they don\u2019t remember the day you left. But Eve remembers every detail. I had to get her in counseling\u2014she was a wreck. But you have to be realistic\u2014it\u2019s not as though they didn\u2019t notice their mother wasn\u2019t here or that you didn\u2019t call or write or visit. I didn\u2019t have to point that out to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou poisoned them against me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said on a laugh. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ever think of calling, or ever sending a birthday or Christmas card? Did it never occur to you that not visiting once in ten years would do the job of making them angry with you? You think they needed input from me? Oh, Cee Jay, how delusional can you possibly be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard! You\u2019re happy they reject me!\u201d</p><p>He took a threatening step toward her. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to spend the better part of the night, maybe the next several days, trying to convince my daughter your abandonment was not her fault, that it was no one\u2019s fault. I might be headed for more counseling, which is tough on a deputy\u2019s salary.\u201d Then he stopped, looked her over and said, \u201cModeling? Movie work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done talking to you,\u201d she said, turning to leave.</p><p>Mac looked at her attorney, lifting his eyebrows in question. She gave a little shrug. \u201cRight now Mrs. McCain\u2019s sole job is trying to reunite with her family.\u201d</p><p>Mac\u2019s expression was deadpan. \u201cIt\u2019s not Mrs.,\u201d he said for the second time.</p><p>Cee Jay was out the door, down the walk and in her car quickly, her attorney following. Mac stepped outside, Sidney on his heels. Nothing was said while Cee Jay started her classy car and pulled away from the curb. He squinted toward the car, memorizing the license plate. There had been no exchange of business cards; Ann had never offered one.</p><p>Then he turned to Sidney. \u201cThat went well,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lou McCain went into Cliffhanger\u2019s, meaning to have a quiet drink at the bar while she waited for Mac to be finished with The Visit. Given it was a Wednesday at six, the place was kind of busy and, as luck would have it, there was only one seat available at the bar...right next to Ray Anne, real estate agent extraordinaire and Lou\u2019s long-time nemesis. And while Lou was in a pair of jeans that she\u2019d dressed up with a jacket, Ray Anne was decked in a royal-blue silky suit, short skirt and very high heels.</p><p>Lou and Ray Anne weren\u2019t exactly enemies, nor were they actual rivals. Anymore, at least. But they grew up together and had issues that went way back to the old days in Coquille. Ray Anne liked men very much and it didn\u2019t matter to her if they were spoken for or not. In fact, Ray Anne, a cute, sexy little blonde in her younger years, had helped herself to at least a couple of Lou\u2019s boyfriends. Lou had a memory like an elephant; it took a lot to cause her to hold a grudge, but once she achieved it, it was even harder for her to let go.</p><p>Ray Anne had relocated to Thunder Point about fifteen years ago, but given that it was so close to Coquille, Lou still saw more of her than she had liked. Then when Lou moved to Thunder Point with Mac and the kids, it seemed as if every time she turned a corner, she ran smack-dab into Ray Anne. Ray Anne might not be the same cute little blonde she once was, but she acted as if she thought she was. Now she had big boobs to add to her charms. Lou had suspected, quite rightly, that a surgical intervention had been necessary to achieve that impressive bustline.</p><p>Every time Lou saw Ray Anne, she automatically looked down at herself. Yup, sixty years old and still she looked as if she were wearing a training bra.</p><p>Yet, there was that lone bar stool. And Lou wouldn\u2019t take a table in a busy restaurant for just a drink. She took the stool next to Ray Anne.</p><p>\u201cIf I sit here, can we have one hour of no conversation?\u201d Lou asked Ray Anne.</p><p>Ray Anne lifted her glass of wine. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time,\u201d she said, lifting one tawny eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Man trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>Right then, Cliff came over to Lou and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cGive me a brandy, Cliff. Make it a good one, please,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You didn\u2019t lose that hunk of a boyfriend, did you?\u201d Ray Anne asked, referring to Joe.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Lou said. \u201cBut I can give you his phone number and address if you want to make a run at him.\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne leaned an elbow on the bar and rested her head on her fist. \u201cYou know, the way you pick at me\u2014it gets old. Aren\u2019t you worried you\u2019ll really hurt my feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess the fact that you call me a lesbian and an old maid wouldn\u2019t be considered picking,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m kidding,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cAnd you damn well know it.\u201d</p><p>Cliff brought Lou\u2019s brandy and disappeared quickly. Lou and Ray Anne had been prickly toward each other for as long as anyone in Thunder Point could remember. It had never gotten down to hair pulling, but they had such scrappy attitudes no one was ever quite sure it wouldn\u2019t result in that one day.</p><p>Lou took a sip of her brandy. \u201cI declare a one-hour truce. This was the only bar stool empty.\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne looked at her watch. \u201cOne hour it is. What\u2019s got you drinking the hard stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is considered hard? This is a Christmas drink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wigged out about something. You haven\u2019t even criticized my attire.\u201d</p><p>Lou gave her a long look. \u201cHow high are those heels?\u201d she asked. \u201cSeriously, no criticism intended, but how the hell do you walk in those things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an acquired skill. Practice. Those wedgies of yours would probably give me leg cramps. Why are you out having Christmas drinks alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lou said tiredly. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear about it, anyway. Mac\u2019s ex is in town, wanting t0 see the kids. She\u2019s over there right now and it was agreed that I not be present since I might lose it and just kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCee Jay,\u201d Ray Anne said in a breath. She had a rather stricken look on her face, her lacquered lips formed an O and she raised a hand to hover over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes, the one and only.\u201d Lou took another sip of her brandy. \u201cGod help us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, holy Jesus, that was her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>Ray Anne turned her full attention on Lou, swiveling on her stool to face her. \u201cShe contacted me. She said she was looking at property in the area and asked about Thunder Point. She introduced herself as Cecelia Raines. She said the house had to be large and she wanted a view. I showed her the Morrison property that\u2019s in foreclosure, but she had a lot of questions about the town, the people, the deputy! I didn\u2019t put it together until ten seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>Lou turned toward her. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. I never met her until a few days ago and I thought she looked familiar. Now that I think about it, Eve looks just like her. Oh, my God, she\u2019s stalking. What does she want?\u201d</p><p>Lou shook her head. \u201cShe says she wants to see her kids. But why now? She hasn\u2019t been in touch since the day she left and now she comes to town to see Mac? This is very strange. Now, after hearing what you\u2019ve just told me, I think it\u2019s a little scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t give me any information about herself\u2014she was a walk-in,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cHappens all the time\u2014there aren\u2019t very many agents in a dried-up old town like ours, so I wasn\u2019t suspicious of her when she arrived at the office. Besides, a lot of people have wanted to see the Morrison place, not that anyone actually wants to buy it. But she was sure turned out\u2014looked like a million bucks. She looked as if she had money, that\u2019s why I took her out there. God, I hope I didn\u2019t do any harm to Mac and the kids. Or you, for that matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>\u201cYou! I hate you,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you!\u201d</p> <p>Lou laughed at her. \u201cYou steal my boyfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done that in years,\u201d Ray Anne said. She lifted her hand to Cliff for another glass of wine. \u201cYour boyfriends are too old for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a slut,\u201d Lou said, but she laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just flexible.\u201d Then she smiled. \u201cAnd open-minded.\u201d</p><p>Lou\u2019s phone chimed and she picked up to read a text. It said, The coast is clear.</p> <p>\u201cThat was Mac. She must be gone already. Oh, that doesn\u2019t seem like a good sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, if there\u2019s anything I can do to help, please let me know. Tell Mac I talked to her and I\u2019d be glad to tell him anything he wants to know about our meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you, Ray Anne,\u201d Lou said while she fished a ten-dollar bill out of her wallet. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne covered Lou\u2019s hand that held the bill. \u201cLet me,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably owe you a drink.\u201d She shook her head and tsked. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine a woman leaving her children and not having any contact with them for ten years,\u201d she said. \u201cI never wanted anything so much as to have a family. If I\u2019d had a family, I would\u2019ve been so happy.\u201d</p><p>Lou was stunned. Ray Anne had never acted like a woman who wanted a family. She behaved like a woman who wanted a man, and another man, and another and another.... \u201cIs that so?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I was married three times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Ray Anne said a little wistfully. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, I\u2019ll tell Mac you\u2019ve seen Cee Jay, talked to her. Listen, I\u2019d better run\u2014I have no idea what I\u2019m walking in to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>Lou started to leave. She turned back, looked at her watch and said, \u201cNext time we can go more than an hour on the truce. If you can behave yourself.\u201d</p><p>Mac checked on his kids, all tucked into their individual bedrooms, starting with Dee Dee. \u201cDoing okay?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDo you think she\u2019s coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, honey. Do you want her to?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. But she has to let Aunt Lou be here because Aunt Lou lives here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Can\u2019t get anything past kids. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to pass that on if I\u2019m ever asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I watch TV? For a half hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomework done?\u201d She nodded again. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>He went to Ryan\u2019s door and opened it. Ryan was laying on his bed, his hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling. \u201cHow are you doing, Ryan?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>Ryan sat up. \u201cWhy\u2019d she come here again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see you, she said. To see all three of you. And for you to see her, since you haven\u2019t seen her in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we done with seeing her now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess we\u2019ll find out if she calls again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably in ten years,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cCan I get on the computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomework done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it at school. Can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s not talk about this visit on Facebook or anything. Family business, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell about it,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s too weird.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he approached his eldest daughter\u2019s room knowing this discussion would be a lot more complicated than the ones he\u2019d just had. He gave two knocks on Eve\u2019s bedroom door and then entered without an invitation. She was sitting cross-legged on her bed, her phone in her hands, texting. There was no question in his mind, she would be checking in with both Ashley and Landon. She looked up at him and he could tell all the wind had gone out of her sails.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated that,\u201d he said. \u201cHated watching that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of her bed. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you, Eve. It was so uncomfortable. Something tells me your mother really wants a relationship with you kids. And I\u2019m terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because she\u2019s lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s lying. I think our perspectives are completely different, as they are between divorced couples. She really believes I failed her. I really believe I did everything I could. How do you change that? The only thing I really want you to know\u2014it was never your fault. Maybe mine, maybe hers, but never yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care whose fault it was! I just want to know how you can love your children and not even send a birthday card!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe no one ever sent her one when she was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know too much about your mother\u2019s childhood\u2014she was in a foster home when I met her in high school. I never questioned that experience back then\u2014seventeen-year-old boys usually don\u2019t ask those kinds of questions. Maybe she was ignored, maybe she had a real bad time growing up or something. A lot of the way we act as adults has to do with how we were treated as children. I might\u2019ve had no idea what I was getting myself into, married at nineteen, but I know that once you arrived, you were like the center of my world. You and your brother and sister were always wanted. I wish I could fix it so you don\u2019t have any pain over this\u2014you\u2019re innocent.\u201d</p><p>A tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like her\u2014I don\u2019t want to run out on my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t. Listen, I know it\u2019s not easy, but I think you have to just accept people as they are. That\u2019s the best Cee Jay\u2019s got, Eve. You don\u2019t have to spend time with her unless you want to, but you also don\u2019t have to carry her burdens. She\u2019s the one who wasn\u2019t here for ten years, no one pushed her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is that,\u201d he said. \u201cHard for everyone, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to spend time with her. But I wouldn\u2019t mind if she sent a birthday card or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she ever asks, I\u2019ll tell her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I might let her take me shopping some time,\u201d she said, smiling sheepishly.</p><p>Mac laughed. \u201cShe should probably take us all shopping.\u201d</p><p>Eve shook her head. \u201cI was kidding, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cHave I told you lately how proud you make me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was rude,\u201d she said. \u201cYou asked me to just be polite and I was rude. And I knew it.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cYou can work on that, but I\u2019m not mad. What have I always told you? We all have our personal boundaries. You have your boundaries and I understand that. It always works best if you defend your boundaries by being firm but without losing your temper, but hey\u2014sometimes if we feel threatened, we lash out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I was feeling threatened?\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cDo you think you were?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a while. \u201cI don\u2019t want her coming around acting like she always missed us because if she missed us, she would have let us know that before now. I don\u2019t like it when someone just lies in my face and acts like it\u2019s the truth. She did not miss us. She came back, but she didn\u2019t tell the truth about why. I guess that\u2019s my boundary. The truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly we just don\u2019t have the whole story,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s my other boundary. The whole story. Don\u2019t just come around acting like it was all a little mistake and hey, we\u2019re all over it now, so let\u2019s party. That isn\u2019t going to cut it.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to smile. One corner of his mouth lifted. \u201cLike I said, we all have our boundaries. They\u2019re personal and they\u2019re ours. I respect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your boundaries?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>\u201cWell, my personal boundaries are my business but, in this case, I had to think about the whole family, about all of us, and I did the best I could to be fair about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were fair,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cI should call Ashley. She\u2019s dying to hear about it.\u201d</p><p>He stood up. That was his cue to give her some privacy to do an emotional postmortem with her best friend. \u201cIf you need to talk about this anymore...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Dad. Sorry I was rude.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>For the first time since Sarah had known Cooper, his temperament was unreadable. He came back from San Antonio in a very quiet, distracted mood. He was so happy to see her, so grateful for her help in the bar while he was away, yet nothing she could say would get his disposition to brighten.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been so hard seeing Bridget like that,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cIt was the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Her family had a tough time letting her go. I hope to never see anything that sad again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you brought a lot of that sadness home with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>And he pulled her close, kissed her temple and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I don\u2019t want to burden you. We have a lot to be thankful for.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t done with it, apparently. Maybe he just needed a little time to process it all. Sarah was happy to have a full week of work to occupy her and keep her from worrying about Cooper every second of the day. By the following weekend, when they had a little more time together, she decided to pursue the subject again. They sat out on his deck under a very starry sky and bright moon, watching over a couple of fires on the beach, listening to the waves break on the shore. He had his evening beer, she had her wine. There were a couple of other people on the deck, also enjoying the spring evening, so they were mostly alone. At least alone enough to have a private conversation. \u201cDid you ever figure out why Bridget wanted you to come to San Antonio?\u201d</p><p>Again he pulled her closer as he did every time the subject came up, as if afraid she might slip away from him. \u201cThere were a lot of reasons\u2014lots of talk about the past, making sure I never for a moment thought she was less than honest with me. But while it probably relieved her and allowed her to move on, it did something bigger for me. I failed her, Sarah. I was a poor excuse for a fianc\u00e9. I was a disappointment as a boyfriend. I wanted to marry her without making any real compromises in my own life. I was leaving the country for weeks at a time, and all she wanted from me was my promise to find a more stable lifestyle.\u201d</p><p>Sarah felt a lump in her throat. \u201cLots of regrets, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots, but let\u2019s see if I can explain\u2014it\u2019s better for both of us that it didn\u2019t work out. She married a good man and I\u2019m so happy with you, here, now. This is the way it should be. But, damn, I don\u2019t ever want to be that kind of disappointment to anyone again. If I thought I let you down like that, it would just kill me. The whole thing\u2014it\u2019s made me think real hard about the man I want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to ask you something. Try to be honest, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always tell you the truth. Not something I\u2019ve always done, but always with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were engaged twice. Was the other woman before or after Bridget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter. And it might\u2019ve been a rebound thing\u2014it was Patti, and I was never so relieved as when it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Sarah turned in her chair, facing him. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear this.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cTry not to be too amused,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI was dating Patti. Same drill. I was the runaway boyfriend\u2014in the States for a few weeks, away for long stretches, expecting the woman of the moment to be so thrilled by my occasional presence that she\u2019d never think of asking more from me.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah just shook her head and snickered. \u201cYou were such a dog. I\u2019ve known a hundred guys just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not really flattering to know I\u2019m just another brute. Inconsiderate and self-absorbed. So, I was dating Patti and ran into, guess who? Bridget. At the grocery store, of all places. I hardly ever went to the grocery store. She was picking through tomatoes or something and she looked...\u201d He just shook his head in wonder. \u201cShe looked amazing. Happier than I\u2019d ever seen her. She had a rosy-cheeked one-year-old in her shopping cart and she was making him giggle. When she saw me, she gasped and laughed and threw her arms around me and said it was so good to see me. I knew she was married but I have to tell you, Sarah, the way I saw her that day? She was never that happy with me. We talked for about five minutes\u2014she married a teacher, had a nice little house not far from her mom and dad, hoped to fill it up with kids. She asked me about how I was doing...I was doing the same thing. She had grown a family and I had grown a little savings account\u2014contract labor outsourced by the Army was good money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was when you wanted her back?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember feeling that way. What I remember was thinking I hadn\u2019t been as smart as I thought I was. So, right after that I asked Patti to marry me and she was thrilled. What is it about women and the capture, huh? What did she have to be thrilled about? In two weeks I knew it was a mistake and we broke up. That\u2019s all there is to the Patti/Cooper story. I think I was trying to reach back in time\u2014I think I felt like I\u2019d been an idiot. A fool. I packed up and left San Antonio, went to the Gulf coast, got a job for an oil company flying equipment and people to off shore rigs. Right then I made a decision to live alone for the rest of my life.\u201d He squeezed her shoulders and grinned. \u201cUntil you came along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou grieve her,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cYou grieve Bridget and the life you might\u2019ve had together.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple, babe. I grieve the foolishness of my youth. But I\u2019m grateful for all the things that happened, even the stupid things. I want to be here with you now and if I\u2019d been smarter back then, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. So, I\u2019m sorry I was an idiot and grateful I was an idiot? Does that make any sense?\u201d</p><p>Derek Stiles, Sarah\u2019s ex-husband, instantly came to her mind. She had so wanted her marriage to work but now she was so grateful things had gone the way they had, allowing her to be here with Cooper. \u201cI think I understand, Cooper. I\u2019m just sorry you\u2019re so sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left a husband and young son,\u201d he said. \u201cThat just shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt happened to Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think about that all the time,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI know I can\u2019t ever be a father to Landon. But you know what, Sarah? If something terrible happened tomorrow and Landon was left alone, I want you to know\u2014I\u2019d never abandon him. Never.\u201d Then he laughed at himself. \u201cI\u2019d be his shadow. I\u2019d stick with him.\u201d</p><p>Cooper got better over the next week. He might\u2019ve been a little bit quiet, but he was lightening up. And then the following weekend, she could tell something had changed. He was as morose and preoccupied as he\u2019d been that first day he had returned from Texas.</p> <p>Sarah went out on the bay on her board while he had customers in the bar and planned what she was going to say to Cooper, because this had to be resolved. Later that day she didn\u2019t say anything and tried to ignore his mood until it was late enough for them to be alone. Sarah was sure that Bridget\u2019s death had opened his eyes\u2014he must know in his heart that he\u2019d been in love with her and was sorry he\u2019d let her go.</p><p>When the last four people from town were walking back down the beach she said, \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with. I want to know what\u2019s going on with you. And I want it all, right now.\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her for a second, shocked. Speechless.</p><p>\u201cI know it has to do with me,\u201d she said. \u201cJust get it out. Stop with all this \u2018I love you so much\u2019 stuff and tell me the truth. What\u2019s eating you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly. \u201cI was going to tell you tonight. I\u2019m sorry you had to wait,\u201d he said. \u201cCome here.\u201d He put out his hand and led her inside.</p><p>Once they were in the shop and there was sufficient light, he pulled out his cell phone and scrolled through the pictures, handing it to her.</p><p>\u201cBridget wanted to tell me before she died that I have a son. She didn\u2019t realize Austin was mine\u2014it was an honest mistake that came to light when her whole extended family, including Austin, had blood tests to try to find a match for a bone marrow transplant. It revealed that Austin and Spencer, Bridget\u2019s husband, weren\u2019t a match. I had a DNA test while I was in Texas and was waiting for confirmation. The letter came yesterday afternoon. I\u2019m a match. I wanted us to have some time to talk it over once I knew for sure.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the face of an adorable little boy. Then she looked at Cooper. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel like you lost your love of a lifetime!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Sarah. I feel like I have a son. I feel like I have more responsibility. To you, to Landon, to Austin, even a little bit to Spencer. Bridget asked me not to take Austin away from the only father he\u2019s had and, of course, I agreed to that. But I have to find a way to get to know him. I have to be a father, even if I\u2019m not a full-time father. I have absolutely no idea how that\u2019s done.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cBaby, how the hell did you do it? Take on Landon when you were just a kid yourself? How did you do such a great job at that?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes welled with tears. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s been beating you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a lot?\u201d he asked. \u201cI have a kid, Sarah. I have a family. It might be a part-time job, but Jesus. What if Bridget and I had known back then? What if we\u2019d gotten married? I think Austin is lucky it worked out like it did. But I have no idea what to do next.\u201d</p><p>Sarah wiped the tears from her cheeks. \u201cYou have a family,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know and it all feels kinda heavy for a guy like me. Am I going to get used to this?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cHe has to come first,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if he has a good father already, you have to put your son first. He\u2019s your first priority. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>And that, Sarah thought, is going to make it even harder for us to be first to each other.</p><p>Mac hadn\u2019t seen Cooper in a couple of weeks. He\u2019d dropped into the beach bar one evening on his way home from work to discover that Cooper was away\u2014some kind of family emergency that Rawley said Cooper would explain later. Mac left the bar thinking he would catch up with his friend eventually.</p><p>More than a week later Cooper walked into the deputy\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cBreak time?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d made good on your threats and just sold the bar and land and left us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I had business out of town. I wasn\u2019t gone that long.\u201d</p><p>Mac rubbed his neck, leaning back in his desk chair. \u201cRight, but then I had a busy week and it seemed like you\u2019d been gone forever. Well, good to see you. I heard there was some kind of emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no. It turned out that my ex-fianc\u00e9e\u2019s husband was looking for me. She had cancer. Terminal. Time was short. I didn\u2019t have much notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was sick. By the time I saw her she was ready to go, just had a few loose ends and goodbyes to wrap up and then, thank God, she could just let go. It was hopeless and she was...man, she was suffering. I was one of her loose ends.\u201d He looked down and shook his head solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest\u2014that really screwed up my head for a while. Poor Sarah. She had to try to figure me out. I think she should\u2019ve just slapped me a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine now. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014you might be hearing from her husband and I wanted to give you a heads-up. The guy\u2019s name is Spencer Lawson and I suggested he call you. I suggested he do a complete background search on me and that you are a personal reference, but one with a real professional expertise.\u201d At the puzzled look on Mac\u2019s face Cooper got right to the point. \u201cI just got confirmation\u2014lab work confirmation\u2014but it was just a formality. It seems I have a son. And none of us knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Cooper, you old dog!\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed in spite of himself. He pulled out his cell phone and showed Mac a bunch of pictures of Austin while he explained about the broken engagement, the bone marrow transplant work-up, all the details. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to figure out how to tell my family. My mom and dad, my sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably prudent,\u201d Mac said, but his grin was huge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really surprised by how much I want to tell them, my dad especially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be bringing him here to live with you?\u201d</p><p>The smile left Cooper\u2019s face. \u201cWell, no. Spencer is a good father. Austin just lost his mother. He wants to stay with Spencer and why would I screw with that? But I am planning to visit in a couple of weeks. I want to take in a Little League game, maybe go out for pizza. I\u2019m not practiced at this, man,\u201d he said with an embarrassed laugh. \u201cI haven\u2019t even been that great an uncle to my sisters\u2019 kids!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re good with kids. You might even be a natural\u2014I\u2019ve seen you with Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a lot older. Austin is only ten,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBesides, I owe Landon. Through him I found Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that working out?\u201d Mac asked. \u201cYou and Sarah? Now that there\u2019s a kid in the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s completely afraid to get serious about me, but I\u2019m wearing her down. I\u2019m counting on Austin to soften her up a little. He\u2019s cute as the devil\u2014obviously doesn\u2019t look that much like me,\u201d he lied. And the grin was back. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that once I check out, Spencer will let Austin come for a visit. He really likes the idea of a Jet Ski. You know what\u2019s so ironic? One of the reasons Bridget and I broke up was because I wasn\u2019t ready for an anchor. I wanted to get married, that was real\u2014I was ready for a permanent woman. But all the stuff that went with it\u2014settled, house, no more contract flying to warring countries, kids...I wasn\u2019t there yet. Little did I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you had known?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cHard to say. I probably would\u2019ve gotten married\u2014I was prepared for that. But I was the stubborn idiot who thought nothing had to change about my life. I\u2019d keep doing whatever I wanted to do and Bridget would go along. Right? Isn\u2019t that what young men think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Mac said. \u201cYou really would\u2019ve been surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Spencer will call you. Be honest, Mac\u2014this isn\u2019t a favor I\u2019m asking. You don\u2019t have to tell me when he calls, what he asks. Austin\u2019s a good little kid. I want his dad to be careful, to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything bad about you, Cooper. And there\u2019s a tradition that goes along with all this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta buy us a couple of cigars,\u201d he said. Then he put out his hand and said, \u201cCongratulations, man!\u201d</p> <p>While Cooper had been dealing with the news of his surprise son, Mac had been busy with his own mystery. He\u2019d been researching his ex, trying to figure out what Cee Jay was up to. Her car was registered to a Madeline Crofts from Los Angeles and that was the second time he\u2019d come across a familiar name but wasn\u2019t sure why. There was no police record, just an L.A. address.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t occurred to him to look up his ex-wife\u2019s attorney until days had passed. When he finally searched the California Bar Association using every possible spelling, the name didn\u2019t pop up. A fraud? Could she be practicing without a license? Finally he looked up Antoinette LeClair on Google and had to go through pages of references until he came upon one that jiggled his memory\u2014that was the name of a character on Law and Order. And she was played by none other than Madeline Crofts, formerly of Oregon.</p><p>Then he went to work on Cee Jay\u2019s history, searching under a variety of aliases, including Cecelia Raines and bingo. Cecelia Jayne McCain was married to Martin Raines six years ago. Almost one year before her divorce from Mac was finalized.</p><p>\u201cBigamy,\u201d Mac muttered.</p><p>The Raineses were divorced two years ago and the wealthy Mr. Raines left her a very large Laguna Beach home, two luxury late model vehicles, jewelry. He also paid two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year in spousal support. Further research a few days later showed that the house was in foreclosure. It appeared that it was left to Cee Jay free and clear and she\u2019d borrowed against it. Its value was two-point-four million.</p> <p>What the hell?</p><p>Mac had bought his five-bedroom home for one hundred eighty thousand and had done all the necessary repairs himself. His Aunt Lou was also an owner\u2014they bought it together. Their plan was to own it free and clear in another ten years.</p><p>How had Cee Jay gone through that amount of money in such a short time? She was well-dressed, but how much money did that take? And if she had resources like that, what was she doing back here, trying to get reacquainted with her children? He had trouble believing it was sincere motherly love.</p><p>This all made no sense to him.</p><p>He called Sidney and asked him to get in touch with Cee Jay\u2019s attorney to set up a meeting. Sidney called him back a few hours later to tell him that the number he had for Ms. LeClair was not in service. \u201cNot a listing anywhere,\u201d Sidney said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t find her in the directory of California attorneys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither could I,\u201d Mac said. And then he told Sidney what he\u2019d found on a computer search of public documents.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t recommend a meeting with the \u2018so-called\u2019 lawyer right now even if we could locate her,\u201d Sidney said. \u201cAnd, frankly, if I\u2019d known all this, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to that meeting with the children. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not legal. It\u2019s certainly not responsible. There are the feelings of children involved!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Mac didn\u2019t discuss this conundrum with anyone else, not even Lou. Instead he called a colleague in L.A., who recommended a private detective with a good reputation. Mac hired him to gather background information on Cee Jay. He was primarily interested in where her money was and where her ex-husband had gone. Marrying and divorcing him, obtaining a very large settlement when she hadn\u2019t been divorced and free to marry in the first place was fraud. She\u2019d be lucky if she didn\u2019t go to jail.</p><p>The very idea of the mother of his children in jail chilled Mac to the bone.</p><p>With the way things had been going with Ashley, Gina did something she thought she\u2019d never do\u2014she phoned the parents of Ashley\u2019s biological father, Eric Gentry. She had no idea where he lived now and she hoped she could get a current address from his parents, whom, she knew, were residents of a retirement community outside North Bend. Without wanting to get into a lot of detail with them Gina fabricated a little white lie. She said she worked for an auto insurance company and had a large refund check for Eric Gentry, but had no current address for him. \u201cSince he hasn\u2019t been a client of ours for over fifteen years, we don\u2019t have his address and the check was returned. I can\u2019t send it to you\u2014it will have to be signed for. Would you be able to give his contact information?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Gentry, gullible as many seniors are, gave Gina his current address. It was a business address in Eugene, Oregon.</p><p>It took Gina about fifteen minutes on the computer to learn that Eric Gentry owned a body shop in Eugene, which was relatively close to Thunder Point. She\u2019d bet her last tip that he\u2019d stayed clear of Thunder Point ever since he\u2019d left town almost seventeen years ago.</p><p>Gina was reluctant to be very far away from home these days, but she thought her reasons for wanting to see Eric after all this time were important enough to pursue. She needed to ask Eric about the medical history on his side of the family.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t going to tell Ashley about this plan\u2014at least not yet. She wasn\u2019t sure how her daughter would react to the news that Gina was going to try to talk to her father. She might even ask to go along, and that \u2019twas not going to happen. What Ashley did not need right now was one more unstable relationship in her life. So Gina told her she was going over to Bandon to the doctor\u2019s office for her annual exam and since she had to take time off from work to do it, she thought she might shop a little. Ashley was told to call her grandmother if she needed anything.</p><p>On the drive to Eugene, Gina wondered what Eric would be like. She expected him to be a slightly older version of the boy she\u2019d known. The fact that he now owned his own small business kind of threw her; she did not exactly remember him as being responsible.</p><p>His body shop\u2014Gentry\u2019s\u2014wasn\u2019t in a particularly nice part of town but it was large, on a clean lot surrounded by a cyclone fence and a couple of signs that said there were guard dogs on the property. She shivered. There was only one small reception counter inside the front door\u2014the place where people dropped off their keys and phone numbers\u2014and the rest of the building was all garage and service bays. She peeked in\u2014there were at least eight work bays and there looked to be six employees working on cars. She saw brutalized bumpers, crunched-up sides, but also vintage and classic models undergoing restoration. And the garage was spotless.</p><p>A young man came to the counter, wiping his hands on a rag. He had his name, Rafael, sewn on his work shirt. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Eric Gentry,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was recommended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2014what do you need done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told to only talk to Eric,\u201d she said smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if he\u2019s available.\u201d And the guy disappeared.</p><p>Not two minutes later Eric walked through the door from the garage, wiping his hands on an identical blue rag. And it was like stepping back in time. He was the same guy, just older and more mature. He\u2019d have to be about thirty-six now and his red hair was a little darker, but those green eyes, Ashley\u2019s green eyes, were just as breathtaking. He still had that bad-boy aura that had once put her afire. And he recognized her immediately. His eyes grew wide and his mouth formed a handsome O of surprise.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call the dogs,\u201d she said, putting up a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you. You\u2019re not in trouble or anything. I just have to ask you a few questions. Health questions. For my daughter\u2019s health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaughter?\u201d he said, as if he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cYes, daughter. Do you have fifteen or twenty minutes? I won\u2019t keep you long, I promise. And there are no wrong answers\u2014you\u2019re not at risk. It\u2019s medical history stuff and it\u2019s important for her, so she gets the best medical care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she sick?\u201d</p><p>Gina allowed a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the first things a doctor asks when you need medical attention and we don\u2019t know anything about the medical history of your side of the family. Is there somewhere sort of private we could talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Denny\u2019s a few blocks away. I\u2019d be happy to buy you a cup of coffee. I\u2019ll just let my guys know I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I follow you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work. Give me a couple of minutes\u2014I want to wash my hands. I\u2019ll be backing out of the lot in the tow truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the old Jeep,\u201d she said.</p><p>Gina left to wait for him in the Jeep. While she sat there she wondered what her next move would be if he bolted again. But he had a business\u2014surely he wouldn\u2019t run now. When he ran at eighteen, he\u2019d had nothing to hold him. He couldn\u2019t possibly believe she\u2019d be coming after him now for support, or to charge him with statutory rape! At this late date? But then, the big tow truck backed out and she put her Jeep in gear and followed him.</p><p>Eric parked around the back of the restaurant and Gina parked in front. She had the passing thought that Denny\u2019s was certainly getting a workout lately\u2014Mac had met with Cee Jay in a Denny\u2019s. Gina hoped this conference would be much more productive.</p><p>She waited for him inside the door and once he was there, the waitress appeared, all smiles.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Eric?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat, Jenn. Can we have a booth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d she said, grabbing menus and showing them the way.</p><p>They settled in, menus closed and Eric immediately asked, \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. She\u2019s had some challenges lately, as all teenage girls will, but the only thing I could use help from you with is a medical history.\u201d She pulled a slip of paper from the side pocket of her purse. \u201cLike\u2014any history of cancer, heart disease, mental illness, epilepsy, diabetes? Any chronic illnesses or hereditary conditions I should know about? Kidney failure? High blood pressure? Breast cancer, uterine cancer? How about clinical depression or bipolar disorder?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cMy dad had bypass surgery, but I\u2019m pretty sure it was more about fried foods and no exercise than genetics. Mental illness? My mother\u2019s pretty crazy, but I think it\u2019s just that she\u2019s pretty crazy, not mentally ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty crazy how?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cShe complains constantly. She\u2019s manipulative as all hell. She\u2019s seventy-five and still angry about everything. It might be keeping her alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, your parents were older when you were born. Didn\u2019t your dad retire right about the time we knew each other?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey had two children. My sister is eighteen years older than I am. My dad is a retired postal carrier\u2014he retired at sixty. My sister and her husband built a guest house on their property and my folks live in it.\u201d He smiled. \u201cGod bless her.\u201d</p><p>The waitress appeared and Eric said, \u201cTwo coffees, please.\u201d And then to Gina he said, \u201cWould you like something to eat?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI take it you\u2019re not close to them?\u201d she asked. \u201cYour parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnsurprising, if you think about all the trouble I gave them. We\u2019ve been closer the last few years, but they have relentless memories. I hope...I\u2019m sorry\u2014her name? Your daughter?\u201d</p><p>Your daughter, too, she almost said. \u201cAshley.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI hope she\u2019s easier on you than I was on my parents. Ashley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a dream come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty name. I wasn\u2019t sure. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure of what?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hands over his face. They were callused hands; hardworking hands. But clean. Even his nails were clean. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWell, if you really were pregnant. If you had a baby. Or maybe decided not to take a chance on one, given the father. I thought about contacting you. Then I thought better of it. I didn\u2019t want to stir up any bad memories for you. I thought you\u2019d be better off, you know?\u201d</p><p>The waitress put the coffees on the table, but they both ignored them.</p><p>Gina shoved her list back in her purse, a little angry. \u201cBetter off, how?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, Gina, I know what I did to you was low. It was so wrong nothing could make it right. I wanted to say I was sorry, but sorry was so lame I couldn\u2019t even choke it out. By the time I could\u2019ve apologized, so much time had passed, I figured I\u2019d be like a bad dream. And you didn\u2019t need that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d she asked. \u201cSo, checking to see if you actually had a child, you thought that would be a bad idea. You thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in prison, Gina.\u201d</p><p>Well. Gunshot to the heart. She felt all the color drain from her face. \u201cPrison?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cArmed robbery. Seven years and I served five. I\u2019m not making excuses here, but I was kind of along for the ride. I made a few bad friends and at that time in my life I thought bad was very cool. I think someone dropped me on my head when I was a baby. I\u2019m sorry, Gina. I\u2019m really sorry. You\u2019re just one of many people I disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>She was stunned silent for a moment. \u201cRight,\u201d she finally said. Hands shaking, she pulled her list out again. \u201cDiabetes?\u201d she asked. \u201cMetabolic issues, like Crohn\u2019s disease?\u201d</p><p>He covered her hand. \u201cI\u2019m not a dangerous person,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve turned my life around. But to a kid, that news wouldn\u2019t be important. I wouldn\u2019t want the reputation that goes with having a con for a dad. I won\u2019t bother you. Or your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be doing okay for yourself now,\u201d she said.</p><p>He gave a nod. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an ex-con, getting work is almost impossible. My brother-in-law helped me land a job in a run-down body shop. It went into foreclosure and he helped me buy the auctioned property. I was probably too young and inexperienced for it, but it was a lot better than begging for a chance, a break. So, I worked hard, ran it for a few years with ex-cons I knew were okay and we turned it around. What you see is a rebuilt and highly leveraged business, but an honest and dependable one. The last couple of years, even in this economy, have been good years.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in trouble since. You can check that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should probably just go....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some money put aside. No other children,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIf you can use a hand...let me know. You wouldn\u2019t have to tell her where it came from.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to know about the medical history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you probably know way more than you wanted to know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWow. I knew you were trouble back then, but I never...\u201d Then she blanched. \u201cI mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you mean, Gina. Listen, I realize I have no right, but can you tell me about her? I promise not to bother her or you.\u201d</p><p>Gina thought about this for a long moment. Then she pulled her cell phone out of her purse, clicked on the picture gallery and passed it to him. The first picture was one she\u2019d taken at a Thunder High basketball game. Ashley was smiling, red hair shining, green eyes twinkling, her pom-poms under her chin. She was stunning.</p><p>And she saw him almost crumble. He cradled the phone in both hands, a look of wonder came over him. He had to glance away briefly to compose himself. \u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d he said in a strained whisper.</p><p>\u201cThere are more. You can scroll through.\u201d</p><p>He took his time with the pictures and awe was obvious on his face. She had about a hundred pictures\u2014Ashley fooling around with friends, sleeping, laughing, cheering, studying with Eve, hugging her grandmother, sitting at the counter at the diner. It was a long while before he stopped and looked at her. He laughed uncomfortably. \u201cI better stay out of Thunder Point or the whole town will know who I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer resemblance to you is unmistakable, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you married now? Do you have someone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot married, but yes, I have someone. You?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cA fianc\u00e9e. She\u2019s thirty. A web designer.\u201d He laughed. \u201cHard to pull her away from the computer and out of the house. But she\u2019s amazingly talented. She wants her own company. Who is your guy?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the irony. She grinned. \u201cThe Deputy Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cFigures. Well, I\u2019m not in trouble anymore. Tell me more about her. About Ashley. Something happened. There\u2019s some reason you\u2019re here asking about diabetes and Crohn\u2019s disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a breakdown,\u201d Gina said simply. \u201cShe had a serious boyfriend, first love, and he dumped her and I could barely get her out of bed. She was saying things I couldn\u2019t deal with\u2014like that she didn\u2019t even want to live. And then\u2014\u201d She stopped. She swallowed. Was this the kind of private stuff you don\u2019t tell a stranger, even if he\u2019s the father of your child? And without thinking any further she said, \u201cAnd then the mean girl he\u2019s now dating used Photoshop on a picture of her with naked boobs and texted it to everyone on his phone list. It was up on the internet. She collapsed. I had to have her hospitalized.\u201d</p><p>His face darkened, then grew crimson. He steepled his fingers to keep his hands from shaking. Then he pursed his lips.</p><p>\u201cWe were afraid we could be dealing with clinical depression, but the doctor is convinced she was just in crisis. She\u2019s home now, doing much better. Except for some emotional disappointment now and then, she\u2019s getting her strength back. But it was that crisis that led me to search you out, to ask about family medical history. I was scared to death, I don\u2019t mind telling you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would do something like that?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p><p>She actually laughed, but it wasn\u2019t a happy laugh. \u201cA mean and jealous teenage girl would. Really, Eric, you have no idea how cruel people can be.\u201d And then she thought about what she\u2019d said. The man had spent five years in prison. Chances were he knew.</p><p>But he was gazing at her with serious eyes. \u201cIt must have been so hard,\u201d he said softly. \u201cRaising her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were hard times,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I had my mother. And like you, I\u2019ve made a good life for myself. I have strong relationships in Thunder Point and Ashley has a very solid support network and good friends. And I\u2019m watching, I\u2019m always watching. I won\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do. Any way I can help. Like I said, I have a little money set aside and she wouldn\u2019t have to know her father is a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Ashley is older, when I\u2019m sure she\u2019s stable and feeling good about herself, I\u2019ll tell her about you. I mean, the new you\u2014I\u2019ve been honest with her about my past. Right now? I think we just leave it alone. No, I don\u2019t want your money. But thank you for offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only ask one thing, Gina. One small thing.\u201d He pulled a card from his shirt pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s my cell phone number. If there\u2019s ever anything I can do for her. Anything. Will you call me?\u201d</p><p>She stared at the number. \u201cIf I\u2019d come around five years ago and asked for help, would you have been this receptive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to. The path I was on, I was going to die ugly and young. And hard as it is to believe, I didn\u2019t want to. Five years ago? Yes, I think I would\u2019ve tried to help\u2014I was well on my way to a better life by then. But I\u2019m sure now, beyond a doubt. If you need me, if Ashley needs me, I can do my best. If I could meet her someday... Ah, I\u2019m not pushing on that. That\u2019s just fantasy. But if she ever needs help, just call me.\u201d</p><p>They talked for another half hour\u2014she gave him news of the town, he told her about his family and some of his misadventures. Gina cried a little on the way home. It was not about regret. It was about gratitude. Her mother always said things happened the way they were supposed to. If she\u2019d found a way to strap Eric to her seventeen years ago, she\u2019d have found herself stuck with a felon; an irresponsible and heartless bad boy. But the world had done its job to shape him while she and Ashley were busy building their family together. And now, unless she was no judge at all, he really had rebuilt his character and his life.</p><p>She was lucky. She had Mac, the love of her life. And a phone number for emergencies.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Cooper had to force himself to call Austin to start a dialogue and he had never found anything so unnatural or difficult. Making small talk with a shy ten-year-old was torture. Cooper asked him about school, about his grandparents, his dad, baseball. Austin responded with one-word answers then, invariably, Cooper would ask for Spencer so he could get the lowdown on how Austin was holding up since his mother\u2019s passing.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing well,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cHe\u2019s resilient and I think he was more than ready to start thinking about normal things. The last few years have been really hard on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how about learning he has a new biological father on the scene?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s news to you, Cooper, but we told Austin months before Bridget passed. He\u2019s ten\u2014if he was going to have another dad on the scene, all he hoped for was a cool one. You passed the cool test with your Jet Ski and Harley.\u201d</p><p>About ten days later, Austin was more relaxed on his call with Cooper. He used more than one-word answers and even seemed to enjoy the conversation a little bit.</p><p>Soon after making regular calls to Austin and Spencer, and at Spencer\u2019s invitation, Cooper packed a duffel and headed to Texas for a weekend visit. Spencer and Cooper took Austin and one of his friends, James, out for pizza on Friday night. Cooper realized that what greased their relationship best was James. The boys got to laughing and screwing around, eventually running off to play video games in the pizza parlor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d he told Spencer. \u201cBringing James along made it so much easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustin has been drowning in adults for months, especially while Bridget went through the last of her illness. He\u2019d almost forgotten how to have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing back at school?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cHe seems relieved to be there. Like he\u2019s so goddamn tired of being serious, of being sad. It\u2019s awful seeing a ten-year-old act like an old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a better job with him, especially through all these adjustments, than I ever could have. I wouldn\u2019t have known where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would if you\u2019d had him in your life since he was born,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI think you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, something\u2019s been on my mind,\u201d he said, looking at Spencer. \u201cBridget wasn\u2019t cheating on you or anything. You\u2019re comfortable with that now, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, yes. I admit it took me a while. I know how it was. At least I think I do. You broke up. She started dating me a few months later, but we were taking it slow. She was trying to make sure it wasn\u2019t a rebound thing. Finally she was ready to get more serious. I\u2019d been ready first, that\u2019s the fact. We were both pretty surprised by the pregnancy. We both thought it happened the first time....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was having trouble with all the things that went along with the commitment. I was good with the fidelity part. I loved Bridget, or at least I thought I did at the time. But I wasn\u2019t ready for stability and family life, and she was smart enough to get that. I wasn\u2019t willing to give up anything to make us work. That\u2019s why we broke up. But I kept coming back. We had history, that\u2019s all it was. It was comfortable and familiar. Then I came back too late\u2014I called her and she told me she was through fooling around, that she\u2019d met someone who could actually make compromises and she was in love.\u201d He gave a shrug. \u201cI was pretty pissed, to tell you the truth. I didn\u2019t contact her again for six months. And you know the rest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cShe was married and pregnant,\u201d Spencer said. He shot Cooper a melancholy look. \u201cAnd said she was happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was happy. We were over before she moved on. Bridget was a good woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sell me on that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to tell my family about Austin. And they\u2019re going to want to meet him at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You tell me when and I\u2019ll take him. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you with him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, let\u2019s be straight about this, about anything that has to do with Austin. I don\u2019t want Austin scared or overwhelmed. I want you to be with him. He\u2019s just a kid for God\u2019s sake. Until he\u2019s ready to visit me or go to my family without you, I want you there with him. I\u2019ll try to work out a time with my family and check it with you. I\u2019ll pay the fare. Maybe after school is out? They\u2019re just over in Albuquerque\u2014not a bad flight for you.\u201d</p><p>Spencer chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re something, you know that? You could be a complete asshole about all this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a complete asshole here and there, which might be one of the many reasons Bridget broke up with me,\u201d he said, slapping Spencer on the back. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying, man. I\u2019m trying. There\u2019s sure nothing in it for me if Austin grows up all screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hold off on the family visit in Albuquerque,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cFirst, I think Austin and I should come out to Oregon to visit you. On your turf. Is there a hotel in town?\u201d</p><p>Cooper smiled. \u201cEven better. I live on the second floor of my business, but I have an RV and a hook-up on the property. It\u2019s nice. You and Austin can have it for a weekend. You\u2019ll have fun, I can almost guarantee it. It\u2019s a nice little town.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd I have that Jet Ski.\u201d</p><p>Right then the boys came running back to the table. \u201cDad! Dad! We need more quarters!\u201d Austin was flushed and sweaty and smelled gamey, like a happy little boy should.</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d Cooper said. He reached into his pocket. He pulled out a five-dollar bill. \u201cWhen you get change, count it and make sure you\u2019ve got the right amount. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Austin said. And they turned away.</p> <p>Austin\u2019s friend, James, said, \u201cWho\u2019s that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Cooper,\u201d Austin said. \u201cThe bio-dad.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t unusual to see Landon on the beach with Hamlet in the afternoons. After school he was often with other high school kids or Eve, but today he was solo, throwing the ball for Ham all the way across the beach. Seeing Cooper up on the deck he headed over and ran up the stairs with Hamlet on his heels. Ham went straight to Cooper for a little scratch behind the ears. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, my man?\u201d Cooper asked Landon. \u201cCoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Landon said. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>A minute later he was sitting next to Cooper in the same relaxed position, feet up on the deck rail, chair leaning back, looking out at the ocean. It was a few minutes before Landon said, \u201cCoop, do you understand women?\u201d</p><p>Cooper turned to look at his profile. He grinned. \u201cNot that often.\u201d When Landon didn\u2019t say anything, Cooper asked, \u201cGirl trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll over the place,\u201d Landon said. \u201cMaybe not trouble, exactly. More like confusion. Does it seem like Sarah\u2019s in a bad mood these days? And Eve...she\u2019s got all that stuff going on\u2014sometimes she\u2019s just plain pissy. Sometimes she\u2019s crying about nothing or laughing about nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah seems okay to me,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cMaybe a little quiet now and then. She said she\u2019s got work stuff going on\u2014stuff that should be resolved soon. I don\u2019t know anything about Eve\u2019s mood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been upset about Ash and Downy\u2014that went down badly. It freaked Eve out\u2014she was afraid we\u2019d get all serious and then I\u2019d do something that nasty to her. Then Eve\u2019s mom showed up after ten years and that had her all upside down. And I think Sarah\u2019s been weird lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon, you gotta be patient, man. There are cosmic forces that have nothing to do with me and you. Like PMS. Ever think of that?\u201d</p><p>Landon winced. \u201cI try not to think about things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you, buddy. And for God\u2019s sake, never ask! That\u2019s the kiss of death.\u201d He took a sip of his coffee. \u201cI think Sarah was a little worried about my trip to Texas. I think she doesn\u2019t know what to make of this situation I\u2019m in\u2014all of a sudden I\u2019m a father. I just try to reassure her\u2014it doesn\u2019t change anything between us. It\u2019s gotta be a shock, though, huh? So if she\u2019s moody, it\u2019s probably because I threw her a curve....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019s jealous or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I think she was worried enough about taking me on, now she thinks she has to take me and a kid on. It\u2019s not really like that, though. Austin wants to live with his dad, Spencer. He feels safe there. I\u2019ll just visit from time to time and they\u2019ll visit here. You don\u2019t show up in a kid\u2019s life when he\u2019s ten years old and take over. I mean, if he was in trouble I would. But he\u2019s not in trouble. Spencer is a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you end up with a kid?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWho knows? Since we were specifically trying not to have one, something obviously went wrong. But when you see that kid it makes you think maybe something went right....\u201d</p><p>Landon shuddered. It was unmistakable.</p><p>Cooper pulled his feet off the rail and turned in his chair. \u201cYou want to talk about something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Landon said, but he didn\u2019t make eye contact. \u201cDid you have a girlfriend when you were in high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like every kid that age, I was in love just about all the time. I lusted after a lot of girls who didn\u2019t appear to lust after me. I had some dates. Most of them were first dates. I think there were a couple of girls I dated a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when did you first, you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Landon? When did I get laid? Do we need to talk about the birds and the bees?\u201d</p><p>Landon finally looked at him. \u201cYou trying to piss me off? No wonder Sarah\u2019s cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was older than I wanted to be. I don\u2019t know. Maybe seventeen, but probably eighteen. I didn\u2019t have a girlfriend I\u2019d been with for six months, that\u2019s for sure. Now, what\u2019s going on with you and Eve? We got problems?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just that... Well, I don\u2019t want to lose her. She\u2019s really special. Perfect. I could never want a better girl. But I don\u2019t want to... You know about her mom and dad, right? How they had to get married because Eve was on the way? And they were just kids? Eve\u2019s mom was younger than Eve is now. Holy shit is all I have to say about that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys don\u2019t usually talk about things like that, but I\u2019m capable of math,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou and Eve getting a little too serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, and Cooper couldn\u2019t tell if it was remorse, disappointment or fear behind those words.</p><p>Cooper leaned back and put his feet up on the rail again. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s what I have to say about that. You can probably save yourself a lot of heartache by being real careful, by which I mean lots of protection. But hear this from Papa Cooper\u2014there don\u2019t seem to be any real guarantees. Any time you want to talk about it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever feel, you know, like you really loved someone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cooper smiled at him and he hoped he smiled gently. \u201cI feel that way right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve felt that way before, as a matter of fact\u2014times it didn\u2019t really work out. And now I\u2019m kind of glad it didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t mind telling you, Sarah\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me and I waited a long time to find her.\u201d He clapped a hand on Landon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel like you love Eve. Nothing wrong with love, Landon. Some people find it young, some people have to wait awhile. But what you have to guard against is letting a little love make you a lot careless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell Mac about this conversation,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cOr Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Sarah,\u201d he repeated. \u201cNow here\u2019s what you do, son. You\u2019re both, what? Sixteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both seventeen this summer. Eve\u2019s seventeen in July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re looking at your senior year and right around the corner will be college. Yep. Here\u2019s what you do\u2014you make sure you\u2019re protected. Safe. Both of you. Just in case, you know, you get a little crazy. I\u2019m assuming you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s one of you,\u201d Cooper said thoughtfully. They met eyes for a long moment.</p><p>Then Landon turned his chair back toward the ocean. They both put their feet up again. And Landon said, \u201cSo. How about those Yankees?\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cYou know what, Landon, old man? I think you need an after-school job. And a summer job. Keep you out of trouble while Sarah\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. You pay anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll negotiate if we have to,\u201d he said.</p><p>The Oregon Dispatch was a regional newspaper that came out once a week and covered news from the many small towns in Coos County. There were also coupons for local businesses and groceries\u2014a dying tradition as people could download many of these coupons from their computers. But when there was exciting local news or big events, the Dispatch was always there. And this week there was a news story from Oregon State University and Thunder Point. It was rumored that Crawford Downy was going to be a first round major league draft pick. A freshman! A couple of scouts had admitted he was a hot property and if he continued to play as well as he had been, he\u2019d be in the majors in no time at all.</p><p>Yes, this was the boy who was one of the favorite sons of the town. Perhaps the favorite of all. A brilliant athlete.</p><p>It was all the talk at the high school and so Ashley couldn\u2019t escape the news. Then she saw the article. There was a picture, of course. Smiling, broad-shouldered Downy with his mitt in his hand, his sandy blond hair lifted by the wind.</p><p>Also in the picture was a female shoulder and arm. He had his arm around a girl who was apparently cropped out of the picture.</p><p>Was it the same girl? Or a new one?</p><p>If he was going to be a pro athlete, Ashley imagined he could have a new girl every week. It depressed her, but she was now completely unsurprised. This guy did not feel like the Downy she had known. She hadn\u2019t thought of her Downy as shallow or ego-driven, though he did love the attention in sports. He had been sweet and loyal. No longer, she thought. She threw the paper in the trash.</p><p>She went home after school, changed into a pair of shorts and walked down to the beach. Spring was a little lazy finding the northern coast, but the weather was getting so nice. The hillside on what Ben had called his bird sanctuary was covered with blossoms and the green of the trees and bushes was brightening. The sun was out almost every day and the water on the bay was as blue as the sky. People had been paddleboarding a lot lately.</p><p>Ashley sat on the sand, knees raised and her arms around them. How many summers had she spent on this beach? How many nights with Downy, partying, making out? She had predicted he\u2019d lose interest in her when he went away to college, but he had said, \u201cWhere am I ever gonna find a girl prettier than you? Or sweeter? Come on!\u201d</p><p>She thought that was going to be the truth, that he was committed. But now as she looked back, during fall and winter he was just some lame freshman, some second string football player who never got to play. He was a pledge, a plebe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Then came baseball and Downy had an atomic arm. He not only started every game, but he also caught everything, hit anything and ran like the wind. They used him as starting pitcher and tried him on first base, as well. His batting average was solid; he had a college and alumni following. He was going to take them all the way to a championship. A freshman!</p><p>Downy was hot shit. And he probably had his pick of girls. And that was all it took.</p> <p>\u201cAshley?\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see Frank standing nearby. Oh, poor timing, Frank! She blinked away some tears that were close to falling. She had just been mourning Downy\u2019s absence.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, hearing the sadness in her own voice.</p><p>Frank sat on the sand, facing her. \u201cYou see that article today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t miss it. It\u2019s got Downy\u2019s fan club pretty excited.\u201d</p> <p>Frank shook his head. \u201cIt got me thinking about something. I bet you counted on Downy taking you to the prom this year.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI promise you, I got over that idea a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know. But I\u2019m not taking anyone. I\u2019d love to take you.\u201d</p><p>She was speechless. She thought it possible he had a crush on her, but even so, what a sweet thing to do! \u201cAre you sweeping up after Downy, Frank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no,\u201d he said with a bitter laugh. \u201cI think he\u2019s an idiot. He\u2019s an idiot getting ready to be a bigger idiot!\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know if he\u2019s a high draft pick, he\u2019ll drop out of college to take it? Like he\u2019s invincible and doesn\u2019t need an education or a career other than baseball.\u201d</p><p>She sat up a little straighter. \u201cSeriously? What do your parents say about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being idiots about it, too. But they don\u2019t really appreciate the value of education\u2014neither of them went to college and they\u2019re pretty satisfied with things. Dad says the union did more for him than an education ever would.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThey think Downy\u2019s going to make millions and build them a big house on the ocean. Crazy.\u201d</p><p>She laughed lightly. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d she asked, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cThe cabbage patch, I think. Doesn\u2019t Downy get that that his whole life is only as good as his rotator cuff or his elbow if he goes with baseball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Frank? He was born to take that on. Athletics has always been the most important thing to Downy. Any sport. He lives that way\u2014it\u2019s his life. Being a star athlete\u2014that was more important to Downy than anything else. And you? Learning is most important to you. I think you\u2019re both going to do well in life, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you already have scholarship offers,\u201d she said. \u201cJust based on your SATs.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI knew it! Well, I guess there\u2019s a lot more to the Downy family than people know. Your folks might not have big flashy degrees, but they have some talented kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks. Back to the prom...\u201d</p><p>She reached out and touched his arm. \u201cYou know what, buddy? If I didn\u2019t have a lot of crap to deal with, I would totally accept that invitation. And it isn\u2019t just about Downy being your brother, either. It\u2019s just that this year, even though I was really looking forward to it, I\u2019m not going. With anyone. Justin Bieber could ask me and I\u2019d say no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good is it going to do to skip it just because my brother acted like such a jerk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about him anymore, Frank. It\u2019s about me. I was so into Downy, it was almost like he absorbed me or something. It seemed so cool to have this popular senior like me, promise to love me forever.... Then when he left me, I couldn\u2019t find myself again. I was so broken. Now my work is to figure out who I am. I want to go back to who I was\u2014I want to be that strong girl again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always seemed strong to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was, back before Downy decided I was the anointed one. Then having him became more important to me than anything else. I didn\u2019t realize it at all, not until he was gone and all I could feel was so empty and lost I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. Did you know I spent a week in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think everyone knows that, Ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cDepression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Depression and feeling like I didn\u2019t want to live. It scared my mom so much, she called the counselor. And while I was in the hospital I met a girl who had the same issues and she tried to fix her boy problems with a razor blade.\u201d She shook her head and shuddered. \u201cYou just can\u2019t mess around with those kind of thoughts, Frank. I\u2019m never losing myself like that again. I had wanted to go to the prom. But I\u2019m not letting a fancy dress or a popular boyfriend be more important to me than living. For God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wan smile.</p><p>\u201cNow why would you smile at that?\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. \u201cI guess because you know what you need now. You\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still struggling,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt so left out that I couldn\u2019t celebrate the draft rumor with him. I would have encouraged him to stay in school, but still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a fucking idiot,\u201d Frank muttered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to hate your brother because of me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLook, Downy took good care of me when I couldn\u2019t take care of myself. When I was skinny little kid who\u2019d rather read than play soccer or sandlot ball. I\u2019ll always owe him for that. I\u2019m not going to feud with him over this, but I have my own opinions. He\u2019s not my hero at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still cry,\u201d she whispered, as if it was a secret.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Me, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew large with the question.</p><p>\u201cI had a dog. The only thing in my family that was really mine. I lived in a house full of jocks and I was the runt. I couldn\u2019t see to get out of bed without my glasses, but Dodger loved me. He died last fall. He was fourteen\u2014long for a Golden, actually. He\u2019s better off\u2014he\u2019d started dragging his hind quarters and I helped him outside to go to the bathroom. No life for a rabbit-chasing, happy, fun-loving dog. But if I think about him, I can still cry. I think loving someone and losing them can leave a hole in your heart. For a while, anyway.\u201d He pulled her hand into his and rubbed his thumb over the back. \u201cBut scars are much tougher than virgin skin. Right?\u201d</p><p>Another thing Ashley hadn\u2019t thought about at all\u2014the Downys\u2019 dog had died. It never occurred to her that he was Frank\u2019s dog. That Frank was grieving.</p><p>\u201cYou should get another dog,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou should get a better boyfriend. One with an IQ higher than a turnip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI think maybe some good came out of this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I feel closer to you. You\u2019ve been so nice.\u201d</p><p>He looked down briefly. Shyly.</p><p>\u201cListen, could you please not tell about the hospital? I think my reputation as a lunatic is going to be hard enough to get over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never tell anything you tell me,\u201d he said.</p><p>They talked for an hour, off the subject of proms and Downy, and on to what colleges they were interested in, what they\u2019d like to do for careers, where they\u2019d most like to live. Frank wasn\u2019t sure what he would study, only that it would have a lot to do with math, and his dream career would be as an inventor. He had questions for her about her goals, none of which she could answer. She had always wanted to follow Downy to college and she hadn\u2019t thought she would ever leave Thunder Point. She had no real career ideas besides being a wife and mother. Things with Downy had changed all that.</p><p>Gina had been helping in her mother\u2019s deli for a good twenty years. Carrie did all the baking and experimenting with new recipes, but Gina could slap together deli sandwiches in record time. If she had time after leaving the diner, Gina would go across the street and give her mother a couple of hours and when Carrie had a party or wedding to cater, it was usually Gina\u2014and sometimes Ashley, as well\u2014to help her serve and clean up after the event. It was rare that neither of them were available, but on those occasions Carrie had a few friends who didn\u2019t mind making a little extra money.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s business had grown lately, which kept Gina busier than usual. People were already ordering graduation cakes. Cooper had made a contract with Carrie for her wrapped and premade deli items for his bar and, with the weather warming up, summer coming and more people on the beach, especially on weekends, he was doing a bigger business\u2014and more food was needed. While Ben, the previous owner, had been happy with simple sandwiches, Cooper encouraged her to try out some new things. She came up with some turkey, ham and salami wraps dressed with spinach leaves and sweet mustard, crab cakes that Cooper could just warm up, shrimp salads, big tomatoes stuffed with shrimp or crab salad, and her special pizzas all made up and ready to pop in the oven for twenty minutes. She had sausage rolls, crab rolls, Caesar salads, fruit plates. All these things could be made ahead and they lasted for three days. Cooper was thrilled and bragged to his friends constantly about the awesome food he served.</p><p>Carrie entered the diner in the midafternoon, right before Gina was finished for the day. She was holding her battered notebook, which usually meant she wanted to brainstorm menu ideas with Gina. Carrie had a few events coming up\u2014a wedding, a baby shower, an anniversary party and the grand opening of the new clinic across the street.</p><p>\u201cCoffee, Mom?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m trying to come up with some new ideas for the same old chicken reception dinner and want your opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust chicken, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019d spend another fifty cents per plate it could be chicken and salmon, but like most young couples, they want to keep the price down. I can actually save them money with this chicken stroganoff recipe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that,\u201d Gina said, mouth watering.</p><p>\u201cI can get by with a little less meat....\u201d</p><p>The door to the diner opened and in walked Marjorie Downy. She was the client who was throwing herself a twentieth anniversary party. Thunder Point people seldom went all out like this, hiring a caterer. But Marjorie was quite proud of this anniversary and Gina had heard she was planning on renewing her vows with her husband.</p><p>\u201cHello, Marjorie,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello,\u201d Carrie added.</p><p>But Marjorie glided forward with a look on her face as though she might have a problem. \u201cI guess it\u2019s best that I caught both of you together, though I tried the deli first. I was going to just take this up with you, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>Carrie closed her notebook. \u201cWe can walk across the street, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. This actually concerns Gina, as well.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cParty time is coming up. I know you rely on Gina and Ashley to help cater events, but I think this time it might not be the best idea. Crawford is coming home for the party.\u201d</p><p>Gina was flabbergasted. \u201cMarjorie, you can\u2019t possibly think I\u2019d let Ashley serve at your party when her ex-boyfriend will be there! This has been hard enough on her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she said, hand to her breast. \u201cI should have known you\u2019d understand, Gina.\u201d Marjorie wasn\u2019t a particularly pretty woman; she was very plain and would be more attractive without so much makeup, and with a more flattering haircut and color. She was hooked on perms and her hair tended to frizz. Her natural color had been dark but with the onset of some gray, she took to yellow streaks. Not blond. Yellow. It appeared striped and the girls in town joked that she was the bride of Frankenstein. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Her appearance wasn\u2019t the problem, of course. She was jealous and insincere by nature and this is what people found most objectionable about her.</p><p>\u201cOf course you heard about the possibility of being a first round draft pick for Crawford?\u201d</p> <p>And uppity.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gina said. \u201cI guess congratulations are in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you. And he\u2019ll be bringing Selena home. It\u2019s getting more serious. She comes from such a nice family. Her father works for a congressman. He\u2019s a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Gina ground her teeth. \u201cYou must be looking forward to that.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little bit. \u201cWe are. Yes, indeed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, rest assured, Ashley won\u2019t be at your party, serving or in any other capacity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI compliment you, Gina. You and your daughter have both handled this situation so well. Rejection can\u2019t be easy and Ashley has been so mature. A credit to you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will your parents be attending the party?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>\u201cMy parents?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey don\u2019t live around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Have they moved?\u201d Carrie asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t they used to live between here and Bandon? Your dad worked on a big commercial fishing boat\u2014he was a crabber. Your mother took in sewing and ironing. Right? Because I was just getting my business off the ground while still working here at the diner and they bought one of my first graduation cakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come here for a cake,\u201d she said, laughing nervously.</p> <p>\u201cI advertised,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI ran coupons. I still have a picture of that cake. And they showed me your picture\u2014so proud of you when you got your diploma. They wanted a flute on it\u2014you played the flute. Nineteen years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been twenty-two years ago.\u201d</p><p>Carrie shook her head. \u201cI was disappointed they didn\u2019t try me for a wedding cake. I so love making wedding cakes. It\u2019s not my specialty, but I think I do a fairly decent job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mixed up, but no matter. No, my parents won\u2019t be coming. They\u2019re not doing very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cPlease, give them my regards. I\u2019ll be bringing some other servers to your party, not my girls. Anything else you want to check? Still happy with the menu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said a bit sourly. \u201cI\u2019d better finish my errands....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTill later then, Marjorie,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>When she was gone Gina turned to her mother. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t her twentieth anniversary. It\u2019s her nineteenth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Downy is nineteen!\u201d</p><p>Carrie shrugged. \u201cMust have taken some time to sort out. I know she didn\u2019t graduate with her class. Her mother told me she dropped out and got a GED. She got pregnant in high school and didn\u2019t marry her husband until after the baby was born.\u201d</p><p>Gina was speechless for a moment. \u201cAfter all the cruel things she\u2019s said to me and about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she thinks no one knows, she\u2019s been lying about it so long. And when was the last time you saw Downy\u2019s grandparents in town? They go visit them, they rarely, if ever, come here. But some of us have been around here a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve known this all along?\u201d Gina asked. \u201cAnd never said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to make bad karma. It\u2019ll bite you in the ass eventually. But I slipped\u2014she just pushed me too far, bragging on that girl who sent texts of that awful picture of Ashley. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t have taken on this job, but I can\u2019t afford to turn away neighbors in a town of only fifteen hundred. And if they\u2019re decent, I can keep their secrets, but Marjorie tries my patience.\u201d</p><p>Gina let a huff of laughter escape her. \u201cAll this time...how on earth did you remember? Dates and everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never forget a cake,\u201d Carrie said with an innocent shrug.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Cooper set up the RV for Spencer and Austin to use on their upcoming weekend visit. Sarah helped him wipe down the dusty surfaces and she changed the sheets on the bed while he cleaned the bathroom and stocked the refrigerator. \u201cIf the boy is going to visit sometimes, he should have a house,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHe has a house in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so jittery,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cHe\u2019ll love this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tin can,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhy have I never had a house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re shiftless,\u201d she told him with a laugh.</p><p>Not only did he make sure Rawley was on board to help him cover the weekend, but he also asked Landon to be there. He couldn\u2019t serve drinks, but he could serve food and help with clean up. And Landon, trying to get ready to take his girl to the prom, was more than happy for the extra work.</p><p>Friday afternoon finally arrived and Spencer drove his rental car down the road to the bar. After parking the car, he and Austin headed to the deck surrounding the property. Spencer looked around the bay and promontories, took a deep breath of the coastal air and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky man, Cooper,\u201d he said.</p><p>Austin was quiet, seeming very shy about the whole visit idea. He met the welcoming party\u2014Sarah, Rawley, Landon\u2014politely. He viewed the bay and ocean passively. \u201cAre we going on that?\u201d he asked, pointing to the Jet Ski.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll take you out on it,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cWhat else will we do?\u201d he asked, looking completely unimpressed.</p><p>\u201cWell, we can take the Rhino into town. I can show you how to paddleboard. We can fish off the dock. We\u2019ll find stuff to do.\u201d Cooper felt as if he was drowning\u2014this was not going to be easy.</p><p>Then Austin pointed at the toy hauler and asked, \u201cIs that where we\u2019re staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it can be. Or, if you\u2019re more comfortable in the bait shop, there\u2019s a very small apartment upstairs\u2014big enough for you and your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBait shop?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt used to be a bait shop with a bar in it and now it\u2019s a bar without any bait. Let\u2019s take a look at the RV first.\u201d Inside, Cooper\u2019s heart sank a little bit. He didn\u2019t have anything good enough for a son and he felt unprepared and a little like an underachiever.</p><p>They grabbed the luggage and headed over to the RV. Cooper opened the door of the toy hauler and let Austin step in first, followed by Spencer.</p><p>Austin stood in the middle of the living room and turned full circle, looking around, taking it in. Cooper was prepared for him to say something about it being a trailer, which it was. Then he turned to Cooper with bright eyes and said, \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d</p><p>The weekend went better than Cooper had dared hope. The weather cooperated and they spent a lot of time on the water. Despite sunscreen, Austin got himself a little color. The toy hauler was full of sand from all his running in and out and so was the bar. Cooper\u2019s upstairs apartment was like an indoor beach. They were going to have to revisit foot wiping. Austin not only loved the Jet Ski, but also bonded with Hamlet, who spent a lot of time at the bar over the weekend. Austin got to drive the Rhino across the beach with Landon as co-pilot. At night, they had a fire on the beach and roasted marshmallows.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can compete with this,\u201d Spencer said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I could compete with ten years of history so let\u2019s go ahead and write up a noncompete clause,\u201d Cooper said, only half-serious.</p><p>Cooper hadn\u2019t even considered the importance of having fun himself\u2014he felt a huge responsibility to give fun. But, in the end, the weekend was satisfying. Spencer took off on his own a couple of times, exploring the general area, leaving Cooper and Austin on their own.</p><p>Once the weekend was done and he was back on his own, Cooper settled in to do the thing he\u2019d been working up to. Knowing his parents were early risers, he phoned them early Tuesday morning\u2014it was barely 7:00 a.m. in Albuquerque.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou and Mom both up? Had your coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp and caffeinated. How are you, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Listen, can you get Mom on the phone or put me on speaker? I have something to explain to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re on speaker.\u201d Then his father said to his mother, \u201cHe has something to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, are you all right? You\u2019re not sick are you?\u201d his mother asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Perfect. Listen, this surprised the hell out of me so I know it\u2019s going to really shock you. Um. Remember Bridget...?\u201d</p><p>On a sunny Saturday afternoon in May Frank Downy walked a few blocks to Ashley\u2019s house. He had a backpack and a soft cooler. When Ashley came to the door he asked, \u201cAre you busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I was helping my grandma make cookies. Want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And how about putting a few in a baggie and come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to the beach and the south promontory,\u201d he said. He lifted the cooler. \u201cI came prepared for a little adventure.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him suspiciously, but she couldn\u2019t help her smile. She had no idea little Frank would grow into his looks and become a hottie. \u201cWhat are you up to, Frank? Shouldn\u2019t you be going to the prom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to the prom, Ash. Why would I? You\u2019ll need tennis shoes\u2014we\u2019re going to take a little hike. You\u2019ll like it, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to take my mind off the prom. You don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. \u201cLandon even offered to have two dates, but I\u2019m still happy with my decision. I don\u2019t want to go this year. Next year, maybe. Not this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d love to take credit for doing something so chivalrous, but it\u2019s a total coincidence. I was down on the docks this morning talking to a couple of the crabbers\u2014the gray whales are running heavy. One of them said yesterday they saw several breach. They\u2019re feeding on crustaceans close to shore on their way back to the Bering Sea from Baja. One of the guys said he thought more than the usual number is hanging around our coastline and not migrating this year. I thought we\u2019d go out to Ben\u2019s point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s private....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Cooper if he\u2019d mind. We won\u2019t disturb anything. Dusk is a good time.\u201d He turned around. \u201cI have everything we need. Blanket, binoculars, flashlight for getting back, Duraflame for the beach afterward. There\u2019s a path out to the point. Not a good one, but a path. Come on\u2014the flora is in bloom out there. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cFlowers, plant life, flora\u2014whatever. And the birds are all in love, I can tell you that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the whales? Are they in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took care of that in Baja,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m going. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cPut on some long pants and grab a sweatshirt,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of berry bushes out there. They\u2019ll scratch up your legs. And you know, when the sun goes down\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Frank. I\u2019ve lived here my whole life. Should I make us a couple of sandwiches?\u201d</p><p>He lifted the cooler just as Gina was coming up behind Ashley. \u201cI did already. We\u2019re set. Sandwiches, chips, case of beer...\u201d He smiled at Gina. \u201cKidding. Diet Coke and green tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me a minute,\u201d Ashley said, whirling off to her room to get changed.</p><p>Gina stepped toward the front door. \u201cThis is very nice of you, Frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I was going out there, anyway. I went from the marina to the bait shop to ask Cooper if he\u2019d mind if I hiked out to the bird sanctuary, and then I thought, maybe Ashley had nothing to do.\u201d He could feel a little color on his cheeks. Being sixteen could be a royal pain. He\u2019d been killing himself trying to think of something that might distract her on prom night and just lucked into the whales. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWell, come inside. Let\u2019s see what else we can stuff in that cooler,\u201d she said.</p><p>But he had it pretty well stocked. In addition to the sandwiches and chips he had veggies and fruit.</p> <p>Carrie grinned when he came into the kitchen as she\u2019d obviously heard the exchange at the door. \u201cHere you go,\u201d she said, handing him a bag of cookies. \u201cAnd is there room for this?\u201d she asked, pulling a small, disposable plastic container out of the refrigerator. \u201cPasta and crab salad? Just fresh today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>She handed him two plastic forks. \u201cDo you have napkins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd wet wipes,\u201d he said with a shy smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dream date,\u201d Gina said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a date,\u201d he said. And he thought, I\u2019m not a date, thanks to my idiot brother.</p><p>\u201cI could call my friend Sarah and borrow her Razor and you could drive across the beach,\u201d Gina offered. \u201cIf you left it by Cooper\u2019s while you go out on the point, it would be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m up for the hike. If Ashley is.\u201d</p><p>She came bouncing into the room, jeans and tennis shoes on, hoodie tied around her waist. \u201cOf course I\u2019m up for it. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to move it. I don\u2019t want to get out there too late. Once the sun sets, the show is over. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me carry something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got it. When we have to go uphill you can have one of these handles.\u201d Then he looked at Gina and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley has her phone,\u201d she said. \u201cJust be careful and have fun.\u201d</p><p>Gina called Cooper. \u201cHey, it\u2019s me, Gina. Frank came by and said he asked if he could go out on the point to look for whales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAffirmative,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cPermission granted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has food, a blanket, a Duraflame.... The log is for the sand, not the point, I take it. So, I think this is great\u2014something for Ashley to do on prom night. But I\u2019m just saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here all evening, Gina,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter Sarah takes pictures of Landon and Eve before they head off to prom, she\u2019s coming over. I see some deck time coming my way. I\u2019ll keep my eyes and ears open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really worried about her. She has her phone,\u201d Gina said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a real rocky spring.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cTell me about it! The whole world tilted on its axis!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess it did, didn\u2019t it? Have I said congratulations yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of times, I think. Don\u2019t worry about Ash. Downy might be a dipshit who\u2019s going to regret his manly moves, but I think Frank\u2019s a standup guy. And for the record, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s just cleaning up Downy\u2019s mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know he can name every plant and bird on that point?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><p>Ashley had been on picnics all her life, but she\u2019d never been on a picnic with Frank. It was like a biology class, but more fun.</p><p>Instead of climbing the stairs to Cooper\u2019s deck, they walked up the drive, then out toward the point.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been out here in a while,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThis place is covered with pine and manzanita, but there are some beautiful plants\u2014wild ginger, salal, iris, ocean spray and even swamp rose, which is typically an east coast plant. The last time I was out here I counted ten types of fern\u2014deer fern, chain fern, maidenhair, lady. There are several lilies, including mariposa, and that usually grows on the mountainsides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know all these plants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked them up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a flowering currant and that\u2019s Pacific blackberry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Geek, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s cool,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBen was more interested in the birds\u2014the loon, eagle, belted kingfisher, cormorant, merganser. I think he counted all the different birds he\u2019d seen out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you into birds, too?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better with stars,\u201d he said. \u201cI should say I\u2019m more interested in them. Here we go,\u201d he said, reaching the end of the point. He dropped the cooler and backpack and pulled out a blanket to sit on and the binoculars, which he gave to her. \u201cI\u2019m counting on you to sight the first breach.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the binoculars and trained them on the sea. She was quiet for long moments before she said, \u201cI saw a spout, but it\u2019s a million miles out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope some come closer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good day for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you do this often? Whale watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpring and fall,\u201d he said. He took an apple out of the cooler and offered it to Ashley. When she shook her head, he bit into it. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d hitch a ride out with a fisherman. Nobody minds me. I\u2019m quiet. Sometimes I\u2019d come out here. Ben didn\u2019t care because I was careful not to disturb anything. Sometimes he came with me. Before Dodger\u2019s arthritis got bad, he\u2019d come, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a dog since I was four,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cShe was my mom\u2019s dog. She was real old even then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t get another one,\u201d he pointed out to her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t feel that way about boyfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do right now,\u201d she said, but she smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long time. And I\u2019m going to be much fussier. I\u2019m not hooking up with some big dumb jock who has an ego the size of California.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled. Then he pointed. \u201cSpout. It\u2019s much closer.\u201d</p><p>She went back to watching, but without the binoculars. She scanned the horizon and saw another spout, a few minutes later. After about an hour, they each had a sandwich and a cookie, broke out some drinks, saw a few more spouts.</p><p>When the sun started to get a little lower over the Pacific, Ashley spotted a few dark humps in the water and wordlessly pointed.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Frank said. And no sooner had he said that than there was a big breach, all the way up out of the water, not too far off the coast. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d</p><p>Ashley had never done anything like this with Downy. If they were together, he wanted to be either throwing a ball or making out. But they had talked on their phones all the time\u2014they even had to get a special plan for exchanging calls so they wouldn\u2019t have such high monthly call charges. Several calls and many texts passed between them every day. Her grandma would say, \u201cYou young people text each other when you\u2019re in the same room together. Don\u2019t you realize you have to communicate to have a relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank? Do you text many people?\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug, his eyes focused on the ocean. \u201cIf there\u2019s a reason. By the way, that text that went around? I knew that was a fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cAsh, you have a nice figure but that obviously wasn\u2019t your chest.\u201d And he colored a little.</p><p>\u201cNo joke,\u201d she said with a laugh. Oh, my God, was she laughing at that horrible incident now?</p><p>\u201cEveryone knew, except idiots,\u201d he said. \u201cThere. Look out there.\u201d</p><p>And sure enough, a pod. Close to shore. There were a couple of tail splashes and another breach. As Ashley knew, you could go whale watching for hours and never see anything.</p><p>\u201cDo you date at all?\u201d she asked Frank.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been out a few times. Nothing special. I mean, nice girls.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaula from science club. We doubled with Kurt and Lynette. Paula is not very happy with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I just wanted to be friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she wanted to get married.\u201d</p><p>Ashley crumbled into laughter.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that funny,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. But that\u2019s the thing about girls,\u201d she informed him. \u201cWe all want to live happily ever after. And the sooner, the better. Even the ones who want some major career achievement still want to be adored forever. Believe me, Frank, it causes a world of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you? Want to marry Downy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely! We even talked about it\u2014made crazy promises to each other about forever. We had plans\u2014right after college he was going to go pro and we\u2019d have a big wedding and I\u2019d follow the team to games.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cSo much for that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d Frank asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to punch him in the face,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a brick.\u201d</p><p>Frank\u2019s smile was huge. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to move this party to the beach,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a log. I\u2019ll show you some popular constellations. If you\u2019re up for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI might have to make a stop at Cooper\u2019s. And, Frank? Am I getting credit for this course?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get anything you want, Ash. How many whales did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Twenty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember everything?\u201d</p><p>He shook out the blanket to get the dirt and dried pine needles off. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a curse.\u201d</p><p>The sun was setting a bit later over the ocean and it was Saturday night, big night in Thunder Point. Cooper had been busy, but by eight-thirty there was just one couple sitting on the deck, a candle on their table, a beer and a glass of wine before them. They\u2019d come across the beach in their golf cart and would go back the same way. Cooper wiped down the bar and took a glass of wine out to the deck for Sarah, bringing a beer for himself. There was a small fire out on the beach\u2014Ashley and Frank. They were lying on their backs, looking up at the star-filled sky. Before sitting down he said to his last two guests, \u201cLet me know if you need anything, folks. I\u2019ll be right over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Then he joined Sarah. He leaned back and propped his feet up on the opposite chair.</p><p>\u201cI think you like this life,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to like? A night in May by the ocean. And you right beside me.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cLandon will be out late. We can sneak upstairs.\u201d He gave her a purely lascivious grin. \u201cFor a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me how your family reacted to your news. I\u2019m dying to hear about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d He sat up straighter. \u201cIt was classic. My father was speechless and my mother started to cry. Austin is the same age as one of my nephews. Our conversation was a little awkward\u2014they wanted details on how Bridget got pregnant six or eight months or a year after we broke up. I did the best I could with that\u2014told them we\u2019d called off the engagement but still saw each other sometimes. You know\u2014old habits are hard to break. My mother said, \u2018Henry Cooper!\u2019 at least once. I tried to put Spencer in a good light\u2014he and Bridget had been dating, but hadn\u2019t gotten too serious until... Well, you know. But word spread and my sisters got in touch. They were ruthless\u2014each one of them called me. They wanted all the intimate details of everything! They wanted to know who was sleeping with whom and when.\u201d He chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI told each one of them that the only really important things is that I was never, at any time, sleeping with Spencer. If you come from a family like mine, it is impossible to have a personal life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She pulled up her feet, circling her knees with her arms and resting her chin on her knees. \u201cAre they happy with the news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re a little too intrigued by the biology of it all. I promised to take Austin to meet them sometime. Probably this summer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a little intrigued with the biology?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI have it figured out. The important thing is that Spencer has it figured out, too. Our engagement had been broken off for over six months and even though I blew into town sometimes, she was moving on. I knew that even if I didn\u2019t take her seriously enough. She\u2019d been dating\u2014she\u2019d met someone she really liked a lot. And if you knew the Bridget I knew... She was extremely straightforward and honest, almost to a fault. Had she known, she would have told us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut have you wondered about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was tested, Sarah....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, others? Have you wondered if this is the only time, the only one?\u201d</p> <p>He leaned back and laced his fingers behind his head, looking up at the sky. \u201cThe truth is, I did a memory check. It\u2019s possible there was a miracle before I met Bridget, and I say miracle because I was always careful. Responsible. Not because I\u2019m some angel, but because I wasn\u2019t looking to get tied down. And I know this is probably hard to believe, but I never liked one-night stands. Seemed like I either had no woman in my life or I specialized in brief engagements. That all came to an end after Patti. I was a monk after that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she said, peering at him.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel good, Sarah. I can\u2019t blame anyone but myself, but it wasn\u2019t... Hmm, how do I put this? An optimal experience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get over that?\u201d</p><p>He reached over and gave her back a gentle rub. \u201cOh, yeah. I think it\u2019s highly improbable there were any other unknown children from my past. You know what I think about a lot more? That I might\u2019ve never known about him. If Bridget had lived a long and happy life, they might not have known. Or even under the circumstances, they could have decided not to tell him. Or me. Most families are notorious secret keepers if not outright liars. Everyone in my family hides Aunt Mercedes\u2019s tippling and we don\u2019t talk about Grandpa\u2019s earlier years\u2014the ones where he had this other family, the one he left to make our family.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAre those some of your family secrets?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not secrets, they\u2019re just things we don\u2019t talk about in front of Aunt Mercedes or Grandma and Grandpa. And I\u2019m sure there are lots more\u2014I have three sisters. My mom and the girls\u2014they love that stuff. They trade in secrets. Dad and I are kind of...\u201d He shrugged as if to say Who cares?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute...Austin. What a happy kid. I mean, after all he\u2019s been through lately, he sure knows how to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to remember, he\u2019s known about me for months\u2014Bridget and Spencer told him long before they told me. And that other awful thing\u2014losing his mother. He\u2019d been losing her for a long time. On some level it might have been a relief for him to be a kid again, not worried and sad every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe reminded me of Landon at that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was probably the hardest time of my life and yet the most fulfilling. He was only five when we lost our parents. I wrestled him away from mean old Aunt Frances when he was six and I struggled adapting to the life of a single mother who was also a Coast Guard pilot. It was so hard to keep up with everything\u2014so hard to take care of him, be a parent, get to the school and sport events, find the right people to keep him overnight or after school. But he was the light of my life\u2014so funny and smart and...and...he just loved me so much, even when I was inadequate. Oh, and I so often felt inadequate!\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed softly, stroking her back. \u201cI bet you were not even close to being inadequate. Look at him now. He\u2019s amazing. Austin followed him around like a puppy all weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were kind of cute together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few months ago you told me that you had this dream of having a kid of your own....\u201d</p><p>\u201cA silly thing,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, Landon is as much my own as any baby could be. Don\u2019t worry about that. That\u2019s never going to happen....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve given up on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-three with twelve years toward retirement responsible for a kid who\u2019s going to be a senior in high school and then looking at colleges. I think the die\u2019s been cast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know. The right man could show up and then everything looks different....\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHah. I\u2019ve been taking care of myself and Landon for a long time now. It\u2019s a habit and a personal priority\u2014I support myself. I\u2019ll always support myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI have an idea. Let\u2019s sneak upstairs while Landon\u2019s at the prom and see if...ahem...the right man shows up and makes things a little different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lobbying for another family, Mr. Cooper?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou still have two customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick them out,\u201d he said, leaning toward her.</p><p>She let him have a chaste kiss, but she pushed him away. \u201cWhen you\u2019re closed for the night, I\u2019ll sneak upstairs with you for a little while. But don\u2019t get the idea you\u2019re going to change my life.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cYou know the problem with you, Commander Dupre? You just don\u2019t keep an open mind. I could take you to bed and change everything. You could discover you just can\u2019t live without me.\u201d</p><p>She ran a finger down his scruffy cheek. \u201cAnd the problem with you, Mr. Cooper\u2014you think you can solve everything with good sex.\u201d</p><p>His grin broadened. \u201cIt is good, isn\u2019t it, Sarah.\u201d It was not a question. \u201cWell, one thing at a time.\u201d He threw a glance over his shoulder at the couple down at the end of the deck. \u201cShould I tell them it\u2019s time for them to go?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her glass and said, \u201cJust get me another glass of wine and leave those nice people alone.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>In a place like Thunder Point there were several key locations to run into friends and acquaintances\u2014Cooper\u2019s beach bar, being one. In the time he had been here, Cooper had met a lot of people. The beach in general found people walking, jogging, fishing off Cooper\u2019s dock, kayaking, just sitting on the sand or a handy rock, enjoying the view. The diner in town was a convenient gathering place, and so was the main drag through town.</p><p>But today was the first time he\u2019d ever been called and asked to meet someone. Mac McCain rang him up and said, \u201cYou free to come over to Cliffhanger\u2019s for a beer? There\u2019s something to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAs long as I can get back here before it gets busy this evening. Anything in particular I should prepare myself for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just bring your laid-back self.\u201d</p><p>While Cooper was crossing the beach on his Rhino, maneuvering around the big rocks that dotted the landscape, he pondered that statement. Laid-back. Huh. That was the funny thing\u2014he actually had not seen himself that way. At least not until he\u2019d taken up residence in Thunder Point, which was, in so many ways, just a simple, easy place. There was no shortage of challenges. In fact, his closest friends were having the greatest challenges at the moment. Mac\u2019s ex-wife had been lurking, making him wonder what she was up to and Gina was worried about her. And Sarah...ah, Sarah! She\u2019d been worried about some work issue she had yet to share, but this talk of hers that she\u2019d always support herself had an independent ring to it that made him nervous. And even with all that, Cooper couldn\u2019t help but think that as long as they had this\u2014the sound of the sea, the compact cocoon of a town and the reliability and loyalty of its people\u2014things would work out fine.</p><p>Yes, he was now laid-back. Prior to this he\u2019d always been a little high-strung, working things over in his mind, thinking too much or too hard. Worrying about what the future might bring or where it would lead him.</p><p>He parked the Rhino at Cliff\u2019s and went into the bar. He saw Mac, the football coach and Cliff sitting at a table in the bar. He walked over.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a board meeting,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>All three men stood. Mac put out his hand. Mac was in uniform and had a cup of coffee in front of him while the other two men were nursing beers. \u201cThanks for coming over, Cooper. Coach Rayborough, this is Cooper. He\u2019s the newcomer here. Have you two met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met in passing,\u201d Cooper said, shaking the man\u2019s hand. He hadn\u2019t really thought of himself as the newcomer, but that was probably accurate. He was no longer someone passing through. He\u2019d settled in, made himself a part of the town. It seemed as if every other place he\u2019d lived before this, he\u2019d always been thinking about where he\u2019d go next. That had definitely changed for him and there was only one caveat\u2014Sarah. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ve seen each other at games and around town,\u201d Cooper added. Then he shook Cliff\u2019s hand. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d the man replied. \u201cA beer\u2019s on the way over. Take a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis looks downright ominous,\u201d Cooper said, pulling out a chair. And before they could get down to it, his beer arrived.</p><p>\u201cWhen Cooper showed up in town, he looked like some kind of jet jockey\u2014leather bomber jacket and boots and short hair. Now he\u2019s starting to look like a beachcomber,\u201d Mac said with a laugh.</p><p>Cooper looked down at himself\u2014soft scrubbed jeans, sweatshirt, well-worn topsiders on his feet. His hair had got a little long and he needed to take time for a haircut. As far as he was concerned, he was attired in the uniform of the day.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some news coming our way,\u201d Mac said. \u201cCoach?\u201d</p><p>The older man cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough year, but I don\u2019t have to tell you that. You\u2019re here because you lost a good friend\u2014Ben Bailey. And you\u2019re good friends with Landon Dupre. We all know he went through some hard times when he first moved here.</p><p>\u201cI expected to teach and coach till I\u2019m seventy-five,\u201d the coach said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here a long time. Been growing up the young men in this town for decades. I\u2019m sixty-five. I think it\u2019s time for me to step down, let a younger man take over, if one can be found.\u201d He shook his head sadly. \u201cI missed so many warning signs\u2014I was coaching a kid who had been a lethal bully for years and I never saw what was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve told the coach, there were a lot of us who regarded Jag Morrison as a spoiled pain in the ass, but never realized he was capable of taking that to the next level,\u201d Mac said, referring to the kid who was now in detention for manslaughter. Mac lifted his coffee cup to his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hold yourself accountable for him, Coach,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cNo more than I can. I\u2019ve been friends with his dad, Puck, for years and I couldn\u2019t stand the way Jag treated his folks or the folks around town, but I never said anything. I never did anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could you have done?\u201d the coach said. \u201cI was in a position to take a stand\u2014he was my player.\u201d He turned his attention to Cooper. \u201cI\u2019ve written a letter of intent to the school board and they\u2019ll receive it tomorrow. I\u2019m resigning as athletic director and head coach effective the end of the school year. I can stay on as a consultant to a new coach\u2014I know the town, I know the boys. But that\u2019s the best I can do. I think the team needs better instincts, younger eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took the team all-conference last year,\u201d Cooper pointed out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Coach Rayborough shook his head, looking down. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to impress on the kids that there\u2019s more to it than just winning. It\u2019s about making your school and your parents and your town proud, and that goes beyond the field.\u201d</p><p>Cooper took a drink from his beer. Then he asked, \u201cHave you thought this through? Maybe you\u2019re just disappointed. You have a right to be\u2014you were as let down as anyone in learning that your team captain was felonious. But the boys\u2014they held it together through some pretty rugged stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI went to his sentencing hearing today,\u201d the coach said solemnly. \u201cI watched a boy not yet eighteen sentenced to prison and he still smirked and laughed as he was being led away. There\u2019s evil there. And I never saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with me?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cDupre, for one,\u201d Coach said. \u201cThe kids in this town need good coaching, good role models. Most of \u2019em come from simple families\u2014fishermen, small business owners, folks with jobs out of town, public servants. These aren\u2019t rich folks. Their kids need scholarships if they can get \u2019em. They all work, with few exceptions. They get through high school struggling for the best grades, hold part-time jobs and if they\u2019re athletic or musical, they put a lot of time and heart into developing those skills to help them land scholarships. We\u2019ve been real lucky\u2014we\u2019ve turned out some damn fine athletes. There have only been a couple of pros out of Thunder Point, but there have been a lot of college degrees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper,\u201d Mac said. \u201cHow\u2019s your game?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and he snapped to attention. \u201cMy game?\u201d He laughed. \u201cFirst of all, I have a year and a few credits of college and that\u2019s it. I could teach just about anyone how to fly a helicopter, but not much else. Second, I played sandlot football\u2014I could catch a ball if someone walked across the parking lot and handed it to me. Is that why you wanted me to come over? Hoping I could step up? Because, man, I love the game but...but I love the game enough to stay the hell out of the coaching business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, I wanted to call you because of Landon,\u201d Mac said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot riding on his senior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re his mentor,\u201d Mac said. \u201cYou\u2019re his closest adult male influence. He probably can talk to you about things he can\u2019t really talk to Sarah about. He might be in the market for some serious moral support. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s counting on the coach being there.\u201d</p><p>Cooper shot Coach Rayborough a look. \u201cListen, I get that you\u2019ve had about enough. I understand, seriously. But if there\u2019s not a decent coach on scene...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can,\u201d he said, but he was shaking his head. \u201cMy best just isn\u2019t so great these days. I thought you could bring this up with Sarah. Of course, she and Landon should call me if they want to talk, but there\u2019s plenty of time before practice starts at the end of summer for them to look around. There are other schools and even private schools in the general area and if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you said, Coach\u2014Landon had a hard time settling in here, but now he\u2019s established. He has good grades, the boy\u2019s got serious game and there\u2019s the girlfriend, not to mention other friends.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t see him volunteering to change schools for his senior year. Matter of fact, I had to do that because of my dad\u2019s job and I still remember how tough it was.\u201d He drank some of his beer. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to hope for the best. You probably know every coach and teacher in the county and beyond. You have any ideas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s some talent out there, but even though we\u2019re a good school and a tough team, we\u2019re small. Starting pay isn\u2019t impressive. I\u2019ll start doing some serious asking around, but we\u2019re probably going to draw attention from young men without a great deal of experience or an exciting track record. Those folks tend to head for the colleges, then the bigger universities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you leave, Coach?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI like it here,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cI like the high school kids\u2014I like taking the raw talent with minimal funding and working it hard, molding it into something bigger than this little seaside town. I like watching those kids come off the field like rockets, all lit up after they\u2019ve taken down one of the big schools\u2014big schools from districts with money to spend. When we do it, it\u2019s harder. But it means more.\u201d</p><p>Cooper leaned toward him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t quit until you find the right person to take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let the town or the school down, but I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. I\u2019m discouraged. I don\u2019t mind telling you\u2014I\u2019m tired. It takes a lot of positive energy to crank up those boys. I\u2019m better off assisting, not trying to lead. Not right now. Now you just talk to Landon and his sister. Tell \u2019em to call me if they need to, but fill \u2019em in. Landon\u2014he\u2019s a leader. If he chooses to stay at this school, on this team, he could make a difference. If he chose another team, I\u2019d understand. Anyone would understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me just ask you something,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhy do you want me to talk to him? Why don\u2019t you just talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019d see in one second that I\u2019m giving up. That isn\u2019t the best message for a kid who\u2019s gonna have a lot on his shoulders if he picks this town. But you can do it, Cooper. Mac says the boy relies on you. And I know he\u2019s got the heart if he has the backing.\u201d</p><p>Cooper finished his beer. He regretted that he\u2019d given Landon the job\u2014he\u2019d be at the bar, washing dishes, sweeping up, running food to tables, serving up sodas or bottled drinks, smiling like a kid who\u2019d won the lotto. And after the heavy lifting was done for the day, Cooper was going to tell him his coach was quitting and break his heart.</p> <p>When he got back to his place, Landon was sitting at one of the tables in the bar, apron on, books open. There were a couple of people out on the deck and they\u2019d been served. It had been Cooper who suggested that if things were quiet and Rawley was caught up, he use the time to get some of his homework done. Soon enough they\u2019d hit their busy time when the sun started down over the Pacific and Landon would be on his feet.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if he could put off this news about the coach until school was out for the summer. But, if Coach Rayborough was giving a letter to the school board so they could post the job and get busy looking at possible candidates, word would get out. Mac was going to tell Eve that night; Cooper should tell Landon so he\u2019d have time to think.</p><p>And then as if the universe conspired, Sarah showed up at about eight o\u2019clock, just as the last of the customers was leaving.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could heat up a couple of pizza slices or something?\u201d she said. And then she immediately said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong, but I have to talk to you and Landon. Is everyone gone from the deck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a couple of people leaning on the deck rail, looking at the bay, but I think they\u2019re about to go. Landon picked up their glasses and dishes. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He was behind the bar; she was sitting up on a stool facing him. He poured her a glass of wine while Landon bustled his dishes back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI had a beer with Mac and Coach Rayborough this afternoon. The coach\u2014he\u2019s worn down by all the trouble last year, by the fact that he had a player in trouble and missed all the signals. I think he\u2019s just worn out, to tell you the truth. He\u2019s getting on in years and the kids kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper!\u201d</p><p>He leaned on the bar. \u201cHe\u2019s going to retire, Sarah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not public yet, but he hopes there will be a new coach in place by the end of summer and he was real honest\u2014he\u2019s too tired for this. A new coach could be inexperienced and young. Rayborough could assist, but he\u2019d rather just move on. He suggested that you and Landon might consider other schools, even private schools, where Landon could get the most and the best\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped when Sarah closed her eyes, tilted her head back and her lips took on that twisted, tortured look of someone who was fighting tears. She lost the fight, of course\u2014a couple of big ones escaped and she wiped at them furiously.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cGod, could the kid catch a break?\u201d she whispered back. \u201cJust when he\u2019s weathered some of his toughest days, the winning coach who\u2019s going to bring him out as quarterback for his senior year, showcase him and set him up for a scholarship...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the only game in town, Sarah. Plus there\u2019s scholarship and grant money out there\u2014there are good loans at the moment. And hell, I\u2019d help. You know I\u2019d...\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cNapkin?\u201d she asked. He handed her one and she blew her nose. Then she fanned her face with her fingers. And then Landon was back from the bar.</p><p>Landon had taken off his apron and had his backpack over on shoulder. \u201cNeed anything else, Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just one more thing. I have some news to pass along. I\u2019m glad your sister is here because I said I\u2019d tell her, too.\u201d Then he went through the details, the suggested options, the challenges and possible changes. \u201cThe coach said if you have a lot riding on this season, you should at least consider other schools....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said, shaking his head. Then he looked at his sister. \u201cNot unless we have to, but God I hope we don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon, if you don\u2019t have a good coach or a solid team, it could really affect your ability to get noticed, to get help with tuition....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll borrow money. Hey, maybe I\u2019ll go Coast Guard or Army or something. But if I don\u2019t have to, I\u2019m not leaving town. We have a good team\u2014we have a good little town. I have friends here. There\u2019s Eve...\u201d Then he looked at Cooper. \u201cIs Coach all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay, Landon. He\u2019s been coaching forty years now\u2014he\u2019s a little worn out. Last year was a bad year for him\u2014he took things with Jag real personally. He said he\u2019ll hang close to help the new coach. He said if you don\u2019t consider your options, you\u2019re going to have one helluva load on your shoulders. Teammates will expect a lot from you. He also said to call him if you want to talk about it, but he asked me to tell you because we\u2019re...\u201d He stopped for a minute. Then he shrugged. \u201cBecause we\u2019re friends and I never miss a game.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cDoes Eve know?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cooper nodded. \u201cMac\u2019s going to tell her, but listen\u2014it\u2019s not official. You can talk to Eve, but you have to sit on this for a little while, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll talk to Eve. Then I\u2019ll call Coach. It\u2019s okay. I bet he doesn\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019m not going to freak out. We have a good team. I know that. I know it.\u201d Then he looked at Sarah. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you the Razor to take home. I need the walk. And the think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d rather not talk about it yet. But it\u2019s okay. Really, it\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>When Carrie asked her closest friend, Lou McCain, if she could help cater the Downys\u2019 anniversary party, Lou smiled. \u201cI\u2019d much rather serve than attend as a guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cOf course, if you\u2019ve been invited, you have to go! I\u2019ll find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I want to serve. That noodle-head Marjorie sent an invitation to me and another to Mac\u2014both said no additional guests. She knows perfectly well that Mac and Gina are a couple. Does she think Mac wants to go with his old-maid aunt? I think she\u2019s getting a little too big for her britches.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been very nice to Gina,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s a fool.

He doesn\u2019t discriminate, so he tries to be everyone\u2019s friend, especially in the good times.

She\u2019s never helped me. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show her what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a little truce going. I had a drink with her when I was banned from the house so Cee Jay could see the kids. We may not like each other but we have a very nice understanding. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Carrie said with a laugh. \u201cAnd how long will that last?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re good. It\u2019ll be fine. She can wear her satin, low-cut, supershort waitress uniform with the seven-inch heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you squabble and snipe at each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass that by her, tell her you\u2019re worried about that,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cYou talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had the occasional glass of wine, nothing big. So?\u201d</p><p>Carrie narrowed her eyes. \u201cIf you start to bicker, I\u2019m going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Lou laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an invited guest,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel right about this.\u201d</p> <p>Lou laughed again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll hit the next twentieth anniversary party in a couple of years.\u201d</p><p>Carrie gasped. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t know? She\u2019s been fudging that for a long time now. Everyone knows. So what? She got caught. It\u2019s been known to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve only lived here four years! I\u2019ve been here since before they moved to Thunder Point!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, everyone knows. See, here\u2019s the lesson\u2014if you have secrets to keep, at least be nice so people feel like helping you keep them. Marjorie has been a pain in the ass because she thinks she\u2019s going to buy the world with her son\u2019s future in pro baseball.\u201d Then she reflected, looking up. \u201cThe kid is amazing. I bet he\u2019s going to kill \u2019em with that arm.\u201d Then she grew serious. \u201cMarjorie should remember, it\u2019s not her arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, much as I\u2019d love to give her a large piece of my mind, I have a business to run and my only goal for this party is that it be perfect. If I were rich or even more comfortable financially, I wouldn\u2019t have taken the job, even though she asked me before Downy and Ashley broke up. The truth is, in a town of fifteen hundred, I can\u2019t afford to be too picky about catering contracts. I have a reputation to uphold\u2014I won\u2019t shortchange a customer because I don\u2019t personally like them. If you\u2019re not on board with that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on board, I\u2019m on board,\u201d Lou said. She reached out and put a comforting hand on Carrie\u2019s forearm. \u201cYou\u2019re my closest friend. Even though I pretty much want to shove Marjorie and her precious son in a hole right now, no one will ever know it!\u201d</p><p>Carrie put out a beautiful spread and her presentation was, as always, fetching\u2014a long buffet and refreshment table garnished with roses and baby\u2019s breath that she drove all the way to her favorite nursery east of Bandon to buy. She served crab and salmon canap\u00e9s, deviled eggs garnished with caviar, though not the most expensive brand, tapenade on small toast rounds, stuffed grape leaves, hot artichoke dip with thin sliced baguette, bite-size beef burgundy and a variety of relishes. There was also a beautiful white cake that said Happy Anniversary in silver frosting. She brought her champagne flutes for a toast and set up a wine bar at the end of the dining room. And Marjorie looked very nice in a new dress for the occasion.</p><p>Her husband, Crawford Senior, who everyone called Ford, had other ideas about the party. He ran some Christmas lights between the trees in the backyard and put out a couple of coolers of beer along with a bowl of chips and salsa on the picnic table. It seemed most of the guests, especially the men, preferred to be out there. Many of them loaded up on hors d\u2019oeuvres and took their plates outside to mix them up with chips and beer. The women appreciated the wine bar and fancy nibbles, content to sit around the living room, gossiping. Nothing Marjorie could do would coax the men inside.</p><p>Downy brought his new girlfriend, a beautiful and tiny young thing dressed for sex with a very short skirt, high shoes, see-through blouse not covering her purple bra. Her long black hair was loose and flowing and she was stuck to Downy like lint. They pawed each other and drank too much beer, although they were underage and everyone knew it, so when the deputy showed up, Ford told them to go hide in one of the bedrooms. Not ten minutes later there was a scream. One of the women at the party went looking for her purse, opened the bedroom door and found them stark naked, in flagrante.</p><p>Carrie had a helluva time rounding everyone up for a champagne toast after that but managed to convince Ford to do this one thing for his wife. Carrie, though not exactly commissioned to do so, took as many pictures of them toasting and cutting the cake as she could grab.</p><p>Then Ford was back outside with a box of cigars.</p><p>By eleven Carrie, Lou and Ray Anne had cleaned up, put the rest of the hors d\u2019oeuvres on disposable but attractive plastic plates, washed out the chafing dishes and serving utensils and loaded everything in Carrie\u2019s van. Carrie told Marjorie good-night and Marjorie said, \u201cThank you, Carrie. I think it went very well.\u201d And Carrie wondered if the woman was being brave or delusional.</p><p>Once in the van she said, \u201cI need a glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use something stronger,\u201d Lou said. \u201cI\u2019m completely exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at my house, where Gina and Ashley will probably be waiting for a report. Not at your house, where Eve will be listening and will report to Ashley.\u201d They both looked at Ray Anne.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cAll right. My house.\u201d</p><p>There was no talking in the van as Carrie drove them to Ray Anne\u2019s little bungalow on the hill, just ten blocks from the Downys\u2019. Like everything in Thunder Point, it was close. It was only five minutes to get there and eight minutes before Ray Anne was opening a cold white and pouring it into three glasses. They sat in the living room, kicking off their shoes. They sipped their wine and just sat quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it a hundred times,\u201d Carrie finally said. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest part about this work\u2014people with huge expectations are always disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Ford, but he\u2019s an ass,\u201d Ray Anne said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t stand Marjorie, but I think I feel sorry for her,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cIt gets to the point that when you have an event that didn\u2019t disappoint, you want to give a discount,\u201d Carrie said, rubbing her foot. \u201cThe worst is when a young bride doesn\u2019t get the reception she always dreamed of. It\u2019s rarely about the venue or the food, but usually some relative or guest with bad manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you don\u2019t often see renegade fucking at wedding receptions,\u201d Ray Anne said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you see it the most,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought that was just me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s something about a wedding that makes people amorous. And reckless. But I have to say, I\u2019ve never seen it happen at an anniversary party. By the son of the couple. In their bedroom. In the middle of the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoolers of beer and cigars...I bet Marjorie wanted to die. Here she was all dressed up and Ford\u2019s wearing his Seattle Mariners cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet that dress cost her forty bucks,\u201d Ray Anne said meanly.</p><p>\u201cGet it out of your system,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cBecause you are not to gossip about this! To anyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sign a confidentiality agreement,\u201d Lou said. \u201cBesides, everyone is going to be talking about it. Especially Pat, who got a close-up of Downy\u2019s naked ass.\u201d She took a sip of her wine. \u201cAnd all you did was pull the door closed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was that or throw a bucket of cold water on him,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI know he broke my baby\u2019s heart, but I\u2019m glad she\u2019s moving on. Hopefully to someone with some manners. If not class. Jeez.\u201d</p><p>And then the three of them looked at each other and burst into hysterical laughter until they were crying and couldn\u2019t sit up straight.</p><p>Frank knocked on Ashley\u2019s door at nine-thirty. Gina answered, looking surprised. \u201cFrank!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. Is Ashley home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yes. I think she\u2019s plugged into her iPod. Or on the phone. I\u2019ll check. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>He stepped inside while Gina went down the hall and tapped on Ashley\u2019s bedroom door. When she came out, wearing a perplexed frown, her iPod earbuds were dangling over her shoulders. And Gina went in a different direction, leaving them alone.</p><p>He smiled and said, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you be at your parents\u2019 party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stayed for the toast and the cake cutting. That\u2019s long enough. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll think I\u2019m in my room or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the beach to look for stars and constellations and meteors. It\u2019s clear and cool.\u201d He half turned, showing her his backpack. \u201cI have a log and a couple of drinks.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep doing this, Frank. I mean, it\u2019s nice of you, but I am managing not to feel like total toe jelly knowing Downy\u2019s in town with his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good. So, the internet says there could be a mild meteor shower tonight. And I did this, as you say, because no one else would be interested. And the party is not for me. My mom is semihappy\u2014my dad gave her a necklace. And now he\u2019s getting hammered with some of his buddies on the patio. So\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting hammered? I thought it was a fancy party!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is fancy for my dad. He put out two coolers full of beer.\u201d Frank grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone\u2019s looking for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left a note on my computer\u2014gone to the beach to look at stars. I\u2019ve done it before. They won\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll sit on the steps with you for a little while, but I don\u2019t want to talk about Downy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I don\u2019t have anything to say about him. But turn off the porch light, in case there are meteors. I want to see them.\u201d</p><p>She flicked off the light, turned off her iPod and pulled the door closed behind them. She sat down on the top step with Frank.</p><p>Frank shed the backpack, opened it and pulled out a couple of drinks, handing her one.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be sure we have something straight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends. We\u2019re going to stay just friends and not because of Downy or the fact that you\u2019re a Downy or anything. It\u2019s because I\u2019m not dating. Got it?\u201d</p><p>He twisted the top off his drink. \u201cI think we already had this conversation. I get it. And I\u2019m real sorry my brother hurt you but I\u2019m not sorry it gave me a chance to get to know you on a different level. While you were with Downy, we only talked if you had a math crisis. I\u2019m not looking for anything, Ash. I\u2019m not dating, either. I have a lot I want to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d she asked, opening her drink.</p><p>\u201cI have to ace a whole bunch of classes, for one thing. I\u2019m not going to be getting a football scholarship.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm. So, where do you think you\u2019re going to college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarvard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. That\u2019s gonna be expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are whole websites and blogs dedicated to tips on how to get in and pay for it. You could fill a phone book with the scholarships and grants available. Not to mention loans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything closer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of good universities that are closer, but I want to go to the east coast. There\u2019s a lot out there I haven\u2019t experienced\u2014museums, libraries, galleries, theater, observatories. Not only does Harvard have a lot to offer but the whole area is a cultural mecca. Not to mention\u2014I just want to spend some time in New York City. And D.C. I\u2019ve never seen the monuments. And the National Air and Space Museum. I guess you already know\u2014I like space and numbers.\u201d</p><p>She was mesmerized. \u201cYou are going to be Bill Gates....\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cBill Gates is taken. I\u2019ll just be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you drop out of college?\u201d she asked, thinking of Gates.</p><p>\u201cIf I had ideas that were bigger than what I could get in college, I might. That hasn\u2019t happened yet. And I don\u2019t see it happening soon. I\u2019m more excited about the classes I\u2019ll get to take than the prospect of getting out of school and making money. I have a long way to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have as far as everyone else,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cShow me the constellations again,\u201d she said, leaning back and looking up.</p> <p>He leaned back. \u201cSee the Big Dipper? Ursa Major. And right across from that is Cassiopeia\u2014the Lady in the Chair. See it? Shaped like a W. And see the North star? The last star in the handle of the Little Dipper.\u201d And then two burning stars shot across the sky. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake a wish,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I get two?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere are going to be more. It\u2019s the perfect night for it.\u201d</p><p>She laid back on the porch, her legs hanging down the stairs. \u201cI love summer nights in Thunder Point. Tell me what you want to see in Boston, in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2014revolutionary landmarks all over New England. And there\u2019s the Museum of Fine Arts, the biggest art museum on the east coast. The Freedom Trail. Fenway and Boston Harbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFenway?\u201d she asked with a yawn. \u201cSo you are a baseball fan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t grow up a Downy without being constantly immersed in sports. I\u2019m not as obsessive about spectator sports as everyone else, but I enjoy them. I\u2019ve never been very athletic, but I like to sail. I have a friend who has a small sloop and we\u2019ve taken it out on the ocean when the weather is decent. I like biking, which is probably a good thing since there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll have a car in college. In fact, I wonder if I can get a messenger job\u2014that could be fun, biking through traffic, not that a good old Oregon boy knows much about real traffic. There\u2019s a great observatory at Boston University. They have nights open to the public and seminars. That\u2019s Coit Observatory. Harvard has a great observatory, too\u2014and the Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Did you know it was founded in the eighteen hundreds?\u201d</p><p>A soft snore answered him.</p> <p>He chuckled and laid back, watching the sky. \u201cBig surprise, I put you to sleep. Don\u2019t feel bad. It happens all the time. And I didn\u2019t even get to New York or D.C. yet. My mother says you should never ask me a question. If you visited me at Harvard, there are about a million things I could show you. We\u2019d take the train to D.C. and spend a whole day on the mall, go to all the museums and monuments, check out the Naval Observatory, spend a day in Georgetown...\u201d</p><p>Undeterred by her sleeping, Frank just kept talking, though softly. He knew he missed a lot of meteors because he had turned his head and was looking at her. She slept with her lips parted just slightly and her rusty brown lashes, so thick, fanned over her high cheekbones and he wondered why she bothered with makeup at all. Her lips were peachy and full, her skin so smooth and ivory. She was so much more beautiful than Selena it just made him laugh inside\u2014Selena was going to be the emotional death of his older brother. But then that was Downy, so egocentric, thinking with his dick. With Downy he was either watching sports, playing sports or angling a way to get laid. It was a miracle he got into State, he could barely maintain a B average and that was taking classes that didn\u2019t require much study.</p><p>Ashley, when she was only a sophomore, had helped Downy with his homework. Sure, she had called Frank a few times to ask him questions for her math assignments, but he was sure she had no idea how smart she was.</p><p>He wanted to touch her, but if she caught him it would send the wrong message. \u201cIf you wanted to, you could make it to an Ivy League school,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou could do anything. Be anything.\u201d</p><p>He just looked at her for a while, letting about twenty minutes of silence pass. Then he gave her arm a soft jostle. \u201cAshley?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. \u201cDid I fall asleep?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and nodded. \u201cWere you dreaming of some geek going on and on about observatories and museums and libraries?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to bed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m headed for the beach. Just for an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>She yawned deeply. \u201cWant me to go with you? So you\u2019re not alone?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to have to drag you home. Go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I will,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks for coming over, Frank.\u201d She rose, stretched, gave him a wave and went inside.</p><p>Ashley went to her bedroom, slipped into the boxers and T-shirt she slept in, put her earbuds back in and crawled into bed. You could do anything. Be anything.</p><p>No one had said that to her before. Well, her mother had, but mothers don\u2019t really count\u2014they have to say that to their kid.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been asleep the whole time. She had nodded off for a minute, but when she heard Frank talking about the train to D.C. and all the museums and monuments, she just listened to his comforting voice, eyes closed. She had never appreciated him before\u2014he was more than just smart and good-looking, he was kind and gentle and fearless. Somewhere along the line he had developed a strong, beautiful body without being a jock, without seeming to be aware of it. Yes, she was discovering there was a lot more to Frank Downy than met the eye.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>It had been three weeks since Cee Jay had visited her kids at the meeting that had ended so unpleasantly. It had been three weeks since Mac had hired a detective to get more information about what her life had been like over the past ten years in the hopes of getting a better grasp on what she might be after now. He\u2019d called the detective a few times and had been reassured they were still in the data-gathering process.</p><p>It had been hard to be patient. He kept waiting for the other shoe to fall.</p><p>Finally a FedEx package was delivered to his Thunder Point office. It was filled with information, call logs from the detective\u2019s office, a few pictures, some of the same public records Mac had accessed\u2014records of marriage and divorce\u2014and a bill. Seventeen hundred and eighty-seven dollars.</p><p>He gulped.</p><p>Then he sifted through the material. And just when he thought he couldn\u2019t be surprised by anything, he was blown away. But there was one important thing missing. He called the detective\u2019s cell phone. \u201cI looked through all your material and sadly, it all makes sense. But where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a casino within two hundred miles?\u201d the detective replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019s still in the area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth women\u2014Cee Jay and Maddy Crofts\u2014came from the area and she\u2019s not turning up anywhere else. She used a credit card in North Bend a week ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a casino there,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cWant a wager?\u201d the P.I. asked, laughter in his voice.</p><p>Mac wasn\u2019t laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll pass. What does she want with me? Or the kids? We don\u2019t have anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that, buddy. I can only tell you where she\u2019s been and what she\u2019s done. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>So, was it all about gambling? Mac had considered many possibilities but never that one. How that could possibly involve him was a mystery. But, he\u2019d have to know. He called the casino hotel in North Bend and asked for Cee Jay or Cecilia McCain and was told there was no one there by that name. He asked for Cecelia Raines and again came up empty. On to Madeline Crofts\u2014no, again. But he struck oil with Antoinette LeClair, the fictional attorney.</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to Cee Jay,\u201d he said when she answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s calling please,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cCoos County Sheriff\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.</p><p>And then he heard her say \u201cCee Jay, it\u2019s your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked impatiently when she came to the phone.</p><p>\u201cI think we should talk, Cee Jay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think I\u2019m all talked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should meet. Or my next call could be to the Los Angeles County District Attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t broken any laws!\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, you have. And even if he doesn\u2019t want to prosecute, at the very least he\u2019ll sign out a warrant and let poor Mr. Raines know he\u2019s not obligated to that alimony. So, would you like me to come to the hotel?\u201d</p><p>Silence answered him. At long last she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be in the hotel restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in less than an hour. And don\u2019t bring your attorney\u2014no one\u2019s filming Law and Order episodes today.\u201d And he hung up.</p><p>He called one of the deputies who worked for him and asked him to cover the town. Then he texted Lou\u2014he said he had to drive up to North Bend on business and asked her to cover the kids if he was tied up. And then he drove and was glad it took a while; he had to think.</p><p>In police work, he always had a strategy, a method of approaching a situation or suspect. A lot of his strategy was following policy, but some was pure instinct. But he knew so little about gambling and less about his ex-wife. He had three images of her\u2014the young girl he\u2019d once loved, the pretty young woman who\u2019d left them so coldly and the beautiful and sophisticated woman who turned up a few weeks ago. He wasn\u2019t sure who she really was. And while he could assume her appearance in Thunder Point had something to do with money, probably with a debt, he wasn\u2019t sure of anything else.</p><p>As for gambling, he\u2019d been to a few casinos. He\u2019d even taken his Aunt Lou. Lou liked the nickel slots because she could play for hours, get mesmerized by the rolling cherries and other fruits, and do it on five bucks. He liked blackjack, but he never lasted long. He thought he had an exceptional memory and tried to remember card play to get to twenty-one, but the house beat him every time. But Cee Jay had obviously gone through millions in a few years. She wasn\u2019t doing that at the nickel slots or two-buck blackjack table.</p><p>He drove through the parking lot surrounding the hotel casino, passing down each lane slowly. Twice. Her girlfriend, the fraudulent attorney, must have gone somewhere\u2014there was no sight of the fancy car.</p><p>When he walked into the hotel, people reacted. They stiffened, stared, watched. Dare he even hope Cee Jay would be intimidated by the uniform? She hadn\u2019t been the last time, when they met at Denny\u2019s. He went to the restaurant and spoke to the hostess. \u201cI\u2019m meeting a woman here, early thirties, dark hair, very blue eyes....\u201d</p><p>The hostess smiled and sent a graceful arm and questioning glance into the sparsely populated dining room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s her. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Cee Jay seemed to be studying the menu until he neared, then she looked up and dazzled him with a stunning smile. Oh, you think I don\u2019t remember? he thought. It cut through him. That beautiful young girl who once loved him, there she was. She\u2019d been new at school and it hadn\u2019t taken her long to single him out and even though she was much younger, to him she was the epitome of beauty and innocence. He fell in love with her immediately. A year later she was pregnant and he was married. And everything about his life changed.</p> <p>She stood and by the lift of her arms, she intended to embrace him. He quickly put out a hand, indicating she should take a seat. She did so with a laugh. \u201cWell, that was awkward.\u201d</p><p>The waitress was there instantly. Something about a police uniform usually produced service right away. He was very uncomfortable sitting with his back to the room but tried to tell himself he wouldn\u2019t be here too long and the casino had security. Still, even though he had no reason to expect trouble of any kind, his hand rested on his thigh, near his gun.</p><p>\u201cJust coffee for me,\u201d he told the waitress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start with a coffee,\u201d Cee Jay said.</p><p>When the waitress had gone, Mac said, \u201cNice hotel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the nicest one in the general area. How did you find me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cI looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t quite answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. So, what\u2019s your game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d She was indignant. She stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you play?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She seemed to be undecided whether to answer. \u201cI just dabble,\u201d she said, visibly tense.</p><p>\u201cCee Jay, I know everything. So, what do you dabble in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny ante,\u201d she said with a shrug, meeting his eyes dead on. She\u2019d been through this before. She could pass a lie detector and he knew it. It scared him, as a matter of fact.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he replied, shaking his head. \u201cIt appears you\u2019re having some bad luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cJust lately. It\u2019s just for fun, anyway. I\u2019m actually ahead.\u201d</p><p>He might not know anything about gambling per se but one thing he knew, gamblers always claimed to win. Always. And they rarely did. Big fancy casinos and casino resorts were not built on charity. \u201cIs that right? Good for you. So, what does this have to do with us? Me and the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought...\u201d Her voice trailed off. \u201cI told you. I thought maybe we could reconnect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She just shook her head. \u201cThose years we were together\u2014they were very hard, Mac. Very hard. And I didn\u2019t really have the tools to deal with what I\u2019d taken on\u2014I was a young fool. So I ran. But I kept looking back to those years, difficult though they were, and realized that was one of the few times in my life I felt safe and loved. I started to regret leaving almost immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you didn\u2019t even call to ask how the kids were?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cI was determined to improve myself in some way before getting in touch. I never brought anything to the table. I wanted to bring something. I thought I could contribute in some way, be valuable. Valuable enough to be welcomed back.\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly and leaned toward her slightly. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you, Cee Jay? What happened that made you feel being the mother of our children wasn\u2019t enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just more work and greater deprivation than I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he was shaking his head. \u201cWhat happened in your childhood to make you think you had to have more? Be more? I want to understand, but I just don\u2019t get it. You said you felt safe and loved. Did the fancy car and jewelry make you feel safer? More loved?\u201d</p><p>She let a huff of laughter escape just as two cups of coffee and cream were delivered to the table. Mac noticed her eyes had welled with tears but he couldn\u2019t trust that they were real.</p><p>\u201cGrowing up wasn\u2019t pretty,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI was raised by a single mother who had four kids by four men. She moved us every time the rent was overdue, virtually ignored us and left us on our own to raise ourselves. I lived in dingy little apartments and motel rooms\u2014there wasn\u2019t always food and we picked through scrap piles for clothes. I was molested when I was small, abandoned all the time, hungry most of the time, missed whole months of school and was always terrified. When I was eleven the four of us were split up into four different foster homes and I was moved every year. When I met you all I wanted was a family and a home.\u201d</p><p>He was silent. Was this some story concocted to get his sympathy? How could he spend seven years with a woman and never know any of these details? It could be as simple as young men don\u2019t ask, or a young man working day and night never thought about the details, or as complicated as Cee Jay making up a story that would get her a second chance.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you would leave that family and home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense, I realize that now. But I wanted things. We had a family and a house, but I was still scared all the time. Afraid of being abandoned, of turning into my mother\u2014a young woman with a passel of kids and no money and no husband and no way to take care of them or myself. In hindsight...\u201d She gave a wave of her hand.</p><p>Actually, it did make sense if it was true, Mac thought. Abused children often grew up to abuse their own children, so this history could explain a lot. But that didn\u2019t make it right. \u201cWell, it appears you have what you needed. Money. Security. And don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re pretty and know how to flirt. You\u2019ll find another husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, except that I\u2019ve had a little setback recently. Nothing serious, but it kind of showed me how much I\u2019d left behind when I left you and the kids and I hoped we could start to know each other again. You know\u2014see if it was as big a mistake for you as it was for me. I knew the odds were not in my favor, but I had to try.\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cI told you, I have someone now. It\u2019s serious. Besides, you\u2019ll do all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some debt to clear,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCee Jay, I know about the house, the cars, the alimony, which incidentally was acquired fraudulently. You\u2019ve gone through a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a person with my upbringing doesn\u2019t really know how to manage all that and it didn\u2019t take long before I mismanaged it. And lost it.\u201d She shrugged and looked away. \u201cBad investments, being taken advantage of by con artists, lots of things I just wasn\u2019t prepared to handle....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cee Jay, you gambled it away. The house was free and clear and you borrowed against it. Millions. So, cash in a couple of rings and sell the car....\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cThe car isn\u2019t mine and the rings are fake.\u201d</p><p>He looked at them with lifted brows. He\u2019d never have known the difference. \u201cGood fakes. And where\u2019s the car? It\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went away,\u201d she said sourly.</p><p>\u201cAnd Madeline? Aka Antoinette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou must have a very unique relationship,\u201d he muttered. Partners in crime, he thought.</p><p>\u201cWe have similar backgrounds,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can trust each other.\u201d</p><p>He immediately thought he knew how to learn more about that. He could spend a lot of time investigating. He might look into Cee Jay\u2019s childhood if only to know if she was lying or telling the truth, but he couldn\u2019t care less about her girlfriend. And if what Cee Jay told him was meant to explain her adult behavior, his kids were safe from that kind of legacy. They hadn\u2019t been treated that way.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you grow up, Cee Jay? You always said it was Oregon.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was walking away from, but I was unstable. Damaged. I haven\u2019t had a real happy day since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Mr. Raines will be heartbroken to hear that.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cPoor Mr. Raines is a penny-pinching, mean-hearted old man! I wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything in the divorce except for the prenup! I got exactly what was outlined\u2014a house, car and limited alimony. He blows more than that in a weekend.\u201d</p><p>Mac leaned toward her. He lowered his voice. \u201cCee Jay, you weren\u2019t legally married. You didn\u2019t deserve anything at all, except maybe jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever look for me. I signed those divorce and custody papers because of Raines. I was trapped. I know, I know\u2014I did it to myself. But still... I meant what I said, Mac. I missed the kids. I missed you. Missed us. If you weren\u2019t involved with someone, we might be trying again....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would never happen. I\u2019m no good to you. I\u2019d probably never buy you a fancy ring or new car. The most you\u2019ll ever get from me is a cup of coffee. And there\u2019s no way I can help clear your debt, so you should keep looking.\u201d</p><p>She lifted one brow. \u201cYou have a house,\u201d she pointed out to him. \u201cI bet you even have a retirement fund and some college savings. You probably have money you don\u2019t even realize you have.\u201d</p><p>Mac didn\u2019t react, but inside he felt shattered. And when he thought about this later it might make him cry. She\u2019d do that? Take the equity in his house? The roof over his kids\u2019 heads or their college savings? What little security he had? He thought he knew what she\u2019d do with it, and she wasn\u2019t going to pay down her Visa bill.</p><p>\u201cHow much is your debt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very much. Just a few thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many thousands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, smoothing her hair. \u201cEight or ten. Maybe eleven. But even five would help. And I\u2019d pay you back, of course. Right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how could you do that? Pay me back right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to work,\u201d she said. \u201cI have several modeling and acting opportunities that I just haven\u2019t been able to pursue, but they pay very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich begs the question, why not work to pay off your debt?\u201d</p><p>She sat back in her chair. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a slight smile. \u201cI have to admit, I\u2019m dying of curiosity. I know you didn\u2019t get in this spot on quarter slots at little casinos. Vegas? Monte Carlo? High stakes poker? Ponies? What the hell have you done to yourself, Cee Jay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got a little behind, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Behind enough that you\u2019d take your children\u2019s college savings and try to roll it into a big payoff? What are you going to do\u2014put it all on black at the roulette table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to help me, just say so.\u201d</p><p>He rested his forearms on the table and looked at her with sympathy. He looked into her eyes and knew that the young girl he\u2019d loved was just not in there. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to help you,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, I have to give you advice. This comes from Eve, actually. If you find yourself missing your children, they\u2019d love to get a note or card. Maybe on birthdays or holidays. You could send a gift, and it doesn\u2019t have to be expensive\u2014just a token to say they\u2019re remembered, that would be welcome. You can\u2019t just show up in their lives after a decade and expect a warm reception, but you\u2019re their mother. They can\u2019t help the fact that they\u2019d like to know you.</p><p>\u201cSecond, if you borrowed from someone who isn\u2019t exactly in the legitimate loan business, I\u2019d be happy to help you file a complaint. I know all the right people. And third, I would be happy to locate a Gamblers Anonymous meeting and give you a ride. No questions asked.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. There weren\u2019t any tears, either. \u201cJust get out of here and leave me alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cAnd fourth,\u201d he said, standing. \u201cI\u2019ll pay for your coffee, and this is for the last time. Good luck, Cee Jay.\u201d</p><p>She just looked at him with weary eyes and a sarcastically twisted mouth. He noticed that she\u2019d tried to cover up the dark circles under her eyes, but the makeup had failed.</p> <p>\u201cListen, let me say something. As hard as the last fifteen years have been, I have to thank you. For giving me my family, I mean. They\u2019re great kids and they\u2019re the life in me. I\u2019m sorry things have been so awful for you. My life has been spare\u2014no fancy houses or cars. But it\u2019s been perfect in every way. I can\u2019t think of a person on earth I\u2019d trade places with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d she said tiredly, resting her head in her hand.</p><p>He didn\u2019t leave money on the table. He wasn\u2019t sure how bad off she was. She might grab a ten-dollar bill and race to a craps table and try to turn it into a hundred, which she\u2019d then try to turn into a thousand, which would turn into nothing in no time. He went to find his waitress. \u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the tab for the coffees?\u201d He paid her and gave her a nice tip. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>One of the perks of wearing a uniform complete with weapons and driving an official car, the valets were more than happy to let him leave the vehicle in front of the hotel, locked. He tried to pass the valet a five, but the kid waved him off. \u201cForget it, Officer. We\u2019re good,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks for taking care of the car, son,\u201d he said. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d</p> <p>At nine o\u2019clock all was quiet at the McCain house. Eve was in her bedroom, either studying or whispering scary love-words to Landon over the phone, Dee Dee and Ryan were supposed to be having quiet time prior to sleep. Mac tapped on Lou\u2019s door and she said, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>She was sitting on her bed, her TV turned low, her cell phone in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m slipping out for an hour or so,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI\u2019m going to Gina\u2019s. I\u2019ve got my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch the nest, but I\u2019m going to sleep soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be late. She has an early morning.\u201d</p><p>Less than ten minutes later he was parked in front of her house and he went to the front door. He knocked and she answered. He held up two bottles of beer in one hand and smiled at her.</p> <p>She was drying a pan. Her hair was piled on top of her head, held with a clip and she wore those plaid pajama bottoms that were so worn in some places the Goodwill might reject them. No makeup. Fitted tank top. She had a wholesome look about her; accessible and genuine. She was a hardworking woman who saved her money and didn\u2019t splurge on superficial things. And she looked so beautiful to him, she took his breath away. He wanted to gather her up in his arms and hold her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cCome out on the porch with me. Have a beer,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a long day. I saw Cee Jay.\u201d</p><p>Gina was clearly shocked. \u201cShe called you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI tracked her down.\u201d</p><p>Gina threw the pan and dish towel into the chair by the door and joined him on the porch. They sat on the top step and he twisted off the caps on their bottles. He leaned back against the porch post, one long leg stretched out on the porch and bent at the knee, the other rested two steps down. He patted the space between his legs and she slid over. She smoothed the fabric of his jeans over his hard thighs.</p><p>He bent and kissed her neck, inhaling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fresh out of the tub.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a serious case of waitress legs today. Sore. Tell me about her.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s messed up.\u201d And then he unclipped her blond hair and let it fall to her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShe sure doesn\u2019t look messed up. All you have to do is mention her name and I start to feel shabby and poor.\u201d She stretched her hands out in front of her face, looking at the short, cropped nails. \u201cShe\u2019s so glamorous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as poor as she is, honey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a good cover going, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Gina turned to look up at him, questioning him with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI investigated her past and what I couldn\u2019t learn from public records, I hired some help to dig up. I felt that was important, to keep the family safe. She married someone else before we were divorced, then divorced him with a sizable settlement that, of course, she didn\u2019t deserve because she was never legally married to him. She could be prosecuted for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you turn her in?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But if anyone runs a records search, if they look at Oregon docs and California docs, it jumps out. And that\u2019s not just bigamy, it\u2019s fraud. She knew she wasn\u2019t free to marry. But with all she\u2019s up against, that\u2019s not really her biggest worry\u2014she has a gambling problem. A doozy. She\u2019s run through a fortune and she has debts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to turn her in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not obligated to snitch on every person I\u2019ve ever known who once did something wrong, not even in my jurisdiction. In fact, I probably did more damage to her just by telling her I knew. I offered her a ride to a Gamblers Anonymous meeting. Daggers shot out of her eyes. She\u2019s not ready to admit to that. In fact,\u201d he added with a humorless laugh, \u201cshe suggested I could help her with that debt.\u201d</p><p>Gina leaned back against him. \u201cReally? You have a stash somewhere you\u2019re not talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I have a house, half a house, actually, a retirement account and a small savings for the kids to help with college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said. \u201cShe would do that?\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through her hair. \u201cI believe she would do that. She said she could pay me back immediately. She\u2019s staying at the casino hotel in North Bend. I think that means if I gave her money, she\u2019d put it all on the table, trying to double it or triple it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ran through a fortune? Did you point out to her that she once had a fortune and she never sent a dollar of it to her children?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on her shoulders and gently turned her. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked into her eyes, her beautiful blue eyes, and they were dead. She has so much she could do, but she has killed her own spirit. It\u2019s very sad. I hope she gets help for that, but it\u2019s not going to happen today.\u201d He leaned toward her and gave her a brief kiss. \u201cOur lives are richer in every way.\u201d And then he pulled her in for a deeper kiss.</p><p>And then he let her slide back into her position between his long legs. \u201cWill you tell the kids?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess they\u2019ll have to know, but I want to make sure they\u2019re capable of understanding. I think Cee Jay will probably leave the area now\u2014she knows I know everything. I told her if I wanted to, I could make a call to the Los Angeles prosecutor\u2019s office. I pity her, but I\u2019m not screwing around with her anymore. There\u2019s nothing I can do for her. She\u2019s on her own.\u201d</p><p>He slid an arm around her from behind, holding her, her back comfortably at rest against him. He took a drink of his beer, then nuzzled her hair. She was so soft and fresh. And for a woman who had so much going on in her life, she was so uncomplicated.</p><p>They sat in silence, just having a beer together. After ten or fifteen minutes of peace and quiet and a half beer each, she asked, \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking, Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just thinking how ready I am to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your ex-wife is pretty unpredictable. It\u2019s a thing you might never get completely resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. If I\u2019m not real lucky, I might have to deal with her from time to time, but I still want to move on. Because she may have more surprises in store for me in coming years, but I\u2019m all done with her. I think the kids and Lou are safe from her manipulations and plots. If Cee Jay proves to be a problem from time to time, it won\u2019t be because any of us is vulnerable. I hope I\u2019m not being overly optimistic in thinking she\u2019s starting to understad that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s going to be lurking in the back of your mind forever....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, babe. Not in my mind\u2014that\u2019s on a different track. She could make attempts to mess with my peace of mind, but I\u2019ll be vigilant. Hell, that\u2019s how I am, anyway. It\u2019s hard to uncop a guy, if you know what I mean. The worst part about my meeting with her today was that I sat with my back to the room in the hotel restaurant.\u201d He laughed and shook his head. \u201cBut I\u2019m turning my life over to you. I\u2019ve given this issue all I\u2019ve got to give it.\u201d</p><p>She turned and looked up at him. \u201cAnd what am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should put our heads together and make some plans for our own future. I know it\u2019s complicated, but there must be a way we can get married. Maybe not next weekend, but the sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look up into his eyes. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you can know.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and knelt between his legs, her hands on his shoulders. \u201cDo you think Lou and the kids can deal with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLou\u2019s been telling me I need a woman in my life for years, but I\u2019ll sit down with her. As for the kids, the most stable thing our girls seem to have is each other. But\u2014once Lou\u2019s on board, we should try to figure out the details. We have to combine our families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could wait a year and a half, when our girls go to college,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can wait that long.\u201d He pulled her into his arms. \u201cThe best place in my life is when I\u2019m near you, when I\u2019m holding you, when I\u2019m spooning you in bed. That\u2019s my peace. That\u2019s my anchor. And you know what? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be hard. I think it\u2019s going to feel like a huge relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not going to solve all your problems, Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to solve at least one. I need to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Gina was sitting on the front porch with her newspaper opened in front of her when Ashley came up the walk after school, her backpack slung over one shoulder. \u201cMy last big test,\u201d she said. \u201cDone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I did great, as a matter of fact. The only major thing left for me is a book report\u2014mega book thesis\u2014for English. And I did it already. I hate to brag but it\u2019s the smartest paper I\u2019ve ever written. School\u2019s out in a week and I\u2019d like to work this summer. As much as possible. I have to save some money. So, who do you think will hire me? You or Gram?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Gina answered, \u201cWell, do you want to wait tables, or cook and do dishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have time to do both over summer\u2014two part-time jobs. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Stu at the diner and you can talk to Gram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can manage to work and cheer in my senior year, I might want to do that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuddenly very ambitious, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Gina said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am. I\u2019ve been thinking college is getting close. I used to think of Downy when I thought of college without even considering all the other things it could mean. I had no idea all the things I was interested in until I started listening to Frank talk about everything he\u2019d like to study and I thought\u2014hmm, I kind of like the idea of psychology. And how about physical therapy? Or education? Or biology? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gina laughed. \u201cHow about all those things?\u201d she echoed. \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of hearing about the wonderful Downy and his atomic arm. Good for him, but I have a life, too, and I just am not about to waste it on some jerk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Gina said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I have your brains when I was your age? Sit down with me a minute. There\u2019s something I\u2019ve been planning to talk to you about and with all you\u2019ve had going on, I didn\u2019t want to overburden you. But\u2014it\u2019s kind of because of all you\u2019ve had going on. When I checked you into the hospital and filled out all the forms I realized that since you were born the \u2018paternal\u2019 side of the health history was always unknown. If we ever had a real issue\u2014like if there was something hereditary we should know about, then... The thing is, Ash, I searched out your biological father specifically to ask those questions. And I found him. Not very far away.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face was one of sheer shock. \u201cHoly crap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I found him, I talked with him, I asked him medical questions. And I found that he hadn\u2019t even been certain whether I was definitely pregnant, whether I\u2019d gone through with the pregnancy, had you adopted, whatever.\u201d</p><p>Ashley leaned back on the porch post. \u201cWow. That\u2019s almost creepy. Especially at the same time Eve\u2019s long-lost mother shows up unannounced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure coincidence and entirely different circumstances. It turns out your father didn\u2019t exactly run out on you. He did run, though, and I think we can all agree that worked out a lot better for us than it did for him.\u201d</p><p>Gina told her the whole story, including the fact that Eric had gotten in trouble, served time in prison and then seemed to have turned his life around. She had had Mac check him out and learned that he had not only been a model prisoner, determined to get out as early as possible, but was now a model citizen.</p><p>\u201cIs he nice?\u201d</p> <p>Gina nodded. \u201cSeems to be. In fact, lots nicer than he was at eighteen. He seems to be responsible and kind of successful with his own little business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him more now than I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going to meet him?\u201d Ashley asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d Gina responded. \u201cBecause you shouldn\u2019t have any fantasies about him\u2014he\u2019s no knight in shining armor. He\u2019s just a man\u2014he does auto body work. He\u2019s got a girlfriend but no family and, he and I?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNever. I think we\u2019re both pretty relieved he didn\u2019t step up seventeen years ago\u2014it would\u2019ve been a disaster. For that matter, I don\u2019t know that you can expect him to be a father, Ash. I think that time has surely passed. You might not even like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind seeing his face. Finding out what kind of person he is. I already know what kind of person he was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can probably arrange that, but I want you to think it over for a couple of days and be sure that\u2019s what you want. He gave me his word he won\u2019t push himself on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s reasonable to think it over first. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Yes. Wow\u2014I always thought if I ever ran into him, he\u2019d be a horrible person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be.\u201d</p><p>A couple of days after that conversation, Gina pulled the business card with the cell phone number out of her pocket and called Eric. \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s Gina. Ashley\u2019s doing very well after a real challenging spring. She had some major heartaches, but she\u2019s so smart, so strong. And I told her about you. Eric, I think it\u2019s time. She\u2019d like to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a date tonight?\u201d Mac asked his Aunt Lou.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you need me for something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to take you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>She backed away from the kitchen sink, put a hand on her hip and looked at him suspiciously. \u201cNow this has never happened before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it has,\u201d he said. \u201cHasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. And the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s throw a pizza at them\u2014they\u2019ll be fine. I want to talk to you alone. It\u2019s about me and Gina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear God, you haven\u2019t screwed that up, have you?\u201d</p><p>He made a face. \u201cDo you ever get tired of being so judgmental? No. I didn\u2019t screw up, just the opposite. It\u2019s time to talk about the future, which happens to link to your future. We have to get on the same page, you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you at least going to take me somewhere nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you settle for Cliffhanger\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can sit at a table,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll need thirty minutes. Lucky for you, Joe\u2019s working tonight and I\u2019m free.\u201d And then she pulled a couple of frozen pizzas out of the freezer, set the oven, opened the boxes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Landon doesn\u2019t show up, hell has frozen over. I should speak to Sarah\u2014her brother clearly has a tapeworm.\u201d</p><p>Forty minutes later they were seated at a table in Cliffhanger\u2019s and Cliff was at the table personally to take their drink orders. \u201cBring Lou a white wine and I\u2019ll have a beer,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Lou objected. \u201cI want a mojito. Do you know how to make a mojito?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cliff said tiredly. \u201cI went to bartending school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s buying. I\u2019m not pinching pennies here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you sure I haven\u2019t ever taken you out to dinner before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this? A completely adult dinner? Just the two of us? I can\u2019t remember a time.\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve done everything for me. I haven\u2019t done anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me a home,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou had a home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a house, Mac. I had two great nieces and a nephew I rarely saw because you were married to a woman who hated me and considered me an interfering old crone. I never once wished your marriage would fail, I hope you believe me. But in spite of the pain of it all, I had a family again.\u201d</p><p>Mac reached for her hand. \u201cYou will always have a family, Lou. You\u2019ll always have a home. I swear to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried that you\u2019re going to throw me out, Mac,\u201d she said. Their drinks arrived and they ordered dinner. Then she lifted her mojito to his glass of beer. \u201cCheers, Mac. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>He put down the beer. \u201cWe have to get the families together. I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re going to pull this off. And what if someone protests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would protest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when Eve first found out about me and Gina, she got a little crazy. Afraid she\u2019d be put through another traumatic situation, like when she was little and Cee Jay left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe panicked, that\u2019s all. If she takes three deep breaths, she\u2019ll realize this isn\u2019t the same thing at all. She loves Gina. And Gina loves her. Besides, Eve is in a serious relationship, like Ashley was last year. She might not admit it but Landon has become a priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we all going to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could squish everyone in our house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be crowded for a while, but not forever. A year and three months from now at least one of those older girls will go off to school, maybe both of them, although I\u2019ve been working on Eve to do her first year of college at community college. Or, maybe I\u2019ll move out. Not far, just out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Joe?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOh, he\u2019d love that. I\u2019ve been trying to save Joe from being stuck with an elderly woman when he\u2019s still young enough to have fun, but he might be the one to bite the dust first. Not only is he a trooper, his blood pressure and cholesterol tend to be high and he\u2019s pretty lazy about it, too. Have you ever seen a man who enjoys butter more than Joe?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI think his arteries might be completely clogged by now.\u201d</p><p>Mac smiled. Joe ignored her just as he did.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Carrie would take me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds awful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d She laughed. \u201cTwo working women of a certain age who are tidy and like the same wine? One of whom loves to cook? A room of my own in an adult household where my boyfriend can spend the night without destroying the values of the younger generation? Please, Mac. You must think us so boring. Besides, I don\u2019t want to discourage you in any way, but I might not be completely interested in a household of seven. I had my own small house in Coquille, remember. I took you on when you were ten, and when you were twenty-six, I got you and three small children. I\u2019m surprised the walls of that little house didn\u2019t blow out.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at the memory. \u201cWe sure worked hard back then, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was horrendous,\u201d she said.</p><p>At first, right after Cee Jay left them, Mac was so hopeful that she\u2019d just return, he worked his two jobs\u2014four days a week as an armored car guard, four nights a week as a new cop, not one day of the week without a job to do\u2014and since Lou was teaching, they filled the gap with sitters. Lou ran back and forth between her house and Mac\u2019s, feeding, bathing, walking the floor, sleeping on the couch. Both of them were sleep-deprived and emotionally distraught. Finally Mac gave up hope; he and the kids moved into Lou\u2019s small house. All three kids had one bedroom, Mac had one, Lou had one\u2014but one kid or another crawled in with them every night.</p><p>And Mac had been so broken. He\u2019d been in pieces.</p><p>It never did get easy, but Mac had to quit the second job even though they needed the money\u2014Cee Jay had left behind bills that had to be paid. They did get into a routine once they had child care nailed down and their schedules were at least the same every week. Once they moved to Thunder Point and all the kids were in school, life became more manageable. Not simple or uncomplicated, but definitely manageable.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe worked together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a common goal. Lou, please know I\u2019ve never taken you for granted. I\u2019m grateful for what you\u2019ve done every day of my life. And you will never be alone or without a home. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet, Mac. But if it\u2019s all the same to you, alone for a while might be just fine. I can still help out with carpooling, et cetera, but a nice little house or apartment...?\u201d She smiled and gave him a shrug. \u201cThat might be pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGina and I have to talk to our kids. Everyone needs to have a chance to air their concerns. We have to get a consensus on how we\u2019re all going to live together. It has to be unanimous. And everyone should have time to adjust.\u201d</p><p>She just smiled at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait,\u201d he said. Then in a voice lowered to be private he added, \u201cIt took me so long to act on my feelings, Lou. I just want to wake up beside her in the morning. I don\u2019t care how crowded it is or how complicated, as long as she\u2019s by my side.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her mojito and smiled. Mac might be her nephew, but she\u2019d been responsible for him for ten years when he was growing up, another ten after his wife left. He was more of a son than nephew; his kids were like grandchildren. They were her life. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve always wanted for you,\u201d she said, her eyes misty. \u201cCee Jay and I were like oil and water. I hoped she\u2019d grow up and be the wife and mother you deserved. And now that you\u2019ve been treading water for ten years, all I want for you is a life partner who loves and respects you as much as you do her. Mac, you\u2019re still a young man\u2014marry your girl. Build a life with her. Be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the greatest woman in the world, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She sipped her drink. \u201cYes, I know. About time you realized that.\u201d</p><p>When they got home, the household was in full chaos. Ryan and Dee Dee were fighting over control of the Xbox, Eve was screaming at her little brother for making so much noise that she couldn\u2019t hear her music, throwing couch pillows at him. Landon was sitting at the kitchen table finishing off a pizza with a tall glass of milk.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get dinner?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>\u201cI had dinner,\u201d Landon replied, stuffing another big bite in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on here?\u201d Mac thundered at his kids.</p><p>Lou walked serenely to her bedroom. She hung up her jacket and pulled her cell phone out of her purse. She sat on her bed and hit the speed dial for Joe while simultaneously flipping on the TV. On her nightside table was her electronic reader and a couple of print books; on the other side of the bed, lotion, brush, lip balm and a glass of water from the previous night. Her cave.</p><p>She expected to leave a message, but Joe picked up. \u201cHey, babe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Joe. Well, I\u2019ve been laid off. Mac wants to get married. As soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>A low rumble of sexy laughter answered her.</p><p>There was just a week left of school and most of it was just a waste of time. There would be senior skip day, graduation rehearsal for seniors, a couple of tests and virtually no new assignments as the end drew near. Landon was determined to do very well on the last final of the year so he was hitting it hard, spending that last weekend studying. Next Friday night was graduation for the seniors. Juniors, like Landon and Eve, would celebrate by taking over the school as seniors in the fall.</p><p>The sound of the doorbell broke his concentration. He opened it to Eve. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I told you I\u2019d be over later.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes welled up with tears. \u201cI have to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door so she could come inside. \u201cAre you breaking up with me?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but maybe I should. Let\u2019s sit down. This could be bad.\u201d</p><p>His heart skipped a few beats. \u201cSpit it out,\u201d he said, leading her to the couch.</p><p>\u201cRemember that time a couple of weeks ago when we got a little carried away? When we got a little...close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that close,\u201d he said, but it had been. He was ready to grab the condom and go for it, but he held back the best he could.</p><p>\u201cIt was closer than usual. And my period didn\u2019t come. Rumor has it, those suckers can swim!\u201d</p><p>Landon died on the spot. She was going to have to give him mouth-to-mouth and pound on his chest. He could feel all the color drain from his face. Then he felt his face get hot. \u201cHuh?\u201d he said so eloquently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late. Five days. Or so. I\u2019m never late, Landon. Never.\u201d</p><p>He knew this. He was not allowed to get her worked up at period time\u2014she felt insecure about it. He, on the other hand, thought that might be the best time of the month if there was an accident, based on what he\u2019d read.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI need a test. One of those pregnancy tests. But I can\u2019t just go buy one at the grocery store or drugstore where everyone knows me. And I can\u2019t borrow the car to leave town\u2014my dad\u2019s working. If he saw me, he\u2019d kill me for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you. Where should we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go to the moon right now, but maybe Bandon\u2019s far enough away. Will you really take me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to have to stop in a bathroom somewhere\u2014like a gas station or something. I can\u2019t take a pregnancy test home! Lou has the nose of a drug dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can come right back here. Sarah\u2019s sitting alert tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if she sees it in the trash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the trash man, Eve. I guarantee you, Sarah has never looked in the trash because I toss Ham\u2019s yard apples in there, too. And I always have it done before she gets home from work so there\u2019s nothing to complain about. Now, how\u2019d you get over here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI borrowed Aunt Lou\u2019s van. But I promised her I\u2019d be less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it back to the house and drop it off. You tell your aunt we\u2019re running into Bandon to the sporting goods store. I want to look at running shoes\u2014we\u2019ll start football practice in a couple of months and I want to get ahead of it. And you want to pick up some wax for your board.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI think that should work,\u201d she said a bit tremulously.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying. It\u2019s going to be fine. It would be more fine if they sold pregnancy tests at the sporting goods store. But we\u2019re going to take care of this.\u201d</p><p>Landon thought he\u2019d been pretty smooth when Eve brought him this problem, but in fact his insides were trembling like a five-year-old on the high diving board. They didn\u2019t talk much on the way to Bandon. Every once in a while he grabbed her hand in his and gave it a squeeze. He tried very hard to be cool.</p><p>He went in the store with her, but left her to do the shopping by herself. He pressed a twenty into her hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t just buy the cheapest one.\u201d And then he went to the paperback and magazine section for ten minutes and left, empty-handed. He met her back in his little truck and all the way home, she read him the directions.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s too early?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt says it\u2019s not. But if it\u2019s negative and your period still doesn\u2019t come, we\u2019ll get another one next week,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, we don\u2019t have that many choices. And I really don\u2019t think you\u2019re pregnant. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>When they got to his house, she immediately headed for the bathroom with her package and Landon paced. Then she came out with a big grin on her face. \u201cWas it a no?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to take it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just got you know what.\u201d</p><p>And Landon fell flat on his back on the living room floor. \u201cHoly crap!\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him and knelt down beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I shouldn\u2019t have panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve, we gotta get ahead of this. You have to talk to Aunt Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m scared to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not going near you! We\u2019re not making out one more time because we both get a little crazy and one of these days... I love you like mad, but I want to be a little older before I start a family. I don\u2019t want one thin layer of latex between us and the next generation. And you shouldn\u2019t, either!\u201d He pushed some of her pretty dark hair over an ear. \u201cI\u2019d like to be with you forever, but I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to want in a year or two. I don\u2019t want to have a baby at seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to cool it down,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe can do that, too\u2014whatever you want, but we can\u2019t get this scared again,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m willing to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The back door opened suddenly and Sarah popped in. Landon\u2019s school books were still covering the kitchen table and he was cuddled up with Eve on the living room floor. \u201cOh, hi, Eve,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be here. I forgot my e-reader and didn\u2019t have a book with me,\u201d she said, passing through the living room on her way to her bedroom. She turned back to them and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit up watching TV all night with the guys\u2014I\u2019m in the middle of a good book.\u201d And then she darted into her bedroom.</p><p>And then she darted out, e-reader in hand. \u201cSorry I can\u2019t stay and chat\u2014I grabbed an hour to run down here and get this, but I have to get right back.\u201d</p><p>And then she walked into the bathroom, shutting the door.</p><p>Eve sat straight, folding up her legs. \u201cLandon...\u201d</p><p>He sat up, as well. \u201cWhere did you leave it?\u201d</p><p>A shriek came from the bathroom. The toilet flushed. Sarah came out, e-reader in one hand, pregnancy test box in the other. Her face was in a scowl. Her eyes were narrowed. \u201cHave we taken the test yet?\u201d</p><p>No one spoke for a second. Finally Eve said, \u201cIt turned out, it was unnecessary.\u201d And her cheeks were so bright red, heat burned off them.</p><p>Sarah stepped into the room. \u201cAll right, you two. I know I can\u2019t control you, but there are two big rules. Huge rules. First, safety. And second, discretion. To live in polite society you have to not shock and dismay people. No embarrassing PDA. Public displays of....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know what it means, Sarah,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d She stared pointedly at Eve. \u201cYou on the pill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d Landon began.</p><p>But Eve shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to take you to see a doctor? Because you should never have to buy another one of these,\u201d she said, lifting the box.</p><p>\u201cI...ah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got it, Sarah,\u201d Landon said, more than a little furious with his sister.</p><p>\u201cYou have two days,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cYou either go to the doctor or clinic or talk to someone in your family and tell them it\u2019s not a good time to take crazy risks or... Or I will. Are we clear? Because I want to hear from your parents\u2014either Lou or Mac, that is\u2014or see evidence there\u2019s a prescription in place.\u201d She zeroed in on Landon. \u201cAnd I\u2019m counting on you, Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, stop it!\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him. \u201cI want you to imagine yourself having a daughter next year. And I want you to imagine her at sixteen\u2014and she just bought a pregnancy test kit and I want you to ask yourself, would you ignore this and leave it up to a couple of kids to make a mistake that could really mess up their lives or would you say something. When you have an answer to those questions, I will indeed stop it!\u201d They both just stared at her. She turned on a heel and went back to the bathroom, putting the kit back where she found it. Then she faced them again. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t have any big plans for your future life, Landon, because Mac might kill you! Love is grand. It\u2019s also been known to kill a lot of brain cells. Talk among yourselves.\u201d</p><p>And she left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill her....\u201d Landon muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Eve murmured. \u201cI\u2019m just scared to face it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared?\u201d he asked. \u201cYour father is going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon, it was both of us.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed her thick, dark hair over her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid your aunt Lou will chew you out, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo telling,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cShe\u2019s the best, but she has a double personality and the other one is pretty growly.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t they all.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later, after the McCains had dinner and Aunt Lou had closed herself in her bedroom for alone time, Eve cautiously tapped on the door. She started with, \u201cCan we talk for a minute?\u201d and then said, \u201cLandon and I have been dating for nine months or so and things are getting kind of...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cA little serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and sit down by me, baby,\u201d Lou said. \u201cHere\u2014\u201d She patted the bed. Then she turned Eve around so she faced her back. She massaged Eve\u2019s shoulders and talked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was seventeen, I had the hots for a guy at school. I was so crazy about him, I could\u2019ve died. Of course we were very involved\u2014we dated the last two years of high school. We were steadies. Back then there were no clinics and, in fact, birth control pills were pretty new and kind of scary. Everyone was supposed to wait. Save it for marriage. I went to a small high school but near as I can figure, four girls dropped out because they were pregnant. And hardly anyone with a steady boyfriend for more than a year waited.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cFour?\u201d Eve asked. \u201cWow. Wild crowd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal crowd. You probably think sex was invented four years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you guys hang out at the soda shop, wearing your bobby socks and poodle skirts?\u201d</p><p>Lou turned her around. She looked deeply into her eyes. \u201cIt was the sixties. Free love. Anyone who could hung out at Haight-Ashbury or Woodstock.\u201d She turned Eve back. \u201cBy the time your mom and dad were in that \u2018pretty serious\u2019 place, there were clinics and even sex education, but it still wasn\u2019t easy to make that decision. That decision that says, I\u2019d better make sure I\u2019m safe and don\u2019t get STDs or pregnant. It\u2019s still one of the hardest things to come right out and say when you\u2019re a teenager.\u201d</p><p>Lou started running her fingers through Eve\u2019s hair, loosely braiding and unbraiding it. She said to Eve, \u201cI\u2019ll take you for a checkup next week. You\u2019re free to ask the doctor for whatever you need\u2014it will be confidential. She\u2019s probably going to want to check you for disease and maybe even do a blood panel for your general health. The first exam can be a little uncomfortable, but it\u2019s like that for everyone. Then you go for a checkup every year and it gets easier.\u201d</p><p>Eve got tears in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so scared to be doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve, you\u2019re a McCain. McCain women are very brave and we take care of our bodies. Just because you have protection doesn\u2019t mean you have to go along with what your boyfriend wants! You decide, you hear me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad\u2019s going to be so disappointed. He really thought I\u2019d stay a virgin till I\u2019m thirty.\u201d She sniffed.</p><p>Lou laughed. \u201cNo, cupcake, he hoped for that, but no one knows better than Mac how unrealistic that idea is. In his secret heart, he wants you to know love just like everyone else does. Of course, he never wants you to be hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan he not know about this?\u201d Eve asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll see the prescription on the insurance papers\u2014there are no secrets. Especially from a cop, God bless him. However, you can tell him it\u2019s for cramps,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cThen he can wonder, but not necessarily know for sure. Because, little madam, you don\u2019t to have discuss your personal life, your sex life, with anyone. You don\u2019t have to tell me or your dad every detail. In fact...\u201d And Lou shuddered.</p><p>\u201cCreeps you out, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll head you off if you seem to be moving in an unsafe direction\u2014like if we think you\u2019re into drugs or drinking or speed racing down country roads or throwing keggers. But trying to spy to embarrass and expose you?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou can come to me with anything, honey. Anything. And I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help you. Your health and safety come first. I could not live without you.\u201d</p> <p>Eve hugged her. \u201cThank you for understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand completely,\u201d she said, hugging back. Then, holding Eve away and looking into her eyes, \u201cAnd stay far away from him until you\u2019re safe. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Eric Gentry hadn\u2019t seen Thunder Point in over sixteen years. Yet here was the town, looking almost exactly as it had all those years ago. Gina was working in the same diner that her mother had worked in. It amazed him that things could remain so unchanged. He briefly pondered whether he pitied them for their lack of imagination or envied them the continuity of their surroundings and friends.</p><p>He went into the diner and found Gina standing behind the counter with a laptop open in front of her. She smiled at him. \u201cHello, Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. This place hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cUpgrades come slowly in Thunder Point. Stand by\u2014let me ask Stu to cover for me for a bit and I\u2019ll take you to meet Ashley. She stopped by here about a half hour ago and said she was taking a walk down to the beach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a sec,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows I\u2019m coming, right?\u201d</p><p>Gina nodded. \u201cYou said sometime this weekend, whenever you could get away for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she nervous?\u201d he asked, hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very curious. Are you? Nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not me. I\u2019m just terrified.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and lifted a brow. \u201cAs I recall, you\u2019re very good with teenage girls.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cI guess I had that coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Let me go talk to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, you stay here. Let me just go by myself. If she wants to, we could walk back here and have a Coke or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You know the way, right?\u201d</p><p>He tapped his temple. \u201cBurned into my memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Eric.\u201d</p><p>He turned to go, then turned back. \u201cGina, I appreciate you giving me a chance here. That you trust me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you, Eric. I checked you out. My boyfriend is a cop and I ran a background search on you. You were very nice at our meeting and you haven\u2019t had a black mark against your name since you were a kid. But if you hurt my daughter in even the slightest way, you will regret it. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt her, Gina. And I promise.\u201d</p><p>He walked down the street, turned onto the beach road and spotted her immediately even though she was on the far side of the beach. Her red hair was pulled through the back of a baseball cap and she sat on the sand, knees pulled up with her arms circling them. There was one kid out on the bay on a paddleboard. Closer to the town side of the beach, a couple of young mothers sat on towels while their little ones played in the sand at the water\u2019s edge.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many places like this, he recalled\u2014a long stretch of beach, a natural and untouched promontory, a calm bay without the presence of a lot of large businesses and hotels. Most of the coastline, at least parts the public could access, was busy with establishments that catered to beach combers and tourists. He remembered the bait shop; it looked as though it had been improved since he\u2019d last seen it.</p><p>Ashley didn\u2019t notice him approach until he stood right beside her and she looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ashley. I\u2019m Eric Gentry.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open as she looked at him. She slowly got to her feet, brushing the sand off her butt. \u201cWow,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cI look just like you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re much prettier, but you inherited the red hair and green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t mention that. I think she told me everything else, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you\u2019ve been having a terrible time lately,\u201d he said. \u201cGo ahead, sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t want to mess up your pants.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at himself. He wasn\u2019t dressed up by any means, just a pair of Dockers, a shirt, topsiders on his feet without socks. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said, lowering himself to the sand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry life has thrown you some curves, Ashley. Is there any way I can help? Anything you want to know about me or my family?\u201d</p><p>She sat down, lifted her bottled water and took a slug. \u201cWell, how about, where have you been?\u201d</p><p>He knew that wasn\u2019t a literal question. \u201cWell, I figured if I was my kid, I wouldn\u2019t want to know about me. I\u2019m not exactly anyone\u2019s hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said you used to be a real hoodlum, but straightened yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI served time, Ashley. She told you that, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou must\u2019a been a badass. What screwed you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. I screwed me up. I wasn\u2019t kicked around as a kid, my mother washed my clothes, had dinner on the table every night and my dad tried to get me interested in sports, but I fell in with a fun crowd and thought I was smarter than everyone else because I had a job that paid nine dollars an hour. I dropped out of school to work more and spent my money on cars, liquor and dope. When I heard I\u2019d gotten my girlfriend pregnant, I ran and found another good-paying job as a grease monkey and a bunch of cool friends who not only drank and doped, but found an interesting way to improve themselves\u2014they robbed convenience stores and liquor stores. That\u2019s pretty much the quick summary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you got caught,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI drove the car,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst time out, I got caught.\u201d He closed his eyes briefly. \u201cListen, there\u2019s no reason you have to tell anyone that your biological father is an idiot and an ex-con. Your secret is safe with me. I don\u2019t want you to be embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed, Eric. I\u2019m not the ex-con.\u201d Then she looked out at the bay, at the guy on the paddleboard. Then back at him. \u201cI bet you have a lot of regrets.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his knees up and looked out at the bay. \u201cKind of, kind of not. The thing about the hard times, the stupid times, they make you who you are. And regrets\u2014 I look back and ask myself if I didn\u2019t do a certain thing that I\u2019m really ashamed of, how would that change the present? What would it erase from my current life? What if I hadn\u2019t been such a badass idiot back then? Would I have learned the cost of that recklessness? Would you be here? There are things I\u2019m totally ashamed of that I wouldn\u2019t change. I ran out on your mom, but if I had stepped up and married her, oh, God, would she have gotten a bad deal. I was such an irresponsible asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cI abide by the laws. I have a little business and a girlfriend. My folks are starting to forgive me. I treat people right. I don\u2019t drink or do drugs. I\u2019m nothing special, but at least I\u2019m not unsafe. I\u2019ve learned a lot.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but your mom told me some of what you\u2019ve been through. Specifically, the boyfriend, the hospitalization...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she did. She was looking for medical history, like does hearing voices run in your family....\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it, he chuckled. \u201cNo official mental illness that I\u2019m aware of, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have crazy people in my DNA. Probably starting with me. So, Ashley, how are you getting along now? How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I feel kind of emptied out. I had a boyfriend dump me, but I\u2019m not pregnant or in jail. I\u2019ve been in therapy and group therapy and I\u2019m very tired of seeing pain everywhere. When I was in the hospital, one of the other patients was my age and had tried to commit suicide, over a boy. It was shocking to think how dangerous that could be, how far something like that could go. I wish I\u2019d never met her so I wouldn\u2019t have to think about how hopeless she must have felt to do that to herself. And I\u2019m so grateful to have met her so I could see how far something like a broken heart could go, how much destruction there could be if we\u2019re not careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Ashley. So glad there was a positive message in it for you.\u201d</p><p>She lifted one shoulder and looked down. \u201cThe worst part is that I felt that way for a little while myself, but I just didn\u2019t follow through. I just couldn\u2019t do that to my mom and Grandma. I wonder if that girl ever thought about that, about how people would feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou felt that way because of the boyfriend?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat did your mom say about that? About the girl you met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said we don\u2019t all have the same number of tools in our tool belts. That she did the best she could with what she had. And I do the best I can with my set of tools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom is pretty smart,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you have a tool for telling the ex-boyfriend to go pound sand.\u201d</p><p>She gave a soft laugh. \u201cOh, I still want things back the way they were, but I\u2019m not dumb enough to take that kind of chance. I might never get over him, but I\u2019m done with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cThings almost never go back to the way they were, Ashley. That\u2019s one of the hardest lessons\u2014that you can\u2019t undo things and you can\u2019t unsay things. When you pass through something like that, you have to build something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo people don\u2019t get back together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure they do, but if they operate under the old rules they\u2019ll revisit the old problems. You can\u2019t keep doing the same thing over and over and expect different results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mom said that, too.\u201d She turned to look at him. \u201cYou must have had to make a lot of changes.\u201d</p><p>He laughed without humor. \u201cYeah. I hate when that happens.\u201d The young man on the board was coming in. Eric watched as he dragged the board out of the water. \u201cWe only lived here a couple of years when I was a kid. I never learned to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopular sport around here,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cThe bay is a great place for it\u2014it\u2019s almost always calm. Sometimes when the tide is out you can even get on the ocean. Want me to teach you sometime? Cooper, the guy who runs the bait shop now, he doesn\u2019t have bait anymore but he has some paddleboards and kayaks instead. He rents \u2019em. And my mom and I\u2014we have boards.\u201d</p><p>Eric smiled. \u201cHow about now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly dressed for it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could get wet, unless you\u2019re like a natural. And I bet you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He laughed loudly at that. \u201cI can almost guarantee I\u2019m not. But if I get wet, I\u2019ll dry. Let\u2019s go get a couple of boards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ve been trying to think of something we could do. I mean, you probably don\u2019t like popping dents out of cars or sanding them down and painting them. And you know\u2014I always used to envy the kids who had their boards or skiffs out on the bay.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him and his heart melted. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of goofy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the things I changed. I exchanged idiot for goofy.\u201d He stood up. \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll give it ten minutes. And if you\u2019re not completely sick of me, maybe I\u2019ll come back at a prearranged time and wear a pair of shorts.\u201d</p> <p>She stood. \u201cAll right, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>Gina\u2019s shift should have been over before three, but she hung around the diner waiting for Ashley and Eric to come in for a Coke. An hour had passed. She hoped they\u2019d gotten caught up in talking. She beat down the fear that something had gone terribly wrong. She knew Ashley wanted to meet him, believed that Eric was a safe man, but still...</p><p>Finally, unable to bear the suspense, she said goodbye to Stu and the teenage waitress on duty and walked down to the beach. What she would give for Ray Anne\u2019s binoculars! They didn\u2019t seem to be on the beach and a glance at Cooper\u2019s deck showed that place didn\u2019t seem occupied. Where could they have gone?</p><p>Then she heard a distant laugh that was clearly Ashley\u2019s. She looked out on the bay and there they were. Eric had removed his shirt and shoes, his pants were rolled up to his knees and he was trying to paddle the board, very clumsily, very slowly. And\u2014he was soaking wet. His burnished red hair had curled up just like Ashley\u2019s did, water was dripping off him. His balance wobbled and, with a giant splash, in he fell into the sound of Ashley\u2019s wild laughter.</p><p>Gina wanted to sit on the beach and watch them, but she turned and left. This was something her daughter had never had in her life\u2014a man in the family. No father, no grandfather, no steady guy. Mac had always been there for the girls, just as Gina had been, but this was different. And what were the chances that that irresponsible jerk could turn into someone decent? She didn\u2019t have any illusions that this could turn into a powerful and intense father-daughter relationship, but even if Ashley could have the knowledge that she didn\u2019t come from a total loser, Gina would be so grateful.</p><p>She looked upward and said, \u201cOh, thank you, God. Thank you. And please let it be real.\u201d</p><p>It had been about two months, but Ashley had finally gotten to the point she could resist reading about or listening to stories of her ex-boyfriend\u2019s grand achievements in baseball. About the same time Thunder Point High School was celebrating graduation, Oregon State was making it to the playoff championships. She was one of the few not planning to follow the playoffs or trying to attend home games.</p><p>Ashley was, however, concentrating on work. She wanted to earn money\u2014her future depended on it. There were very few Thunder Point kids who didn\u2019t have to work to pay for their own activities or cars or car insurance, not to mention saving for college. In fact, most of Ashley\u2019s friends used their part-time job or babysitting money to buy their clothes or cheerleading uniforms or prom formals.</p> <p>Ashley worked afternoons at the diner, relieving her mother, and some mornings she worked with her grandmother at the deli. All her friends were working\u2014Landon was helping at Cooper\u2019s almost every day and Eve had gotten herself a part-time job at Pizza Hut. They wouldn\u2019t be spending the long days of summer on the beach this year, but rather catching moments here and there to hang out. And even finding time to spend with her mom and Gram wasn\u2019t easy. Sometimes they met at the diner if Ashley went in a little early for her shift and Carrie took a break from the deli before heading home.</p><p>She started at the diner on Memorial Day weekend, the end of May, and she\u2019d only been there a week, the third generation of James women to work there, and she loved it. Gina trained her herself and just based on that and what she already knew from her mother, she was excellent at the job. In fact, although her previous plans had included going to State, living there in a dorm or apartment, she was reconsidering. It might be a better idea to stay in Thunder Point for her first year of college, borrowing the car to drive to Coquille to the community college and keeping at least one of her jobs. It would not only give her a chance to get used to the whole college experience, but it was also far cheaper and she could sock away more money.</p><p>She enjoyed the job of serving and cleaning up at the diner, and she saw lots of familiar faces every day. Friends and neighbors dropped by often and she realized that by being there, she never missed a thing that was happening in town or on the beach.</p><p>The new doctor in town, Scott Grant, would finally open his clinic across the street soon and he was holding a grand opening that Carrie would cater. Until he had a full roster of patients he\u2019d only be open three days a week, supplementing his income by being on call at the Bandon emergency room. Deputy Pritkus, a much more efficient gossip than Mac, kept Ashley up-to-date on local trouble, mostly small stuff, but interesting nonetheless. And Frank, who was taking a couple of college level classes even before his senior year, came by when the diner wasn\u2019t busy in the afternoon. He didn\u2019t pester her; he brought his books, had a cola and studied in a booth in the back of the diner.</p><p>He always left the diner in time to get home for dinner. He never told her anything about Downy and she never asked.</p><p>Ashley assumed that the whole Downy family would be going to Corvallis for any playoff games happening there and that at least one or two of them would travel to out of state games if they could. She could ask Frank, but she wouldn\u2019t. She did ask him why he\u2019d started coming to the diner to study and he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for a couple of years. It\u2019s always noisy at my house\u2014TV, music, people making noise, sometimes arguing. It\u2019s easier to concentrate here. And it\u2019s even better since you started working here.\u201d And he grinned.</p><p>So when she wasn\u2019t busy, she\u2019d grab herself a cola and slide into the booth across from him. \u201cJust tell me if I\u2019m bothering you.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his books and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not bothering me, Ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I got an invitation to meet with an early admissions counselor at MIT.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. \u201cWas that your plan?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWasn\u2019t even on my wish list. I think they want to look at me, talk to me, just to be sure I\u2019m not some hick from a little fishing village before they process my application. I\u2019m trying to decide if I can afford it. I should try since my focus is on math and computer science. You know, I think they actually looked at the computerized study guide I developed for high school students. I recorded it and loaded it on YouTube.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in wonder. \u201cYou did that? I didn\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did it for the people who ask me for help all the time. It\u2019s almost always the same questions. It was efficient. I put a link in my letter to admissions. I didn\u2019t expect anyone to actually look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you come up with these ideas?\u201d</p><p>He just shrugged. \u201cThere are several online tutoring programs\u2014some of them have millions of hits. There are a few things I\u2019m good at....\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cA few, huh? Do you know your IQ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cDo I need to? I promise you, it wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a genius or something. It must be so much fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be a geek?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo be different from everyone?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI get bored real easy. My mother calls me high-maintenance. It\u2019s hard to make friends that last after they pass the test they needed help for. I think it would be easier to be good at football or baseball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that? Well, don\u2019t. What you have has a longer shelf life.\u201d Then she rolled her eyes and laughed at herself. \u201cSpoken like a waitress, huh? One of my jobs is to check dates on the packaged food! And, as for friends, you better not ditch me for a smarter girl because you made very big promises about my visits to the east coast. Very big. If you get a girlfriend, first thing you tell her is that you have a commitment to me for visiting and you\u2019re the tour guide. She\u2019ll just have to live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we won\u2019t run into that problem. Have you decided where you\u2019re going to apply? Still looking at State?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny you should ask\u2014I\u2019m thinking of taking my first year at community college so I can keep my two part-time jobs. They\u2019re good jobs\u2014good tips. And if I ever want to go farther away than State, I\u2019ll need money.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at that. \u201cOregon State is an excellent school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And believe me, I\u2019m not thinking of avoiding it because of you-know-who. I like my jobs. Doing it this way might give me a leg up. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Probably a good idea to keep your options open. Listen, do you have any days off? Ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can easily get time off, as long as I give Stu and Gram a little notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can borrow my friend\u2019s boat. He might insist on coming along, but maybe not. Doesn\u2019t matter, really. We could spend a day sailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could bring lunch,\u201d she said. \u201cI get a great deal at the deli. Like free. What\u2019s a good day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have classes Tuesday and Thursday mornings. Any other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it early. Seven in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s usually kind of foggy....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014it\u2019s very cool to sit in the bay and watch the fog burn off.\u201d</p><p>By nine on week nights, Ashley was closing out the cash drawer and mopping the floor and she was usually on her way home by nine-thirty.</p><p>Ashley always walked home. It was only a couple of blocks in a safe town. Unlike what she read about big cities, if she screamed for any reason, all the porch lights would pop on and people would stick their heads out to see if anyone needed help. Sometimes she got home to find her mom and Mac on the porch, talking and holding hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Tonight Stu locked the diner door behind her and said goodbye. She\u2019d barely taken two steps when she heard, \u201cAshley?\u201d</p><p>She just about jumped out of her skin! She whirled to see that right behind her, Downy was leaning against one of the lampposts on the street, not far from the diner\u2019s front door. \u201cOh, my God, you scared me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Ash,\u201d he said, stepping toward her. He had his arm in a sling. \u201cI just wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, nodding toward the sling.</p><p>\u201cNothing too much. Dislocated shoulder. I\u2019m resting it for a couple of days, then it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s okay. Ash, listen, I\u2019m sorry. About everything.\u201d</p> <p>She felt color rising up her neck. Then she realized it was anger and not self-pity and that felt so good. \u201cIs that right? Well, it\u2019s over.\u201d And she turned to head for home.</p><p>\u201cWait a sec,\u201d he said. \u201cCan we talk? For just a minute?\u201d</p><p>She turned back to him. \u201cWhat on earth can we talk about, Downy? You\u2019re sorry, it\u2019s over, we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, look,\u201d he said. \u201cI made mistakes, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding! Crap, why didn\u2019t Frank tell me you were going to be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got here a couple of hours ago. I\u2019m not sure Frank even knew I was coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going right back, right? Because you\u2019re staying at school all summer....\u201d</p><p>He gave a pathetic shrug. \u201cPlans change. I\u2019m home for the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the girlfriend must hate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe broke up,\u201d he said. \u201cAsh, I made some bad decisions. Really bad. I need you to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI really don\u2019t care what bad decisions you made. You didn\u2019t care about me, about my feelings, about anything. Do you really think I\u2019m going to worry about you now? Just go home. Your mommy will snuggle you, not me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got cut from the team. My scholarship\u2019s in trouble. I might not have one anymore. I couldn\u2019t play and then we lost. Maybe not because of me, but I wasn\u2019t there to help. And they\u2019re all pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut?\u201d she said, curious in spite of herself. \u201cPissed? How could they be angry if you got hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get hurt playing. I was mad and went to a batting cage and swung a bat for hours and hours and got unhinged.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t make any sense to her. \u201cWhy\u2019d they cut you, then?\u201d</p><p>He looked down and shook his head. He tilted his head to the bench. \u201cWill you sit down with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can sit there and I\u2019ll sit over here. But only for a minute. And only because I\u2019m curious.\u201d</p><p>He sat down on one side of the diner door while she was on the other. And they just looked at each other. Finally she said, \u201cWell, what? What do you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl, Selena. She seriously messed me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Ashley said, standing up.</p><p>\u201cNo, really.\u201d He stood, as well, wisely keeping his distance. \u201cShe gave me pills she said were vitamins, supplement drinks for strength, but there were steroids in them. Low dose, oral steroids. I kept them in my locker because why wouldn\u2019t I? Then someone accused me of using performance enhancers. They looked at the pills, tested me for doping and...everything came crashing down. It\u2019s all a big misunderstanding. I didn\u2019t know I was doing anything wrong. It\u2019s not like I injected it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d she said. Ashley looked at him in astonishment for a second. Then she laughed. She put a hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lie. Or maybe an excuse. I know you, Downy. You know steroids\u2014you\u2019ve used them in the past. They\u2019re not illegal\u2014my grandmother takes steroids for her knees. I think you told me the doctor gave one of your little brothers growth hormone because they were behind in growth. Or sometimes you can find small, supposedly safe amounts or protein drinks that are supposed to have nonsteroid enhancers, but they sure act like steroids\u2014they bulk you up and make you cranky and short-tempered. We\u2019ve argued about it. You like that stuff\u2014you like being really strong. You\u2019re addicted to being strong. She didn\u2019t slip anything by you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe said it was undetectable. She gave it to me in a vitamin pill bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But you knew.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her pleadingly. \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t, but there were rumors about being an early draft pick and I wanted to hit everything, catch everything, run faster.... I felt like it was a chance, a safe chance, that wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone and would make me just a little better. I wanted that break so bad, Ash!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an athlete! You know what the problems with steroids are! Not only does it hurt your body, your personality, but it changes the playing field so it\u2019s not athlete against athlete but athlete against superdrugs! And you can\u2019t blame this on some girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was her,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she used me and tricked me. I think she wanted me to do whatever it took to go pro. She wanted to hook up with a ballplayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019d all give you the prize for being stupid, except you and me\u2014we\u2019re in a dead heat for that prize.\u201d</p><p>His brow wrinkled in confusion; he didn\u2019t get it. \u201cAsh, give me another chance. I\u2019ll make it up to you. I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her; she took a step back. \u201cI need you, Ash. I need help to get through this. I need to feel like someone\u2019s on my side. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshley, I\u2019ve been wrecked by this. I know I made mistakes, but Jesus, nothing I did is so bad I should have to go through this! I lost everything! Everyone is pissed at me and no one understands the pressure I was under. Everyone was counting on me\u2014my team, my friends, my family....\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. She actually did feel sorry for him. But not that sorry. \u201cWhat happened to you, Downy? You went to State as this town\u2019s shining star. You had a nice girlfriend who would never cheat on you, a full ride scholarship so you could get an education\u2014something a lot of us little people are working our tails off to try to pay for. You even had agents sniffing around, telling you you\u2019d go pro before you\u2019re even dry behind the ears. And how did you respect all that? You decided to break all the rules. You cheated. You hurt everyone and now you want them all to be a little more understanding, to let it go. You know what, Downy? You have your work cut out for you, because you\u2019re going to have to earn back the respect you lost.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, then he said, \u201cTell me what to do, Ash. I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and shook her head. \u201cHey, there\u2019s nothing for you to do for me\u2014I\u2019m over you. I think when an altered naked picture of me went out to about four hundred cell phones and Facebook friends and you shrugged it off and said, it was just a joke, that put the last nail in the coffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, come on, I was mad about that! We had a fight about that! That was wrong, that she did that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t even call me, explain and say you were sorry? I went through all that alone, and did you care? Nothing is ever your fault. Yeah, you have a long way to go. Good luck, Downy.\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked away. He called to her; she heard him but she didn\u2019t turn around. In that moment, with a smile on her face, Ashley knew she was finally well and truly over Crawford Downy. When Ashley was home, she found her mom and Mac sitting on the porch steps, a little votive candle between them. She told them she was tired and went inside.</p><p>Ashley went to her room, got into her little boxers and tank top and sat cross-legged on her bed with her cell phone in her hand. It was ten. Probably too late. But she took a chance and put through the call. When he said hello, she said, \u201cEric? It\u2019s Ashley. It\u2019s late, I know\u2014should I try you another time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI was going through some paperwork and I\u2019d love an excuse to stop that. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have called earlier, but I worked at the diner until after nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put in some long days, don\u2019t you, Ashley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, I do. This is very last-minute, but I don\u2019t have to go to work until three on Sunday afternoon and I\u2019m not working at the deli at all that day. Would you like to come to Thunder Point and go paddleboarding? I think you have potential.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you be at my house at about ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>On Sunday morning they launched off the marina dock and even though the bay was completely calm, Eric went in almost immediately. And getting back on the board wasn\u2019t exactly graceful. \u201cI know we\u2019ve been over this, but you\u2019re a good swimmer. Right?\u201d Ashley asked. \u201cI\u2019m not going to have to save your life, am I?\u201d</p><p>He spit and sputtered. \u201cI\u2019m a good swimmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. It\u2019s a good day on the bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day all around,\u201d he said.</p><p>But after that first big splash, Eric found his footing and kept up with her. They paddled around the bay, skirting the big, protruding rocks. A couple of small sailboats left the marina and headed out to the Pacific.</p><p>\u201cDoes everyone in this town have some kind of board or boat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust about. A lot of people like to dive, but the best diving is up the coast a little bit. There are a few places where the water is deep and clear and there\u2019s lots of marine life. A few of us have taken our boards up there, past Coos Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t dive?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cDiving gear is pretty expensive.\u201d At the mouth of the bay, she stopped and sat down on her board, just enjoying the endless expanse of ocean. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get too far to either side out here,\u201d she cautioned. \u201cThere are some sharp rocks and big waves at the tips of the points. It\u2019s best to stay in the center and if a boat\u2019s on the way in, get out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Eric sat down. He was quiet for a moment. \u201cThis is awesome,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWhat made you decide to call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pretty nice guy,\u201d she said. She turned and looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t know you when you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for giving me a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it can\u2019t hurt to get to know the other half of my DNA.\u201d She laid down on the board and looked up at the sky. \u201cI saw my ex-boyfriend last night.\u201d</p><p>Eric, still sitting, looked down at her. \u201cHow\u2019d that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back in town and was waiting for me outside the diner. He\u2019s now sorry and would like a second chance with me. But this is all because he\u2019s in big trouble and was cut from the team and might lose his scholarship.\u201d She turned to look at him. \u201cDoping. He claims the new girlfriend messed him up, got him doping and then dumped him. Of course, it\u2019s not his fault and is all a big misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Eric whistled.</p><p>\u201cHe was a star in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cAll-conference football and baseball. He was the Homecoming king. Maybe I didn\u2019t see it then, but I thought he wore it pretty well\u2014that kind of popularity. I thought he was a nice guy. He was a nice guy, I think. He looked out for his younger brothers and I think he was loyal to me. We talked on the phone and texted many times a day\u2014something he stopped having time for when a new girl came along. But I also remember\u2014he used all kinds of supplements when he was strength training. Nonsteroid, he said. But he didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with steroids, if you weren\u2019t competing. Downy\u2019s a big guy\u2014very strong. He saw a chance at going pro real young and he didn\u2019t want to miss it. He caved. He caved all over the place\u2014gave in to the pretty, snotty college girl, the drugs, probably other things. He wanted it all and he was willing to take a lot of chances and... Well, he lost it all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cDo you feel a little sorry for him?\u201d Eric asked.</p><p>She nodded. And then in a very quiet voice she added, \u201cBut he sure didn\u2019t feel sorry for me. He was cruel. When I was broken he told me to go away and quit bothering him.\u201d</p> <p>Eric smiled at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re broken anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m much stronger. But I might never have another boyfriend. I don\u2019t ever want to feel that bad again.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s funny, what I went through?\u201d she asked, an edge to her voice.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I was just thinking, you\u2019re young. You\u2019ll get past that and take a chance again. You know why? Because you\u2019ll look around and notice that even though you had a very painful experience, no one gets through this life without some major disappointments and hurts. You\u2019ll see that a lot of people had it even worse than you and you\u2019ll take notice. You\u2019ll see that to get through life you have to be strong and smart and patient and humble. What happened to Downy? A classic example of hubris\u2014the deadliest of sins. And I know\u2014I was there. I wasn\u2019t lucky enough to go there with a ball and full scholarship\u2014but I thought I was above it all, invincible, more important than anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHubris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogance. Pride before the fall. The feeling that the universe is there to serve up our selfish wants no matter what it does to other people. Downy let down his teammates and his school and his girl. But I stole from people.\u201d</p><p>She thought about this for a moment. \u201cWell, he should be ashamed. Most of us have to work real hard just for a chance to go to college. He had it all and threw it away by wanting still more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you learn your best lessons when you add up all your losses.\u201d</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow at him. \u201cMost of the time you don\u2019t sound like a grease monkey.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know who\u2019s been just supernice to me for the last three months? Downy\u2019s brother. Frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he a lot like Downy?\u201d</p><p>She sat up. \u201cNothing like Downy. I\u2019ve known Frank forever\u2014we\u2019ve been in school together since kindergarten. He was always the skinny little runt with the thick glasses, but so smart it was scary. The bigger kids used to pick on him and try to beat him up and if not for Downy... Well, Downy was his bodyguard and Frank was the nerd. But Frank has changed a little bit lately\u2014he\u2019s grown up, for one thing. He\u2019s taller, stronger, got contacts. He\u2019s actually good-looking, but you can tell he doesn\u2019t know it. He likes to sail and paddleboard, so he built muscle. He\u2019s not an athlete like Downy, but he has an appointment at MIT for an early admission scholarship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Eric asked, surprised and impressed.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll in one family. Why couldn\u2019t I get some of that?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou have what you need, Ashley. I promise. Hey, your mom knows I came over to board with you, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. She said she hopes I don\u2019t end up disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has good reason to worry about that,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThat\u2019ll take time. Hey, you almost ready for some lunch? We can come back out after, if you feel like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Sarah had continued to put off talking to Landon about her potential change of assignment. In fact, she had been in some denial. It had been a while since Buzz had dropped the bombshell on her and as the days, and then weeks, passed with no confirmation she found herself taking the irrational position that if she didn\u2019t think about it, maybe it wouldn\u2019t happen. But she was going to have to deal with this. School had been out for less than a week and Landon was already talking about football practice starting up in August. He was working at Cooper\u2019s part-time for the summer and was running and lifting weights, getting ready.</p><p>She\u2019d been in her office for thirty minutes when her phone rang. She should have looked at the caller ID. She innocently answered, \u201cDupre.\u201d And then she just listened to the voice on the other end of the line. Orders were being cut, she\u2019d receive them in a few days\u2014and she was going to Miami. She was slated to move in August, but she had two weeks to either accept the transfer or resign her commission. If she planned to accept the new assignment the chances were excellent that she\u2019d be offered a promotion within a few months of her arrival in Florida.</p><p>That\u2019s what service meant\u2014you go where you\u2019re needed, when you\u2019re needed. And she was needed in Florida.</p><p>Sarah hung up the phone and sat, stunned, for a few minutes. She needed to talk to Buzz. She went to his office, tapped on the door, went inside as he looked up. She closed the door but she didn\u2019t sit down. \u201cI just got my orders,\u201d she said.</p><p>He turned away from his computer screen. \u201cWas it what I heard?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMiami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to talk to Landon....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your guy? Cooper. Have you talked to him?\u201d</p><p>And say what? she asked herself. Goodbye? \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone. I wanted to wait until I knew for sure. First, I\u2019m going to talk to Landon. What do you say to a sixteen-year-old kid who is looking at being king of the world in his senior year? You know the story, Buzz. What do I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Buzz said. \u201cI have a sixteen-year-old kid and he thinks I can pick money off the tree out back. So does his mother, for that matter. I\u2019ve had to do the hard, unpopular things and it has cost me. I don\u2019t know what else I could\u2019ve done, but the price was high.\u201d</p><p>She looked down. He\u2019d probably paid the ultimate price for the less than stable lifestyle and she knew why he was here, why she was here. He loved the Coast Guard; he believed in their mission just as she did. In every branch of military service there was instability and risk, it took its toll on relationships.</p><p>\u201cNeed a couple of days off?\u201d Buzz asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll get back to work. I think better when I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can do anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I think of anything, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>For the next couple of days she tried not to let on that her brain was about to explode, trying to decide how to do what she had to do. Landon didn\u2019t really notice\u2014he had his new job on the beach, which he loved, and Eve, who he loved even more. Cooper noticed; he asked if there was another evaluation coming up and she said, \u201cWe\u2019re facing some transfers and the whole station is going to have to adjust and figure out how to fill some gaps. But I\u2019ll figure it out, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Just when she was about to sit down and spill her guts to Cooper they learned that Austin and Spencer were coming for another visit. The toy hauler was ready for guests once again and Sarah knew she\u2019d have to put off talking to Landon and Cooper just a few days longer.</p><p>The activity around the RV led to every person from the road to the beach asking what was going on.</p><p>\u201cSpencer and Austin are coming for a visit, now that they\u2019re both on summer vacation,\u201d Cooper said. And he said it over and over again. \u201cKind of last-minute, but it\u2019s a good thing. Austin loves being on the water and it saves me a trip to Texas to visit him.\u201d</p><p>Late Friday afternoon when the deck and bar were full of beachcombers and neighbors and folks from neighboring towns out for a summer evening, the back door burst open and little freckle-faced Austin stood grinning in the doorway. \u201cHey, Cooper! I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>Cooper\u2019s face lit up and he laughed, coming around the bar. \u201cSo you are,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing like an entrance!\u201d He put out his arms and Austin leaped into them.</p><p>\u201cCan we go out on the bay for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here less than a minute. And I\u2019m a little busy here. Does your dad feel like taking you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to unload and unpack,\u201d Austin said with a pout. \u201cAnd eat something. But I want to go out on the bay!\u201d</p><p>Sarah leaned on the bar. \u201cHey, Austin,\u201d she called. And to Cooper she said, \u201cI can cover this if you want to go ahead. Landon will help me and Rawley is still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Cooper put Austin on his feet. \u201cFifteen minutes. I\u2019ll run you around the bay on the Jet Ski. Get your suit on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d He wiggled out of Cooper\u2019s arms and headed for the toy hauler.</p><p>Cooper had never longed for children, but he wasn\u2019t opposed to the idea. He figured he might have one or two someday, which was one of the reasons the idea of marriage hadn\u2019t spooked him. But he had no idea one skinny, goofy, freckled little kid could bring him so much happiness. Five minutes later he had Austin in a life vest and on the back of the Jet Ski. When he\u2019d bought this thing, it was in his head that he\u2019d be loading a variety of beautiful bikini-clad young women behind him, holding on to him, but not one of them could have given him as much pleasure as this kid. His kid.</p><p>A half hour later he had Austin off the bay, sitting at a table on the deck, devouring a pizza. Spencer was having a beer, his feet up on the railing.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to take him out on the Jet Ski?\u201d Cooper asked, joking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just spent hours traveling with him. He wiggles worse than a box of worms and he is a talking machine.\u201d</p><p>After dinner, Cooper had him fishing off the end of the dock, and then they played checkers for a while. Spencer coaxed Austin into the shower and by the time the sun was setting, Spencer had him tucked into bed in the trailer. After Landon and Rawley left, Cooper lit the little candles on the deck tables. He had a half-dozen customers enjoying the last of the sunset over the Pacific. Finally Spencer reappeared, showered and changed.</p><p>\u201cI better have another beer,\u201d he told Cooper. \u201cCan I help myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, you can bring me one.\u201d</p><p>Cooper scooted his chair close to Sarah and put an arm around her. The beach began to come alive beneath the deck and a couple of fires appeared.</p><p>Spencer was back with the beers and sat down with a heavy, exhausted sigh. He was quiet as he took in the last of the sun\u2019s pink rays over the ocean. He took a pull on his beer. \u201cDoesn\u2019t get any better than this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs he asleep?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThe TV is on and I told him to call me if he needs anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll pass out pretty soon. I tired him out the best I could,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cHow can something so small wear a person out so thoroughly? Listen, I have to tell you something,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll take this as good news. There\u2019s a professional reason for us being here. Your football coach and athletic director is retiring and I applied for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Cooper asked, sitting straighter.</p><p>\u201cNot good news?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t say that, but why didn\u2019t you tell me that\u2019s why you were coming? Maybe I could\u2019ve said something to someone. I knew about Coach Rayborough retiring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here that long. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be tight with the coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not and I was pretty surprised to be included in the discussion. But what about your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents are in the same nursing home in Missouri. I have some aunts out there but I\u2019m an only child. The last time we visited, my mom couldn\u2019t remember who Austin was. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll be before they\u2019re gone, but probably not long. You\u2019re probably thinking of Bridget\u2019s family, too. They\u2019re grieving and I think they\u2019re going to be grieving for a long time.\u201d He shook his head sadly. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough of death and illness. Austin and I need a fresh start. I like your little town. And Austin loves it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can get that coaching job?\u201d</p><p>Spencer smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that much about me. I had to check you out and make sure Austin was safe with you, but you probably never took a close look at me. I\u2019m not a born-and-bred Texan, you know that, but I\u2019ve been a Texas high school football coach and athletic director for years. My teams go to state, and it\u2019s a big-ass state. Texas is serious about football. There\u2019s a lot of competition for a job like this in the Northwest, but not a lot of experienced teachers and coaches who would be willing to take the size of the Thunder Point paycheck if there are bigger schools hiring. This is a good place for Austin for a lot of reasons.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBio-dad is here.\u201d Then he grew a little serious. \u201cWe do fine, Cooper\u2014me and the little man. But we seriously need to move on. We\u2019ll visit Bridget\u2019s family, but we\u2019re due a new agenda. I\u2019ll apply and interview, but in the end it\u2019s all up to the school board.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper leaned toward him. \u201cWhat if this doesn\u2019t work out for you, Spencer? What if you don\u2019t like it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cIt could swing either way\u2014it either turns out to be a positive move for me and for Austin. Or if it doesn\u2019t live up to my expectations, I could be looking again. And if it\u2019s visits instead of living in the same neighborhood, you can count on me to help with that. I didn\u2019t do this to pin you down, Cooper. I did this for an opportunity, a positive change. This town and, in fact, the high school, both have very good reputations. Even with a smaller paycheck, it looks good on paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re going to find it feels as good as it looks,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cI moved here for Landon. He should be the starting quarterback in the fall, unless something happens, like maybe some hotshot moves here over the summer. I was looking around for a proactive football coach in a place I could afford, in a school that boasted athletic and academic scholarships. A place with opportunity for Landon. And it\u2019s worked so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll work for us,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI haven\u2019t given my notice in my school district and I haven\u2019t looked anywhere else yet. This was a complete coincidence. I visited you, liked your little town, started looking around for Oregon job opportunities. I thought if there was something within a few hours\u2019 drive, this piece of coast makes for a nice weekend. But I never imagined something like this would show up.\u201d</p><p>Spencer turned in, but Sarah and Cooper stayed out on the deck. Once the sky was dark and the million stars came out to play, it was just impossible to leave. All the customers had gone, leaving just the two of them. There were two campfires on the beach and the presence of the Razor made it clear Landon was down there somewhere. They heard a clumping up the stairs and Ham came panting toward them, tongue hanging out and drooling.</p> <p>\u201cAnd hello to you,\u201d Sarah said, giving him a pat on the head</p><p>Then a whistle rent the air and he ran back down the stairs and across the beach to where the kids sat around a fire.</p><p>\u201cLandon would probably like us to go inside and leave them alone,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cSo what? It\u2019s a perfect night.\u201d He pulled her chair closer.</p><p>She sighed and looked out over the water. \u201cYou really do have a perfect life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d he agreed.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now your son is here,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s everything, Cooper. That\u2019s the whole thing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Spencer still has to apply for the job. Sounds like he\u2019ll get it, though. I had no idea he was a championship coach. That\u2019s pretty cool. I hope Spencer is up to the job of making the most out of Landon, for his sake. For the sake of college opportunities. And for the coach\u2014he really wants an exit strategy after forty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she agreed. \u201cHow does it feel, really? Being a dad?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cPretty damn cool. Doesn\u2019t hurt that he\u2019s an awesome and hilarious little kid, which I owe to Bridget and Spencer.\u201d He chuckled and shook his head. \u201cBio-dad.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever see yourself in this situation\u2014the father of a ten-year-old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the back of my mind I thought I\u2019d accidentally get married and have a kid or two, even though I had no idea what responsibilities that really entailed. I figured I\u2019d grow into it. I thought I\u2019d eventually tie myself down to a house, a couple of kids, a steady job that didn\u2019t change every two years. I didn\u2019t think it would take this long. I\u2019ve always known I\u2019m a one-woman man,\u201d he added, giving her shoulders a squeeze. \u201cBut, I wasn\u2019t ready at twenty-seven when Bridget was ready. I was still moving fast back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re ready now?\u201d</p><p>He turned and looked into her eyes. He smiled. \u201cI\u2019d better be\u2014it\u2019s here. And it feels pretty good. I don\u2019t know how Spencer will like it here, but I couldn\u2019t ask for more than this. I mean, come on\u2014listen to that surf. Look at that sky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if this job hadn\u2019t come open?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat if Spencer and Austin weren\u2019t here? And what if it doesn\u2019t work out for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019d be on a plane regularly. Single parents do that all the time. It\u2019s not the best situation, but it works.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him. The sound of lapping water at the shoreline and the laughter of teenagers on the beach was soothing. \u201cYou sound really unfucked-up for an ex-helicopter pilot who runs a beach bar.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cAnd for the first time in a long time, I feel that way, too.\u201d And he kissed her brow.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Ashley walked home after her shift and found her mother sitting on the front porch in the dark alone. \u201cWhy are you still up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Gina smiled and sighed. \u201cMac just left and I stayed out here. Did you have a good shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but I\u2019m tired now\u2014I\u2019ll sleep in a little tomorrow. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m okay. I was just thinking how lucky I am. Having Mac in my life\u2014he\u2019s such a good, strong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting kind of sad for someone who is planning to get married,\u201d Ashley said, sitting down beside her mother on the porch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll pass. Give me ten minutes. But I will say this\u2014I look forward to not saying goodbye to him at the end of every day. And you know what worries me? I know this is going to sound very strange, coming from your mother\u2014but I\u2019ve never been a wife. What if I stink at it?\u201d</p><p>Ashley giggled. \u201cI bet you\u2019ll get the hang of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I want so much to be a good wife to him, and a good stepmom. I have no doubt he\u2019ll be an awesome stepfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe practically has been, Mom. He\u2019s been my stand-in dad for four years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he has, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it sure wasn\u2019t Stu at the diner, or Downy\u2019s dad, Ford. If I had any situation that I\u2019d mention to a dad, or talk to a dad about, it was Mac. In fact, ever since all that drama with Downy, Mac seems to keep a real close watch on me.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe really is a busybody, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. In the best possible way. It used to frustrate me so much that he just thought of me as a good friend, but now I realize that all those years of friendship before romance has been a good thing. He\u2019s a patient man\u2014he knows me as well as you do. He\u2019s easygoing and generous, not prickly like some men. I think Lou softened him up, taught him how to live with a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you two are waiting to get married. You know that Gram and I could put together a wedding in a week. Two at the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t really figured out all the sleeping arrangements.... We have to give it at least till the end of summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the end of summer everyone will know their places, but you don\u2019t have to wait that long. Eve and I have talked it out. For the past four years I\u2019ve either stayed over at her house or she\u2019s stayed here at least once a week, but it\u2019s usually even more often. When she\u2019s had enough of Lou and the younger kids, she might be here most of the weekend. And when I\u2019ve had enough of\u2014\u201d She stopped suddenly and even in the dark, Gina could see a flush darken her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou can say it. My feelings won\u2019t be hurt.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cOur house is quiet. People go to bed early. Eve\u2019s house is lively. Lots of kids get together there because the deputy likes to have eyes and ears on them, but our house is a good spot to bring boyfriends after a game or dance because Gram is out like a light with her ear buds in her ears. When Eve gets enough of lively, she\u2019s here, where we can just walk to the beach, or to the diner, or to McDonalds and Pizza Hut. When I\u2019m looking for a little more action, I\u2019m there. I might move in there\u2014probably into Eve\u2019s room\u2014but Gram will let us come here to spend the night anytime we want to. It\u2019ll probably be a lot like it is right now, except you\u2019ll be paired up with Mac, just like you should be. And I bet Aunt Lou moves out\u2014I bet she moves in with Joe. She\u2019s making those kind of comments, thinking no one is listening. But Eve and I will be the same. We study together, we wear each other\u2019s clothes, we carpool and double date. The only thing we don\u2019t share are boyfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Gina said. She reached out and touched Ashley\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel about my house being the best make-out house. But I caught on to your agenda a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not my agenda anymore, but this house is a really good one for marathon Criminal Minds shows. Eve\u2019s gets a little wild with Ryan and Dee Dee competing on the drums and piano and video games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like those movie and TV nights,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cIf Mac lets you out, you can join us sometime.\u201d Then she grinned at her mother.</p><p>\u201cI hate that you had such a hard spring, baby. But you\u2019re better than ever. And you were amazing before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mama,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI feel better than ever. I don\u2019t like how I had to learn a few things. But I like what I had to learn. And as a bonus, I got Eric.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew. I\u2019m so glad that worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked out. At least so far. So about you and Mac... We could fix up a quick wedding. Lou can still take all summer to decide what she wants to do. You two can live in the same house for a couple of months if it takes her that long to decide. Maybe she\u2019ll want to hang around for Ryan and Dee Dee while school\u2019s out. Think about it, Mom\u2014we\u2019ve been like one family the past few years. We do everything together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe keeps suggesting we just elope. And it\u2019s tempting, but I think people expect a ceremony, a reception, a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you? Elope? Just run off and get married?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t given it serious thought. I admit, having four kids between us, a nice dinner out and a night or two away sure sounds nice. But we can wait till August so we don\u2019t take anyone by surprise....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could also tell Gram and Lou and the kids that you\u2019ll be away next weekend, getting married. Everyone wants you to get married. No one except Dee Dee has a big need to be in a wedding,\u201d Ashley said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? The maid of honor?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way...you know I love Mac and the whole family but I\u2019m a lot more interested in this idea of Frank\u2019s\u2014going out on the bay at night when there\u2019s a full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Gina asked.</p><p>\u201cFrank has seen dolphins out there. I\u2019d give anything to see a dolphin up close. Do you know if you shine lights down into the water at night you can see massive marine life?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cFrank?\u201d she asked, lifting a brow.</p><p>\u201cAnother gift\u2014I never really knew him before even though I\u2019ve known him my whole life. We\u2019re good friends now. And that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to stay. Good friends. And it\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be darned. Frank. Huh. And you wouldn\u2019t be hurt and deprived if I didn\u2019t have a wedding and party you could be a part of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, the whole town has expected you and Mac to get married for years. The two of you are so lame, thinking no one could see the way you look at each other. Put your lives together and move on so we don\u2019t have to all watch you sneaking kisses. No one cares. Well, except Dee Dee. But we can have a pretend wedding for her and she\u2019d be just as happy\u2014she\u2019s ten. We could let her be the bride!\u201d And then she grinned. \u201cDid you know Frank plans to go to college on the east coast? One of the big ones\u2014MIT or Harvard or Boston University. He knows everything out there to see and do! He says if I ever go visit him he\u2019ll take me everywhere. To New York City, the D.C. Mall to see all the museums and monuments, to all the planetariums and observatories. I am so going to do that! And Eve and I have been talking about Europe. You know, after we finish college. There\u2019s a big world out there. It\u2019s not all Oregon State University and Thunder Point and some baseball player, you know.\u201d</p><p>Gina sighed and gave her daughter a loving stroke along her arm. \u201cI know, baby. It\u2019s so good to see you have dreams. Big dreams. And you will do it, too. All of it.\u201d</p><p>Gina called Mac\u2019s cell phone. \u201cDid I wake you?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNo. Saying good-night again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have Ashley\u2019s permission to elope,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you still tempted to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than tempted. Want to leave in an hour?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI think one needs a marriage license to elope....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Coquille and get one tomorrow. This weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you ask your family if they\u2019re on board with that idea?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no, I\u2019m not asking. I\u2019ll tell them, though. I\u2019ll find us a little chapel, we\u2019ll do it Friday night and have the weekend away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll move into your place, if Lou has no objections. Tell her I\u2019m prepared to take orders. For as long as she\u2019s there, forever if she chooses that option, I understand it\u2019s her domain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAch, she talks tough. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be glad to have a little help around the house. What made you decide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Ash. I told her that it\u2019s hard to say goodbye to you at the end of every day and she said, \u2018What are you waiting for? Just do it!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that girl,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want you to have what you want, Gina. Big or small, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d even go common law. I just want you to be the last thing I feel against me at night and the first thing I feel in the morning. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the strangest man,\u201d she pointed out to him. \u201cIt takes you years to kiss me and then you\u2019re a runaway train. There will be adjustments, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Extreme contentment. I\u2019m a tough guy, Gina. I\u2019m up to the job.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was a genius. It wasn\u2019t lost on him that something serious had been bothering Sarah for at least a couple of months. She tried to pass it off as just work stuff, but it was obviously much more serious than that. And the past few days the quiet had grown deep and a little scary. He was a very straightforward guy, so of course, he confronted it, told her he\u2019d noticed a change in her behavior lately and wondered what it was about.</p><p>\u201cI realize I\u2019ve been moody,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll pass. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpencer was told they hadn\u2019t even hoped for a candidate of his caliber for that job at the high school. It\u2019s all done but the shouting now. Is it about Austin living here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not. That\u2019s wonderful for you. And I enjoy Austin\u2014I think he\u2019s adorable and exhausting, just as a ten-year-old boy should be. It\u2019s just work stuff. I\u2019ll tell you all about it when I get a handle on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex isn\u2019t giving you a hard time, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s ben completely silent. In fact, rumor has it he\u2019s found women up there in Alaska, which means he\u2019ll be very busy and will be leaving me alone. Listen, don\u2019t take it personally, okay? Now and then work gets a little stressful at the command level. You know. I\u2019m cranky. I just need a couple of days off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll get \u2019em,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the weekend off, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m looking forward to spending it on the beach!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe except for one night. I have had an interesting request from Mac. Apparently Gina and Mac aren\u2019t waiting any longer\u2014they\u2019re going to get married Friday night in Coos Bay at a little chapel on the water. They\u2019d like us to meet them there, be the witnesses, join them for a nice wedding dinner and then disappear as quickly as possible. It\u2019ll be small, just the four of us. There will be someone at the chapel to take a few pictures and they\u2019re going to hide away for the weekend. We can come back here. Or, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, I\u2019ll take you on a sleepover. I can get us a reservation somewhere that has a vibrating bed and mirrors on the ceiling.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. He could always make her laugh.</p><p>\u201cLet me think about that\u2014Mac\u2019ll be out of town, I\u2019ll be out of town, Landon and Eve will be in town....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Mac\u2019s got a shotgun Lou knows how to use....\u201d</p><p>Again she laughed. \u201cFor right now, let\u2019s plan on coming back to Thunder Point on Friday night, but I\u2019ll think about the mirrored-ceiling option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl. I\u2019ll call you again tonight.\u201d</p><p>Cooper knew it wasn\u2019t the Mac and Gina marriage that bothered Sarah, since she\u2019d just barely found out. He hoped she wasn\u2019t worried about the fact that Spencer and Austin would be making Thunder Point their home. But he\u2019d told not only Sarah, but also Spencer, that if his circumstances changed he could be flexible, he would travel to see his son. So it couldn\u2019t be those things. He\u2019d asked her about Landon\u2014he was under control. No more scary romance issues with him, at least for the time being. Cooper felt as if he was beginning to make things up\u2014none of it made real sense. Of course, there was the dreaded possibility that Sarah had taken this thing with him as far as she could and was ready to end it all, but even that idea seemed pretty far-fetched.</p><p>It would be hard to stay strong through something like that because he loved Sarah. He loved her like he\u2019d never loved before. He wanted her forever and he knew he wasn\u2019t just fantasizing\u2014it was real for him. If she dumped him it would put a serious kink in some plans he had to surprise her. Not to mention the idea that she might leave him would kill him.</p><p>But things remained the same all week. Sarah was aloof. Preoccupied with some itchy problem, yet not seeming to be terribly unhappy with him.</p><p>On Friday he picked her up to go to Coos Bay to meet Mac and Gina. \u201cWe\u2019re stopping at a florist,\u201d she said. \u201cI ordered flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know to do that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI asked,\u201d she answered with a laugh. \u201cI asked Gina what she\u2019d like me to wear, and if she\u2019d planned for flowers or a wedding cake or anything like that. She said she was keeping it very simple, that her mother wanted to have a party sometime this summer and if she didn\u2019t get to make the cake, she\u2019d be crushed, so flowers it is.\u201d She gave a sigh. \u201cShe said as boring and unromantic as it sounded, they had so much to do with their hard-earned money\u2014educations for one thing\u2014and they didn\u2019t want to splurge on a big wedding. She said getting out of town for a weekend was definitely going to be romantic and not boring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should do that sometime,\u201d he said while driving.</p><p>\u201cWe should,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>They stopped off for flowers, took two lovely bouquets to a small chapel near the waterfront and found an excited and thrilled bride and groom. Gina was astonished by the gorgeous flowers. Sarah pinned a simple rose on Mac\u2019s lapel, and then one for Cooper. And Cooper was so proud of her for her thoughtfulness and generosity. He\u2019d gotten them a gift to give them later, which he hoped they would like.</p><p>When the bride and groom stood before the minister, Cooper whispered, \u201cWe could do this, you know.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh that was filled with disappointment, she said, \u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a game changer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Before anything more could be said, the vows began. It was the simple, straightforward pledge\u2014for better or worse, richer or poorer, sickness or health, forever and ever. A very short, balding minister who wore glasses and a robe stood before them at the front of the pretty little chapel; his voice was soft and caressing, but Mac\u2019s voice was strong and firm, Gina\u2019s voice was tinged with emotional tears. Sarah cried and smiled at the same time, and in seven minutes the vows were pledged, the kissing done, the certificate of marriage signed by everyone and a half-dozen pictures were taken by the minister\u2019s oldest son. Cooper and Sarah took photos on their cell phones, then immediately texted them to Lou and Carrie. Ten minutes later they were entering a nice waterfront restaurant where Mac had reserved a table with a view.</p><p>Before even sitting down Cooper excused himself for a moment. He saw the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and ordered a bottle of champagne. He hadn\u2019t been seated long when it arrived to the surprise of the new husband and wife. When the cork had been popped and the flutes filled, he lifted his glass and said, \u201cHere\u2019s to a wedding in which the kiss lasted longer than the vows!\u201d</p><p>Mac leaned against Gina and said, \u201cHear, hear!\u201d</p><p>Gina said, \u201cAnd look at us\u2014at a restaurant that\u2019s not Cliffhanger\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Mac doesn\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll order for myself tonight,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty fond of telling people what to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the pot speaking of the kettle,\u201d Sarah pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSo where are Mr. and Mrs. McCain knocking boots tonight?\u201d Cooper asked, getting an elbow in the ribs from Sarah.</p><p>\u201cJoe has a lake cabin,\u201d Mac told them. \u201cThere are plenty of really nice hotels around here, even some bridal suites, but the cabin is just perfect\u2014we\u2019ve been there before. It\u2019s isolated, comfortable, there\u2019s a boat to take out on the lake. Gina packed a cooler with some of Carrie\u2019s best dishes and sandwiches premade, plus some breakfast groceries. I made the beverage run and confirmed that the cell phones don\u2019t work up there. There\u2019s a landline for emergencies, but we\u2019ll be alone, which is the main thing. It\u2019s an hour away, but well worth the drive. We promised to be back by six Sunday night. We\u2019ll stop by Carrie\u2019s for dinner with Ash and Carrie, then on to my house\u2014Gina\u2019s new home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope,\u201d Gina said. \u201cA lot of people are facing change with this marriage\u2014the kids, my mom, Mac\u2019s aunt. They all say they want this, but we\u2019re hoping the adjustments won\u2019t be too confusing or disruptive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGina will have the biggest adjustment to make,\u201d Mac said. \u201cHer house has been like a convent\u2014not a lot of noise or traffic. My house is the bigger house, but it\u2019s filled with kids and dogs and... Well, there\u2019s Aunt Lou, who is very protective of what little space she gets. She\u2019s threatening to get her own place, or move in with Joe, who is staying there with her this weekend. Whatever she does, she won\u2019t be far away. My kids are her kids. She\u2019s raised Ryan and Dee Dee since before they were potty-trained.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, my mom and Aunt Lou have made all things possible,\u201d Gina said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how either of us would have raised our kids without them. You, Sarah, doing it on your own as you have...my hat\u2019s off to you.\u201d</p><p>Cooper put an arm around her, giving her a squeeze. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t give herself enough credit. She\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper noticed that she looked down, nodded and murmured something about Landon being a wonderful kid. In spite of the happy occasion there seemed to be a sadness about Sarah and he began to imagine she was hiding even more dire problems Maybe she was sick. Terminal! There was something terrible going on to cause her to withdraw like this.</p><p>After dinner, Cooper and Sarah walked the happy couple to Mac\u2019s truck, bid them farewell and wished them a great weekend. After they had gone all Sarah said was, \u201cIt was so lovely. So lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for a little walk,\u201d Cooper said, his arm around her shoulders. \u201cJust around this block to the waterfront. To finish watching the sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get home, Cooper....\u201d</p><p>He stopped and turned her toward him. \u201cNo, baby. We have to talk about whatever is eating you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should figure out what to do before I dump it on you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could use some help with whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep steadying breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been notified that...I got reassignment orders, Cooper...soon. I haven\u2019t had the guts to talk it over with Landon yet. This isn\u2019t going to go down well.\u201d</p><p>Shock widened his eyes. It was the last thing he expected. \u201cI thought you had another year here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have. That\u2019s what I thought when I came here\u2014that\u2019s what we had all predicted. But there\u2019s a pressing need for someone at my level of command and I\u2019m the most logical person to fill it. And it\u2019s for a south Florida Coast Guard station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cCould they give you a more distant assignment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have Coast Guard stations on the moon yet,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cooper said, thinking for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right, this is going to go down hard. I was moved right before my senior year and I\u2019m still pissed about it. And I didn\u2019t have a shining football career ahead of me. I was just an ordinary high school kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will devastate Landon,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cIs it at least a decent job? In Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on your definition of decent. It\u2019s a good position and I\u2019m in line for a promotion. It will mean less flying and more administrative time. But I\u2019m good at both, so...\u201d</p><p>He thought maybe they should continue walking...and thinking. But for some reason his feet were rooted to the ground. \u201cMaybe it would help if...I could get him down there early, like right away. We could look around, make sure he gets into a good school with a good football team and give him a chance to adjust before school starts. By the time you get there, maybe he\u2019ll be human about it....\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were round and her mouth actually hung open. She shook her head as if to roll the marbles back into place. \u201cYou would do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I could. Or I could take care of him here. He only has one more year. But it would be so damn far for you to travel to see him. That would be really hard on both of you. I mean, you\u2019re a team, you and Landon. But there\u2019s another fact you have to face\u2014in one more year he could choose a college on the other side of the country. He\u2019s going to leave your care eventually. But if things stay as they are now, I think he\u2019d probably opt for the left coast....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLive with you...here?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arms and looked into her eyes. \u201cOkay, maybe you don\u2019t want me to be a part of this. But if that\u2019s what it is, you have to tell me, Sarah. I\u2019ve been bent out of shape worrying that you want to dump me. We\u2019ve been together nine months. You know I love you\u2014you know I want to spend my life with you. If you don\u2019t want that, you have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have a business here! A son!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t lived with my son for the last ten years. He wouldn\u2019t be devastated if I only visited. In fact, there\u2019s no guarantee Spencer and Austin will stay in Thunder Point\u2014that all depends on if this job works out to be a good thing for them both. You and Landon, that\u2019s a different situation. It\u2019s just the two of you and you\u2019re real tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the bar? The beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I love the beach and the bar is working out, but I\u2019m not more tied to that than to you, for God\u2019s sake. I could sell it. I could even sell it responsibly, so it doesn\u2019t hurt the town. Or I could rent it so there\u2019s something to come back to. You do understand that if I had to make a choice...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be giving up everything you love!\u201d</p><p>He just smiled at her and shook his head. \u201cNot everything I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I quit?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t take the assignment and just resigned my commission and didn\u2019t have an income? What if I turned out to be just a part-time barmaid who couldn\u2019t pay her own rent just so Landon could finish school here?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t tease me,\u201d he said. \u201cSarah, don\u2019t you know by now? There\u2019s no deal breaker here. I\u2019ll take any part of you\u2014career Coast Guard pilot or simply my wife. And I\u2019m not asking you to give up anything you love or have worked hard for.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI know how controlling you are. And I also think you love me. You love us together. If you don\u2019t, you have a good fake going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper...\u201d she whispered, her eyes misting.</p><p>\u201cHey! How long have you been carrying this around? This worry and burden?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged helplessly. \u201cI got wind of it a couple of months ago, when it was just rumor, when there was still hope that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of months? Aw, baby! We could\u2019ve talked it out a long time ago! This has been eating you up! Sarah, honey, you don\u2019t have to manage everything alone anymore. You can count on me, don\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>He looked around uncomfortably. They stood on a sidewalk under a restaurant\u2019s neon sign. The surf was audible, but so was passing traffic. He grunted, reaching into his shirt pocket. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I planned. Man. I\u2019m no great romantic, but I thought I could do better than this. And I don\u2019t know if it will help your decision or just make it harder, but...\u201d He produced a ring. Not a box, just a ring. But he thought it a damned beautiful ring. \u201cI\u2019ve been carrying this around for a while now, but you were so bitchy. Sorry to say that, but really...\u201d He held it out, in his palm. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me get down on my knees,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ground is wet.\u201d</p><p>A laugh sputtered out of her through her tears. \u201cYou\u2019re not kneeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a wet, cracked sidewalk, in the mist, on a busy street? Only if it\u2019s the difference between yes and no. I\u2019ll kneel for you later.... Sarah, I want to marry you. I want to bind you up and take you off the market. I want you to trust me with your problems. I want to be your other half. I want us to share the same life, whatever that means. The only caveat is that I will always visit Austin, wherever he lives. But you? You, I want to be with every day. And I will never ask you to give up anything for me\u2014just say you\u2019ll be my wife.\u201d He picked up the ring and slid it onto her finger so she could look at it.</p><p>\u201cIs it real?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s real! It\u2019s not a custom design or anything, so you can exchange it for something you like better. It\u2019s damn hard to pick a ring for a woman who never wears jewelry and who goes to work in combat boots, so I can be flexible here. But you have to say yes first.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d he said softly. \u201cPlus, you hold a grudge. It takes a lot to piss you off, but man, when you get there... Look, I know you\u2019re scared, but I\u2019m not. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m not nervous about commitment like this. And eventually you\u2019re going to stop being scared because there\u2019s not one thing about us that\u2019s suspicious or scary or risky. Everything works with us. We\u2019re solid. And you know it. You should take a chance on us. We can be happy, I know we can.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and a tear escaped. \u201cThen...yes,\u201d she said in a whisper.</p><p>He lifted her chin with a finger and kissed her, at first lightly, then with hunger. His arms went around her waist while hers went around his back, molding her to him. Their mouths fit perfectly, searching and caressing and devouring, the taste of her tears on his lips.</p><p>A horn honked and someone yelled, \u201cGet a room!\u201d</p><p>They broke apart on a laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s get a room,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d she said.</p><p>He kissed her again. \u201cHome,\u201d he repeated. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>It was hard for Gina to say goodbye to an idyllic weekend at Joe\u2019s little cabin on the lake, but Mac said, \u201cHe promises that any time we can get away and it\u2019s not in use, it\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>They headed home, as man and wife, all ready for a new adventure in Thunder Point. They would have dinner with Carrie and Ashley, at which time Gina would pack up what was left of her toiletries and a few other personal items and bring them over to Mac\u2019s place. School might be out for the summer, but Gina and Mac both had to get back to work on Monday morning.</p><p>As they pulled onto Main Street sawhorses had been set up with detour signs hanging from them. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Mac said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t told about this. I wonder if there\u2019s trouble in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they close the street through town?\u201d</p><p>He put the truck in Park. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you. Broken water main? Fire? Maybe they\u2019re moving a wide load through town? Let\u2019s go have a look, Mrs. McCain.\u201d</p><p>They walked the rest of the way into town and as they got closer they spotted the Sheriff\u2019s Department SUV, lights flashing, blocking the street in front of the diner. There were people everywhere, milling around the closed off street.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mac, this doesn\u2019t look good....\u201d</p><p>They took a dozen more steps when someone yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s them! They\u2019re here!\u201d And a surge of people moved toward the police vehicle. Behind the crowd a banner was raised between the diner and Carrie\u2019s Deli that said, Congratulations Gina and Mac! Suddenly they were being embraced into hugs, slapped on the back by laughing, smiling, happy friends and neighbors. Since neither of them could move, they were pulled into the center of town. There were long tables full of food, wide grills steaming, a Sno-Kone machine, an ice cream truck. Wayland had a bar set up outside his bar and Cliff, wearing an apron, waved from behind one of the grills. And music floated toward them\u2014\u201cHere Comes the Bride\u201d rang out on electric piano and guitar. There was a band set up on a platform at the end of the street! And right in front of Carrie\u2019s deli, on a special table, was a very large wedding cake. Large enough for a town.</p><p>Ashley pushed through the people. She was grinning. \u201cTold you we could throw a wedding together in a week or two.\u201d</p><p>Gina looked up at Mac and the only thing she could think of to say was, \u201cI\u2019m wearing jeans.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her and said, \u201cI like you in jeans.\u201d And then to the pleasure of a cheering crowd, he grabbed his wife and kissed her senseless.</p><p>Not far away, another car was parked outside the roadblock. It was a ten-year-old Pathfinder with a lot of miles on it. Cee Jay was driving, Maddy was in the passenger seat and their luggage was piled in the back. Cee Jay got out of the car and looked down the road into the town. The banner had been raised, the music played and it appeared there was dancing in the street as the sun made a lazy decline over the rocky Pacific coast. Kids and dogs ran amok, laughter rang out, a couple of fireworks shot into the sky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>A wedding party, Cee Jay thought. An entire town celebrating its favorite couple.</p><p>\u201cWanna go congratulate the happy couple?\u201d Maddy asked with a laugh. \u201cThrow them off balance just a little bit?\u201d</p> <p>Cee Jay shook her head. No one could see her, but if they could they would see a very melancholy, remorseful look come into her eyes. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve played my last card here.\u201d Then she took a deep breath, shook herself of the sentimental musing and smiled over the top of the car at her girlfriend. \u201cSo. What sounds good? Miami? Atlantic City?\u201d</p><p>Maddy got back in the car. \u201cYou\u2019re driving. Just get me outta here. I\u2019ve had enough of these hicks.\u201d</p><p>Cee Jay looked for another moment at the hundreds of people, all with what appeared to be happy, untroubled, connected lives. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYeah.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
